** Some people claim that the thing with Draco getting pregnant is about Harry impregnating his mind with ideas. Others say that it's just some nonsense to entertain the readers.

As for the blood purity thing, it's about convincing someone not by preaching what you know to them but instead by listening to their arguments and taking them apart. In some cases it actually is the better approach.

In an AN he explicitly says he hadn't considered the possibility of Luna being a seer and he would consider it, however even if he made her one that headline would be a result Luna saying something like "light will plant a seed in darkness" and xenophilius would have interpreted it in much the wrong way as he is wont to do

**** Even if Luna isn't written as a seer, people can claim that the author intended for the readers to make that connection, but then there are also things that don't seem to be in it for anything other than humour. Plus, him saying that he did not consider the possibility doesn't tell us much about how it applies to the name that the article ended up having.

As such, I see no problem with writing that I've seen people interpret it in those two ways when that I have seen but I do not know enough about the author's intent to claim which group is more right in regards to the chapter as it is.

** ...er, that's the /Quibbler/, not the /Prophet/, I believe. So it's just a preposterous /Quibbler/ title, to be taken in the same spirit as "Cornelius Fudge bakes Goblins into pies and is in cahoots with the Rotfang Conspiracy" or "is Professor Dumbledore secretly a Cornish Pixi/Nargle hybrid?".

Of course, it also serves as a discreet joke on mpreg fics and Drarry, by implying that they're so preposterous they could only exist in any version of the /Harry Potter/ universe as a ridiculous rumor the Lovegoods would make up.

I don't really see the problem. There are some things that HPMOR claims are rational that can be argued to not really be that, but this... just isn't one of them.

**** AFAIR, nothing; it's an intentional non-sequitur. Harry leaves behind the topic to ask what he really wants to know, e.g. to get a better understanding of blood-purity from the horse's mouth.

***** It's not really a non-sequitur.

Over the course of 40 paragraphs or so, Draco says something terrible about Luna, and in the process he reveals some extremely disturbing things about the state of justice and social innequality in wizarding britain.

Harry decides that a society that corrupt needs to be fixed, and he can start by persuading Draco (the son of a wealthy politician) that his worldview is flawed. One way to persuade Draco is to ask him to explain his beliefs in his own words, and then show at least one way they are wrong. So that's what Harry does.

****** Also, before he can talk about fixing anything, he needs to /understand/ what's actually going on and how things work. Thus his question.

** I don't even understand your question.

The scene is about the Quibbler written by Luna Lovegood, not the Daily Prophet.

#+begin_quote
  I don't know how this is anything but rational.
#+end_quote

Do you mean irrational?

Draco is certainly not pregnant so it's not exactly a rational statement.

And then why are you jumping to the explain blood purity to me sentence? it hardly fits with your 1st sentences.

** Maybe Harry is trying to make a point that the whole blood purity thing is just as stupid and irrational as the idea of Draco getting pregnant and yet many people still believe in it?

I dunno, could you maybe link or quote the whole scene, this is hard to interpret without context and it's been ages since I read HPatMoR.

*** The lines OP quoted are word sphagheti. They left out parts of sentences and about 40 paragraphs during which one topic of conversation is concluded and then proceeds naturally into another.

** On a side note, there is a subreddit ([[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]]) where people discuss that fic. I often see people get answers there when they have questions about scenes in the story. That might be a better place to ask fic-specific questions.
