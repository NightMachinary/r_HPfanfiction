** Lol I love finding little references in fics to Harry's fixation on gold cauldrons or gold scales, etc. Always makes me giggle.

I haven't read an entire fic with that theme though.

** linkffn(Harry's Golden Nuggets) although fair warning, I didn't really love this.

You might also try linkffn(The Price is Right) which I haven't read.

#+begin_quote
  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.

  AU Harry is more money-conscious when he arrives at Gringotts with Hagrid. He's not going to let the wonder of magic take away his common sense and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics.
