** While looking for (platonic) SS&HP I've come across the occasional "Snarriet" as the fics usually reference themselves as. I read a couple out of morbid curiousity, and none of them actually have fem!Harry looking like a miniaturized Lily. I do still find the ship creepy, but at least he isn't /grooming/ her in the fics I did read (time travel, so lacking the history).

In a universe where a fem!Harry actually does look like a mini-Lily (including the eyes, so not just a male!Harry inversion), I could definitely see Snape treat her better. But, while Severus is many things, he never came across as a pedophile to me, so he would never let it go that far. At least not while they remain in the teacher/student positions. Then again, there's a lot of SSHG teacher/student fics, so...

*** I read a fic that had this plot- Harry as a girl, a mini me version of Lily, marrying Snape- but the difference was that Harry pursued the relationship. It was creepy because she was like, a fifteen years old girl doing it.

and not necessarily he is a peadophile in this scenario too. Snape could very well be not even suggesting anything physical until Harry was of age. Like, he could make sure Harry was never interacting with boys her age, emotionally blackmailing her to spend time studying with him...those kind of things.

The thing is, it could be done in so many ways having the same elements. I was curious to see how this angle was being explored. As i said, the only one I know has Harry pushing Snape for a relationship because...blergh " destiny"

**** I'm morbidly curious now, do you have a link? Does the fic raise the obvious problems with the idea at all?

***** It is called the Daisy chain. Harry turns into female Harry. She pursues Snape. The author dies not address the creepiness factor. But is the only pic I remember that Female Harry looks like Lily and ends up with Snape.

To me the likely outcome of this plot would be Severus creeping on mini Lily and not the other way around.
