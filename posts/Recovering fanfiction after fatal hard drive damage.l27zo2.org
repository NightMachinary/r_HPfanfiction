:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello everyone, after a fatal failure of my hard drive where I kept a copy of all my favorite fanfictions, I am trying to recover some of the fanfics that I liked the most, now I am looking for one that I do not remember many details to see if you can give me a hand in find it again.

I remember that Harry somehow does not enter the tournament, but when the first task comes he has to save several students, already Victor because a giant dragon arrives, with many dragons and he considers his stadium and Harry somehow understands them, too I remember that a nott is the minister, and he loses an arm trying to look good and "eliminate" the dragons.

anyone know how fanfic it is to get it back?

Greetings and thanks


** I remember this one. The Giant Dragon is Norberta and her multiple boyfriends, if I recall correctly. Harry helps Hagrid hide the Dragon in the forest instead of taking it to Charlie, I think.

Also, Cedric picks Harry as his tournament mentor.

Unfortunately, I have no bloody idea what the blasted thing is called. But I remember the story!

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.
