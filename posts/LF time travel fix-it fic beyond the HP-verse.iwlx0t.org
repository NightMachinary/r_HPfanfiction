There's a ton of fics where time travelers fix every little problem in the magical world in canon, but they usually don't bother fixing things outside of that... Like in this video: [[https://youtu.be/hBmj4rs1KrI?t=270]]


** "In the Bleak Midwinter" linkao3(15430560) has a subplot where Hermione introduces modern antibiotics and vaccines in the 1920s, after some prompting by non-time travelling characters.

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
