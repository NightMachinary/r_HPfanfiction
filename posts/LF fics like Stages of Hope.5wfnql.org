linkffn(Stages of Hope) Amazing worldbuilding, excellent writing and characterization, It really makes you want more and to keep reading, It hooks you and doesn't let go. Best dimensional travel story I've read. Also if the no pairing bit puts you off just give it a try. Another thing , the summary does not do the story justice, do not pay any attention to it.


** Here is a collection of COMPLETED dimensional travel fics I have in my Favorite list:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052): Both Harry and Sirius before dimensional-traveled through the Veil. They started wrecking things in the new world, quite recklessly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): Again, the Veil served as the conduit for Harry and Sirius to a new dimension. Harry met a good Tom Riddle there, but also new bad guys.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(7718942;12040341): The first story is a Star Wars crossover, in which Harry followed Sirius through the Veil and ended up in the SW universe. Emperor Palpatine captured him and successfully turned him into a vicious Sith Lord. Harry returned after 4 years in the SW universe, but only 41 days in his home universe, extremely powerful and terrifying. Hermione and Luna managed to moderate him somewhat, but at cost of becoming quite dark themselves. Together they embarked on a megalomaniac plan of global domination. In the sequel, their plan was disrupted by treachery and they were forced to leave Earth through the Star Gate. Out there, the power Trio took their fight to the Goa'ulds, and their ambitions now extended to the entire Galaxy. "The Stars Alone" is now one of my most anticipated WIPs.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327): This fic is IMO very similar in its feel to "Stages of Hope", but not as good. The story is about Hermione from an alternate dimension, where the war was basically lost, requesting help from the canon dimension. The canon Trio and Ginny eventually answered the call and went once more into the breach.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3959072/1/Deepest-Reflections][Deepest Reflection]], linkffn(3959072), is the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][The Darkness Within]]. Harry from that dimension made it to canon universe and swapped places with canon Harry. Lots of Angst in this fic.

[[https://www.reddit.com/user/InquisitorCOC/comments/?count=175&after=t1_ddouy31][Shadow Walks]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11305263/1/Shadow-Walker][Shadow Walker]], linkffn(6092362;11305263): They are two highly UNDERRATED fics. I think their writing quality is en par with "Stages of Hope". The first one has Harry searching for Hermione across several dimensions, and encountering of course multiple outcomes. The second one is about one of the Hermiones he encountered during his travels going on her own dimensional travels, looking for a new home. "Shadow Walker" was actually complete on a now defunct site and I can send you a copy if you are interested.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886/1/Strange-Reflections][Strange Reflections]], linkffn(12307886): In the other dimension, James and Lily survived and raised Harry. They made it to canon dimension after canon Harry defeated Voldemort. To avoid confusion, the other Harry called himself 'Hadrian'....

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-26436/DianeCastle+The+League+of+Extraordinary+Women.htm][The League of Extraordinary Women]]: It's both a multiple crossover and dimensional travel. Canon Hermione had to summon 6 female heroes from other universes to defeat a looming demon invasion from the hell dimension. The other six included Sam Carter from SG1, Buffy and Willow from the Vampire Slayers, Selina Kyle from the Justice League, Jaime from the Bionic Woman, and Alex Mack from the Terawatt Verse. This author also wrote [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], often recommended here and set in the Terawatt Verse.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It][The World As We Knew It]], linkffn(3571753): Harry and two other canon characters ended up in a world without prophecies, and that world was even in worse shape. The author wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3872862/1/Rebuilding-the-World][an alternate version]] that was IMO even better, but unfortunately abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6730432/1/World-in-Pieces][World in Pieces]], linkffn(6730432): Harry got summoned to another universe by a desperate Order. The characters there took somewhat different roles than their canon counterparts. Snape, however, was good.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

** Unfortunately that is one of the best fanfics, imo. You'll have trouble finding many that match up to it. One that comes to mind is The Sum of Their Parts, linkffn(11858167) It's not time or dimension travel but it is a dark/grey Harry working with partners (ron, hermione, and George) and doing what needs to be done.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
