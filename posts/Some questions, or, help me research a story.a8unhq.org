I've been batting around an idea for a while now about a Holy Grail War in the HP universe. Not really a crossover with Fate/Stay night, just using their mechanic, and likely taking some liberties with it. The important part is, seven Masters (normal HP characters) each summon a Servant (absurdly powerful versions of characters from myth and history).

Once only one servant remains, that master-servant team gains access to the Holy Grail which can grant any wish. The easiest way to kill a servant is to kill their master, so there is a very serious risk of death.

Servants are summoned into "containers", things like Saber, who wields a sword, or Rider, who uses mountable beasts or vehicles or something in combat.Since my HGW is being set up by Voldemort, the containers in mine will be Wizarding related.

Tentatively, my classes are:

- Curse
- Charm
- Shape (transfiguration)
- Brew (potions, but also poultices, and could be things like alloys or alchemy)
- Harness (dealing with creatures or plants)
- Rite (rituals like horcrux)
- Echo (counter spells)

Another one I thought of was Prophecy. I'm definitely open to other ideas, not super happy about Echo, or the name "Shape", though I do like it better than "Transfiguration". Bear in mind, Servants use these container names as their names in order to hide their identities, so going over two syllables is a little unwieldy.

1. Do you know any good depictions of the Golden age of magic in the HP universe?
2. Any good candidates for servants of the classes above?
3. What HP characters have desperate wishes? I think I have my Master lineup but if you have ideas I want to hear them.
4. What changes in the timeline if Bellatrix dies in 1975?
5. The only two masters I'm really committed to are Voldemort and Luna. Searching this sub has given me lots of good stories for characterizing Luna but not so many for Voldemort. Any recs that will help me write in their voices would be great.


** Concerning #1: you'd have to go AU for that, since in canon magic is advancing, not receding.

  canon magic is advancing, not receding.

... Can you eli5 it, please? Have tried googling up about magic system. No references to "advancing" or "receding" with regards to it.

**** There's a lot on Pottermore, interviews, Rowling's old sites, the Famous Wizard Cards, etc. about the invention of new spells, all of which are at historical times.

IIRC /Expelliarmus/ only dates to the Renaissance, and /Gemino/ is even newer. Good wizards in the series are constantly shown to be inventing new magic (Snape's curses, Hermione's /Point Me/, Fred and George's inventions, Dumbledore's Deluminator, the Marauder's Map). There's also the fact that every year brings its new, more advanced brooms. Along the same lines, the Time-Turners are the result of the Unspeakables progressively perfecting time-travel magic, which was unwieldy and dangerous even in the 18th century.

Generally, there's nothing in canon about "lost lore", a concept that would be essential to magic declining. There is "old magic" in canon, and it can be very powerful; it is, generally, the 'deep' magic directly tying to the inner workings of the human soul; but it is not at all lost. Voldemort feels stupid to have overlooked the Love Sacrifice angle, /because/ it was "old magic". Indeed, it's the entire point of Hogwarts that HP magical lore isn't hoarded and lost, but published and taught to an entire new generation who can then build upon it with their research.

To all of this, the common objection is: but what about the ancient powerful artifacts? To which I say: what ancient artifacts?

*The Philosopher's Stone* only dates to the Renaissance; its recipe was /created/ by Nicolas Flamel, who is a researcher. He and Dumbledore could still discover new exciting things about alchemy in the 20th century (cf. Dragon's Blood).

The *Goblet of Fire* is more bark than bite, mostly getting by on the mystery of its origins. In practice it isn't actually all that powerful; its workings are mysterious, but in the hands of a capable villain it is easily befuddled by the more recent Confundus Charm.

As for the *Deathly Hallows*, well, their legend claims they were given to the Brothers by Death itself, precisely because it's so insane to think that such old wizards would have been able to create such powerful items out of their own skill; and the Peverells aren't even anything you'd call "ancient" --- they're just medieval.

***** That's... wow. So... magic is literally evolving/being discovered again and again?

That'd cover a few of the plotholes, don't they? Like, how not everyone knows or uses Time Turners because a precise and calibrated instrument to harness such magic might've only been developed recently.\\
Even the question of why James/Lily wasn't secret keepers themselves.

Time for me to dig deeper into Pottermore and Lexicon. Frankly never considered them canon, though. But the thought definitely is interesting.

*** Well, it's somewhat AU anyway, I'm alright with that.

How do you know magic is advancing? It seems pretty common in fanfiction to say magic is receding, to the point that it took you pointing this out for me to realize it wasn't canon.

** Indeed - in HP, old magic, with a few exceptions, mostly plot devices, is generally weaker and less advanced than contemporary magic. The Firebolt, for example, outclasses anything older in the air - the first Atlantic crossing on a broom happened in the 1930s, not in some past golden age. The same goes for many spells.

** /Wishes-/

I suppose Harry really wants a family, it's in Erised after all.

We also now know young Dumbledore saw Grindlewald in Erised thanks to FB. The future though? My headcanon is that he wishes he could right the wrongs of his past. The mistakes he made with Grindelwald, his family and Tom Riddle. Though that's quite vague and can't be solved with one wish - aside from maybe the wish to start again from scratch.

Snape's whole characterisation hinges on his ruined relationship with Lily and his hate for James, translating into his hate for Harry and general bitterness. His wish could be a number of things to do with that, go back and have Lily in love with him, resurrect Lily etc. It all revolves around Lily.

--------------

/As for characters from the past, how far do you have to go?/

Would 1920 be alright? I know technically Scamander is still alive in the 80s but you can mess with that. He'd suit Harness pretty well right? He's the ultimate animal guy in the HP universe, followed by Hagrid.

Also - the Founders. I'm sure they'll have defining characteristics that can be interpreted as one of your classes.

Making up some characters too based on the old families. The Black's are the Ancient and Most Noble House right? They're supposed to be dripping in dark magic and a lot of their old family tree is named too. You could expand upon a canon character that's only mentioned by name. Very easy to work with.

The three Peverell brothers would be my go to for mythical figures.

Also - ghosts. Figures like the Bloody Barron and what not. I imagine the Bloody Barron in his chains and his garrish state he ended up in before he died would make for a rather menacing servant, different from the others.

--------------

/I have a copy of The Tales of Beedle The Bard on my book case./ I'll give that a read because it's all the fairy tales set centuries before the books and might have something you could use regarding ancient magic or characters.

Also for Shape, maybe Form?

*** I might use Snape. I'm not sure why, but I just don't want to use Harry or Dumbledore.

I've kinda been using 1300ish as my cutoff. Any later than that and the history is just too good to get away with pretending the character is a league above the likes of Voldemort and Dumbledore, which Servants kinda have to be for the conceit.

I'm definitely using one of the founders but I don't want to use more than one.

"Form" is much better than "shape"! Thank you!

I'll see about finding a copy of Beedle the Bard too, thank you!

**** Alright then! Well I'll have some answers regarding Beedle and the Bard tonight when I can write out a full response.

When you get around to writing It, reckon you could let me know/link it here? I'd love to read this even though I've only seen a little bit of the series it's inspired by
