Looking for stories that feature Peter Pettigrew as either a good guy, protagonist [meaning still dark but is helping things go to a good end in the the story] or competent. I have seen him written really well in Arc of Sacrifices and The Mind's Guardian so I am wondering if there is anymore. Only stipulation is that it must not be crack or Peter deluding himself into thinking he is competent/good. Other characters must acknowledge it too. He doesn't have to be the story focus either.


** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken][Promises unbroken]] trilogy.

Peter is not a main character but is a good guy and competent in his field.

** This is all I have to offer you at the moment. Peter is the main character, and I hope I've arrived at a pretty balanced view of him.

**** Nope, only on HPFF. You don't need to be a member to read or review there.

Cheers!
