I'm writing a fanfiction set in Andromeda Tonk's perspective showing her early life with her family, her relationship with her sisters, how they fall apart and her relationship with Ted Tonks. I'm really struggling to capture the dynamic between the Black family though and unsure what sort of scenes would be relevant to the story. Any tips would be widely appreciated :D


** The Blacks are a dysfunctional family living in their own fantasy world that no longer exists and probably never existed. Their pseudo-aristocratic attitude clashes with a world that doesn't recognize their claims of innate superiority. While pureblood supremacist beliefs are widespread, their power is diminished to an extent that a muggle-born can become Minister of Magic.

So while the Blacks are still rich and privileged, each generation of Blacks witnesses that they're less privileged than their parents, and they long for a past glory long gone. They're not the nobles they pretend to be, they are a family of deplorables with a history of mental illness excarbated by inbreeding. In such a situation, especially if you believe yourself to be innately superior and the blame therefore can't rest with yourselff, it is tempting to engage in scapegoating and the creation of nonsensical conspiracy theories. And that's what Sirius' parents, as well as Andromeda's do, blaming muggle-borns, "blood-traitors", and everyone else they deem beneath themselves.

A radicalized version of this thinking leads Regulus and Bellatrix to the Death Eaters, whereas Sirius, Andromeda and Uncle Alphard all at some points have cracks appear in that worldview that lead to their estrangement from their family.

So my recommendation would be to include some scenes in which Andromeda realizes the discrepancy between the worldview instilled into her by her family and the reality of the wider wizarding world.

For the relationship between the sisters, I think that their initially close relationship becomes increasingly strained by the diverging beliefs of Bellatrix and Andromeda. I think that especially Andromeda and Narcissa will struggle with the love for her sisters even though they are becoming staunch ideological opponents. Ultimately, they reach a breaking point that leads to Andromeda being cast out from her family.

**** Oh I love this parallel and I 100% agree. The Gaunts led themselves with their pure blood mania and pride at being Slytherin's heirs to having a squib for a daughter and an insane son. The Black line never survived long enough to reach that level.

***** Merope wasn't a squib... didn't Dumbledore say something about the abuse suppressing her ability to perform magic well?

From HBP:

#+begin_quote
  “I think you are forgetting,” said Dumbledore, “that Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years.”

*** This is basically my interpretation. Pseudo-aristocratic seems to be a good way to describe it. It sort of bugs me when fanfics treat them as literal wizarding nobility, instead of just a family with a superiority complex

** I am writing the backstory of the Black sisters for my own fic (No longer alone) so take this with a grain of salt since I have to fit it into a certain plot. I wanted to develop their characters into more than "good sister", "somewhat bad sister" and "crazy sister". But House Black dynamics boil down to four main aspects for me.

1.) The sisters used to love each other unconditionally. Narcissa as the youngest was watched over by two slightly unhinged and overprotective sisters. In a family where love was not given freely the three of them grew up relying on each other.

2.) Andromeda's marriage caused a chain of events which eventually lead to the creation of the infamous Bellatrix Lestrange. After Andi got hitched her sisters were rushed into contracted marriages to "upstanding members of the society". Bella was not born a sadistic bitch. I don't even see her as a supporter of Voldemort before her marriage. All of the Black sisters were raised to believe in the superiority of purebloods, something they all agreed on to a certain extent because having magic would not stop them from using the "achievements of the Muggles". Muggles were second-class people who had their uses, not vermin to be exterminated. Ideologically that puts them closer to Grindelwald than to Voldemort. Andromeda shed that believe over the years thanks to her muggle in-laws. Narcissa kept the attitude she was raised with while the Lestranges drove Bella into the militant extension of that belief. After Andromeda eloped her sisters were contracted to Lestrange and Malfoy. Malfoy was happy with his trophy wife while the Lestranges broke the rebellious Bella and turned her into the monster she became through conditioning (torture those muggles or get tortured yourself), not through some loyalty potion bullshit. Andi blames herself for that since without her marriage the contracts would not have been signed.

3.) Andromeda and Narcissa are on friendly terms. They have secret meetings once every couple months (or at least no one on Narcissa's side knows about them). Both miss their sister whom they lost two decades ago due to the Lestranges and both feel guilty about it because they feel like they failed Bella (Andromeda) or could have done more to help her (Narcissa).

4.) Andromeda is not the embodiment of the "Light side". Andromeda is a pragmatist, someone who would kill to protect her family. She makes decisions based on her family's welfare (Edward, Nymphadora, Edward's parents, Narcissa), not "looking at the bigger picture". If she had the choice between saving her husband/daughter/sister or saving five hundred others she would sacrifice the whole lot without remorse. She could live under Voldemort if her family was safe. She stayed out of the first war because that conflict did not concern her. Andromeda is not a patriot (unlike her husband and daughter), running away is a valid choice for her. She would rather hop aboard British Airways Flight 15 to Sydney via Singapore than stay in Britain and fight the war.

*** I agree with this A LOT. I think it says a lot that Andromeda was sorted into Slytherin like every other Black before her. People try and equate her to Sirius, which I don't believe is the case. She was a Slytherin who somehow managed to fall in love with a muggleborn. Sirius was never a Slytherin, he was always rebellious and staunchly against the teachings of his family. From day one on the train he expresses a desire to placed somewhere else other than Slytherin. He flourished under James' friendship and was guided strongly towards the path of bravery and was desperate to prove he was nothing like his family. Quite frankly I don't believe Andromeda gave a damn what people thought of her. She did what she wanted as a Black and when she displeased her family, I wouldn't be surprised if there was an attitude of “I'll do whatever I damn well please.”

** I think the most information from canon is in OotP when Sirius is showing Harry the tapestry. I write about the Black family a lot, and what I've gotten from canon is that they're mostly pure blood fanatics and generally miserable, with a line of psychopathy running through, cropping up now and then (like in Bellatrix).

With that, you can make Andromeda seem more of an outcast - perhaps she's not so enthusiastic about what's expected of her, or she's not as pretty as the others, thus earning her the spot of least favorite daughter at an early age, further compounding her feelings of alienation. Perhaps she'd feel resentment toward her sisters for that.

Her parents can be either abusive rage-aholics or cold and snide, or one can be the former and the other the latter...you can play with them a bit but I can't imagine either of them would be too normal.

Anyway, those are just some headcanons and such. We know from canon that she was disowned and that both of her sisters shunned her after she went off with Tonks, so it's clear she either wasn't valued from the start or her family took it as the ultimate betrayal. Probably both.

Edit: also link me when you're done. I'm always up for a good Andromeda story.

** First of all,

Noble is a binary value. You either are or aren't. Ancient may be a matter of degrees, as tracing lineage more than a thousand years back really should qualify you to claim 'older than most' in your regalia. Therefore, it is the 'Noble and Most Ancient House of Black'.

Being a Black no doubt meant great care and concern over reputation and influence was the family dynamic. Bellatrix was the eldest and expected to lead her sisters towards proper positions that would reflect well on the House. She probably rebelled against that by falling in with extremists and striving to be the most deadly duelist around.

Andromeda was also intended to marry well and bring honour to the House, but I get the sense that she had a quite sarcastic streak and a wicked sense of humour about all the posturing and bloviating. She nearly succumbed to the pressure of expectations, but there was this guy who made her laugh and maybe one day he said, "You're a witch. If something bothers you, change it."

Faced with the madcap eldest daughter and defiant middle daughter, the obligations fell on the shoulders of Narcissa. Which is not to say that she hates her life or her family or even her husband, but you get the sense that she had only one child for a reason.

*** This sounds like a great summation of that wonderful Narcissa comic (don't know what else to call it) - where she was determined to Minister of Magic but as Bellatrix goes a bit insane (in the comic she cuts open her womb) and Andromeda gets disinherited, she realises she needs to take up the responsibilities her sisters shirked.
