I know that Moody's eye can see through wood and invisibility cloaks/disillusionment charms, but what is the extent of this? Is this ever touched on in canon? For example would he be able to see through concrete? What happens if he is in a forest? How far does his eye reach? Would it work in the same way as spells and fry electronics like an EMP?


** Honestly I feel like Moody's eye being able to see through Harry's cloak is a flaw in DH. Death himself can't see through the cloak but a prosthetic can? (Yeah yeah, "Death" is a metaphor/fairy tale/etc., but the cloak is not an epic artifact on par with the Deathstick and the Resurrection Stone if a prosthetic can overcome it.)

I'd be interested in a canon rewrite that merely incorporated elements from later books into earlier books. Dumbledore is unavailable in PS because he traveled to the ICW by international portkey, rather than flying to the Ministry by broomstick. And Moody!Crouch knew Harry was there because the paranoid teacher used a hearing enhancement, rather than seeing through the cloak.

/cough/ Anyway, back on topic! I'd like to know more about his eye too. Specifically how common it is. Moody is a cop, no indication that he's fabulously wealthy, so it was either a government salary or a government health benefit that paid for it. Yet it was unique enough for Umbridge to display as a war trophy. Is there some drawback that most people won't use one (pain, vertigo...)? Or is it just that magic healing is so extensive that in all the war survivors Harry meets (i.e. almost everyone over the age of Snape/Sirius/Remus) only one had an injury so severe it couldn't be cured?

*** I always liked the theory that Dumbledore used the Elder Wand to enchant the eye, and that that's why they're such good friends.

**** Especially since he had the cloak to study after the war, so he could have figured out the secret to beating it with the elder wand

Maybe then the eye is a powerful artifact too? It would explain why we don't anyone else with that kind of prosthetic: everyone just gets themselves fixed, in the typical "magic can fix pretty much any mundane injury" way, but Moody couldn't resist upgrading himself with that Unique Eye of +5 Paranoia.

**** A good explanation, but it asks more questions! Where did Moody get this unique, powerful artifact? He didn't buy it with a cop's salary. Quick, someone write a fic where young!Moody goes questing for the Unique Eye of +5 Paranoia, Indiana Jones style.

***** Oh, I would definitely read that.

He could also have gotten it from some dark wizard he defeated. Aurors are supposed to be dark wizard hunters after all. And now I also want to read the story of a young Moody running around the world hot on the trail of some dark wizard...

**** I like the theory that it's Odin's eye. And maybe it can't see through the cloak like it's not there, but it can see the cloak's magic and he extrapolated who was under it.

** Eh, I chalked it up to Dumbledore putting a tracking charm on it, or a tread with a tracking charm or beacon sewn into it. This isn't bashing Dumbledore. I mean, he's giving a kid an invisibility cloak. You might want to be able to see said kid. That would probably be responsible. Well, more responsible than dumping it on the kid's bed at christmas and hoping he doesn't use it for evil.

Moody can naturally "see" the tracker/beacon with the eye.
