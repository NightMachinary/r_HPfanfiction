Looking for an artificer 5e/gemcaster 5e/rune scribe 5e fanfic

Harry gets interested in dnd when he stumbles in on a session while running from his cousin the players take him under their wing teaching him of magic until Harry gets his Hogwarts letter then have him telling them of magic maybe have him meet Hermione at a book store where he reads manuals and books of it and have him do better at school because somebody cares about his grades

some fanfics i have seen are kind of like what i imagine such as The Rune Stone Path and the Runemaster or *burnable's* works


** i think this has potential to be both fun and hilarious just imagine mcgonagal says "mr.potter please you dont need a spell book you have a wand."

harry says"of course i need a spell book how else am i to memorize all of them."

i think shit like this would be hilarious

*** Hermione hidden away behind the shelves at the public library stares at the impossibility as Harry cross-references multiple floating books for any magic spells that might explain the powers he can use finally he looks up to try and find where the odd blubbering noise is coming from.
