Here's what I remember:

- Possibly read on LJ or IJ
- Harry is struck by a curse that de-ages him to an infant
- Snape is chosen/forced to take care of him
- They are sent by Dumbledore to a safe house
- I think the safe house is accessed via a portkey suitcase?
- As Harry grows up (at a fast pace) he begins to remember things about his life -- eventually he remembers about who Snape is; angst/resentment follow. Dumbledore has to come and counsel him.
- Eventually Harry becomes older than Snape, and then goes back to defeat Voldemort

I'm having no luck on Scryer or Google, possibly because I'm no good with search terms.

Anyone have any ideas??

  A curse from Voldemort regresses Harry to infancy. Snape must protect him while the Order tries to find a way to reverse the spell.
