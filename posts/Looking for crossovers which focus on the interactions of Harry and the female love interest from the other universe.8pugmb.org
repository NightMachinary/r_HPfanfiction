Are there any crossovers where Harry ends up with a woman from the other fandom without becoming buddies with everyone there? For example, Harry ending up with Wonder Woman but not befriending Batman, Superman and so on. I'm here for the BAMF woman, not the guy Riot forgot to nerf or the edgy vigilant. Or Harry ending up in the Mass Effect Universe and with Tali but not getting along with Garrus, Kaidan and so on. Obviously, this would require an AU and not just Harry in the main plot of the other fandom. The other character being dropped in the HP universe would work even better for this.

Please no m/m (obviously), Death Eater whitewashing or ridiculous amounts of bashing. I don't care about which fandom is the other one, but a basic explanation within the story would be nice.


** Abandoned but here is a Harry/Dawn Summers (BTVS) pairing:

Linkffn(the second prophecy by IllusionsofBliss)

There are 24 chapters and you can pretty much tell the direction the story will go in so although abandoned, still a good read.

** The Power He Knows Not by Steelbadger linkffn(11027086) is a Harry/Eowyn where he is friendly with the Community but not friendly enough to really follow or help them. He's concentrating more about helping Eowyn and her people (Rohan) during and after the battle.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Ã‰owyn.
