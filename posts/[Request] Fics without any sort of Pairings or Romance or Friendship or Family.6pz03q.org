I want to read a fic where the MC is completely focused on their magic to the point that they neglect interpersonal relationships. Preferably currently updating, complete, or at least 100,000 words long before being abandoned.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

** Unfortunately, I can't think of anything really like that, but I have read some stuff that gets close. In most of The Many Deaths of Harry Potter, Harry is completely closed off and paranoid. He does start dating and stuff though, fair warning. The story drags, but it was good. Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King has him not taking his relationship seriously (not in a take advantage way) from what I recall, but I have never read the sequel. Fair warning though, Harry switches last names (and families) more than he does Defense Professors.
