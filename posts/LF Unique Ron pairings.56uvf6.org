It's no secret that while Harry and Hermione get shipped with every member of the HP cast, regardless of whether it makes sense or not, Ron gets shoved to the side as always. So, gimme some fics where Ron gets shipped with someone he isn't normally shipped with. In other words, anyone that isn't Hermione.

** I've recommended this a lot, lately, but "For a Pound of Flesh" linkffn(11793813) a Pansy/Ron fic, then "Facade" linkffn(11815322) might be of interest. Ron is with multiple women in that one. Then "Our Hidden Desires" linkffn(11481910) features a short Ron/Lavender piece every other chapter.

** Ron/Pansy seems to the next most common Ron straight pair, for whatever reason.

  Dating's tough when you're Harry Potter. Ron watches his best friend go through some very bad dating experiences, while going through some awkward ones of his own. H/R slash. Please note the rating and warnings inside.

  Draco Malfoy's life takes a turn for the traumatic when he's kidnapped by Ron Weasley to protect him from an murderous foe he's never heard of. With friends like these, who needs enemies?
