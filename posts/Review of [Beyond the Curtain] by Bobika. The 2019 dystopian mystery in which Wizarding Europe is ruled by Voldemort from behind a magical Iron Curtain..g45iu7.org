*Premise*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13047893/1/Beyond-the-Curtain][Beyond the Curtain]] is an AU sequel in which Voldemort sees Snape's memories and changes the outcome of the war by avoiding killing Harry. Within four years, he has established his empire and an impenetrable magical Curtain is brought down over most of Europe.

Our story is set in 2019, 17 years after the Curtain falls, and told through Neville Longbottom, who still fights for the resistance movement outside the borders of the Magical Empire. In recent times, a Crossing has opened up in the Curtain, with goods being exchanged and muggles being smuggled out occasionally, but no one on the outside has managed to find their way in. Neville finds himself unexpectedly meeting Harry, who has not aged a day past 17 and appears to have unfettered access through the Curtain. With his help, Neville's band of four resistance soldiers arrange to sneak past the Curtain and attempt an incredibly risky mission to bring the Empire down from within.

The story is currently two thirds complete, has been ongoing since August of 2018 and is 130k words. It is an Adventure/Mystery story with a T rating, though its themes are very much geared to an adult audience. It is a war story, with its thematic roots in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Curtain][Iron Curtain]] of the Cold War.

*Plot*

The author has divided the plot into 3 arcs, the third of which is still unwritten.

The first follows Neville's team's journey across the border. Accompanying him are Bill Weasley and two original characters -- Gregory Danes and Annie Karlsson. Gregory is a second-generation resistance soldier who refers to Neville as “old man”, and Annie is a muggle with a unique power: magic cannot function within a 1.5m radius of her. She cannot be cursed, even by an Unforgivable, but she cannot be magically transported either.

The Curtain crossing at Belarus does not go smoothly at all -- Neville's crew are instantly captured and must be rescued by Harry and another OC -- Andrei Sadecki, who is a spy for Harry working within the army's ranks at the Crossing. A few action-packed scenes end with Harry driving all 6 of them across Eastern Europe in a caravan, giving us an eye-opening road trip and a gradual easing into what the Magical Empire looks like.

The worldbuilding in this story goes so deep that in the interests of brevity I will only mention a few highlights here:

- Muggles in the Empire are either slaves with enchanted bracelets, or else they live in slums.

- The Trace now encompasses the whole Magical Empire, and tracks all magic used at all times. An unregistered wand alerts the army immediately, so Neville and the crew are unable to cast any magic until they get their wands registered.

- No muggle may step foot on the British Isles anymore -- it is considered a sacred magical land.

The second arc begins as the road trip finishes and the crew make a base of operations within a muggle slum in Serbia. Harry slowly integrates the crew with his own resistance force inside the Curtain, who have literally been hiding underground for years now. This section does not have as much action but much more unravelling of the enigma that is Harry. How is it that Harry seems to have a superhuman awareness of what's going on around him at all times? Why does he still appear 17 years old? Does he mumble to himself because he's crazy, or is he talking to someone?

Because of the genre of the fic and the fact that it isn't finished, I don't want to spoil any more of what occurs, but I strongly encourage you to find out.

​

*Writing*

Beyond the Curtain's prologue was the strongest opener of any of my recommendations so far. Harry has been captured by Voldemort, and while it is confirmed that all the other horcruxes have been destroyed, Voldemort is delighted at the prospect of having ‘discovered' human horcruxes, complete with all their survival instincts. We don't know what he does to Harry, but we do know that his aim was to make Harry indestructible, even through suicide. The desperation in Harry is palpable and the scene is absolutely gripping.

Neville's 3rd person perspective is the lens through which we journey beyond the Curtain and into the unknown Empire. As a narrative choice, this was a stroke of brilliance. Much of the mystery of the story surrounds Harry himself, so having it told from Harry's perspective would have been like telling the canon story from Dumbledore's -- there would have been no tension or anticipation whatsoever. Neville is able to fill us in succinctly on life outside the Empire, but knows nothing about what happens past the Curtain, so we learn as he does.

I am also endlessly impressed by how well the author handles the genre of the fic. The plot is well structured because it knows where it's going and how it's going to get there. Revelations are foreshadowed either within the text of the fic or from canon, thus rewarding the audience for getting invested in many of the same ways J.K Rowling rewarded attention to detail in the books. As both a mystery and a sequel fic with a significant time gap, I cannot overstate what a fantastic structural choice it was to starve and drip-feed the audience with tidbits of information to keep us wondering what in the world /happened/ here. A good literary tease can have an audience on the edge of their seats, desperate to know what's in that next layer, that next revelation, and Bobika is a master of the tease.

The worldbuilding is also /phenomenal./ On two levels.

One is that setting takes a prominent place in the writing. Each chapter begins with a date and a place, which was very fitting as a formatting choice. As the first arc is a road trip, several real-world locations in Eastern Europe are visited and described in such detail that I have little doubt the author describes many of these places from experience. Svetlaya, Belarus. Ruma, Serbia. Silesia, Poland. I googled these places and many more as our protagonists journeyed, and found it both delightful and immersive to connect the characters to their landscape.

The second level is the sheer creativity of this fic. There are highly dangerous places in this story called “dead zones”, in which magic cannot function. Magical artifacts tend to explode when they come into contact with them, and they have only started appearing in the years since the Curtain came down. Since the Statute of Secrecy has long since been broken, muggles and muggle weaponry are heavily incorporated into the new world. The inclusion of dead zones and a girl with an anti-magic field seriously impressed me for the way it ups the stakes and makes wizardkind less god-like compared to muggles -- it provides a balance that wasn't there in canon.

And this isn't even the half of the work that went into designing this story - the geopolitics and moral complexity of the war; the social hierarchy of pure blood, half-blood and muggle inside the Empire and the near utopia that exists for wizardkind and so, so much more deserves huge merit. I have rarely seen such extensive work go into developing a fanfiction like this, especially since it does so by devotedly building upon the canon rather than overwriting it. It is clearly a labour of love.

The general writing quality was extremely high, and it is pertinent to point out here that the author is not a native speaker of English. Despite this, the grammar was impeccable and phrasing was always on point. The mistakes I did find were spelling errors which would not have been picked up by spell-checker. Things like ‘sept' instead of ‘seeped', ‘rooster' instead of ‘roster', and I think my favourite was ‘otter chaos', because it [[https://images.app.goo.gl/GQWq9zaSanW2784t9][still works just as well]]. The author does use a beta reader later in the story, but I found mistakes in those chapters too. Lastly there are small continuity errors concerning the timeline, Bill's children, and who survived the war. Nothing that really throws any kind of spanner in the overall reading experience mind you, it's all small stuff that doesn't repeat itself.

Pacing was fair, and whilst there was great tension during action scenes and I absolutely believed how high the stakes were, there were long swathes of complacency in between, especially in the second arc. I would have liked to have seen that broken up and the sense of urgency of the story kept a little more consistent.

​

*Characterisation*

While this was still a strong element compared to a lot of fics, it was weak compared to other elements of this story. Note that I also give a lot of leeway as far as canon characterisation goes, considering we're imagining these people as they would be over 20 years from where we left them.

*Neville*'s characterisation feels comfortable and fitting for this version of him who has been over 20 years a soldier. He is married to Luna in this universe, and they have been living a relatively quiet existence in Finland since the Curtain came down. His day job is in local law enforcement but he is still quietly fighting a war under Bill Weasley's command. He also developed a magical weed using mimbulus mimbletonia and I kind of love that.

One of my favourite things about having the story told from Neville's POV is that we get to feel what Harry's secretiveness is like from the other side. When we rode with Harry in canon, we knew why he would ask people to do crazy things without ever explaining himself (“Kill the snake.”), but when you're not in the know, I am right there alongside Neville feeling super frustrated and resentful that Harry just railroads everyone else's plans without giving a reason. It's quite eye-opening really, when you think about how many characters must have felt this way about Harry throughout the canon text, especially around OotP.

*Bill* is a hardened soldier with a chip on his shoulder when it comes to Harry, but then, a lot of his family died following Harry into battle. We do see moments of him opening up though. There was a particularly good chapter called “Cherchez la Femme” in which Neville, Bill and Sadecki all bond by talking about the women in their lives and how those women influenced these men to be where they are today. The title comes from Andre Dumas, and means to “look for the woman”, if you want to find the root cause of the problem. It's something of a detective fiction staple and “the woman” is [[https://images.app.goo.gl/bR1ECFvX953y6S9a8][almost certainly played by Eva Green.]]

However, if you were to actually “look for the woman”, you would come up dry in this story. Most of the female characters we're familiar with are either housewives or dead, and the rest were in and out within a chapter or sort of swept under various plot rugs. I was certainly expecting more from Hermione and Annie.

The 40-year-old *Hermione* we meet in chapter 1 has been psychologically crippled since a traumatic experience during the war. She cannot stand to be around magic, has not touched a wand in years, is mute, and spends her days in total isolation in a dead zone, caring for her aging mother. Without downplaying the effects of PTSD, I have trouble wrapping my head around a Hermione who could bring herself to stop fighting, stop being involved in making the world a better place, especially while Harry was alive. She has apparently been in this state for well over a decade and her condition has never changed. I kept expecting a better explanation for writing her into this corner; I was even building up anticipation to read a chapter called “Hermione's Worst Nightmare”, which I thought would look at this in depth, since the canon “Snape's Worst Memory” chapter was so telling about how Snape grew to be the man he was. I was quite disappointed to realise that the title was actually just a gimmick about Neville feeling guilty for burning some books, and that Hermione's entire role in the story was over by chapter 3.

*Annie* had real potential. She's a soldier raised in the resistance and the best shot in her crew, since the other 3 are wizards who rely far more on their wands than muggle weaponry. Throughout the whole first arc no one could use magic inside the Curtain, so you'd think that she would have really shone here. Instead, she gets shot in the leg in the first conflict and just has to be carried for a while. As a side note, Harry does a basic stitch up for her and says she'll definitely need proper medical attention soon, but then her injury is just never mentioned again, so I guess she's fine?

In the second arc she drops off screen almost entirely. Neville is often off scouting or doing other things which require a person to be magical in order to be useful, so Annie inevitably gets left out, and none of relationship-building conversations involve her either. Two thirds of the way through the story I don't have much of a feel for her personality, let alone empathy for her.

It's easy to see her purpose in the story though -- Annie is a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysticalWaif][Mystical Waif]] trope: the young woman in a group of men on a mission, and her mysterious power is the key to saving the world, if only her brave companions can her protect long enough to do so. This role is usually filled by a magical woman amongst more mundane travel companions, but it's an interesting inversion to have the other party members be the magical ones and the mysterious power be the ability to nullify magic. Probably because of this power, the author was overcautious to not make her a Mary Sue (and succeeded), but unfortunately also failed to make her a fully realised character.

*Gregory Danes* has it even worse. Like Annie, his personality is extremely underdeveloped. Unlike Annie, I cannot see his purpose in the plot at all. His main duty is to guard Annie whilst Neville and Bill go off to do more important things, so he is also left behind a lot, and I have to assume he is just canon fodder.

The 3rd OC, *Andrei Sadecki*, is slightly better off than Gregory in that he gets to have a bit more personality and purpose. In one of the more exposition-heavy chapters, Sadecki unwittingly reveals that children raised inside the Empire do not know the reality of who Harry Potter is. The name is synonymous with a bogeyman used to scare children, and now that he is grown Sadecki believes him to be a myth, and that the Harry Potter he knows in person must have had parents with a poor sense of humour. Aside from his assistance in getting the crew past the Curtain, it's clear that his role in the story was to provide this perspective on growing up in Voldemort's world. After that was done, he just sort of sat extraneously in the background of several chapters before quietly dropping off.

Lastly, I am beginning to notice certain signs... signs which signal that a *Harry Potter* character interpretation has been cultivated in the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][DLP forums]]. They tend to be extremely cold, logical, clever, a magical force to be reckoned with, boundlessly confident, and of course he's a /strong independent man who don't need no friends/. Even his love interests seem to be pre-determined. The Harry of Beyond the Curtain falls somewhat into this trope. He didn't seem so overpowered at first, and I thought I recognised the Harry of the books in his character, but despite a touching scene in which he opens up to Neville in the second arc, he was eventually revealed to have very little humanity left. This made me mostly disconnect from him and feel grateful to be travelling with Neville rather than Harry.

He is not a Gary Stu mind you. He has real flaws that are called out -- he is pathetically avoidant of emotional conflict and extremely traumatised as an adult -- but at some point I realised that he is also a one-man army, strategy board, spy network, smuggler, researcher and criminal mastermind. All at once, all the time, and frankly it asks for too much suspension of disbelief. No one has time for all that. Moreover, it becomes increasingly clear that Harry and Voldemort are the only two characters in the fic who matter at all, because their galaxy brains just render everyone else too stupid to be anything but pawns on their chessboard, and that's kind of a turnoff in a fic which is otherwise so incredibly realistic.

​

*TL:DR*

I recommend the heck out of this one. It's a fantastic premise, a planned out, well-structured plot, A+ worldbuilding and creativity and a gripping mystery. The only real downsides are some of the characterisations and the fact that it isn't finished yet. It's great for adult readers but not explicitly gorey or sexual, so it doesn't really leave anyone out. Beyond the Curtain gets an *8/10* from me, and I look forward to seeing how it ends.

** Don't know what's the proper policy when it comes to the author reacting to a review, but I don't want to pass up on the opportunity to say a few words.

Thank you, Draquia, for this incredibly detailed look at the story. Yes, you were right with your concerns about reviewing an unfinished piece, as there are some layers of the plot we haven't delved into, and in combination with the unreliable narrator, some elements (and especially characters) feel flat.

It makes it hard to justify my choices without giving away any spoilers, and I'm not going to - after all, you were reviewing what's written, not what I'll reveal in the future. Just in regards to the rest of the discussion here: I'm a girl and I love to read about and relate to some well-written female MCs; when writing this story, though, I cared very little for equal representation and just went with what felt natural for the characters I adopted or created.

I'm very much excited and grateful for the review - it offers a great mirror to what's been written so far, and it'll help me shape the rest. Thank you!

** I have been posting repeatedly on this forum asking for fics with realistic conflict, so I was hooked just by the promise of this fic's promise.

It's too bad that, according to your review, it seems as if the fic is heading towards superman!Harry territory, but I think I will give it a try nonetheless.

That said, I just finished the first chapter, and I notice the author ends it with "To be continued-19 years later", and I can't stop thinking how funny it would have been if the author actually just posted that chapter and waited 19 years to post the rest of the fic.

** Have always wanted to get into this fic as there are many elements which intrigue me. Unfortunately I have simply never been able to get past the existence of "dead zones" or a character with an anti-magic field around them. "No nerfing magic" is basically my #1 red line in fanfic.

*** I've managed to incorporate several personal pet peeves that would otherwise instantly turn me off from a story, into my own fic - in a way that I find enjoyable. "Nerfing magic" seems to be one we share, so I'll try to explain what I did there.

Muggles nerfing magic to stand a fighting chance (and thus creating some level of tension in a plot) has made me stop reading in the past. That's not how I'm using this element, though - the dead zones and the anti-magic field are creations of magic, and are wielded as strategic tools by magical users against other magical users. In a similar way an Anti-Disapparition Jinx is used to block one magical ability, the dead zones just block many more (almost all).

The fact that muggles then can use these spaces to their advantage is a by-product.

Yes, it does take away most of the charm, but I also did it so the bit of magic that is left would stand out.

*** I noticed a couple of reviews on the fic which expressed the same sentiments. It surprised me a little because it was one of my favourite features of the story. In a world without the statute of secrecy, muggles would more or less be relegated to rolling over and dying if it came to war, and I like the idea that wizards don't just automatically win all the time, even though I'd probably be rooting for them.

**** For me, the fun of the HP magic system is that its produces wizard vs wizard conflicts which ask the question "What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?"

I specifically like the HP system because it is /not/ a rock-paper-scissors style RPG system where magic and non-magic are balanced.

***** Personally I'm kind of the opposite. While I love the sense of wonder the magic of HP brings, I'm not too fond of its lack of limitations nowadays.

My personal favorite magic systems (Allomancy from Mistborn for example) have clear rules and limitations, but still leave a lot of room for creativity. The characters are forced to get creative and cannot simply "magic" their problems away or "brutforce" their opponents into submission, simply by being more powerful. I guess I'm more of a hard magic person.

The idea of magical dead zones and anti-magic people is intriguing to me, but the characterwork seemingly taking a backseat turns me a little off, so I think I'll pass on this one too.

****** Allomancy and similar systems always feel far too gamey too me. The author designs them according to the principles of tabletop RPG design and it shows. It's just a couple steps away from giving the characters MP counts.

One of the things that I like about the HP system is the sense of authenticity. Any magic system which the reader fully understands will inevitably feel shallow, IMO - contrast the reader's understanding of how the magic of a story works vs. the complexity of how the universe works in real life. The magic system will always come off the worse for that comparison. Any attempt to have both authenticity and a fully explained system is doomed to failure.

So the best route to authenticity and realism, I think, is to avoid having the reader understand magic. Rather, you /allude/ to complexity - Hogwarts has a massive library; you can have whole books written about single spells (Harry reads 2 books about the Summoning Charm in GoF); there are periodicals which resemble academic journals, to which the most accomplished wizards contribute; magic has laws and theories, etc.

All this creates in the reader an impression that magic is a complex and living body of human knowledge, that understanding it involves significant study and intelligence, that it is a worthy parallel to Muggle science in terms of its intellectual sophistication, although it uses different means to explain the world than through mathematical models; that it is a believable system which explains the true, magical nature of the universe -- or at least, wizards' attempt to understand it.

For me, that sense of realism is much more important than the reader's ability to understand magic - because ultimately, a good story resolves its conflicts via satisfying character choices and development, not through rules lawyering its magic system.

******* I can understand how hard magic can sometimes feel a little to gamey and ironically I still have Lord of the Rings with its soft magic as my absolute favorite when it comes to fantasy. Different strokes for different folk.

Magic like Allomancy actually gives me an added sense of authenticity. I've always been a curious person, so clear defined magic gives me a different sense of wonder. I feel like I can discuss it, discover it.

It never feels like it detracts from the story or the characters either. If properly integrated into a world, that feels lived in, a world that lived with the magic, it rather increases the authenticity for me.

It's like a second set of laws, besides physics, gravity and time. Sort of like a heightened, more interesting reality.

I felt Vin for example had a fantastic character development, unconnected to the magic, from a traumatised street urchin to a badass, confident woman, who still had fears and insecurities.

********* I think we're in agreement here. I am not claiming that hard magic systems or physics are "solved", but they are closer then something like the magic in LotR. While we cannot explain everything (and probably never will), there is a lot we can. I'd wager most hard magic doesn't even try to fix all the rules on how it works. It just gives us a bit more meat so to speak, so I don't have to ask myself why you simply cannot wave your hand and someone drops dead, thereby destroying any sense of stakes and conflict.

There is a reason Sanderson divided the Mistborn series into multiple eras. That way he can explore more unknown facets of Allomancy. That sense of discovery is what lead me to the physics comparison. Allusion is absolutely necessary for worldbuilding, otherwise it would bog a story down, but harder magic systems Imo tend to take a closer look without losing that sense of wonder.

Soft/hard magic isn't binary. It is a scale and I just happen to prefer something closer to one side.

I'm all for stories with a rich female cast but that doesn't mean they have to appear in every story, or that you can't write stories which focus on a male cast. It's completely legitimate to tell a story where all the main characters happen to be of a single sex, whether male or female.

  Sounds like the author really hated (strong) female characters and really liked powerful male characters.
#+end_quote

That's what I said. You seem to have a problem with that statement. To elaborate: If an author has a certain bias - like the authors who really like "hard men making hard decisions" - then that can and often does shine through in their work. And not everyone likes every bias, so it's often helpful to know about a bias before you start reading a story. Especially if you dislike a certain bias.

And since the review touched on that, I commented on it.

***** And how does that lead to concluding that the author hates women? It seems like a ridiculous leap. I could say that by making Hermione the star of every one of your fics, you must be weirdly obssessed with a fictional character.

Are you weirdly obssessed with a ficional character? No? Well, there's about as much merit in my "conclusion" as there was in yours.

****** I said the author hated /strong female characters/, not /women/. Please do not put words into my mouth.

And if you're writing fanfiction for a setting where men and women are equal - something often touted as a quality of Harry Potter - then writing a story where female characters do not seem to play a major role and are damsels in distress or wrecked, as the review mentioned, then that does point at a certain bias.

******** That'd be weird since I'm active in other fandoms as well, but well, you're free to think what you want.

I do have a clear preference for stories with strong female characters, though, in any fandom. Fortunately, fandoms without strong female characters are pretty rare these days.

**** I certainly didn't intend for what I posted to be construed as misogyny - if I believed it was I would have called it out as such. I wish Hermione and Annie had more to do in the story, but I don't consider the fic misogynistic any more than I would consider Sailor Moon to be misandrist.

And I do also think that Annie will have a significant role to play in the final arc, and hopefully she'll even get a bit more character development, but what I put in my review was only based on what has been written up to this point.

**** I was commenting on the review, stating what impression I got from it. That's not grapsing at straws or whatever - that's just saying "Hey, the review said there's no strong female character in it, and cited Annie and Hermione as examples, so that looks like bias."

And so far, none of the author's post have convinced me that this isn't the case. Now, having a dislike for certain characters, or strong female characters in general doesn't make you a misogynist. But it's usually an indication for at least internalised misogyny or sexism - "girls shouldn't be action heroes" or, in this case, "smart girls shouldn't usurp the protagonist role in action stories".

***** Oh my. I'm afraid you misunderstood, or to use your own phrase, "put words into my mouth". I don't enjoy reading Hermione-center stories for the same reason I don't enjoy Ron-center or Snape-center stories where they take on some of Harry's agency; and it has nothing to do with their gender and much to do with their character traits. And the simple fact Harry's my favourite. I wouldn't say these reading preferences (and their reflection in my own writing) are an indication for misogyny or misandry, either.

***** Anyway, I'm aware of the current gender disbalance Draquila has pointed out when it comes to the main characters. But it's pointless to argue the reasons behind that ratio or its gravity unless we all have the same facts, i.e. read the whole story.

Thanks, everyone, for arguing my case, I limit my screen time and I'm not always able to swiftly reply.

*** The author's a girl. I don't know if that changes anything but I'd say I enjoy strong female characters I fancy relating to when I read and write, as much as male ones.

I admit I'm not a big fan of the trope where Hermione usurps the protagonist role, especially in an action fic. If my story now gives the impression that I overdid it with pushing her into the background, it's only my damn fault that I haven't finished the whole story yet and told you the rest.
