I prefer longer fics over shorter ones, but I'm not picky. They DO need to be complete (or close to completion and not likely to be abandoned). I'm a huge fan of kink, but not necessary.

I've been out of the community for a few years, but prior to that I was a huge reader and beta so I've read a lot of the classics, but let's post 'em anyways to have a nice complete list!

To give you an example of one of my favourite little series, I love the Mudhoney series by Calanthe (which of course I can't find working links to anymore).


** Calanthe is one of my favorite authors. [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3598][Big Dick Come Quick]] is amazing as it also hits upon my love for a very powerful Harry and [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=6725][Potter Sucks Cocks for Chocolate Frogs]], even though it's unfinished, made me nearly die of laughter.

I don't think I've read much recent fic that I've really loved, and though it's likely you've already read it, [[http://hp-kinkathon.livejournal.com/11064.html][Excerpts from On the Plethora of Uses for Zingiber officinale by S. Snape, PM; with notations by D. Malfoy, App.]] has an extraordinary amount of kink in it.

*** Turns out I've read all of these (I'm horrible at remembering titles, but great at remembering plots). I've just thoroughly enjoyed them all again. Thanks for the reminder of them!

** Bond is really good; very "hot". [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2493456/1/Bond]]

Must Love Quidditch [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4726251/]]

Unthinkable thoughts is good, but it gets a bit mushy. I like that, but I know it's not for everyone. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/448652/1/Unthinkable-Thoughts]]

This is my all time favorite. It's a series starting first year and going up. Harry is in Slytherin, has a twin etc. etc. it's probably the best written fan fic out there in my opinion. Now that being said nothing gets "hot" until later books, but I love how it builds the relationship between Harry and Draco. Harry in this series was made to be a child soldier to protect his bother who everyone thinks is the boy who lived and Draco helps him get past being a robot perfect soldier. Sanpe becomes a father figure as well and I loved their relationship in this. The first book is Saving Connor, it can be a bit slow, but I'm telling you keep reading and the later books (especially after 4) will blow your mind.

*** ooOoh these all sound amazing and I don't think I've read any of them. I'm OK with slow and investing some time in a fic as long as there's payoff :D

**** Major pay off. I like the lightning on Wave series more than the actual Harry Potter books, I realize that is like blasphemy, but it's how I feel. You must must must keep me updated with how you like that series! I've read more than the ones I listed, but these are my favorite.

** The following recs are fics that have not been written recently, but they're some of my favorites. These fics are not as raunchy as the Mudhoney series, but I think all of them have good sex scenes. As for not being able to find links to the Mudhoney series, I think the author look them all down. :(

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=719&warning=4][The Boy Who Lived a Bit by Barbarella]] - HP/SS non-canon compliant. After graduating from Hogwarts, Harry is holed up at 12 Grimmauld with Lupin as his protector. Snape provides distractions. 21 chapters with 2 sequels.

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=3019][Escaping the Paradox by Meri]] - HP/SS - non-canon compliant, an adult Harry travels back to 1971.

[[http://hd-holidays.livejournal.com/10970.html][Boxing Day]] - HP/SS/DM - Severus learns that Harry and Draco have an intriguing Boxing Day tradition. Very sexy.

[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=11874][An Eye for an Eye]] - Eventual HP/DM/SS, non-canon compliant obvs- Draco calls in a life debt that Harry owes him; Draco needs potions ingredients for a potion Snape needs. This shows good development from barely getting along to a functional threesome.

Just found this gem - [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3598][Big dick, come quick by Calanthe]] - I'm sure if you're read Mudhoney, you've probably already read this - just posting this in case you're having difficulty finding any of Calanthe's stories. This is HP/DM - Draco's obsessed with big dicks.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/221208][The Silent World Within You]] - HP/DM - Harry only wanted Draco for one night; it wasn't meant to be anything more.
