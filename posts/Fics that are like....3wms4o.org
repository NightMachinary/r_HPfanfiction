I'm looking for fanfics that are similar to; Runic Animagi and lucky Harry. If possible no H/G or H/Hr


** Runic Animagi: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][Runemaster]] has a similar feel concerning the runes.

Lucky Harry: Sorry about this, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]] has a similar feel, it's Hermione/harry/theo, as odd as it sounds, but it works for the fic, and it's hardly a really cannon Hermione so it may be acceptable for you.
