I recently completed the series for the first time back in May and would like to start looking into fanfic. Malfoy is one of the most interesting characters to me and I would like to read a story in which he is the main character. I've tried browsing the web and haven't really come across anything I like or which I feel portrays him accurately, so I was wondering if someone here could give me a recommendation and/or point me in the right direction. I would prefer something that takes place during or shortly after canon. I don't mind romance but only if it makes sense within the realm of his character.


** Here's a story where, shortly after the battle of Hogwarts, Draco leaves his home, trying to figure out who he is. This is fantastically-introspective and well written. Delves deep into his character. No romance, just Draco. I loved it.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** The only Malfoy fanfics I know are Draco/Hermione because I'm a big fan of that pairing. A great one is The Fallout (not sure how to link fan fictions, sorry) but it should be easy to find - it's usually in Dramione fans' top 10 list! It's novel length and a dark war fic so you're in for a commitment, but I find the characters are excellent and believable.

** linkffn(The Malfoy Case) This is a Malfoy/Astoria fic that focuses on his his trial after the war. Romance is not the focus although Astoria does play his lawyer so she has major part in this story. The author seems to have a lot of knowledge of the judicial system and court cases. I can't say for sure since I know nothing about the courts or trials, but it read like a real trial which I found quite interesting.

  The trials for suspected Death Eaters involved in the Wizarding Wars have begun, and Draco Malfoy finds himself trying to hold together what is left of his family and his fortune, while struggling to escape the looming, almost inevitable future of a lifetime spent in Azkaban. But there is one person who might not have given up completely.

**** I don't think she is lawyer in canon, it's never stated what she does or how she met Draco. One of the theories is that it may have been an arranged marriage by their parents, but it's not clear. Her actual backstory from what I know is that she marries Draco, has a child with him (Scorpios), then tragically dies sometime later so Draco has to raise his son alone.

** I'm a Dramione fan also and recommend linkffn(Rebuilding by Colubrina) and linkffn(And We All Fall Down by Rumaan)

There's a popular non-Dramione Draco-centric fic that I haven't read yet that I know a lot of people tend to like but for the life of me I can't remember the name, I think it's Draco/MuggleOC

  A man appears at the gates of Malfoy Manor. Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either. Honestly, they're supposed to be on the other side in all this business. But it cannot be denied that they're very efficient, especially given their quest is relegated to Narcissa's free time and Draco is relegated to a guest wing bedroom so his father and younger self don't interfere. Nor can it be denied that if the Dark Lord isn't going to show them loyalty and victory, then... well... Family First, after all.
