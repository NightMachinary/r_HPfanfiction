I don't think this is actually a good pairing (for a pretty obvious reason) but I'd love to see if anyone's ever thought of this before and tried to write it. Again, I don't think this is actually a good pairing, but a bad pairing doesn't stop people. Does anyone know of any fics that pair Marietta and Hermione?


** There's a finnish fic on ao3, but it looks like it's smut. This pairing /could/ be an interesting rare pair fic or drabble if done well.

*** 2 questions:

1. Can I see the link anyway?

2. How reliable is google translate from Finnish to English?

Edit: I was able to find it, and gender pronouns are pretty consistently mistranslated from Finnish to English. Even ignoring the translation errors, it's pretty boring, even for smut.

*** The girl who betrayed the DA. As a result, Hermione used a jinx on the parchment they all signed at the start of the DA and put the word SNEAK on Marietta's face in pimples.
