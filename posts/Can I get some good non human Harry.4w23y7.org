And not something "half assed", like half Veela Harry (somehow), but one when he constantly or at lest most of the time looks and thinks/acts like not human. Something in line with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8106168/1/Weres-Harry][Weres Harry?]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/Enter-the-Dragon][Enter The Dragon]].

And please, NO evil!Harry, and NOT slash. Thank you.

*** I'm almost half way through. It's really good. Pity only that his external transformation ended up (so far) only on eyes.

*** Ok, finished. I wish their went a bit further; horns, claws, maybe tails; but it still was an awesome story. Thanks for this recommendation.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10084910/1/Incubus][Harry the Incubus]]. The premise is that Harry has become an "incubus", meaning he has to shag at least one girl a day, otherwise he loses his magic. However his "incubus instincts" let him know exactly how to turn on women. Harry/Gabrielle

It's non-human Harry. Is it "good" non-human Harry? You decide. It is kinda funny in the "so bad it's funny" kinda way.

*** Not sure if want. I was hoping rather for a "story" story, not shag-a-thon. Thanks anyway.

**** Yeah. It was the only thing that came to mind, unfortunately, and was more of a joke answer.

Best of luck searching though!
