  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** Chilord recently started a fic that looks to be heading straight into that direction with an already batshit Bellatrix. Not too sure about it yet (overpowered Harry through brutal use of basic spells eh...) but might be fun.

*** I've been liking this quite a bit so far simply because Bella's character is captured very well. I absolutely hate it when authors take the 'a marriage contract made her insane' excuse.

It's lazy writing and frankly insulting to even imply that a women couldn't possibly be just an evil sadistic bitch in her own right but absolutely has to be mind controlled to make something like that possible.

*** Unless he expands on it, the story is actually complete. The FF version is the one that's been betad and stuff.

**** That was a very good read. Characterization of Bella is very good. But that version is really in need of a betaing. Hopefully FFN version will be better. Thanks for the link!

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

*** Only picked this one up recently but it's actually pretty good and plays its clich√©s in an ok manner. A bit too super Harry in parts but not too cringy.

**** Yeah, the bit where a short period of training with unspeakables suddenly turns you into top tier badass is a little questionable, but if you can suspend your disbelief for that, the writing is generally good enough to justify reading it, depending on your tastes.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
