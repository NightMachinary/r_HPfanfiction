I'm looking for stories where squibs get revenge on the Wizarding World.


** There was the one where Harry gets a pistol from Vernon and ends up creating a squib regiment to take out all the death eaters and Voldemort with extreme prejudice.

I think it was a Rorshachs Blot fic.

Neville disparagingly refers to himself as "almost a Squib".

There's also Aunt Muriel saying (from her own experience) that the existence of specific Squibs were generally hushed up, that Squibs were shipped off to the Muggle world, that it was kinder than letting them live in the magical world where they would be second-class citizens.

**** I mean, the text treats Filch unkindly because it's from Harry's perspective, and he thinks Filch is an asshole. Is Filch an asshole because he grew up as a second class citizen? Maybe, but I don't think there's sufficient evidence to say one way or the other. I don't talk about any of my cousins, pretty much ever. Weasleys are a big family, I'm sure there are other family members that are never mentioned.

Hagrid I'll give you, it's kinda shitty to use Squib as an insult, yeah. Neville, I don't think so much - I don't think it's unreasonable to think there is a kid who is depressed at how nonathletic he is, and says he's 'almost a cripple.' He's referring to his ability to do magic, a talent in which he is certainly closer to being a Squib than Dumbledore. I don't think it's so insulting that it's something Squibs would seek revenge for.

The second paragraph, though, yeah, that's all pretty shitty.
