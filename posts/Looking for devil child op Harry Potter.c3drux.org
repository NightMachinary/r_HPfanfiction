  When the infant Antichrist is brought to Earth, he is secretly exchanged for another child with no one the wiser. His new parents? James and Lily Potter. The situation doesn't go exactly as Heaven and Hell planned, however...

** Well, to be honest linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) comes instantly to mind regarding this.

Say what you will about this series, but Harry goes around acting like an arrogant ass, has a demon in his mind, heaviliy relies on violence and setting everything on fire (hellfire ran though him is a common refrain for example). Hell, if you want to get down to it, Harry turns into a demon and outright murders the Dursleys in the first chapter and is later hunted down by the Church and holy knights.

*** The Denarian series is an interesting read. It was the one who got me into the Dresden Files tbh. However, it gets cringy through a second read through and the attitude of the MC gets old real quick.

Still an intreseting read though.

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files

  There is a lot more to magic than simply waving a wand and saying a spell, something Harry Potter knows all too well. After all, when a mere mouth full of someone else's blood can drastically alter your life, learning magic's secrets is a must. (Amoral!Monstrous!Ravenclaw!Harry. No bashing, no romance.)
