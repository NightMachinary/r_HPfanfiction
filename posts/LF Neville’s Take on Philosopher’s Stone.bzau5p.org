I am looking for the story “Neville's Take on Philosopher's Stone”. It used to be on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11339343]], but it is not there, and it is neither on [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/]]. I tried also [[https://archive.org/details/Fanfictiondump114]] , but it went blank as well. Does anybody know about other potential FF dumps, where this store could be stored, please?
