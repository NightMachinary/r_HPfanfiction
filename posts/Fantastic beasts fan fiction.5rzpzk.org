This is just a start of the fan fiction.

The first day I went to hogwartz I wasn't welcomed. Why because I am a muggle. Usually only wizards go but I was an exception because I have bonded with fantastic beasts. They protect me from being harmed by magic, especially my little friend who's a mage cancellor. I call him Mag for short. When dumbeldor called for me to go to hogwartz I was glad to go with my friends but when I arrived I had an uneasy feeling. Like everyone was out for me even dumbeldore. He seems nice but always has to announce that I am lower than him and the rest of the school. They just want Mag because of his unique power. I won't let them have him. So it's me an outsider against the school. They spit on me any chance they get. I have only made friends with the animals, the fantastic... no they are not beasts that's to degrading to what they are fantastic animals, fantastic friends.

** You need more creative spelling--since the narrator appears to be speaking to the reader in a conversational tone, rigidly adhering to the tyranny of formal English spelling lends your writing an uncomfortable dissonance between the flow of consciousness of the narrator, and the rigid structure imposed by English when it comes to the written word.

I notice you've already taken some action there--the use of Hogwartz instad of Hogwarts, and the multitude of spellings you use in place of Dumbledore clearly indicate you understand how badly consistent good spelling can ruin a piece, but I think you should go bolder: use chatpeak whenever possible, maybe switch between "was", "waz", and "wuz" in place of "was" alone. Perhaps, you might even want to explore alternate spellings with "fantastic."
