I don't mind bashing that much. No harems though please unless the story is /very/ well-written or has incredibly creative ideas ideas.

It's basically 'Harry travels from a world where literally everyone has betrayed him, to a more normal world, but still thinks everyone is out to get him'.

*** Fair warning though: It's very easy to get tired of this Harry. Yes, he hates everyone but there's literally no character development whatsoever. It is pretty much exactly what you're asking for but it's also the same thing over and over and over again.
