Looking for recommendations. Preferably rated M and cannon or cannon divergent. Some of my favorites have been rebuilding and debt of time. I just finished Blood Traitor and it started out great but the ending was meh. Not picky on pairings but I like when the themes match original. TIA!


** For what it's worth, the flair for this would be "request"

"recommendation" is when you've read a fanfic and want to recommend it.

** Can I point you in the direction of mine? It's a Snape x OC fic (certainly M!), and I do try to be canon-compliant. Hope you enjoy it :)
