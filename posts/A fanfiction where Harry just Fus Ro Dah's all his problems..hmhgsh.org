Fus Ro Dah is a move in Skyrim, became a meme, now I want to see it done in Harry Potter.

Professor Quirrell? FUS RO DAH!

Want to make a dramatic entrance into the great hall? FUS RO DAH!

Dementors? FUS RO DAH!

A Hungarian Horntail? FUS RO DAH!!! Then the dragon is like, "It is the Dragonborn! He must be killed!"


** Soon, the whole Auror Department would be after Harry. Especially after absorbing a dragon's soul!

** Harry Potter at least attempts to be somewhat parallel with reality.\\
A Fus Ro Dah would literally have killed virtually everyone in the arena watching the first task. Not just blown them back, but actually killed them all.

A good reference: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VGDhGsYoSA]]Jake from Vsauce3 did a video about how powerful a Fus Ro Dah is about 7 years ago. Given that magic within the HP universe wouldn't be able to stop most blasting charms without being extremely powerful. Something of this power would destroy likely even Voldemort's shields and kill everyone in a decent radius.

I do understand what you are asking, but this would be taking the who "God-mode Harry" closer to an extreme. I am sure there are fics like that out there, but yeah, they are likely crack fics.
