I don't know if this is allowed, and apologizes if it's not but I would love to recommend a fic by billowsandsmoke. The characterizations of Severus and Luna are well done, I never would have thought of a Severus and Luna friendship story, but it was very believable and it is now my headcanon. It's not perfect, but still it's very good in my opinion. if you haven't read it yet and like Severus or Luna or maybe both I definitely suggest it. (I want more Severus and Luna friendship stories now).

** Agreed. This story is sublime. One of the very best--and a superb characterization of Luna, that adheres to canon rather than turning her into a Seer.

*** Agreed with your agreement, lol. I love Luna, she's one of my favorite characters but she is so difficult to write, and so I'm rather picky on how she is written by authors, but I was pleasantly surprised by how they wrote Luna. People tend to write her too crazy/weird/random, without making much sense, but this way the way she was written in the fic was just so well done and believable. Loved it.

** It's gotten pretty popular around here lately, but It definitely deserves it. I held off reading it when I saw it the first couple times, when I finally got around to reading it I regretted putting it off.

** This has already been recommended [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6h6v00/recommendation_i_know_not_and_i_cannot_knowyet_i/][here]]. But yeah, it's a beautiful story. It reduces me to tears every time.

*** Ah apologies there, didn't realize. But yeah the ending does get me teary eyed.

Even the part where Luna is taken gets me really sad.

(And not a spoiler since it's canon compliant).
