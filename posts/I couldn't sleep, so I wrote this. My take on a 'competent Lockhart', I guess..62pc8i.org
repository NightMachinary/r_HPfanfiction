If Harry thought that Lockhart was different when he walked through the Great Hall, today he wouldn't have even recognized him. Gone was the pompous pretense -- instead, Lockhart looked older and very much more tired.

‘Sit.' Softly ordered professor from his chair behind the ornate table. A series of thuds followed his requests, as the second year students took their places.

‘You already know who I am.' Stated Lockhart in the same voice. ‘If you don't -- it's alright, a short version of my biography is printed at the end of each book. Just enough to give you an idea...' he droned off.

Of course, Hermione took it as an invitation to ask questions. Lockhart looked at her for a second, taking in the silent salute, and then nodded, carefully.

‘Hermione Granger. Professor, I've read all of them already. But can you tell us about our curriculum? As entertaining as your books are, they are hardly suitable for school!' Hermione's face and voice trembled, yet she pressed on. Never before had she been so torn between a rampart at the man's achievements and his absolute disregard to his apparent profession.

‘All of them?' rose an eyebrow Lockhart, with a distinct sense of surprise.

Granger nodded. Lockhart closed his eyes for a moment.

‘Tell me, miss Granger...' he finally said. ‘Do you believe me?'

Hermione nodded once more. Lockhart smiled.

‘So would you believe me if I said that the dragons are susceptible to the noise-powered weapons?'

She nodded.

‘That the direwolves of Siberia have a tendency to mimic sounds not unlike human's speech?'

She nodded.

‘That the dueling shield is a perfect defensive solution in any situation?'

She nodded. But this time it took a second. Lockhart's smile grew as he threw the next one:

‘That the best solution when faced with a multiple fractured bone break is to remove the bone in its entirety?'

Hermione tried to nod, but she couldn't. Instead she just froze, gasping for air. Lockhart went on:

‘And yet you believed that there is an Anti-Lycanthropic Charm. That the hag can be scared off by my words alone. That a troll can be brought down without unrelenting brute force. Or that there is a way to tame a vivern... Don't worry. You are far from being the only one.'

The class was silent. Gryffindors and Ravenclaws alike listened with their mouths agape, as Hermione was going through an existential conflict.

‘Are they... all lies?' finally whispered the girl.

‘Lies...' answered Lockhart. 'No. Far from it. They are truth -- from a certain point of view. But most of all, Ms. Granger, they are stories.'

Lockhart slowly rose from the table and walked a bit closer to the class.

‘When I first submitted a manuscript of ‘Wandering with Werevolves' -- the first of my books, even if it was released much later -- my editor sent it back. He said it was too dark. He said he could not sleep after reading it. Surely enough, I told the old chap to shove it.'

Ron chuckled and Harry found himself smiling too.

‘But then he told me that it wasn't what people needed.' Went on Lockhart. ‘That my story -- which would be riding on the back of an international incident -- would only provide more fear and needless pain. That in the days after the War people looked for inspiration -- not a horror. And so the cannibalistic monster became a tragic character, and a duel to the death on the peak of Hoverla -- a wacky chase in order for me to apply the Anti-Lycanthropic Charm. And the experienced, careful hunter -- a dashing scallywag adventurer. And then I found out that I actually enjoy being that version of me.'

‘Then why did you make us buy your books!?' asked with a justified rage some Ravenclaw girl Harry barely knew.

‘You mean beside the royalty check?' Lockhart rose his eyebrow again.

For a second the girl just fumed. And then Lockhart laughed -- warmly, softly and kindly.

‘I am sorry, miss...'

‘Chang,' uncertainly said the girl.

‘I am sorry, miss Chang.' Disarmingly smiled Lockhart. ‘I just could not resist.'

He cleared his throat and bit his lip for a second.

‘I took this position as a chance to redeem myself. A chance to teach the wizarding world about creatures I have had so grossly misinformed it about. Except, the Ministry refused to approve the books I have selected. And then refused to let me teach without the books. So in a moment of desperate brilliance I wrote an old fan up there and asked her if it would be alright for me to reenact my stories with my students. She said it would be fine, as long as the material is in the approved books. One very expensive box of chocolates and a flattering letter later, she approved them. Of course, I am going to add a little artistic touch to these reproductions... dial some things back, I might say.'

Chang's eyes widened comically. ‘So you are...'

‘Yes, miss Chang.' Lockhart's smile grew mischievous. ‘I am going to teach you the Defense Against the Dark Arts, on the examples and experiences of yours truly. Also, I am opening a Drama Club, but more on that later. Now...' he clapped his hands and looked around the classroom. ‘Now, it is time for my theatrical debut. And that means we need a troll. Any volunteers?'


** I like tired, world weary Lockhart. If only more stories took the point of divergence as him being what he claimed to be.

** I've always wanted canon Lockhart, just a wee bit smarter about it. Like instead of being completely incapable of spells (and making them up? Peskipiksi Pesternomi is hilarious..but why try something obviously that fake?), he just goes through them deliberately and slowly "to show the children how it is cast." When its the only way he can cast those more difficult spells.

I just want a charlatan who is incompetent at magic but extremely competent at faking it.
