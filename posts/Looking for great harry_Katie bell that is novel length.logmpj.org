I read a lot of haphne because I love that pairing, but every once in a while I try searching for a harry Katie bell fic that is novel length and can never find any

I did find one that harry dated Katie for a little while but they broke up and harry started dating fleur.

Anyone know of a good novel length fic where Katie bell is the only ship harry is in?

Not direct linking as there's sexual content as per subreddit rules.

** If you're willing to read a very old story (pre-HBP), there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2090945/1/Year-Six][this one]] and the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2283150/1/Year-Seven-Harry-Potter-The-Blood-Debt][sequel]].

That's what got me into Harry/Katie way back when. I haven't found anything else lol.

Edit: the sequel seems to be missing the epilogue, but it's posted on other fanfiction websites so you could just search it.

*** It went complete last month, FYI.

I agree with TE7's own assessment that tying things up in Ch. 3 would have been preferable to going off the rails as it did in the end.
