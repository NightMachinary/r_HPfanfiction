- Hermione Granger was a pissed off witch. Sure, Crookshanks was getting a little big, and his hairballs were annoying her roommates... but if she had to wipe off another "Granger has a huge, hairy pussy" sign, she'd end up killing someone. Crookshanks wasn't huge!

- Harry Potter was confused. Ever since he was made Quiddtch captain he found himself surrounded by girls. Many girls. and some odd boys too. Most of them had no idea about Quidditch! So... why were they offering him to help him play with his balls? He didn't even had a ball set!

- Ron Weasley was scared. Sure, as a ginger he had heard the rumours, but he knew it was just a joke. Of course he has a soul! ...right? but some girls must be half-dementors. They keep saying they will suck off his soul. He has no idea how though.

- Something something Draco?

--------------

A lack of sex-ed makes the Golden Trio confused and adorably/hilariously innocent. Hilarity ensues.

If there are any fics like that, it'd be nice. If not, and if this silly little post made you chuckle, feel free to take it.


** On the other end of the sex-ed education spectrum:

"Harry!"

Harry stopped and turned around, eyes narrowing in caution. Harry saw Draco Malfoy furiously running at him, pushing through the crowds in Diagon Alley, with his parents running to catch up.

"I'm in heat and I need to impregnate you, you're my omega!"

"I'm sorry, Malfoy, what?" Harry asked.

"You're my omega, Harry! I figured it out when I was thinking about you last weekend!" Draco replied, smiling.

Harry shuddered as the meaning struck him. "I'm sorry, are you trying to tell me you're attracted to me?"

"It's more than that, obviously," Draco said before he launched into an explanation of Alphas, Betas, and Omegas.

Harry's mouth widened and he began to look around for a way out. Trouble always did seem to find him. He saw Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy catch up with Draco. Harry grew even more confused when he saw them whisper at each other with panicked expressions.

"Lucius, have you been forgetting the silencing charms when we roleplay?"

"Maybe? Why didn't he tell us about it? Does he think we really mean what we act?"

"I think it's worse that that, he's found our roleplaying diaries if his comments on other alphas are any indication."

"Fuck," Lucius summarized succinctly.

"Submit Potter!"

(I originally posted it [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ibd3gj/my_father_will_hear_about_this_draco_malfoy/g1v44ux?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][here]] but I thought it would be a funny counterpart to a Harry that has no sex-ed education.)
