:END:
The gist is Harry getting fed up with Dumbledore/the order's ineffectiveness and secrecy and decides to take initiative. At some point, he assassinates Voldemort while under the invisibility cloak iirc and sets Kreacher/Dobby to stalk Nagini, as the last remaining Horcrux, until she is alone. Dobby kills her and proudly reports to Harry while still waving around the knife he used. I remember towards the end he does offload on the order that he's taken care of everything and that if they have a problem with his methods they can take a hike. I don't think it was particularly long and it was set around 5th year. I can't remember if it was before or after Sirius died.

Actually, it may have been after Sirius died and Harry kept getting fed up with people taking Grimmauld place for granted, acting as if they were entitled to anything in it, and in Mundungus' case stealing from it.

*** Does this also include Harry killing Death Eaters on the way, or are they left untouched/merely "captured"?
