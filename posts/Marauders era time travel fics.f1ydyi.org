Any fanfics where Draco Malfoy travels back to the marauders era?


** As much as I am learning to dislike HBP and thus all good-Draco, good-Snape stories, I would like this one. Draco as the same bigoted idiot coming to the middle of the First Wizarding War and discovering with horror for himself how exactly looked those glorious days of the Voldermort's dominance his father was always reminiscing about.

  They thought after Voldemort's fall that the world would get better. But they were wrong. The Death Eaters are still ruling, using politics instead of hexes. With the dwindling Wizarding population and no one left to fight, they must go back in time to before Voldemort rose to power to fix what broke in the past. Nominated for Best James and Best Peter in the 2018 Marauder Medals!
