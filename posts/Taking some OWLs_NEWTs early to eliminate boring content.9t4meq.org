Hearing about the characters fall asleep in History of Magic, or "Generic Astronomy lesson" or "Generic x lesson without any plot points" could be skipped if you allow some, or at least the main focus characters to take the OWL early, and maybe take the NEWT when they would be doing the OWL instead.

Neville could take Herbology if he had a little more confidence, he could have probably got his NEWT and been working on his Mastery during his Hogwarts years.

Harry could take DADA by the end of fourth year, most likely. Harry already having the DADA OWL (Or NEWT even) could add some tension with Umbridge and make for interesting plot

Hermione could take a few subjects, without becoming Hermy-sue fanfiction Hermione. Muggle Studies (Harry could get the NEWT in that too) History of Magic (Her retentive memory is noted, and it's just regurgitating facts in the exam) Astronomy (Most of the characters could take that by the end of first year if they studied. It mentioned that Lunar Cycles and completing a Star map were most of the exam for OWL)

Snape and Lily could both take Potions early, especially Snape, if you're in a Marauders era, and you could have him act as a TA instead of a student, to get credit towards a Mastery.

Err... Arithmancy... if you have a character that is Aoko Aozaki/Fate Testarossa/Nanoha Takamachi level of maths (Fate tutored a highschool student in maths at 9 years old) you could have them take the OWL/NEWT for that...

There are probably others, but what do you think? Write out a boring part by having your character use the area they excel in, or just the simple areas, to get ahead, and have more time for the fun parts.


** Wouldn't it be simpler to just not write boring scenes? Sure, the characters have to take boring classes, but the reader doesn't have to be taken along for the ride.

**** The question always is what exactly that means.

Take my own story "No Longer Alone" as an example. There is a chapter with two matches of the Quidditch World Cup (1k words each), which, as a couple of reviewers pointed out, is not exactly crucial to the plot. And they are right, it could have been summarised with a paragraph and the overall plot would not have changed.

Yet at the same time, it allows me some world building for Europe (Holstein and Venice have their own teams), it shows another facet of Quidditch at a professional level and magic is shown as more than just Hogwarts. Harry likes Quidditch, he would be interested in seeing at least a few professional games.

Is this strictly necessary for the main plot? No. But it adds life to a world, it shows that not everything revolves around Harry. There is more to life than Hogwarts, the Ministry and Diagon Alley.

*** True, but the possibility is there. I really don't know why Astronomy is a 5 year course when it could be done in 1... or why they do it at midnight when they have spells like the Hogwarts Great Hall ceiling, so I was trying to think of ways to skip classes to add contention and fun.

The only disproportionately advanced magic that he knows is the Patronus Charm. In /GoF/, he's shown struggling with the summoning charm, a Fourth Year spell, when he learns it a few weeks/months before his peers.

He's a good teacher. He's lucky. He can learn when he's really, really motivated (e.g., the Patronus Charm). What he's not is academically advanced.

No he struggles with it in class, so he and Hermione practice it for the task. They cover the spell a week or so before the task.

*** He got a Top grade in his OWLs at least, not knowing much more than he did by the Third Task of the TWT. the DA, at least we didn't see any pure theory studying, just spell practice, so It's not impossible for him to get EE/O at OWL with the bonus from his Corporeal Patronus.

**** But if he sits his Defense OWL early, he doesn't get the extra study from TWT prep and DA sessions.

***** I mentioned after Fourth Year, the DA Sessions, they last a few months and are just "Spells I already know, let's show the class" so he should be fine to take it during the Summer after Fourth year, either before the Dementors, or after the Trial. That way you could have an amusing plot of Harry not being in Umbridge's class, and getting detention for not attending class, when he doesn't take her class, and McGonagall being a "Keep your head down" sort of person, upholding the Detention even if he already has the OWL
