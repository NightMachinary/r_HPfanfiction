I haven't read a really good Teddy Lupin Fic, and I really would want to read one. Also can anyone recommend A good next gen fic, either following Scorpius or Albus?


** linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided) is a great Teddy Lupin fic. It was written by Inverarity, who also wrote the AQ series, so the story's quality is pretty much guaranteed right there :P

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

*** I second this, it's a great fic, lovely characterisations. The only downside is that Inverarity has a really annoying habit of describing EVERYTHING, like exactly how people get dressed down to "then he put his right sock on". I also think some of the kids in this act a bit too old for their ages - they're only 11, I'm not sure so many of them would be flirting and stuff just yet. Maybe one or two. But that's very subjective, so I don't really consider it too much of a problem.

That said, it's such a great and original plot idea, with a really well rounded cast of OCs, who all have distinct personalities. It's something I come back to and read a lot.

**** For Scorpius/Albus, Irradiance by Brief_and_Dreamy is well written and really good but super depressing. Linkao3(115114). IIRC, in this Albus is Scorpius's only friend and Scorpius battles depression. Over time Albus falls in love with him. It is set during hogwarts. This fic is locked so you need to make an Ao3 account to see it if you don't already have one.

I liked Summer Boys a lot too. It's not too plotty, but it's well written and pretty detailed character development IMO. It is set at the Potter's summer house the summer after Scorpius's 7th year. He is invited because he is best friends with a Slytherin Lily and secretly starts to hook up with Albus. Linkao3(4605858).

For Teddy Lupin and Scorpius as friends both in Gryffindor - the author aged up Scorpius a bunch with an interesting plot device - check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4751586/16/Lonely-Moon][Lonely Moon]]. It is actually a very slow build Drarry slash but Teddy and Scorpius are both main characters. linkffn4751586

**** I'm the author of Escapades (thanks for the recommendation!!!!!) and am going to slip in a note that though Escapades is complete, I did discontinue the series. I'm currently working on a fifth-year Teddy Lupin fic though called 'The Lost Children' linkffn(The Lost Children by nymphxdora)

This is a really lovely Teddy-centric oneshot if you'd like something a little shorter: linkffn(Peach Shortcakes and Turquoise Hair by The Lady Arturia)

  Teddy Lupin thought his fifth year at Hogwarts would be just like all the others: full of fun with his friends, work, and perhaps a bit of drama. Then the muggleborns started disappearing, and everything changed. The war might be over, but the darkness remains.

****** To be completely honest, I lost inspiration and passion for it. I felt like every time I sat down to write, it was the same scene over and over -- Teddy, Alfie and Ella talking about Ralph -- and I realised that I didn't really know where I was going and I didn't have enough material to stretch it out over six more stories. There was no coherent direction, and the story that was being written didn't do justice to the characters, nor my original vision for the story.

The idea of TLC was to refocus. It's got (mostly) the same characters (Teddy, Ella, Alfie, Victoire, Daisy, Matilda, Michael, Terence etc.) but is definitely more focused, and I've brought in most of the plotlines that I was really excited to write in Skeletons and the rest of the Escapades series. I feel like it's got more of a plot, more direction and the way it's written gives me a lot more room to explore the characters. A lot of people who enjoyed Escapades are giving me good feedback on it so far, so hopefully it's working haha!
