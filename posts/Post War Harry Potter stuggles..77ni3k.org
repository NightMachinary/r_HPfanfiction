I once read a fic that focused on Harry coming back for his seventh year and brought Teddy with him. It was Harry/Daphne and they slowly get together and I believe it culminates in Teddy calling her mommy at one point. So kind of search for that fic but also more fics like that. Immediate post war "angst"? I really am not aware of angst definition so maybe not that. Point is: immediate post war, don't care whether canon compliant or not, Harry struggles a bit, and taking care of Teddy or some focus of being his godfather.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
