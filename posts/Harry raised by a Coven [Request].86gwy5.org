Aside from Reclamation of Black Magic, I can't find any stories where Harry is raised by a coven of witches. And sadly, as good as that story is, it updates too slowly and skipped a lot of the actual parenting Harry got. And besides, honestly, Sirius taking the man parenting duties is lame compared to being raised by 13 witches of the Black family.

While rereading it is still quite fun, it'd be cool to see someone give that premise of go. Also yes I am kind of repeating a thread I did recently, but the few suggestions I got didn't even link stories with witch covens at all. :(


** Can you link your story? This is a super cool concept to me!
