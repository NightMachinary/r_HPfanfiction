Hello!

I am yet to publish - working on something I want to get just right before putting it on stage. However, I am curious as to whether there is an established community of fan-art drawers who go about visualizing and drawing art for fan fiction? My fiction is mostly OC with some appearances from canon characters. Any art based on it would require a lot of imaginative interpretation as there are no style models to work from; no illustrations or movies or other material from the canon for most of the characters.

Do people do this in significant numbers? Are there pairings between authors and artists? What are your thoughts?

Thanks!


** I have no idea whether or how things are set up between authors and artists, but I have seen many drawings done for fanfictions, often posted on deviantart, which is then linked by the author. It usually appears to be a surprise to the author (i.e. they did not request the art), but surely somewhere out there there must be a place where you could ask an artist to give it a shot. Or maybe you could just mention it in the notes at the top of your fiction, that you would love to see any interpretations that people have.

** The best, because safest, way is to just comission some artist to do it. A colored portrait of your character is often around 40$. You can find artists who're open for comissions at deviantArt

Another possibility would be to go to [[/r/characterdrawing]] and request help.

** I have OCs too. What happened for me was I just updated my chapters got a following and then one day someone asked me if they could make fan art for me.

** I wanted a character done for a non-Harry Potter story I was working on so I commissioned an artist off of deviantart. I paid $300, but that's probably a bit high because I wanted it colored, with a background, and in a realistic art style.

** Not so much a community, as a scattering here and there.

** I know a few artists that illustrate scenes from their favorite fanfictions, but that's on their own time/own desires.

** Just kind of look around on DeviantArt. There are more than a few groups that support OCxCanon and usually the members wouldn't mind drawing stuff from your series. But by the by, it's usually fans of the work that draw the scenes without being asked by the artist. It's best to just wait for the fans to come. Or you can hold a contest after you publish and ask fans to 'draw their favorite scene' or some such.

** about +/- 15 years ago (Merlin's beard, I'm getting old!!), an artist surprised me with a couple of very nice drawings of a HP ff that I was writting at the time; I didn't ask for it, but the guy really like my story and he decided to presente me with his art. Later we became friends, and I gave him my address and he sent me the drawings by post - and I still treasure them!

I don't know if there is such a thing as a deal between ff authors and fan artists. I wouldn't know where to look for one... even this old friend of mine, I would never ask him to draw something for another story of mine, as I would feel bad - like I'm exploring him for getting a free drawing. Especially because he does drawing for living nowadays...
