Runes seem to change a lot in different fics from a lost language to the base of all magic. I've always thought of them like a permanent chant for rituals. By writting it in ruins the chant repeats without fail and doesn't rely on you to remember it and repeat it if you end up in pain or unconcious. Runes on an enchanted object only help to keep the charms permanent. What are other thoughts on how they should work?

** Canonically, Runes are just a language using Elder and Younger Futhark taught at Hogwarts. Its the equivalent of teaching Latin or Greek at many boarding schools in Europe in the last couple centuries. It doesn't possess any magical principles or abilities.

Besides, the problem with Runes in most fanfiction is that to try and make them more useful the authors tend to weaken or diminish normal magic (i.e. wand magic, wandless magic, potions, etc.). This almost always goes hand-in-hand with everyone being implied (explicitly or otherwise) as dumb or foolish for not learning them, or is a way to make X-character look smarter/competent/awesome than everyone else. Not always mind you, but its more common than not. You can mostly blame jbern for that one, but its hard to when his fics are admittedly pretty entertaining if dated.

** I like it when they serve an actual purpose.

My headcanon has always been that Runes and Arithmancy are basically "advanced magical theory", and that they have uses in most areas of magic. For instance, stirring a potion in a runic shape, or perhaps a runic sentence, has predictable effects. The pattern and number of stirs can be discovered using arithmancy and perhaps a splash of astronomy should the potion require it (wolfsbane, for instance, or Veritaserum, which is said to require a full lunar cycle)

Additionally, I like to believe that runes can basically anchor a charm to an item, by perhaps inscribing the incantation, or a sentence describing the effect, with the alphabet used depending on the items cultural origin (so a vyking-inspired enchanted axe would need futhark, while an enchanted khopesh would need ancient egyptian hieroglyphs.) the difficult part is discovering the best alphabet for the item used - you have to research a ton to get the best result, by for example respecting the details unique to the hieroglyphs and grammar used in egypt when that particular khopesh design was invented.

Arithmancy is numerology, and it can be used to accurately predict the future - that means it can be used to basically "discover" the incantation of a spell. You input your spell, all its details broken down of course, into a complex formula. The unknown details are substituted with variables, and then tweaked until the calculation says it will work. These formulas are ridiculously complex, and jealously guarded by the families of spellcrafters, creating a sort of artificial scarcity because people are greedy. This difference in approaches also explains why there are definite "trends" in the incantations we see. (Stupefy, for example, is just a word in english, same as Pack. Legilimens, Locomotor Mortis and so on are faux latin, while Alohomora is another language all together.)

** Old languages. Don't need to be anything else. If they're even half as magical as they appear in some fics then they would be compulsory rather than an optional course. The language works with what we see in canon in the seventh book, it works with Bill's job because finding tombs and finding any references to their protections would be vital.

Arithmancy just works as a predictive risk assessment all Gringotts employees have to complete before any project gets approval.

*** Not necessarily. Runes being complex/annoying, and less convenient than wand magic, could still have them be magical without everyone having (or wanting) to take them.

It's like how potions seems to be, in the books, almost entirely just following the directions - vs designing/experimenting with new ones. Runic magic to me seems like it'd need more time to use than wand magic, and is probably more inflexible - so in day to day life, just having a wand is more than enough.

But you're right about canon - it doesn't appear to be too much more than a latin/greek analogue for the WW, even if I find that rather boring.

I disagree. Given how most of the hogwarts curriculum seems geared towards using magic instead of understanding magic, I can easily see it being left as an elective for those who want to enter the creator class.

First year textbook is Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling. They frequently spend time writing essays. Theory is boring and we only see what we need to see. There are plenty of hints that they study the understanding it's just not explict because it would detract from the story.

**** We know from the polyjuice in second year, the existence of werewolves etc that Astronomy does affect multiple branches of magic. Potion, Herbology, Defence against the dark arts, divination all feature Astronomy to some extent and we don't see much of what else they study.

** My headcanon has always been that Runes are for long-term enchantments. For example, the curses in the Egyptian Pyramids wouldn't just be caused by a spell, but via engraving Runes into parts of the tombs and casting curses into the Runes, so that they activate when triggered. Or the cursed necklace we see in CoS and HBP would have needed to be cursed the same way rather than someone just casting a curse on it.

Canonically, however, it's more likely that standard curses and charms are used to enchant places and objects, and Ancient Runes is just a language class. Like how Arithmancy is just Divination using math and not spell creation or anything like that.

** In canon, they just seem to be an old written language - kinda like Latin or Greek electives you could take in secondary school. In the same way, Arithmancy seems to be math + divination. But that characterization is a bit odd (eg, if it is just learning the names of the old norse runes, then the professor is garbage). Then again, the pensieve /does/ have runes around its outside, and runes are associated with magic.

However, both of those are boring IMO. I think the fanon of runes being a way to 'write' magic, or help anchor enchantments in, opens it up to a lot of interesting aspects. Runic magic could be less flexible (due to having to work within the runes), slower, but last longer - and perhaps allow for more complex enchantments by taking a long time and carefully layering on runes. It could also act more like an anchor sometimes - helping to keep an enchantment stable and connected to the item it's meant to, or anchoring wards, etc.

For the background of the runes, I like the idea of them having just emerged more from repeated use/belief - eg, ancient Norse runes would have gained their associations through having been used for centuries as magic, kinda like how I imagine a lot of the latin phrases for spells end up historically out. Another interesting approach there would be to tie it into astronomy - maybe adding in a veneer of runes being derived from constellations and thus conduits for magic somehow?

In any case, I find it being a branch of magic far more interesting than just a language - but it shouldn't be the foundation/base of all magic, and it should have disadvantages compared to wand magic.

** I think of them not as a basis of all magic, but as a different means of expressing or performing magic. Just like potions are a different means from wanded magic. Invented by different sets of wizards, in different eras, for different needs.

*** My preference. I think that Runes were invented by Germanic wizards in a pre Roman era and spread through germanic and nordic areas. When Roman conquerors took most of Europe they supplanted Runic magic with wand and incantation magic. Only nordic countries maintained the runes as the basis of their magic.

British use of runes is like a novelty. They were introduced/reintroduced by the Vikings, though British wizards having been heavily Romanticized by this point don't consider them essential. Runes are powerful enough to be a foundational magic system for enchanting, warding, and foretelling the future, but Hogwarts and other Roman based magical countries don't fully see that.

** Ive always thought of them like the written forms of incantations. You say the incantion and add magic, stuff happens. You write the incantation and add magic, stuff happens. The benefit of runes being that the "incantation" is permentantly being said sonlong as the rune remains intact allowing you to make magic that sticks around for a long time, possible even forever.
