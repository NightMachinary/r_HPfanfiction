** First, have you explored [Walking the Plank]([[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/][www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/]])? It's an older, clunkier site, but it's where most of the classics are housed. Next, AO3 is much more likely to have Snarry slash fic, since it's actually slash friendly (and FF.net, not so much). [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Btitle%5D=&work_search%5Bcreator%5D=&work_search%5Brevised_at%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&work_search%5Bsingle_chapter%5D=0&work_search%5Bword_count%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bfandom_names%5D=&work_search%5Brating_ids%5D=&work_search%5Bcharacter_names%5D=&work_search%5Brelationship_names%5D=Harry+Potter%2FSeverus+Snape&work_search%5Bfreeform_names%5D=&work_search%5Bhits%5D=&work_search%5Bkudos_count%5D=&work_search%5Bcomments_count%5D=&work_search%5Bbookmarks_count%5D=&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=created_at&work_search%5Bsort_direction%5D=&commit=Search][Snarry]]

This is a crazy long link and I don't know what Reddit will do to it, but it's Snarry sorted in date order. Third, the LJ (livejournal) community Snape-Potter is still active and holds fests several times a year. The master list of master lists is here. [[http://snape-potter.livejournal.com/2631782.html][Master-list]]. A lot of these fics are locked to users, but many of them are cross-posted to AO3, so if you find a summary that intrigues, search for it there.

Finally, here's my (ever-present) list of recommendations.

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, Severus Snape shared a kiss with Harry Potter. Then Harry had disappeared after killing the Dark Lord, leaving Severus the reluctant darling of the Wizarding world. When Dumbledore insists on throwing a ball in Severus's honour, Severus is convinced the world has gone completely mad. But when he comes across an ashy-faced young man whose half-answers about his identity haunt his every thought, Severus realizes that a ball might be the least of his worries.

** Talk of Snarry and not recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3484954/1/The-Marriage-Stone][The Marriage Stone]]?

Otherwise I recommend works by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/tiranog/pseuds/tiranog/works?fandom_id=136512][Tira Nog]] on Ao3

** I haven't read it in over ten years, so I'm not sure how it holds up, but my old favourite used to be the [[http://www.noiresensus.com/authors/a_sushi.html][Civil War series]], by Sushi. It was written in 2002, so obviously AU for the last few books. It is long as heck. There's like ten stories in the series, and a couple of them are quite long.

Unfortunately I remember very little about it, except that it's long, and that I loved it as a teenager.

Also, in case you hadn't already, try heading over to [[/r/HPSlashFic]]. It's a good little community over there, they can hook you up.
