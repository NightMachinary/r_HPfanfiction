** Like magical gender swap? (Continual drinking of poly juice potion, maybe a spell?)

Or like regular transgender

** Jeez now I'm going to be thinking about this all night. How would that even work? What about Voldemort? What about summers and holidays? What if it happened completely involuntarily, like how someone mentioned freaky friday, and they try living as each other and attempting to find a way to switch back, only as much as they miss being themselves, they also really... don't. Maybe one of them knew from the start while the other stumbles into it along the way, confused at how being in someone else's body could feel equal parts wrong, and yet right.

I kinda feel like they should return to their own bodies and their own lives, but after, they'd able to transition and be themselves, wholly.
