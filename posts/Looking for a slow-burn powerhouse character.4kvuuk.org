e.g. Harry (or any character really) becoming slowly more and more magically powerful until they are Dumbledore-tier.

*** Good rec, though it should be noted that it's a WIP, so protag's not Dumbledore-tier yet.

**** As spoken by the writer, [[/u/Lane_Anasazi]] somewhere in this place, it is still being worked on. He just recently updated his profile, with one of (the only?) change(s) being the moving of the chapter by chapter summary to a google doc which contains the chapter title for the next portion.

***** Thank you. I tried searching for this but a ton of stories were named Taking Control. I was lazy and didn't want to read them all. :)

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
