*** As someone who has written the most generic 4th year Harry/Fleur fic in existence, I agree. The same thing can also be said about the Harry/Daphne section. All the fics are pretty much identical and interchangable, and some of the authors literally are "if you've read one one, you've read them all" type of people.

*** Are you sure it's that one? It doesn't seem that boring and forgettable to me, it's only got three or four cliches that I can think of (Harry has secret awesome magical power under a block (despite that, the fic's usual-bash-free), someone goes back in time, Draco is turned good, etc).

**** I actually forgot the title and a lot of the content and had to look it up. Harry is no fun at all. Snape is an angst machine. His mischievous edge is completely gone, all he seems to care about is his healing. [[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BXXujr_CYAA2Jz4.png]]

That is what I felt like reading it.

Fics with tons of cliches like Harry Crow aren't forgettable, they are awful and it sticks in your head. I can't forget it, even though I only read a couple of chapters past the sorting.

**** I agree with it being boring. I usually love Snape fics but I quit that one fairly early. Granted I did not read a whole lot of it, but in it Snape seemed to be way too nice, with no cynism, hate and sarcasm and darkness that makes his character interesting. Harry also seemed out of character with none of his usual come backs, sass and independent streak that he has in Canon. The tone of the writing was also just kind of flat. I would have loved to read about Snape's thoughts about going back in time, but the majority of the beginning of the fic was just description after description of Snape being nice to everyone.

***** So, basically you don't like it because the characters bear little to no resemblance to canon and there's also not enough monologuing. Fair enough.
