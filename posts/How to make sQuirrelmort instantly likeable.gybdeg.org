In one sentence:

"The trio entered the room in the forbidden corridor, only to find Fluffy already asleep, and a harp near the side of the room playing...

Nothing else matters."

Kind of like in this video [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PhyXQ8lE5E][metallica's nothing else matter - harp solo play]].

How in your opinion would that change the story / the charcter of voldemort / prof. sQuirrel.


** I don't think it would change literally anything.

** I mean, when Harry brutally murders him, perhaps the school would be a little more distress over the loss of their beloved teachers.

However, he does still have Voldy on the back of his head.

*** Harry didn't murder him. You been watching just the movies?

**** No, I read all the books several times over. Albeit when I was a child, so a little under a decade ago.He burns the man to a crisp, this is what Dumbledore says when Harry wakes up."No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. *He left Quirrell to die*; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. "

I guess, if you really wanted to optimistic, you could assume that while Voldy left him to die, Dumbledore saved him. But honestly I didn't think into that much depth on that one. I have always assumed that was to be taken directly: Quirrell died.

Edit: perhaps murder is the wrong way to put it. Accidental killing? Manslaughter? Either way, he burned his face off.

***** Sure he died. But it wasn't because Harry gave him blisters. It was because possession is bad for your health - thus the earlier drinking of unicorn blood - and once getting the Stone failed, Tom gave up on him and left him to the natural consequences.

****** "possession is bad for your health"\\
I think I shall have to remember that quote for any future use.

I think I'll just have to beg to differ. Yes, Quirell was dying, but Harry pulled the plug on his life. If you shoot a man with a stab wound, surely its still murder.

******* If he's bleeding out from the (self-inflicted) stab wound, but still trying to kill you, and you hit him with pepper spray (which is about the level of force Harry used), and that stops him from reaching medical attention - no, that's not murder at all. Not only is it self-defence, it's an extremely reasonable and restrained case of it.

******** In reference to comment 3 (??) I did concede that you could call it accidental killing instead. However, my original comment did not need the specific word 'murder' to make sense. It was more about the nonchalant manner the wizarding world reacts to the death of a teacher.

If I am entirely honest, I mainly debated with you because I was unjustly offended with the assumption that I had not read the book haha

***** It's not murder when the other person is trying to kill you. Harry had no intent to kill him, just stop him, but he did deliberately go on the offensive when he realized that Quirrell got burned from touching him.

I think the worst he could get charged with (in the US at least) is Wrongful Death, which is when your actions cause somebody to die who shouldn't have. (Even in self-defense, you are legally obligated to just leave if your attacker stops attacking you.)

Note: IANAL; do not take this as legal advice.
