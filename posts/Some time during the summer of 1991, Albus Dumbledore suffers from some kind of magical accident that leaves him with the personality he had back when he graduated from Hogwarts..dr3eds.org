*** Personally I see it as less fanon's "Greater Good" and more the Tau's "Greater Good" that young Albus would've ascribed to. Then combine that with the kind of arrogance a young magical prodigy would undoubtedly develop.

**** Without Grindelwald I don't think he'd give a shit about the "Greater Good". What this story would have to do would be to look around and find another handsome, talented man for Dumbledore to fall in love with. Then, whatever that man wanted to do Albus would put his brilliant, easily-influenced mind into justifying it and working towards it.

***** If this was set in Tom Riddle era Hogwarts instead of '91, I could see Dumbledore Ã— Tom. Maybe add in a lil age regression?

For a crackfic, Lockhart x Dumbledore ftw though.

** He left school to travel around the world with a really old Elphias Doge, rediscover eleven uses of the dragon's blood (but not the twelve), write letters to the important wizards of that time (Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Luna Lovegood and Tom Riddle).
