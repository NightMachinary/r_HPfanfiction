For an upcoming video I'm working on, which is essentially a react video to a bunch of cringey Harry Potter fanfictions. Can be badly written or cringe worthy stories, reviews, other Reddit posts, fanart, etc. Anything other than just My Immortal. And dont worry, it's not a complete degradation of the topic, its all done in good fun.

And if you just link back my fanfics then I WILL cry


** Cringiest fic I've ever seen is linkffn(12562072) Couldn't even get through chapter 1.

  Do you want your little ones to read books; and they want to read the Harry Potter Books; but you do not want them to turn into witches? Well-this is the story for you! This story has all the adventure of JKR's books; but will not lead your children astray. For concerned mommies everywhere! Blessings! Grace Ann

** Just look up "Harry Potter After The War" on YouTube. You'll get loads of shitty slideshow fics that all go like this:

Harry goes to the Burrow after the Battle of Hogwarts (preferably after being missing for months/years)

Ginny yells at him for breaking up with her/leaving her/some other crazy made up reason

Harry has a huge crying fit and attempts suicide

Ginny has a similar crying fit as she realises what she's done

They make up

Cho/Dean tries to get Harry/Ginny to cheat on their partner with a love potion

Harry/Ginny breaks up with their partner, resulting in another crying fit from both sides

They make up

Voldemort comes back/the Death Eaters get ressurected

Harry/Ginny almost dies, resulting in yet another crying fit and an almost-suicide, only for them to find out that their partner is actually alive and have yet another crying fit, this time a happy one

This goes on and on for ages, until the author eventually gives up or gets demonetized

Bonus points if the author messes up the timeline in some ridiculous way, like having James Sirius Potter being born a good few years before his actual canon day of birth

Some other recs:

The "Willow Prank" (I know there are some truly good stories like this out there, and I'm currently writing one that starts off at that point, but most of them are either badly written/totally unrealistic, abandoned or have horrible grammar)

Harry's parents/Sirius coming back to life (Again, there are good ones out there, but they are few and very hard to find)

Anything with bad grammar (Especially if they use "of" instead of "have")

Badly written and unrealistic mental disorders ("i WaS feEliNg dEpREsSEd sO i sliT One OF my wRiStS")

Totally unrealistic and stupid bashing of people for minor flaws/things they can't control, e.g. bashing Sirius for not caring for Harry " correctly" because OH MY GOD, SIRIUS, WHO CARES IF YOU LOVE THIS CHILD MORE THAN LIFE ITSELF, AND ARE TRYING TO BE A GOOD GODFATHER TO HIM WHILE LIVING ON THE RUN AND EATING RATS, YOU'RE STILL NOT DOING ENOUGH, AND HOW DARE YOU GO AFTER PETER, I DON'T CARE IF YOU WERE BLINDED BY GRIEF AND WANTED REVENGE, THAT JUST PROVES THAT YOU CARE MORE ABOUT REVENGE THAN YOU DO ABOUT HARRY--- ..sorry, got carried away. Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, bashing. Also if they bash someone for loving the MC at the same time as whoever you're pairing MC with.

First and second years being about as emotionally immature as two year olds. Like, seriously, I knew more about crushes at age six than those characters do at twelve!

There's many more others, but these were my main cringe-recs. Good luck!
