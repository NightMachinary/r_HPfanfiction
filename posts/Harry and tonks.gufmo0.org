*** That's fair any good ones you'd recommend would be appreciated. Everything I seek to find under that pairing is either super short, abandoned, or pwp. Ive read a couple good ones but there don't seem to be many of them

**** Given how long ita been since I read these I don't remember which ones are complete, or even which ones are good, but I do know that they are long. All of these (with the last one being an exception at 69k) are 100k words or more. Often more. Best I can do, I hope you find something you think is worth reading.
