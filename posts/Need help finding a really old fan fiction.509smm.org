I don't remember too much other than Harry had somehow left the dursleys gained all of his parents money and enrolled in a special program that allowed him to become essentially child prodigy, he was really cocky and it was pretty dark fic


** I can't remember too much, I think it was a program run through gringotts this fic was probably over 10 years old probably can't even find it any more. I think dumbledore was portrayed normally, but it was more how harry acted, he had a snake as a pet. gosh sorry I can't remember much more
