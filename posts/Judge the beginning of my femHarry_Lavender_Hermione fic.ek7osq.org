“You fancy her, don't you?” Lavender asked. Holly didn't answer, stubborn as always. The answer was obvious now anyway. How utterly disappointing. 

“Oh, Holly. You're mental.” Sighing, Lavender turned to her friend. Holly, normally as brassy as her ginger mane implied, looked almost... meek. It was an odd look on a girl whose adventures typically involved dark lords and serial killers. 

 Now Lavender just felt guilty. This was not what she'd signed up for when she'd decided to stay at Hogwarts for the holidays. 

“Listen to me, will you? It's not about you fancying girls...” Lavender said. /I fancy them too/ was left unspoken, hanging in the air between them.

“Fuck off, Lav. When you had the notion I was chatting up Weasley, you were all for it.” Holly shook her head, muddy eyes flashing through her thick rims. 

“/Holls/! You know me better than that.” Lavender imitated Holly's aggressive tone and pouted dramatically, hoping for at least a chuckle. It was a failure only matched by her potion's results last year. 

“I thought I did.” Holly pursed her lips, about to abandon this conversation entirely. That was not allowed to happen. Why was finding the right words such a struggle?

“It's just... why /Granger/? Of all people?” Lavender winced the moment the question left her mouth, but...  A girl like Holly mooning after a swot like that?

“Ah. I should've realised that was your real objection.” Bizarrely, Holly's voice took on a softer tone. Lavender seized her chance.

“Obviously! You're too good for her. Even if you weren't, Krum's taking her to the Yule Ball!” Holly shrunk away from her words, but they needed to be said. Lavender needed to say it, even if she wouldn't admit to herself why.

“I know. Well, the last part at least...” Holly said. She sounded close to tears. Dammit.

"Come with me," Lavender blurted out.  

"... What? If you're taking the piss out of me, I swear..." Was Holly blushing?

"I'm serious! There's no better way to grab her attention than dating someone she hates. And lucky for you, I qualify." 

"What's in it for you?"

"Helping one of my best friends? Annoying Granger? Dressing you up? Take your pick. Besides, it'll be fun." Lavender tried to ignore the odd stomach gymnastics she couldn't fully attribute to too much chocolate. 

"... I guess you're right. It will be fun, won't it?" Holly smiled. For once, Lavender hadn't even been trying.


** It's a good start but fair warning, too much relationship drama will piss people off, especially if it's because the characters aren't communicating. People have enough of it IRL to deal with it in stories too.

*** While I personally as a romance and miscommunication hater would completely agree with your assessment, apparently there are people who really enjoy that stuff. The shows my mother and sisters used to watch was full of it and they seemed totally hooked so I guess if that's the kind of story you're going for then it's pretty nicely written. If it's just inside a story that's more likely to attract a different kind of audience then yeah, it really annoys people.

Am I making any sense?

**** I set out to make the most stereotypical fake dating AU possible for fun/to try something new, because the other stories I write are usually focused on established relationships or have no romance at all. Hence why I chose Lavender, the most "romance-oriented" character in the series, as my protagonist.

*** I wanted to write the most stereotypical story possible (fake dating AU) because my normal writing is usually pretty experimental/introspective and never has explicit romance.

The real GoF also heavily features "no communication" and considering the characters are 15/16, I think writing them without drama would be OOC.

** Maybe 7/10? I'd definitely read more of it if only because I like femslash.

*** Are there any specific criticisms or suggestions you have? This is the roughest of rough drafts and I'd like to hear from someone who reads a lot of femslash (I tend not to read romance in general).

**** I don't have any criticisms to give you. The only issue I have is the fake-dating trope but that's simply due to personal beliefs I have regarding romance. I'm very much looking forward to reading this in full. Sorry I couldn't be more help as I'm admittedly shitty at writing romance.
