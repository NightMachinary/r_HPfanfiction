So, I got an idea after watching a few Tom Riddle/Voldemort videos. Tom somehow ends up in DN universe, eventually somehow changing the events. Imagine Half-Blood Prince's teenage Tom from Slughorn's memory in Death Note, meeting L. What would be interesting. I got part of inspiration seeing these three youtube videos: [[https://youtube.com/watch?v=eAwL_Fh54oA][Tom Riddle's Little Secret]], [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ROnERGMCKO0][this]] and [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=glb1uUJovqs][this]]. Has anyone read fics like this? I'm sure someone would have this idea. So, details for anyone who likes to write this idea: Tom would appear/be 17(I mostly imagine Frank Dilanne), . Looking for intellectual games, so for whatever reason Tom wouldn't/couldn't immediatly use Imperio/Legilimency on L or Light, (at least at first anyways). How he ended up here, or when, or will he be able to come back, or maybe it's same world, or whatever it's up to you. Alright, cheers!
