Or, not specifically'Kung Fu”, but the martial arts style I forget the name of, based on the crossover I forget the name of. Notably, there are two other users of it, a Master ‘Shin'? And another ‘mostly adequate' American. They're assassins, and the Master adopts Harry at some point before he goes to Hogwarts.

The American lesser master packs a death eater into a trashcan, that tried to follow them, once..

Additionally, Hermione was watching the exhibition where the flying accident happens, with her parents, and she recognizes Harry, and claims that ‘he can't do that” with or Without Magic.


** *EDIT* here we are I think I found it. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4532363/1/][Harry Potter and the sun source]]

I know what you're talking about but not the title. I think it has the word “Sun” in it and it's a complete fic.

In the scene Harry starts running and then jumps up really high and catches the pilot during an air show.

I think he was taken before his Hogwarts days and wound up in China. He eats boiled chicken and rice. Shows up at Hogwarts due to either the cup spitting his name out or maybe because his master wants him there for some reason.

Also the American and Harry are extremely brotherly.

I might not be able to find it but I'll start a search
