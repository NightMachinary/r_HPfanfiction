...but where Harry is in Amestris instead of the Elrics being at Hogwarts. I've never seen the former, only the latter.

Bonus points if you know a fic where the Department of mysteries has the Gate instead of the Veil. It's a plot bunny I've had knocking around that I've shelved for now, but curious if it's been done already.

*** Hmmm I can't remember which ones are good since it's been a while, but there are a lot in the fanfiction.net crossover section. I'll have a look through my favourites in a bit and see if I can find any!
