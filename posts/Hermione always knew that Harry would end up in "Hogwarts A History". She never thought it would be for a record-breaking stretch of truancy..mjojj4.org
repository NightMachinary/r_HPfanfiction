"Harry. Explain. /Now./"

"Okay, so you recall how we took a bit of a sabbatical in '97-98?"

"I may recall something along those lines, yes."

"And after the war, you went back and took a belated Seventh Year with Ginny and Luna's class?"

"Of course."

"And Ron joined George at the shop, and took his N.E.W.T.s later?"

"Harry."

"And I went into Auror training without any N.E.W.T.s - they decided to bend the requirements for /some/ reason and let me in - and never went back to take them. Well, it turns out that unlike Fred and George, Ron and I never officially unenrolled from Hogwarts. Him getting his N.E.W.T.s counted to get him off the rolls, but I was still on. That meant I counted as truant, so I should probably have been expelled at some point, but apparently McGonagall still has a soft spot for me and kept me on the books as a student. I suppose I could have unenrolled myself, but Hogwarts was the first place I ever really felt at home, so I sort of liked still technically being a Hogwarts student."

"So you've managed a truant streak longer than an actual Hogwarts education by some bizarre combination of accident and sentiment? And you never thought to /mention/ this to me before I read about it in the latest edition?"

"Face it, Hermione, for me that's not even in the top ten for bizarre happenings."

****** In canon it's never mentioned that Bagshot wrote Hogwarts: A History. Bagshot only wrote (as far we know) A History of Magic. We don't know who wrote Hogwarts: A History but my guess is that it's multiple authors and it would surprise me that Hermione would become one of them.

******** They also had the Marauders map for a few years, and arguably found more secret passages and hidden rooms in the castle than the majority of people before them besides the Marauders and the twins. Also with access to house elves that could share their secrets I think Hermione would be perfect for it, even as just an editor.
