I've binged on Drarry and now I'd like to read some Severus-focused fics. They do not have to be slash, I do not want Snamione, Snarry, Snon, or any Snape and the HP aged kids slash.

I quite enjoyed The Best Revenge and I liked A Difference in the Family up until a point then it started getting boring and he was ridiculously overpowered and it never explained why Eileen was so gung ho on teaching him dueling- sorry, fresh on my mind.

Looking for long, engaging, well thought out fics. Thank you truly. (Also I like Snupin)

Am I the only one who finds these ship names absolutely ridiculous? And Snon was a new one. I could have lived the rest of my life without knowing Snape/Ron was a thing and was called /Snon/.

In any case, linkffn(The apprentice by Deborah Peters) is pretty good. Not much happens in it beyond Snape becoming an apprentice to a famous potions master and starting a relationship with Lily, but it a good read nonetheless.

I'll post a few fics.

linkffn(The Moment It Began) -- Snape goes back in time and makes some better decisions. SnapexLily. Very good.

linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles) -- You've read this, but for other readers, this is basically Snape's life, start to finish. Very well written. Author takes some liberties at some parts.

If you haven't read it, there is a fanfiction of the Snape Chronicles if Snape hadn't died -- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8090116/1/Miles-to-Go-Before-I-Sleep]])

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3f60oj/snapecentric_fics_please/ctlmmas][This comment]] has some some good ones. I haven't read all of them, but some are good.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  #+begin_example
      When starting this, please keep in mind that A Year Like None Other was started long before HBP came out\. It was always my intention to write an alternate 6th year and when the canon Year 6 was published, it meant that my own little saga seriously diverged from canon\. So reading this, imagine that Years 1\-5 did occur, but nothing we discover from HBP and DH is necessarily true this time around\.The most important divergences are these: In this universe, Snape \*is\* a pureblood and his father's name was Hostilian \(which tells you a lot all by itself\)\. Dumbledore never died \-\- and certainly not at Snape's hand\!   This story is completely finished and is about 760,000 words long\. It took me a while to get it all posted here at AO3, but I am very happy to report that the whole thing is now online for your \(hopefully\) intense enjoyment\!And now, on with the show, which begins with A Year Like None Other \(completed\), continues on into A Summer Like None Other \(also completed\) and wraps up with A Family Like None Other, a Year 7 novel that I am still writing\.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. Rating & Genres may change later.

***** This fic seems to focus on Molly, Ginny, Percy, and Ron as being unable to see the real Harry. And the author is quite unfair to them. I mean, for one, Molly practically adopts Harry into her family in spite of the fact that she already has seven children and little money. For another, the story doesn't seem to list any of their good traits whatsoever.

Which is a bummer because I was excited by the Susan cameo (I love the discworld).

I do have to say though that Molly practically adopting Harry doesn't preclude her from being a villain. Ends, intentions, and means are all separate - related, yes, but separate nonetheless. You can have good intentions and still do bad or questionable things. You can also have bad intentions and still do good things. The two events in this case are not mutually exclusive.
