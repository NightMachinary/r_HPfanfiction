can anyone recommend any well-written yule ball fanfics? doesn't have to be one-shot, can be part of a whole story. open to any pairing except harmione and romione. would prefer any of the following characters: cedric, cho, draco, pansy, harry, but at the end of the day i'll take anything as long as it's well written


** This is a good premise. Yule Ball in canon was such a disaster because we only got to see Harry's terrible experience. If you are interested in Harry getting a re-do at the Yule Ball, then alternate pairings offer fruitful ground. Here are a couple I recently read:

- A Harry / Daphne fic called "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13028375/1/A-Pearl-of-Great-Price][A Pearl of Great Price]]" that is a flashback that starts with Harry saving Daphne at the Yule Ball. There is a lot that happens after the Yule Ball as well. Unfortunately, the fic appears to be on hiatus. linkffn(13028375)
- The second chapter (of 5 total so far) of "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13777689/1/Chasing-Snowflakes][Chasing Snowflakes]]", which one is an in progress Harry / Katie Bell fic, features an extensive view of Harry & Katie at the Yule Ball. The Gryffindor quidditch team really looks out for Harry. linkffn(13777689)

  An incident at the Yule Ball, results in the rescue of a maiden fair. It was impossible for them to imagine that the resulting ripples from this event would impact so heavily on their lives and all those in the magical world.
