I'm considering writing a story and so I'm putting this prompt/demo out. Let me know if this is trash and if I'm a worthless writer. I know that my dialogue is my weakest point. I never really learned how to format dialogue, though I think I can improve on what is actually said. I tried to keep this pretty short.

â€‹

Albus Dumbledore looked down upon his desk, his normal twinkle no longer present in his eyes. On his desk lay the remnants of a package; discarded twine on the side. On the brown wrapping paper lay a severed finger, unnatural black veins running through it and a silver ring on it. A note read "Fates truly worse than death can only be brought through the dark arts". Dumbledore recognized the ring as belonging to Elphias Doge.

With a serene expression on his face, Dumbledore muttered "the dark arts indeed" as he stood up and turned around and pulled the elder wand out as it hummed insidiously. Dumbledore flicked the wand at the wall. In a headache inducing sight, the stone bricks shifted, revealing an opening in the wall. He strode furiously through the opening into a brightly lit room. Along the sides were shelves with potions, books, and other magical artifacts. The current concern to Dumbledore was the table in the center, however. Upon it lay the still body of Igor Karkaroff. As Dumbledore flicked his wand to bind Karkaroff in ropes of golden light, he raised his hand. A vial flew into his outstretched hand which he promptly poured into Karkaroff's mouth.

Karkaroff awoke with a start, frantically looking around, spotting Dumbledore.

"Where am I?" Karkaroff shouted, struggling against that which bound him.

"A question of greater relevance, is what I am going to do" replied Dumbledore, waving his hand to silence Karkaroff. "I'm afraid that Voldemort has decided to anger me. I'm not quite as spry as I once was, however, and I'm afraid I might need to, what's the phrase? Ah. Cheat the dickens. I'm afraid I'm going to need some help from you, though you might not be terribly willing to provide it"

A week later, Dumbledore apparated before the gates that protected Malfoy manor. He was glowing with a dark red light and his eyes, normally blue, were now black, seemingly sucking in all light. He pulled a bottle out of his robes and threw it at the gates, flicking his wand to conjure a silver shield in front of him. The bottle collided with a now visible translucent pink barrier and exploded. The shockwave shattered Dumbledore's shield and some shrapnel flew towards his robes before halting and hurtling towards the ground. The barrier flickered and a groaning could almost be heard in the air. Dumbledore flicked his wand and the ground seemed to tremble as an invisible force seemed to leap from his wand and collided with the magical barrier which shattered, the pieces vaporizing as they fell. Another flick and the gates twisted into giant silver tigers which immediately ran towards the manor.

Dumbledore strode towards the manor as screaming started to seeming fill the air. He spotted three death eaters fighting his tigers, two more on the ground with their throats ripped out. He flicked his wand, a blue spell flying towards and colliding with a death eater. Lightning seemingly ripped out of the death eater's chest to shock the the other two death eaters who fell, blood pouring from their eyes and ears.

Dumbledore continued to stroll towards the manor. He saw Antonin Dolohov rushing towards him, wand aloft and a furious expression burning in his eyes. No words were wasted before Dolohov's arm started blurring and a flurry of spells started flying towards Dumbledore. Each one was lethal. Unfazed, Dumbledore shielded, countered, and parried, retaliating with curses of his own. Near the en of their duel, a blue spell erupted from Dolohov's wand, blinking out mid flight with a flick of Dumbledore's wand as Dumbledore's tigers were simultaneously banished towards Dolohov. Dolohov was forced to cast a silver spell, alight with a golden flame, at one of the tigers. The silver rippled with little other effect. Distracted, Dolohov failed to notice a black curse. His intestines forced their way out of his mouth as he was suspended midair via his intestines.

Dumbledore continued on, casually flicking his wand to send a killing curse to silence Dolohov's screams. He heard a scream of pure rage as he saw Voldemort fly towards him. Voldemort opened his mouth before freezing, his mouth opening in an expression of pure surprise as Voldemort took in Dumbledore's appearance.

"Ezekiel's ritual?" Voldemort gasped. "But that requires an unwilling sacrifice" Voldemort said astounded.

"Surely you didn't think you were the only one to master the dark arts, Tom" replied Dumbledore. "Did you think I was friends with Grindewald because of our shared interest in possibly fictional artifacts? No I was mastering and advancing magic of the vilest kind before you were born."

Voldemort laughed. "How hypocritical" Voldemort scoffed. "The great Albus Dumbledore, preacher against the dark arts, using the dark arts because his friend /died/". Voldemorts eyes widened as he was forced to shield and return a barrage of spells, none of which were anything short of a tortuous death.

"I truly wish that I had never had reason to use these spells again. But you forced my hand Tom. If you're really so confident in the dark arts and their seductive power, then you won't mind dying to them either, will you?" Dumbledore spoke as his wand blurred.

The ground shook, as parried spells burned the ground and craters began filling the air near the men. An errant spell left a death eater running out of Malfoy Manor a bloody paste on the ground. A flick from Dumbledore conjured a torrent of cursed fire that flew towards Voldemort, six silver spells flying through the fire towards the dark lord as well. The six spells flew into a silver shield that morphed into a snake that bit the fire before smothering it into the ground as Voldemort returned with a volley of spells.

An hour later, Voldemort lay on the ground, his torso ripped open.

"Go on then, kill me. Show me the final hypocrisy of the great Albus Dumbledore" Voldemort breathed out.

Dumbledore knelt and bent down.

"Oh no I'm afraid, when I said I mastered and advanced the dark arts I meant it. I'm going to show you what I meant back in the ministry, Tom, when I said fates worse than death" Dumbledore whispered as his eyes began to clear up, a black smoke flowing out his ears towards the sky.

Voldemort laughed as he replied "did you forget Dumbledore? I'm immortal!" He left his body, intent on finding another, furious on being forced to obtain another.

A gleaming white light surrounded Voldemort's spirit. After all, Dumbledore hadn't only mastered the dark arts.

Voldemort screamed.


** Brilliant.
