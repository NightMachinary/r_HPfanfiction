Reading through OotP again, Dumbledore says that the protection of Lily's blood was only guaranteed when Petunia agreed to take him. Are there any good fics where she /didn't/ agree?


** I think that maybe you are looking for a thing where Harry doesn't have the "blood protection" that would, for example, allow him to burn Quirellmort in the first book, but I can't remember ever seeing that as a plot point.\\
Also, I think Dumbledore only meant that the blood wards around privet drive would only activate if he was taken in /willingly/, and was not talking about the protection in Harry's blood.

Anyway, here are some conciliatory NotRaisedByDursleys! or TakenFromDursleys! very good fics:

  Harry was proclaimed dead when he was two years old and ended up in an orphanage. But that was only the beginning of his journey. While trying to find his place in the world of magic, he never forgets those whom he views as family.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

** I find all the fics of this kind to be awfully optimistic. It's invariably Harry being raised and !TRAINED! by Dumbledore himself, or Sirius, or the Flamels, or the goblins, so that by the time he arrives at Hogwarts, he is better-read than Hermione, better at chess than Ron, more aristocratic than Draco, and better at magic than Dumbledore was at his age.

Why is it never exploring the practicalities of raising Harry while compensating for the sacrificial protection that was lost with Petunia's rejection? Or, worse yet, the consequences of failing to compensate?

There would be a Fidelius Charm that limits his movements and his interactions with people other than his caretakers. His caretakers, in turn, must not let on that they are taking care of Harry Potter, even as their friends and coworkers notice that they are often gone for long periods of time without explanation.

Of course, Fidelius alone is not sufficient, because an assassin with a vial of Felix Felicis would know just where to go and whom to Imperius. That means defence in depth is required, perhaps a mechanism to delay even those "authorised" in the hope that Felix Felicis wears off, or to require more than one caretaker to be present to access the location. All this further complicates the caretaking and isolates Harry.

At some point, one might wonder whether a cupboard under the stairs is so bad...

*** I'm mostly thinking that Dumbledore's plan for Harry's safety relied on a pretty huge assumption - that Petunia would accept it.

What did he intend to do if his assumption was wrong?
