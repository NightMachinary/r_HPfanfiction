As the title says I just have a itch for betrayed Harry and have read most of the good ones. Doesn't matter if it's slash or crack or whatever.

  Harry never killed or tortured anyone, yet they convicted him for the crimes and sentenced him to life in Azkaban. His friends believe him guilty, the Ministry is more corrupt than anyone realizes and Voldemort is closing in. When the Order comes across info that only Harry can help them with, they need to furlough the prisoner for his help. Can they trust him? Can he trust them?

*** Love this fic so far. Also just in general love when stubbornness is the main character's super power.

** I love Never Alone Never Again by Bored Beyond Belief on FFN. Harry is used as a scapegoat by the ministry. Sorry I don't know how to make the bot link it.
