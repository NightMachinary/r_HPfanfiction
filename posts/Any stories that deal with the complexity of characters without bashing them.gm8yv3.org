For an example: Being angry at a character for doing a in character thing: Such as Dumbledore sending Harry to his death, isn't bashing. But writing evil Dumbledore who is using Harry's fame and fortune is.

I don't want there being a sudden: We were suddenly using your fame and fortune plot line though, as that would fall under the bashing that I don't want.

He's not evil, he's well meaning with poor thought out ideals, thus making him human.

I love the characters in the Harry Potter Universe, flaws and all, the flaws are what to me, make them feel real.

Same with Severus Snape, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, or whomever else.

So I'm not looking for character bashing, but that explore the flaws and/or complexity of different characters, maybe even helping them change (in realistic ways).

I would also appreciate, including minor characters/side characters not to be one-dimensional in stories. Realistic or semi realistic competent adults. (If at all possible, but not mandatory). I'm not expecting them to know everything, or have God Like power, of course, just more interesting adult characters, if at all possible.

If Harry is in the story, and is smarter or more powerful then in canon, I don't want it to be a just because thing, I don't want him having Godlike magic or because of creature inheritance or anything to that nature, I want it to be because he worked hard for it.

The plot itself and genre I don't care, it can be anything.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual, et cetra (Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing).

No Harem Harry, If Harry is "Lord" I want him to still help people, instead of him just being Draco Malfoy 2.0

Can be on ANY site, anyone can be the main character, can have any warnings. Can be any length.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, if at all possible, but if not that's fine.

Extra Notes: If people have a falling out in the story, as long as it doesn't lead to downright bashing, that is fine. If people have disagreements with each other, without leading to bashing, that is fine.


** Ironically enough, I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][/Make a Wish/]] by Rorschach's Blot treats the canon good characters very well. It's just Harry becomes ridiculously OP. I swear, Dumbledore's characterization in this particular fic is one of my favorites, for all that he's a very minor character in it.

** It's not for everyone, but linkffn(12978482) is doing pretty good with competent adults and exploring motivations. Sirius and Barty are great and though Harry is quite biased against Dumbledore, what we see of him is canon compliant. Even poor Ron is treated well.

Incomplete at the moment, but updates are pretty regular.

Warning: Harry/Voldemort endgame.

  In 1978, Sirius Black almost becomes an Auror. Turns out even he can't fake his way through the mental health assessment.So what. He has better things to do: Remus Lupin is one. The war is another. He spends weeks at a time undercover for the Order while Polyjuiced to the gills. It's probably his new favourite thing.Little does Sirius know that running from himself will send him on a collision course with his ephemeral brother, but life is funny that way.

** The fic I'm co-writing currently seems like something you might like. It's definitely along these lines, and absolutely no character bashing. We are intensely interested in complex characters who make both good and bad choices & just generally clash and misunderstand each other.

It is unfinished, but fairly long already and only going to get longer. No hard feelings if it's not your cup of tea. :)

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** linkffn(2580283) is absolutely brilliant, it's very different and AU, and Harry has a twin and is trained to protect him to an extreme. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you want to give it a go then you likely won't be disappointed.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
