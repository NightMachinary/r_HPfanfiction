** It can, depending on the reasons for the change in gender. Most gender swap stories are focused on the different social dynamics (who likes/hates/lusts for who) and the writer isn't interested in how the difference might change the overall plotline of hero quest/coming of age, except to disable all the difficult parts that would normally cause a character to grow more mature.

The rarer stories rework the plotline and theme to reflect the change- a coming-of-age story is different for a girl than a boy, and actually addressing the issues of identity (while tedious to the action-minded) can make for stirring empathy/catharsis. Then the story isn't about confronting the responsibility for defeating a bad guy, so really the canon storyline is there just for timing purposes.

It /can/ change a whole lot of things, but few writers really go through the effort of exploring the logical effects and how it could make things worse/more complicated rather than better/easier/sexier.

** I can't read most fics where they're changed to the opposite gender. It's mostly for shipping and rarely brings anything new or interesting to the story.

The only good opposite gender fanfic I've read was Weasley Girl, where Ron was Veronica, first born girl of the weasley family. It got boring though.

Oh, and also this Dudley one where (s)he and Harry got together.

** Sometimes such a story exists, though they seem to be outnumbered... But aren't "stories with plot" outnumbered anyway?

I really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl]], a story where there is no Ronald Weasley, but a Veronica Weasley. - this has lead to some changes in the plot line (and some changes well before the story even started...), which by now has diverged from canon quite a lot, while still having a canon feel! The dynamic between people is just ever so slightly different, to begin with...

The author has mentioned that any pairing will still have to wait for a bit and never will be the center of the story, so it's not as if it was written as an excuse plot to get any two characters together.

** I can't remember the title, but I read a super AU story where women were much more socially powerful than men in the wizarding world, because it was more likely for girl witches to survive childbirth than boys and some other, more detailed reasons. The author gender bent a lot of canon males to female to create this dynamic without just cutting out a bunch of characters. It was a really fascinating read.

**** My summary doesn't do it justice. I promise it makes total sense in the context of the story, and that it was necessary to the plot for there to be a large majority of females in society. And no, Dumbledore was not female. :) I'll try to find it, but it was awhile ago.

** It's not about changing the plot. It's about making a character easier for half the population to identify with. While a woman identifying with, being inspired by, and seeing something of herself in a male protagonist is far from impossible, and vice versa, a gender difference is a barrier. This would be true if gender differences were more superficial than they currently are. And that's more than enough reason for someone to write fan fiction with gender swapped characters.

...Rowling might have hit on something when she made the plotwise protagonist male but utterly forgettable and then made the actual interesting major character female. I'm male and identify much more with Hermione than with Harry.

The vast majority of media involves white male protagonists. It's boring. That's reason enough for gender and race swapping.

You don't need huge plot shifts to make fan fiction worthwhile. It just suggests that, if you're writing a fic with gender swapped characters and want to engage an audience that is quite familiar with the original work, you want to focus on the events that are different and omit or shorten those that are largely the same.

As for plot changes based on gender changes: yes, that's quite possible. What if you gender-swapped Lily Evans and James Potter? Suddenly Jane Potter is a blood traitor who ended her family line, so she and Harry are both derided by all the purebloods around (even Augusta Longbottom, most likely; she forces Neville to stay away from Harry). Harry might end up ineligible to inherit from pureblood houses. The trust vault is intact since it was set up before Jane and Liam Evans's deaths, but the vast Potter fortunes and estates that a lot of fics talk about are /gone/, divided between the goblins and the Ministry. Maybe Malfoy taunts Harry by revealing that he lives in the old Potter estate.

Gender-swap Neville. Suddenly his lack of confidence is compounded by the additional social pressures of being female. Even odds he commits suicide by the end of first year.

Gender-swap Ginny. Now /Ron/ commits suicide by the end of third year, on account of all his friends and family do so much better than him at everything but chess, boardgames don't a career make, he can't deride his younger sister on account of her gender, and the occasional signs of wealth that Harry displays really grate on him.

Gender-swap Snape. Women don't get away with as much, ever, and in authority positions, they're more likely to be labeled as bitchy, controlling, or bossy. Severa Snape gets sacked or at least put under administrative review well before Harry gets to Hogwarts. Also, women's appearances are much more tightly policed. Severa Snape doesn't have greasy hair; she uses hair-care potions of her own devising and keeps her hair in a net while she's brewing.

Gender-swap Dudley. Delia Dursley gets a lot more shit for her weight than Dudley ever did. She lashes out, sometimes, but mostly she turns her stress in on herself. She develops an eating disorder and starts self-harm and overall has very few friends. Since Harry is present, can't run away, and is non-threatening, she eventually opens up to him, a little, and they form an awkward friendship. But when Harry goes off to school, Delia has zero friends left. Eventually she runs away and makes her way to Hogsmeade, relying on the bit of wizard blood she got from being in the same family as Lily Evans. She discovers that there's far less fat-phobia in the wizarding world, where a potion can change your appearance forever and you look exactly how you want, and ends up working as a cashier at an apothecary.

Gender-swap Harry Potter. Uh...well, canon Harry is kind of a blank slate. A more generic version of Ron Weasley, overall, with a /bit/ of competence in a couple subjects and a bit less character. Gender-swap him and you get pretty much no change -- there's not much character to begin with, and what character there is has almost no effect on the story. Harry's just a plot monkey. Oh, there would be a couple things -- someone who grew up as a girl in the muggle world isn't nearly as likely to confront Malfoy over Neville's Remembrall, for instance, so no Quidditch in first year. (Neither is someone who grew up in an abusive home, for that matter. Harry Potter in canon, though, wasn't abused at all. He grew up in a moderately loving home. His personality rather screams it -- moderate introversion but otherwise intact.) But those are minor things. And for the most part, the books are plot-driven, not character-driven. So, yeah, not much change.

If you have an ounce of creativity and spend five minutes thinking, gender swapping a character can have tons of impact on a story. Unless you've a misapprehension that men and women have only superficial differences in how they're treated by society.

*** i think about fem!sev a lot. i don't think she would have been sacked because of dumbledore reasons, and her connection with lucius who was on the something committee before the events of CoS and reps. for her at the ministry. but there's something really attractive to me about fem!sev, head of slytherin clashing with minerva for the house cup, potions and DADA/Dark Arts genius, spell inventor, secret agent that deceives voldemort, juxtaposed with the main protagonist and antagonist of the series. definitely a slytherin, but probably the bravest woman harry potter ever knew. best friends with lily evans, growing to love her, their fallout and her joining the ranks of DEs. renegading to try to protect her. even better if she stil uses the moniker 'half blood prince'. ahhh

**** Judging by his personality, yes, he grew up in a moderately loving home. Not a great one, but a reasonable one.

I think Rowling wanted to avoid Harry having to tell his parents about the terrible things happening at Hogwarts and give him more reason to stay with Ron over the summer, plus cut his attachments to his living family so he'd have less holding him back at the final confrontation. But she definitely didn't want to write the story of an abused child.

******** Sure, from a perspective of what events the story recounts, Harry was abused. But Harry has no signs of having suffered abuse. You're repeatedly trying to refute the claim that Harry is a well-adjusted kid by saying that the Dursleys did unpleasant things to him. These things /should/ be related; in reality they're related; but in the books, they're not.

**** fem!Ron: suddenly not overshadowed by her older brothers, she's the first female Weasley- but she's not the /only/ female Weasley, since her spunky younger sister is right behind her. She's driven to prove herself- not to catch up with his older, successful brothers that he not-so-secretly worries he'll never match, but instead to outpace her younger sister, to make sure people think of her as more than just "the first" Weasley girl. She's got a 1-year head start, though, so much less of a chip on her shoulder about it. Year 2 is completely different- she doesn't ignore Ginny, because she /can't/ ignore Ginny, not when she's the benchmark she needs to stay ahead of.

male!Hermione - nerdy little boys get picked on, sure, but they don't get teased constantly for their bushy hair and buck teeth as badly as girls. He's still a social outcast, but doesn't feel the need to suck up to authorities as much (though he still spouts off answers in class) because they were never as much of a refuge against the other students. Maybe not as defiant about breaking the rules, though still brave- better-than-even odds of going Ravenclaw instead of Gryfindor, where he'd fit right in, though his spark of bravery might lead him to fall in with Harry anyway- or especially a fem!Ron. Troll scene never happens- Herman wouldn't be crying in the bathroom- so the way year 1 plays out would be different.

Mostly it doesn't add anything at all, except that now Harry is gay, which again doesn't usually hurt the story and can provide a protagonist that some people can relate better too.
