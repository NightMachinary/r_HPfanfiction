I think that I remember reading three different fanfics:

one were he puts every Toilet but one in Myrtles Bathroom under Fidelius

another were he puts every Toilet but the one in the Headmaster quarters under Fidelius

and the last he puts every toilet in the Castle under Fidelius so that anyone who needed to go started walking down to Hogsmead to use the Toilets there


** Never hear about it but would like to see it now. What an insane idea. Do you remember a reason why he did it? Just for shit and gigles?

** Seriously? Everybody just went to Hogsmeade? Shows that wizards aren't human. Any muggle guy faced with such a dilemma would just find a quiet corner to piss in and let the house elves worry about cleaning the mess.

*** From memory they try to make to hogsmead and fail in makeing it there in time.

In one of them Harry may have also put laxatives in everyone's food in at lead one of them. Sadly it's been a while I read the storys so I have forgotten.

** Imagine the mass confusion, having known you obviously must have gone shit /somewhere/ but suddenly waking up and running down for a morning piss in Hogsmead, confounded as to why you have no memory of having ever gone to a bathroom in Hogwarts.

*** Or being used to a Toilet being less than a 2mins walk away so you have the internal timing that they don't start looking for a Toilet until they normal do.

*** No, there is only a brief mention that the Slytherin toilets have been put under Fidelius in the past, and therefore not a prank Harry ought to do
