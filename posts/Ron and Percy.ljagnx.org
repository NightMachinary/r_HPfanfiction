Simple comedy movie prompt. It's third year, Hermione is annoyed and Ron lazy and lack of studying mood. The twins have had enough of Percy when he spoils their best prank yet. In one of the twins craziest ideas, they swap Ron and Percy personalities. It goes well, for a while ... But eventually Hermione and the twins miss the former Ron/Percy and hurry to get them back before the change is permanent.

Could be Ron/Hermione or just friendship Ron and Hermione fic.


** Cool idea, would read it.
