This is exactly what Mao Zedong said, only replacing wand with gun.

He even copied [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotations_from_Chairman_Mao_Tse-tung][that]]!

It is true though, even our democracies are all backed by massive defense budgets and weapons powerful enough to destroy the world several times over.

However, we have significant checks and balances in our system, unlike Napoleonic France, Soviet Russia, Communist China, and of course Riddle's Wizarding Britain.

Indeed. This Riddle is rather more aware of the muggle world than his canon counterpart.

That publisher is [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Little_Red_Books][canon]], actually! But you can see why I specified them. :)

My first thought: The way you phrased all that, it sounds like "Wizarding" refers to the political state of the country, like "Napoleonic" and "Soviet."

My second thought: Come to think of it, that might not be so incorrect with reference to the United Kingdom, at least as of 1986... >:P
