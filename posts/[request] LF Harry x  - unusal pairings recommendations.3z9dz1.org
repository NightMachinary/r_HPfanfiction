So some time ago I read a HarryxGreyback fanfic I never finished because it was essentially a rape fic and I am not into that, but it made me wonder if there are any other unusal pairings out there that have good fics I just never came across! So here are some pairings I never read but would be interested in exploring - IF you can give me a good recommendation! :)

Harry x Greyback

Harry x Lupin (I don't see them as romantic so never went looking for anything! Any good ones?)

Harry x Sirius (I only read 1 which involved time travel, thats it)

Harry x any Ravenclaw /not Luna/ (are there any out there? most are HxSlytherins or HxGryffindors and I read HxLuna rather a lot before - also no HxHufflepuff except Susan Bones I think :( )

Harry x Neville (existence of fics debatable?)

Harry x Millicent (ex. of fics deb.?)

Harry x Percy (I think I read 1 ages ago I actually liked, will look for it if there is interest! otherwise no clue)

Harry x Bill (hottest Weasley imho, yet most fics seem to be HxRon, which I dont like or read, or HxCharlie)

Harry x Theo Nott (Because why not(t) ;) )

Harry x Blaise (male not fem!Blaise , I read 2 only but love HxBlaise or better HxBlaisexDraco :D )

Harry x Bellatrix (I know they're out there, but I only read 1 good one before)

Ideas? :D

*** Thanks , i read a few of your shorter recs and they were awesome! I'll try a longer one later. If you know of others feel free to share, this pairing or another. I already resolved to sharing unusal pairings I find myself over time here, so others have a better way of finding the fics. cheers

  Neville is completely oblivious he's revealed anything, Harry isn't sure how this will affect their friendship or working relationship, and the only liquor he's got tastes like peaches.

  Curry leads to warm hearts and a titbit of Harry's past.

  #+begin_example
      Written for cottoncandy\_bingo 2012, prompt “Confidence\.” Confidence is taken in a number of ways by this response, feel free to speculate on them all\. You’d probably find a few that I didn’t think of, too\! Additionally, the Harry and Neville in this fic are the same from Lucky, with this fic set earlier in the relationship\. If you find any mistakes regarding the curry or anything else \(including Americanisms\), please let me know\. Thanks\! :\)

  When a werewolf first touches its future mate, it gets an unusual feeling and somehow knows that person will be its mate. Imagine Remus' surprise when James first hands him a baby Harry...

  #+begin_example
      A series of scenes from Remus' and Harry's life before Harry begins Hogwarts\.  The story came from a prompt from a fest years ago but was never published\.

  62/? When Harry Potter starts coming into his full wizarding powers too early, what better way to stabilize his magic than a full marriage bond? Certain Weasley brothers can't stand to see Harry manipulated any longer, and suddenly plans change. Eventual Harry/Charlie, Fred/George, Sirius/? Begins after Harry's fourth year, but only VERY loosely follows plot after that point. Abuse
