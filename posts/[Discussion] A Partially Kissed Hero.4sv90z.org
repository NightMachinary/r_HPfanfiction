** Absolutely horrible.

Its one of those fics that tell a lot about the taste of whomever recommends it. If I see it in anyones recommendations, the entirety of that persons post will be ignored. Its just that horrible.

**** Terribly evil!Dumbles (literally moustache twirling), over the top evil!Snape, a plot that is nonsensical and utterly incoherent /at best/. Time travel which makes absolutely zero sense. A weird section about how Muslims are evil. Stupid fairy shit. And those are /the good/ parts of the fic.

When a friend of mine got his wisdom teeth removed, the painkillers made him think the trees were out to kill him (a frightening proposition since our part of the country is one big forest). This fic makes that hallucination seem reasonable by a sober man's standards.

**** I tried 5 times now, but I just can't find the words.

Here is the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PartiallyKissedHero][TVTropes site]] for it. I almost dare not say it, but to experience the full awfulness of it, you may just wanna grab a beer and read it.

*** You have to admit, it at least started off entertaining in a sort of horrific way, like watching a train derailment in slow motion. That's a pretty apt metaphor for the plot, actually... It's at least amusing for the sheer WTF factor.

***** Well, about the latter - depends on a case. Good archer can do some tricky things that are impossible with a gun, like firing in arcs to hit something behind the wall or delivering something (a letter or 20g of TNT in arrowshaft, with pressure sensitive detonator in arrowhead).

So if you need something like this - bow rules. On the other hand, in actual combat, any modern rifle is a better option.

** Why would this be a thing that is discussed?

This doesn't even feel like one of those terrible fics that seem to be trying to be parodies. It's quite literally one of the worst fics that there are to offer, simply for the subject matter that is espoused in it.

8600 favorites. I'm going to guess some people like it. I'm going to guess again. They don't post here. It's got some fun bits, perfectly fine for a lazy afternoon reading.

** I can't stand "My Immortal", but I love reading "Partially Kissed Hero" for shits and giggles. It's "so bad it's good" for me, but I wouldn't reccomend it under any other circumstances.

** I'm going to attempt to say something nice about this fic.

I liked the bits about Colonel Sanders. It was pretty funny.

I also liked (briefly) the idea of an evil Dumbledore fic where he literally turned into Snidely Whiplash. Then I realized the author was seriously running with it.

** If you take it serious, it's not good. If you treat it like a parody it's fine, I laughed, I was annoyed by the Muslim rant and ignored it, and it's pretty dead the last 15 chapters. 5/10 parody fic
