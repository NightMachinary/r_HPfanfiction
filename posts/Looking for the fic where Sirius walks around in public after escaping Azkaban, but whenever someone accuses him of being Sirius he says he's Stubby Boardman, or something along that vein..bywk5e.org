Also what's that fic where Harry gets Sirius to wear his glasses, and no-one recognizes either of them.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** I think it's called linkffn(All the Dementors of Azkaban). Where he wears glasses and says things like "I can't be Sirius Black, he doesn't wear glasses!" whenever he gets confronted.

  AU PoA: When Luna Lovegood is condemned to Azkaban prison for her part in opening the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is the first to protest. Minister Fudge is reluctant to comply, but then again he never really had a choice in the first place. Oneshot.

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

I don't really want to get into politics, but the userbase here is even more left-leaning than [[/r/politics][r/politics]], although perhaps not as politicized on here.

Still, I was nearly perma banned by the sub founder because I called something "gay" in a negative context, which apparently was an insult to homosexuals across the world, lol. Clearly, they didn't see the South Park episode :)
