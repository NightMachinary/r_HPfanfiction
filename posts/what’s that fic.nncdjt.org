honestly i don't remember much about it. harry was darker, maybe slytherin idk, and hermione died when the troll attacked in year one. i can't remember anything else really, but i'm pretty sure it's pretty popular. if you know what i'm talking about please tell me!


** Harry Potter and the Shadowed Light meets your description mostly. Harry is MoD and goes back in time. He is sorted into Slytherin, and watched the troll attack Hermione. Her magic ended up saving her but she was placed in the long term ward at St. Mungo's with Neville's parents because she's basically brain dead. It says Hermione would have wished she died rather than being in that state. Sorry I don't know how to link it, but it's easy to find through a Google search.

*** hmm i don't think that's it. i remember hermione specifically dying and harry being confused how everyone went back to normal after not too long. that sounds pretty cool though so i'll definitely check that one out.

**** I think your looking for Something Like Your Family by Luan Mao. She dies early on and no one really cares. The story revolves around Harry learning that no one other than pure bloods matter.
