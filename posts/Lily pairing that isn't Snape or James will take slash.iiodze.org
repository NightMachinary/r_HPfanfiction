** You mean she could be paired with someone /else/? Crazy!

To be honest, it always puzzled me somewhat how incredibly rare non-Snily non-Jily Lily ships are.

Personally I always figured that the ship most likely to end well for her (besides Lily/OC which could be anything) is Remily. Snily has obvious problems while Jily only works if James legitimately matured, something canon never explicitly makes clear. However, I haven't read any myself with it as main focus. But I've seen linkffn(A Love like a Moonflower) that is supposedly decent.

Pretty sure it's Remus who explicitly says that James chilled out around 6th or 7th year, the only person he continued to fight with was Snape, who also would start fights with James.

**** The problem here is, how believable is this when nobody in the entire series aside from Snape's memories (and Snape himself, but he's so biased as to be useless as a source of information) actually bring up the fact that James wasn't always perfect? Everyone mentions how good he was without bringing up flaws. Which is fair, since it's bad form to speak ill of the dead, but we know for a fact that this wasn't always true.

Don't get me wrong, I like to think that he matured in the end, and I vastly prefer reading fics with a James that isn't an asshole. I just feel that canon could have done a better job presenting this fact than hearing it from one of his closest friends, especially with the caveat "oh and he still fought with Snape". Why even mention it if James truly matured and further fights with Snape was defensive in nature?

***** I think it makes sense that James did mature and everybody venerated the all-around good friend that died tragically young, who from their perspective grew out of being a bully when he became an adult.

It's possible that he stayed an asshole and everyone ignored it and/or didn't tell his orphan child how awful of a person he was, but since Lily in canon did end up with him, either he actually wasn't an asshole anymore or she stopped caring.

Like most things in canon, more clarification might be nice, but I don't feel like we need it to accept that James grew up. I think having another character who wasn't particularly close to James talk to Harry in depth about his father's virtues and vices throughout his life would probably feel out of place anyways.
