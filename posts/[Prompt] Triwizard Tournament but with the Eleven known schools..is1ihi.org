Harry can still be picked 12th champion or whatever.

The Undecawizard Tournament or whatever


** "So gentlemen, what will be the first task?" Dumbledore asked Bagman.

"Well, we're thinking dragons and the tasks of stealing these eggs from them," Bagman proudly presented the golden egg.

"You do realise that it would be a dragon per champion. Twelve dragons in total," Dumbledore noted as Bagman began to sweat.

"Y-yes, well... Think of all the press! The glory!" Bagman cried.

Harry quietly crept away from the two men, hidden under his cloak. Unbeknownst to the fourteen year old, the headmaster gave a small smile at Harry's back before turning to Bagman, " I think we'll do away with the dragons... Now, what about a Hippogriff Race?"

** I think this is one of those ideas which everything thinks of and the first thought is "Yes, what a great way to show more of the international wizarding world!"

But then, the moment you put pen to paper, or even begin to plan the idea with serious intent, you realise how cumbersome it is to the narrative to write 11 schools arriving, 11 champions, etc. Too many characters to introduce, give unique voices, and coordinate logistically, and too much info-dump exposition to explain everything.
