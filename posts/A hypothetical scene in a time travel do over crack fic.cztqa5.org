Harry is on the train to his first year of Hogwarts. Neville comes looking for Trevor the Toad. Being a Powerful Wizard Who Breaks All Known Laws of Magic from the future, Harry says, "Accio Trevor" . Instead of summoning Neville's beloved toad, he instead summons several confused and somewhat put out students named Trevor and Questions Are Raised


** Worse, there probably aren't more than 1-2 Trevors on the train, but plenty being passed by as they make their way through England and Scotland. They arrive at Hogwarts with like 70 confused Trevors stuck to the outside of the train covered in bugs

*** If the train goes through any tunnels or past signals, that might also end very messy if you have people on the outside.

**** Yeah, pretty sure that 'rule' was put as an answer to why they don't just accio Pettigrew when he ran for it, the right answer being Rowling hadn't invented that spell yet and didn't think it through. On the other hand you have Fantastic Beasts casually accioing magical creatures, so who the fuck knows at this point.

***** Is there an answer for why they didn't just stun him and instead chained him with manacles that, in a surprising turn of events which absolutely no-one could have foreseen, were ineffective against someone with the ability to turn into a rat?

****** In-universe answer or the out of universe reason?

Because the out of universe answer is that it didn't exist, because IIRC the first time it pops up is in Goblet of Fire. Along with the way that he needed to escape in the first place for the narrative to work ;)

In universe, we need to come up with a reason - even without a stunning spell, they could have used a body bind (eg, petrificus totalus). I think the best we can do is chalk it up to all of them not thinking straight, really - it's a chaotic, stressful situation where none were at their best. We're not going to get anything more reasonable than that in universe.

***** HP tends to be consistent within each individual book, but have holes when you look at book to book situations. Nothing is going to fix that at this point, really - no sense in finding canon solutions to them. That's part of the fun of fanfiction - going back and seeing how it could change or making it consistent from the start.
