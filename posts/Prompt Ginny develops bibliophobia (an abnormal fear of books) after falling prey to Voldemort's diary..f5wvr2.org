Ron became arachnophobe after the twins transfigured his teddy bear into a giant spider and in my humble opinion, Voldemort (even a teenaged version in a fifty year old diary) is more traumatizing than a spider.

*** Well seeing as it's highly inappropriate for a teacher to be involved with his student, and he'd start seeing her as a sister of sorry that he's helping. I'd see Hermione helping him and finding him attractive. Yeah make it H/Hr and Ginny becoming sort of their little sister.

Frankly, I can't understand how all her brothers never noticed how bad it was when she was possessed. My little brother is 6 years younger than me and I always noticed the littlest differences in his mood

**** you forget it was also ginnys first year at hogwarts so any differences could be waved away as her being different at hogwarts

***** I was joking about the teacher thing, I'm just a Harmony shipper, lol.

Yeah but even if it was as simple as that, I would still pull my brother aside and talk to him. I would be a shit brother if I left him getting progressively worse throughout the school year.
