  With Sirius dead, Harry expected a summer filled with dark times, marinating on how he was to blame. What he did not expect was for the Dursleys to thrust a baby into his arms and declare it his. One night of recklessness was enough, but he refused to leave the baby with the Dursleys. Could he do this at 16 on top of school and extra Defense? (Mentor/Fatherly Snape, eventually.)

  Harry receives a rather unusual 17th birthday present from the Headmaster. A present that changes anything and everything.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me]]) i really love Harry's relationships with his young kids in this.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7737991/chapters/17639245]]) This is a great fic (with sequels) that features Harry and Ginny as parents and lots of Potter family-centric plotlines

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
