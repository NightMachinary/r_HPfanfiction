:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't know if this is the right place to ask this, but I'm looking for a specific fic. I don't remember much about it but...

I think that Harry comes into some sort of inheritance that allows him to...idk, see? Travel? To a different â€˜plane/dimension'. Luna Lovegood is also allowed to go there. There's a lot of drug use, such as a drug called Nyx. I think Harry is a Slytherin, or he's friends with Slytherins. I think it's actually a story where Draco turns Harry into a vampire? I don't know! I know that Snape knows about Draco and Harry. I know that there's a bit of sex and stuff. Hermione is totally against the drugs. But I can't remember much else.
