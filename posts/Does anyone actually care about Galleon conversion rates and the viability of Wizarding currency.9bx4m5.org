** Yes. A story or a book need to be consistent and attention to detail is important. if the protagonist can buy an important object for the same price as a bread its ridiculous. Mostly because in when the protagonist loses such an important object they are quite upset. But why? You can pay for it again its next to free......

** Honestly? I don't. Maybe I should, but I always skip it if they start to go in depth in stories. It's just not something I find interesting enough to pay attention to, and it's not something I focus on in my stories either.

** Not necessarily viability, but it must have reasonable exchange rates or capital controls to prevent people from abusing the system or playing arbitrage games.

In my world, Gringotts set the exchange rate of Galleon into Pound at 5:1 ratio in the 1990s. A very limited amount of Pound could be changed into Galleon at same rate. Exchanging larger amount of Pound into Galleon went by the market price of 1 Oz of real gold, which cost roughly 200 Pounds in the 1990s and 1000 Pounds today.

Due to the massive appreciation of real gold price from 2000 to 2010, the exchange rate from Galleon to Pound is now 20.

** I don't think wizards need muggles for many things, thereby limiting the usefulness of muggle currencies for wizards. If we accept this, then banks are unlikely to want muggle currencies in exchange for Galleons, and likely only do so for muggleborns at a very limited rate (likely with some strongarming from the Ministry).

​

Thus, any kind of currency manipulation or trying to "profit" from this discrepancy is just shut down by the system itself.

** no. its a classic case of, for a lack of a better way to put it, nerds being nerds. focusing on the wrong things.

** I can lump this in under the general heading of Suspension of Disbelief, most of the time.

*However,* when someone does care about it and actually pays attention to this sort of detail, it really makes me sit up and take notice. I don't mean the cliché where Harry uses the value of gold to bankrupt the goblins. I mean when there is a sense of an actual economy and financial implications to consider. It doesn't have to be exact or heavily detailed, just considered.

** Not particularly. Although I do appreciate it if someone goes to the effort to work out a reasonable explanation.

** The exchange rate thing is fine, as you probably can't exchange a large amount of currency so you wouldn't be able to abuse the exchange rate to mess with the economy. However, the canon conversion rate between knuts, sickles, and galleons is ridiculous and stupidly cumbersome.
