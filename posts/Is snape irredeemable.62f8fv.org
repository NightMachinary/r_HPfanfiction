I do not ask this question lightly, but the way i see it is snape willingly joined voldermort, aggreed with their views, (even if only out of anger towards james) and only came back to the light because lily died. He didn't care about the baby nor did he care he was effectivly sentecing families to death by giving the dark tosser part of a prophecy.

So please convince me that he is good. I've stopped reading a lot of stories i enjoyed because he was put in a positive light in them. Also a scene i remember is hermione getting cursed with ever growing teeth with snape saying he doesn't see a difference.

How petty do you have to be to loathe and bully a 11yo just because of who his father is let alone kids you don't even know.

Putting it mildly. Lets consider the horrific ramifications of Neville's boggart.

- The kid was abused by his uncle several times to show magic, including attempted drowning and thrown out of a window. I'm assuming a lot more that just wasn't said, too.\\
- His parents were driven insane by the first cousin of "Voldemort's right hand man" who has just escaped from super prison that no one has ever done so before.\\
- The guards of said jail are soul sucking aura of despair monsters, that will not discriminate according to Dumbledore. Said monsters attacked Harry Potter in front of him.\\
- Just last year a monster was screwing around the school randomly petrifying people, and got several students his age.

Yet his biggest fear is his high school chemistry teacher basically. Even Walter White's students wouldn't have said him.

I never understood that. How did no one see this and decide "Huh. Maybe we need to have a Parent-Teacher conference or something." Lupin didn't say anything. The kids spread the rumor until everyone in Hogwarts had heard it. And what? Nothing was done.

This is one of several moments in the series that convinced me wizards don't care for their young. Or at least view child endangerment totally differently. (Another was when Hagrid takes Harry, Ron, and Malfoy, who are all known to (1) be stupid and (2) not get along, to the forest filled with dangerous animals and has them split up).

McGonagall gets a lot more love than she deserves as a teacher for most of the books imo.

  2) He still joined Voldemort at the beginning. Sure, this itself is redeemable but when added to everything else? He's probably killed and tortured people for fun.
#+end_quote

When Dumbledore asked Snape to kill him, he asks "What about my soul?" Doesn't this imply that he hasn't killed before or least not without remorse?

Also he says something like "Lately only those who I could not save" when asked about how many people that he watched die. I would say that you could interpret it as him not liking seeing people die in front of him.

Toward the end, Dumbledore is dead, Harry Potter that he swore to protect is going to die anyway, everyone hates him and thinks that he is a death rater. He could have easily gone back to being a death eater, helped torture students but he didn't and still helped Harry win.

I mean, he definitely isn't a nice or good person, but I believe that especially in the context of fanfiction, it is possible for him to be redeemed (at least if you interpret his character in a certain way and have specific circumstances that make redemption possible). But then again, I do love redemption stories so I may be biased towards thinking that it is possible to find good in characters that do not seem like they have it in them.

** I think there are two separate issues here.

One, there's Snape's crimes as a Death Eater. He is, I think, redeemed there. One can dismiss his heroism in spying for Dumbledore --- which wasn't limited to gathering information --- as motivated by revenge, but his reluctance to kill Dumbledore in cold blood, even at Dumbledore's request, is evidence that he had repented of that and stands redeemed.

Two, his being a petty, vindictive, generally unpleasant person, who bullies children and abuses authority, is a lesser crime but one of which he has never repented. The only mitigating factor there was the need to maintain his cover; but anything over and above that, he stands guilty.

***** I... think that's a complicated question. We're really never given any explanation for how the killing curse works except for when Moody talks about it a single time in Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts.

I'm willing to bet his explanation was bullshit for a simple reason. Consider:

1. Pretty much every Death Eater is able to cast the curse.
2. Quite a few Aurors are able to cast the curse.

Now, we all know that the Death Eaters are fanatical. But can they truly all be /evil people/? Quite a few of them are like Draco Malfoy. Raised in an environment where they're taught a set of beliefs. A belief system which they're simultaneously grown up indoctrinated to believe is under attack by inferior beings.

Can each Death Eater possibly have enough hate against EACH INDIVIDUAL person they fight against? It seems unlikely.

Aurors are another step removed. In war-time, we're told that Crouch Sr. authorized the use of Unforgivables (possibly specifically against Death Eaters, but I can't remember).

Now Aurors are just doing their job. Granted, they're often fighting for their lives, but is it likely that they can have enough hate against EACH INDIVIDUAL Death Eater? Again, I think that's unlikely.

So assuming that you have to hate for the curse to function /at all/, I can't believe that you have to hate the /specific person/ you're using the curse on.

I think it's likely you don't have to hate a specific person /at all/, rather any hatred would suffice. This hatred can come in form against a person, an idea, a situation, memories, etc.

Snape has had a fucked up life. Some of it was his fault, certainly, but fucked up nonetheless. I don't find it difficult to believe that he could have summoned some hate from somewhere.

** Snape was never a hero he was an antihero. As for being irredeemable I'd say he did redeem himself in the end. By spying on Voldemort and ensuring that Harry was safe from Voldemort.

If you look back he defended Harry against Quirrelmort's curse in book 1. In book 2 he acknowledged that Harry didn't petrify Filtch's cat. Book 3 where everyone loves to bash Snape he clearly went out to the shrieking shack to save Harry and his friends. Even if he refused to listen to Remus and Sirius. I could go on about each incident in every book.

Was Snape a nice guy? No he really wasn't, but being redeemed isn't about shitting sunshine and rainbows it's about trying to make up for your past. Which for him was turning on Voldemort and protecting Harry because he did care for Lily on some level.

** Does he have to be redeemed completely to cancel out some of his acts? Can he die in a neutral state?

I think you're forgetting his treatment of Neville. Unless Frank or Alice did something to him he bullies Neville because he can. That means he could be doing it to others outside of Harry's class too. He's ridiculously petty and awful. He had years before Voldemort came back when he could have tried to be a decent human being but remained awful. Nothing can excuse the way he behaved but equally he did contribute in the second war. I say equally but even if he did help it cannot undo the damage he did in the first war and possibly while keeping his cover in the second. In my opinion he doesn't even have to 'come back to the light' to help. He just has to really hate Voldemort. I would call that selfish not a seeing of the light.

I don't think Snape joined Voldemort for the blood issue but for a fraction of Voldemort's power. Therefore him not killing muggleborns and muggles in the second war doesn't make him good, it just means he's not bad, unfortunately for him by that point he was so far into the negatives on the good-bad scale he was doomed.

Edit: if you didn't already know, the bottom of the fanfiction filters, the bit underneath 'Without' allows you to filter out every story where Snape is listed as a major character. I use it to filter out Snape and Hermione, its not perfect since they can crop up as background characters but it might help if you didn't know already.

** No one is truly irredeemable. There is always a chance for grace and mercy, so long as one repents. So the real question is this: Does Snape ever repent of his evil deeds? That's a complicated, murky question. He certainly never made himself like able (and honest to God, I don't understand how ANYONE thinks he should be shipped with anything other than a therapist and a life skills coach) and her certainly never acted as though he felt any remorse except for the death of Lily Potter.

That said, ultimately he was willing to give his life to save Harry's own and to make the world a better place. Greater Love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his brother. Snape did do that. Was that act alone enough for redemption? As long as we're not talking about a spiritual sense, yes, that is enough. His final act was to reach for the light and repent; that was enough to redeem him.

Given enough time, assuming the trend of contribution is in any form net positive, no amount of negative contributions to the world can be considered irredeemable.

There are, I'm sure, negative impacts a person can contribute to the world that cannot be counter-balanced by equally opposite positive things in a reasonable time-frame. Like mass-genocide.

Snape, however, isn't Hitler. Given the course of his life being unhindered by his sticky death by Voldemort's pet horcrux Nagini, I personally believe that Snape's character would have eventually redeemed himself (not to say he wasn't - I haven't reached the third question, yet).

Despite this being one of the things people love to latch onto, I honestly believe that this period of Snape's life is pretty tame, in regards to positive/negative contribution.

Yes, the Death Eaters were labeled as a terrorist organization by the Ministry of Magic.

Yes, the Death Eaters were - objectively, even - a group of racists and xenophobes, comparable to the magical version of modern-day Neo-Nazis.

However, it is never /ever/ discussed what Snape's /role was/ as a Death Eater. As a matter-a-fact, it's very likely that his main occupation within the Death Eaters was to brew potions. It's often mentioned later in the series that, as an inner-circle Death Eater, that's what his function was. I see no reason why that /wouldn't/ have been his function earlier in his life.

Snape was a bitter and angry teenager who grew up with an abusive father. While he was going to a boarding school for 10 months out of the year, he lived with children who gave him friendship and groomed him to follow and believe in their ideals.

While Snape was a half-blood and raised in the muggle world, he was still indoctrinated like many other characters such as Draco Malfoy. I can't consider /just joining the Death Eaters/ as a huge negative.

The only /proven and irrefutable/ thing that Snape did as a Death Eater was /purposefully/ hand information to the Dark Lord Voldemort that he should have realized would lead to the death of /somebody/. This somebody, to his dismay, was Lily Potter nee Evans.

** Attempting to spare Lily (via Voldemort)

   :END:
Snape, knowing the Dark Lord would have to go after the Potter family, asked Voldemort to spare Lily's life. His friend. The only person he ever held any romantic feelings for.

I do /not see this as a bad thing/.

Realistically - and Snape is nothing if not a realistic, if perhaps a bit too cynical - there was no fucking way he could have convinced Voldemort to spare the entire family.

He didn't do /nothing/, and attempting to spare /anyone/ is a net-positive. Even if his reasons were selfish.

** Attempting to spare Lily (via Spying for Dumbledore)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: attempting-to-spare-lily-via-spying-for-dumbledore
   :END:
Many people will criticize Snape for going to Dumbledore and not asking about sparing James and Harry, as well.

While there was certainly no reason to /not/ ask for them to be saved, I'm not sure why people make a big deal out of it.

Do you honestly believe that Snape was under the impression that Dumbledore would have only protected Lily? Why is the distinction important?

LET US BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS POINT:

Snape was FULLY AWARE that going to Dumbledore would result in James and Harry Potter being saved. Nothing else makes sense. Dumbledore asking for that clarification was HIS OWN MANIPULATION of Snape.

The fact that people don't see that is truly baffling to me.

** Spying for Dumbledore
   :PROPERTIES:

This section alone is huge.

Snape, throughout the books, is identified of having reported:

1. The dates, times and force involved of attacks against homes and businesses.
2. Plans that Voldemort is attempting to follow through on.
3. information about known (to him) Death Eaters.
4. False information to Voldemort about the Order's plans/members.

Trying to gauge the sheer number of lives that Snape saved while spying for Dumbledore is staggering. Truly staggering.

How many times did Snape come through when no one else could?

** The occasions when Snape /saved lives/
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-occasions-when-snape-saved-lives

1. Attempted to save Lily/James/Harry.
2. Saved Harry from falling off his broom.
3. Later refereed a match to prevent it from happening again.
4. Brewed the potion to de-petrify students.
5. Saved the Ministry Six by informing the Order about them leaving school. "Padfoot's was taken to the place where it's hidden" indeed.
6. Saved Katy Bell's life from Draco's failed attempt to kill Dumbledore.
7. Saved Draco's life from Harry's /sectumsempra/.
8. Spared Draco having to kill Dumbledore.

** Conclusion
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: conclusion
   :END:
Snape is, objectively, an asshole. He's also petty and a horrible teacher.

But through his acts he saved /hundreds/ if not /thousands/ of people both directly and indirectly.

The idea that anyone can think of Snape as /irredeemable/ if fucking /astounding/ to me.

Outside of Harry and Dumbledore, Snape was singlehandedly the most instrumental character in the books to bringing Voldemort to his demise.

Snape, outside of Dumbledore, saved more people's lives than any other character in the series. Yes, including Harry.

His motives may have not always been innocent. He may have been cruel while doing it.

But Snape was *by far* a redeemed character.

** I think he's a very complicated and sympathetic character, even if I wouldn't be friends with him.

In the real world, do we look at people who have joined a gang at 17 and got out at 19 as irredeemable for life? Harry was born when Lily was 20, which means that Snape would have been 19-20 at the time when he had turned his back on Voldemort for the rest of his life, which is 18 years in total. Only 3 of those years were spent actually fighting in a war, which means that he had spent the same time or a bit more as a spy for the Order than he did actually Death Eating. So, as an actual adult, he was risking his life to fight for the right side. In essence, he had joined a gang in high school, and as a result, his only childhood friend died, so he spent the rest of his life atoning for it by going undercover.

He might have been an asshole, yes, but he's still a war hero. Having a shitty personality =/= evil. He probably shouldn't have been teaching, but I'm guessing Dumbledore wanted to keep an eye on him. If we look at the bigger picture, the ministry employees who sent thousands of muggleborns to their deaths were all probably perfectly pleasant with nice little families, just like in Nazi Germany. Snape's role was more high-risk and important.

I think Snape is brilliantly written. He's very clearly severely dysphoric, depressed and never had the chance to get over his teenage grievances, just like Sirius, but for different reasons. You can notice that Lupin turned out a lot more mature than those two because he had the chance to wallow about in the real world and grow up. Sirius and Snape, on the other hand, are two overgrown teenagers. They're 35 by OotP, and yet neither has gotten over their respective childhoods and teenage animosity, because neither has had the chance to move on. Of course, Snape was not in prison, but I'm going to guess highly depended on Dumbledore and restricted in movement, and not exactly welcomed back into society.

If you think back on Snape joining the teaching force, he was 21 and dealing with the fall of Voldemort, his recent arrest and Lily's death. You'd notice that half of the children he was teaching were around to see him floating upside down and got a good look at his underwear. If he didn't become a scary overgrown bat, they would have eaten him alive back there. Of course, it is higly unprofessional and petty, but Snape is not a mature person.

Of course, we also have to remember that JKR wrote him in a book for children and he was initially a very cartoonish children's decoy villain for about two books, just your typical evil teacher. The Dursleys were like that at first, if you look at the first two books and take them at face value, they're extremely violently abusive, but in a children's book they're more like a cartoon representation of a cold family mistreating an orphan. After PoA, the tone shifts and Snape slowly grows a personality along with the rest of them.

** Snape as the character he is, absolutely irredeemable.

Snape as the character Rowling wanted him to be, totally different question.

I think Rowling wanted to write a grumpy, emotionally scarred character who made a (albeit terrible) mistake when he was a teenager, and this is the only way to make up for the harm caused because of it. Instead, because we're reading a children's book that just sort of morphed into YA literature, we're seeing Rowling's evolution as a writer. Don't get me wrong, she's a fantastic author. But a lot of the problems we see in the book, and yes, in Snape's character, are from her not being sure where to take the plot, and therefore his character development. In addition, this is being written from 3rd person limited, and Harry's perspective almost exclusively (exceptions being the prologues). We have only ever seen what Harry has seen and thought about something.

So, as he is, terrible human being who needed to chill it with the Lily obsession.

As the character I think he was meant to be, probably okay.

i don't think this is incoherent within canon at all. she thinks he's 'emotionally scarred', but not just grumpy- he's genuinely a bully. she also thinks he's wholly repentant for being a DE and the like, because he feels remorse for inadvertently murdering his best friend and wants to do right by her by adopting her ideals, in an abstract sense

** Its hard to call someone Irredeemable whos braving the dangers Snape is braving to help the "light", but I can completely understand why folks think he is, and to be honest, I struggle to even come close to saying yes hes redeemable.

His terrible teaching and attitude towards students alone should be the primary reason. But he also turned his back on Lily, joined Voldemort willingly, and had to have murdered and/or raped to do so most likely.

To be honest Ive always questioned the whole story behind the Snape/Lily/Voldemort interaction. Lily would obviously not "fall in love" with Snape as a death eater or who he was at the end of Hogwarts and post Hogwarts. So even if Voldemort had spared Lily, what would that of done? If Snape was that broken up by her death, would he have been able to and willing to force her into a slave position, or feed her love potions or kidnap her or whatever he would of done since she would not of willingly been with him?

It just strikes me as odd...

--------------

We know from canon that to become a healer, potion master or auror, you need to have potion NEWTs. If we combine that with Snapes horrible teaching as well as his requirements of an O to be able to go to NEWT classes, we can easily assume that he solely was responsible for the decline of all three professions. And two of them were actually important for the war, so due to the shit he was pulling he helped Voldemort immensely to help win the war.

** No, Snape is not irredeemable. People make mistakes, and if their future actions show that they do regret those mistakes and that they really are trying to fix them and are sacrificing things for that goal and trying to be the better person, it can and often enough does redeem them.

Snape has all of that, except for the last one. He does regret sending Lily to her death, whatever the reason behind that regret. He is trying to fix what he did by working against Tom and his merry bunch. And he is sacrificing things for that goal.

The problem is, in acting on the envy he feels for Harry for being the one Lily chose, an envy for her one and only child which makes it blind envy, he does show that he is not trying to become a better person. This very much is his own ghost to fight against, though, and is it not a stretch to say that it always was possibly for him to try to ignore that envy and do right by the people he is surrounded by. And the problem is exacerbated by the fact that many a writer simply do not know how to write a realistic Snape who would choose that path. He is a flawed person, very flawed, and those flaws define him; for a story to portray him accurately it does have to give him either those flaws or an actual reason not to have them, which actually is quite hard. And it gets /even harder/ when you realise that due to the standard of interactions we see between Harry and Snape in canon it becomes close to impossible to say anything about his redemption or lack of thereof if the Harry in a given story is egging him on, as Snape's flaws mean that he /will/ lash out if he is egged on even if he is attempting to be the better person.

It is for the last reason that it's hard to say whether or not Snape got his redemption in “Seventh Horcrux”, for example; his behaviour is not much different from that in canon, but at the end he is pretty much a tired old man (though not “old” old), but he does seem to be lashing out at people, but both of those people (Harry and Sirius) are egging him on.

For what it's worth, I did feel that he redeemed himself in a story called “Digging for the Bones”. It is a story in which he actually is Harry's father (open spoiler so I don't feel guilty about just writing it), for reasons that actually do make sense and do not make Lily into a harlot or something along those lines, and he is kept just as flawed there as he is in canon, he does have the very core of what made him “Severus Snape”, he has his cutting remarks and his tendency to jump to conclusions and many other traits that make him him. And it is a story in which, despite the fact that not everything is right at the end, despite the fact that it would probably take just as many words as the story has to explore all the things that it left hanging with the implication that they will be problems for the two in the future, it's also alright because he worked hard to get over himself and become a better person. It is a bit of an angsty story, I do admit, due to dealing with issues that generally tend to end up very upsetting emotionally and doing it realistically, but it has quite enough of those heart-warming moments when you would normally expect something but then Snape does something else instead, something that shows that he really is trying even if it is not easy for him. If you aren't put off by the open spoiler bit, I wholeheartedly recommend it.

2. he is right bastard to neville and harry once again show he doesnt give a damn about anyone but himself.

I think he is irredeemable, the only thing tethering him to the light side at all is that he killed his fucking best friend (ok: And having a debt to Dumbledore who kept him out of Azkaban) who he was in love with and tries to atone for it

It's tragic, but I still loath him and I'd have killed him in Harry's place (probably after Sirius died or earlier: After Pettigrew escaped, partly because of him!), sadly canon Harry is too much of a goody two shoes (sorry, I don't have a problem with being nice to people who haven't done anything to you - but sitting down and just taking abuse (and Snape is abusing the students, he's in a position of power over them and loves putting them down to prop himself up and feel good!) is not something I like (and I have been bullied at school for 5 years (!) - I was powerless to stop it back then (parents and teachers didn't really try, they didn't want to expell the bullies!), but today I'd take those bullies to court (something my parents sadly didn't do...they didn't even sue the school for not providing a save learning environment, despite the fees they payed for that school (private catholic school - and they ask me why I think there is no god, if Christians can ignore bullying like that then I don't want their god to be real and if it turns out he is? Well fuck you god! You are a douchebag!)!)

ps: So I am kind of in Snapes shoes (I just don't teach, but even if I would be teaching I'd not take their parents actions into account when forming oppinions about their offspring - I might take a closer look at them than at other kids, but I would not punish them harsher etc.!)
