So I'm not looking for fics that make the light devils in disguise but more along the lines of Harry ripping the order and friends a new one for all the shit he's been through, especially the lack of support after witnessing murders, and their failure to do anything worthwhile. I in no way want some bullshit like the dark are actually the good guys. For the pairing H/HR is a no, I do not want Harry to suddenly forgive Hermione because he was always in love with her or some similar stupid shit. Slash is a even bigger no.

I'll take fics where Harry simply doesn't forgive his friends and Dumbles for forcing him to get over the murders without help from friends and therapy.


** well, i know of some WhinyLittleBitch!Harry, but he runs into the arms of Misunderstood!Voldemort in all of those, so....

*** I now want a story where the author /deliberately/ wrote WhinyLittleBitch!Harry, if only so I can scoff at it.
