:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The fic starts with a dinner/gathering of people and they start to reminisce about Harry.

The group included Harry's brother (can't remember name,) Hermione, Ron, Luna, Neville, Fleur, and Nymphadora. I think there might have been a couple of others there as well.

Harry dated Fleur at one time but she tried using her allure on him to discover some of the secrets he was hiding from her and they broke up. Tonks dated him at one point as well I think, if I'm remembering correctly.

He ended up dying and in his will, he left everything to his younger brother.

I think the title had Lion in it or Harry's nickname was something to do with a Lion?

Please help, it's been bothering me for ages! Lol


** It doesn't have Lion in the title, but I think it was called "The King" or something similar. It disappeared though
