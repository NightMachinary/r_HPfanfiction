** There is a fic called 'Temptation on the Warfront' by alizarincrims0n

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594]]

“Draco Malfoy is forced into hiding with the Golden Trio and dragged into their search for horcruxes. What ensues is a journey of redemption, unexpected friendships and an unwanted, turbulent romance with Harry Potter. Warnings for swearing, sexual content, and dark themes.”

It's slash though, but I wholeheartedly recommend it because it's absolutely wonderful.

** I actually read a fic that had this basic theme but I can't remember the name of it and unfortunately it was unfinished... but the author managed to keep Malfoy as the asshole he is while writing a realistic type redemption theme during the Horcrux hunt with the trio. It didn't have any slash and it was only posted on FFN. If anyone's interested I'll try and find it. It stuck out to me because the characters really stayed true to how they are in the books and didn't fall into cliche-type fanon stuff.

** There's an excellent fic that makes Draco a central character:

Chosen by 5moreminutes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16832419/chapters/39513448]]

"Draco Malfoy has a mission to complete, and no one can help him. Spending nights stuck on Prefect duty with Hermione Granger only adds to his problems. Doesn't it? Or is it possible that their unlikely relationship could alter the course of the Second Wizarding War -- if the Boy Who Made All the Wrong Choices can get this one thing right?"

Few of the OP's suggestions actually happen, but this fic essentially follows the process of Draco becoming quasi-part of the Golden Trio while adhering to many aspects of canon. One of my all-time favorite fics, I adore it!

** One thing I'd really love to see is similar to this, I've seen it in Drarry fics before, but I'd like to see it in a platonic one-- what would have happened in the bathroom scene if Harry chose not to fight Draco, but give him sympathy, seeing that he was basically having a fcking panic attack. I've only ever seen it in slash.

I love any kinds of proper Draco redemption though.

**** They're pretty common on Ao3 as a Drarry fic, people fixing that scene. I love the books, but that was a scene I would have loved to have gone differently. It would have been the perfect moment for things to take a turn, and for Harry to show Draco kindness when he needs it the most.

Malfoy for most of the books was just the evil prick from the snake house where zuko had redeeming traits early on we spent alot of season 2 in zuko's head If Zuko was redeemed in season 2 it wouldnt have been as meaningful Zuko in season 3 had everything he thought he wanted but decided to turn away from that to train the avatar

** Honestly, I find this unlikely. He's an arrogant bigot (and no it's not because of his family, he spent 9 months at Hogwarts surrounded by an environment that frowns upon outright racism) who only turned away from the side of the Death Eaters because he didn't have to stomach to kill and be tortured by the Dark Lord. A far better character would have been Crabbe or Goyle. Plus it'd put another spin on them other than "stupid strong boy".

*** I love the stories where CrabbenGoyle are more than stupid strong boys, even if it's just one of them. I recently read a fic where Harry (not sure if he was the main character or secondary) referred to them as one name because you never see one without the other and "are you sure they aren't one person? I'm not convinced." It was a mentor!Snape fic, probably a time travel because I'm in one of those kicks, and when I saw that I hoped for CrabbenGoyle character development. I was disappointed in that sense but it was a well written story. Another they were super loving and caring to animals, but still very little face time. Do you have any recs for them? I'm writing a fic and recently had an idea where they would fit in beautifully, and I can't wait to get to my notes to jot it down.

lol The spoiled brat was "misguided". I'm sure he had a big fluffy, soft heart while using racial slurs, trying to get Buckbeak executed, imperiusing Rosmerta, committing attempted murder on Ron, Katie and Dumbledore and joining a terrorist organisation. I seriously do not understand why so many people want to "redeem" Draco. He grew up in a rich, loving family. His father being abusive is purely fiction stemming from the movies. He */chose/* to be evil. He wasn't forced, coerced, misguided, etc.

I want to see a fic where Draco attacks Harry (or one of his friends) and Harry warns him this is his last chance. So when Draco attacks a second time Harry mops the floor with him and stomps his guts out.

*** Young minds are impressionable, yes, he definitely had his own free will, yes he chose certain actions.

But, he never killed a living, innocent person like his father had done, that is where he stems out differently. Redeeming him is popular because of the fact that he has at least one quality that can be expanded on, it's not like they're trying to redeem Lucius.

Lucius has killed, Snape has killed, Draco is 16 (or at least, he was), a 16 year old can still be swayed, can still change, but changing a 40-50 year old man? No.

You have to look at things from a psychological point of view, what you can change, what caused him to do the things he did, it's never just “they're evil”, no one is born a monster, they are crafted, and since he was brought up in a family where multiple people believed the things that he was taught, he was surrounded by bad influences.

There is so much you can do with their character arc, so many things that you can change, so many things that you can put in place that can make him change!

That is why I love writing him, the fascination of his character draws me to him, because there are so many possibilities!

Oh, please. He had all the choices in the world. The same choices people like Andromeda Tonks and Sirius Black had. (Oh, and Regulus too, somehow I always forget him.) Draco just lacked the strength and will to act.

Edit: Or did Draco lack a true friend? It just got me thinking- Andromeda had the love and support of her husband, Sirius had James who literally took him in from the street and even Regulus had Kreacher. But Draco only has Dumb and Dumber. I suppose if Astoria Greengrass played a larger part in Draco's school years steering him away from the Death Eaters he could have redeemed himself.

***** The friend thing is probably a big factor, but honestly "he had all the choice in the world" yea so does everyone and most people aren't working to topple evil dictatorships or getting degrees in medicine or law in order to eradicate aids or stop deforestation or whatever.. ppl aren't usually hero's, that's kinda what makes hero's hero's you know.

Also I kinda like research about how the holocaust (or other horrible shit) could have happened and the general consensus is that people are easy to brainwash and usually do what they're told.

+it probably didn't occur to Draco that his world few might be flawed until he saw first hand what Voldemort was, people don't normally go around thinking they're evil or wrong
