Albus Potter is sent back in time to the year 1962 at the age of eleven, gets sorted into slytherin, befriends the kids who will become the death eaters, fights alongside them during the First Wizarding War, and is then transported back to his own time (and also back into his eleven year old body) near the end of the war in 1981.

After he gets back, he has to come to terms with his own PTSD from the war, all his friends being either dead or imprisoned, him having to attend Hogwarts again with his friends' grandchildren, and the fact that Wizarding society views him and his friends as monsters; while also trying to keep his past a secret from his friends (particularly Scorpius) and family who know that something is wrong, but not what.


** He was doomed by his name. Anyways, it will be fun to read Albus Severus Potter fighting his grandparents in the war.

** If Albus Severus Potter was sent back to the 1960's and was at Hogwarts he'd be in school with his maternal grandparents as well as Bellatrix, Andromeda , Narcissa Black and Lucius Malfoy. Probably the Lestrange brothers as well but I haven't seen an exact date for their birthdays/birth year.

*Arthur's* birthday is February 6th 1950 - Hogwarts = September of 1961- June 1968

*Molly's* birthday is October 30th in 1949 or 1950 - Hogwarts = September 1961- June 1968 or September 1962- June 1969

The Black Family tree had birth years for Bellatrix ,Narcissa and Lucius. Andromeda was burnt off but I assume she's in between her sisters based on where her burnt mark is on the Black Family tree.

*Bellatrix* was born in 1951 so -Hogwarts = September 1962- June 1969 or September 1963- June 1970

(I assume Andromeda would be in between these two , which is why I head-canon Bellatrix as being at Hogwarts September 1962- June 1969 and Narcissa being at Hogwarts between September 1966 - June 1973 putting *Andromeda* at Hogwarts September 1964 - June of 1971 but she could also be various other years depending on when exactly her birthday is.)

*Narcissa* was born in 1955 so Hogwarts = September1966 - June 1973 or September 1967 -June 1974

*Lucius* was born in 1954 so Hogwarts = September 1965- June 1972 or September 1966- June 1972 (pretty sure he was Headboy when he met Severus Snape, so it's more likely to be 1965-1972)

Lily Evans was born January 30th 1960 - Hogwarts = September 1971- June 1978

James was born March 27th 1960 - Hogwarts = September 1971- June 1978

** Plot Twist: Back in the 60's, Tom Riddle is uninterested in girls and only care about immortality and power, and so do most of his male followers. Albus somehow ends up the Slytherin stud who bangs all the babes.

*** James and Lily were born on March and January 1960 respectively and Molly and Arthur are older. Unfortunately, Albus Severus Potter cannot be his own great-grandfather.

** I really do love this idea, but like how the hell are you gonna make a blood supremacist a character people want to read. You're gonna have to pull one hell of a redemption arc off.
