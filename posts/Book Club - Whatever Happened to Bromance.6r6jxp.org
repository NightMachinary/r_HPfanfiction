What did y'all think of *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5445767][Whatever Happened to Bromance?]]*? Let me know in the comment section down below.

The next fic is *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/][Hogwarts Houses Divided]]* by /Inverarity/. It's a canon-compliant next-generation fic, and it is quite long (200,000 words), so I'll give you a month.

And:

#+begin_quote
  Cormac didn't want to let up. "Seriously, what's wrong with you man! She comes in here looking for you, all but begging to see your sphynx, and you send her away like a broken broomstick! I'd stick my bludger so far up her quaffle she'd be out for weeks! And Harry fuckin' Potter just sends her away! You must be getting more tail than you know what to do with, if a girl like that's not even worth your time!"

And:

#+begin_quote
  "If she came up to me practically falling out of her top, I'd make like the Hogwarts Express and railroad the bitch!"

** I read this everytime I slog through a story that initially looks interesting but then devolves into contrived melodramatic angst. It's like having one drink after a night of binging, just sets you straight, clears your head.

It provides a nice dose of deconstructive realism, in that, only JK's twisted mind would have a clueless 15-16 yr old boy refusing a girl like Romilda.

Having someone aggressively pursue you is actually scary, even if you're a hormonal teenage boy. Romilda actually tried to drug the fuck out of him. I would be running too.

**** Yeah, same. Looking back it would have been fine and she was nice but at the time it just freaked me out a little bit and I didn't know how to react. Maybe because I just wasn't used to girls propositioning me rather than the other way around? I don't know, it was just really weird at the time and I was too uncomfortable with the situation to do anything.

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** This fic doesn't need a detailed analysis because that's not what it's for. It's balls-out comedy and loses steam on a reread, but the first time it's full of lolz. Many people here recommend frankly bad fanfic all the time. Skip Prince of Slytherin for once and read this instead, it's great for a laugh. Better with alcohol.
