Looking for fics where something happens where wizardkind and sentient magical creatures die out, except for one survivor, who has to handle caring for magical flora and fauna.

For example, everyone magical dies, but Harry has to start up a farm to restore magical life back to health, etc.

Crossovers welcome, thanks! I know it's oddly specific, but any fics that fit are encouraged.

It's not one person surviving. 2012 crossover where the radiation is killing everything magical. Harry leads a team to build an ark and leave Earth to find a new home for magical civilization.

Then they run into Cylons.

*** As with all Darth Marrs stories, this one starts strong and then becomes more and more and more weird as the time goes on. I had to put it down eventually because it became unreadable.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.
