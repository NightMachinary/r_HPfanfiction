Just as it says.. fics where Harry recognizes and realizes the unworthiness of Adults in his life, especially the ones who were supposed to take care of him.

Examples include him unwilling to forgive them or just not responsive to their attentions which he deems as too late. (Not looking for Harry joins Voldemort)


** /hem canon hem/

kidding, check linkffn(Honour Thy Blood) and mostly Harry's relationship with Dumbledore, especially later on.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

*** I thought of Canon as well, hesitating before posting this request. I guess I just wanted something more blunt , and Harry to acknowledge and , and react to it properly! Thanks, will check out this fic, I've seen this fic recommended more than once, it must be good.

** Linkffn(Don't Get Mad Get Apathetic By birdwoman95) might be somewhat close to what you're looking for. Granted Sirius and Remus are exempt from his new outlook.

Linkffn(The Life He Leads By GeneralStarfox) might also work, although it's not a central theme. The moment I'm thinking of also happens somewhat later in the story, so you might not want to bother.

I am okay with fics that don't have this, although fics with Sirius finally realizing his foolishness will also be great. Don't get me wrong, I love Sirius , it's just that I've been reading fics where people just glaze over the fact that he left his godson to get revenge, when there were resources available to him via law and incarceration. That prompted me to request these types of fics in first place. Everyone expects Harry to behave like anAdult when at most we see him at 17, he's a child! And Sirius is just totally forgiven in Canon and fanfics!

  What if, in fifth year, Harry did just that? An independent Harry story with some OOC, no real bashing, but not a big fan of some of the big players. No pairings. Rating for some curse words. First attempt at publishing on this site... we'll see.

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end.

** Basically the early plot of Brutal Harry (and I strongly recommend this to anyone who hasn't read it). Note that despite the title and description that Harry is not a psychopath but just someone who is willing to deal out extreme violence to protect himself and those he cares about. linkffn(Brutal Harry by Lordsfire)

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.
