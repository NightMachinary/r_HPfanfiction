Fanon claims that the muggleborn population is on the rise, but the numbers don't support it.

Hermione is the only muggleborn Gryffindor student in her year. The only confirmed muggleborns attending Hogwarts at the same time as her are Justin Finch-Fletchley and Dennis & Colin Creevey. The few other muggleborns with any plot relevance in the books are Lily Evans, Moaning Myrtle, Ted Tonks, and Kendra Dumbledore.

Think about it. The muggleborn with the most amount of focus outside of Hermione (& arguably Lily) is /Moaning Myrtle/. Ted Tonks is the /only/ living muggleborn outside of Hogwarts Harry meets (and he gets murdered!). wtf JKR.


** Keep in mind that Harry is not a reliable narrator. There could be six hundred muggleborn kids in Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, yet Harry knows the names of approximately twelve people combined in both houses.

I just find it strange that the idea of "muggleborns on the rise" is something most people take for granted in fanon when Harry has only met four living muggleborns in canon (& three were very minor characters).

They /are/ rare, even if it's because they're irrelevant to the plot. Why didn't JKR make irrelevant characters (the quidditch team, DA, etc) muggleborns? It's probably because she can't do math, like everything else, but still. Would there be a plot difference if Cho or Cormac were muggleborns?

I also think it was a bad move on JKR's part to have muggleborn persecution be a major part of the books, but only have one major muggleborn character, and "center it on halfbloods" as you said.

I don't think Cho is seeker in her 4th year if she's a muggleborn. Thus changing a huge chunk of OotP. The Slug Club looks a lot less like "old boys' club" if Cormac 'I hunt with Rufus Scrimgeour' isn't there or is a muggleborn.

Both Harry and Hermione are muggle-raised and still pretty ignorant of basic ins and outs by DH. Upgrading Colin only stands to add more "muggleness" to the story.

Very small sample size lol. And everyone sucked at broom riding other than Harry, including Draco & Neville. No first years other than him were allowed their own brooms either.

And confirmed muggleborns /are/ rare in canon, which is all we really know about their population size. Another commenter calculated they would be about 20% or less of the wizarding population based on some other canon info, which I can mostly agree with.

The good guys can have muggleborns but it's better to show purebloods and halfblood fighting the death eaters since they don't /have/ to. They can live their lives semi-peacefully even under Voldemort's reign but they still stand up for what's right.

** I imagine a significant portion of them were probably killed in Voldemort's first go at power.

And well, I mean, if you have three Muggleborns one year, then having six the next year lets the media scream about how Muggleborn numbers have LITERALLY DOUBLED OVER THE LAST YEAR! Apologies for bringing real world politics in here, but it happens in the Western World all the time at the moment. I mean, Britain has 3% Black and 2% (ish) Pakistani and not even 5% Muslim populations and our Media is constantly banging on about how they're 'flooding the nation' and other such immensely misleading bullshit. It doesn't actually matter how many Muggleborns there really are, people who feel their culture is being changed by incomers who they perceive as enemies will always use evocative language to make the problem sound as big as they feel it actually is.

I imagine the fanon way of talking about it is a mix of that real-world 'issue' leaking in, the fact that someone started it back in the day before we got any real confirmation on numbers (Harry is an utterly unaware moron who could've been in school with a billion people and he'd never have noticed until at least a million of them tried to kill him) and it just propagated outward until it became a headcanon, some people empathising too much with the Pureblood Magical-Nazis and their 'it's all about cultural change, not just Muggleborns being mud' explanations, the fact that we all tend to ignore any numbers that Rowling comes up with due to her maths-ineptitude and subsequently make up our own that make more sense, some people just plain misremembering, some forgetting the canon numbers and thus just going with the assumption that the Purebloods wouldn't bullshit that much over Muggleborn numbers, that kind of thing.

** In canon, their are several reasons to rationalize this.

1. Harry's main interactions are with a select group of people, otherwise he generally makes no note of them in the books. And these fall into mostly his immediate friends and peers (Ron and Hermione, dorm-mates, quidditch team, etc.) or people who antagonize him for one reason or another. Most of his antagonists (like it or not) are Slytherin's and thus not likely to be muggleborn in general. You could rephrase this as a more broad question asking why does Harry interact with so few Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, and the answer would be roughly the same?
2. Muggleborns are not that important to the story. And yes blood purity is central to the story, but let me give you real world examples. Did Nazi Germany, the Ottoman Empire, the Golden Horde (and countless others) fall because they committed genocide against various minorities within their control? No, they fell because outside parties opposed and defeated them (along with innate structural problems within and without). Voldemort wasn't defeated because he persecuted muggleborns and muggles; he was defeated because people opposed him for a variety of reasons ranging from taking over the government, dark magic, revenge and so on. The story of the muggleborns is just not really important then to the overall narrative, and the book are already fairly large as it is. Its not A Song of Ice and Fire after all.
3. Muggleborns aren't needed to drive the plot at any point really. Most of the good and bad guys are from entrenched families in the society. And thus Harry's main interaction and glimpses at the magical world come from those same good and bad guys. A muggleborn is just less likely to know what is going on and why to explain to Harry (and thus the readers).
4. The idea of blood purity is odd in that while magic does appear in muggleborns, it also is passed down genetically or similarly in wizard-children, with an unknown amount of squib children also existing. Why this is open to debate, but arguably the most succinct answer is that their is some unquantified quality that must appear in a person in order to manifest magical abilities. Perhaps its mental (nature vs nurture), or even genetic, but as to what that actually is up in the air.

Anyway, just some thoughts.

** I believe Mary McDonald, a housemate of Lily, was also Muggleborn (The one Mulciber hexed at one point). But overall, you're right in that not many major characters in the universe are muggleborns.

This, however, is something I believe has mostly to do with Harry's social circles simply not having many of them.

I always liked to believe that the Lily-Severus situation (a muggleborn living in the same place as a halfblood/pureblood) was less an extreme coincidence and more something that happens plenty. This would also allow the non-muggleborns to minimize the risk of muggleborns exposing their world with their lack of knowledge.

** Using this [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/numbers.htm][semi-canon reasoning for the population]] and bumping it up to 15k, my personal headcanon is that Muggleborns make up less than 20% of the population. If one believes that Muggleborns are decended from Squibs (at least 3 generations back) and Squibs are rare (less than 2% from Halfblood and pureblood population) then the Squibs that left the wizarding world 3 or 4 generations ago are just now having their descendants re-enter the wizarding world as witches and wizards. If a Squib has 3 kids, and their children have three kids, and their children' children have three kids, etc there are plenty of opportunities to have a witch or wizard in the family somewhere.

Alternatively, the 'Muggleborn' population might be 'artifically' boosted a bit by what I call the 'Dean Thomas cases' (thought to be Muggleborn but actually half-blood for whatever reasons), so that may also skew the numbers.

The reason why Muggleborns are 'rare' in canon? JKR didn't want to focus on them as much.

**** Purebloods are defined as having all your grandparents be wizards, regardless of their own blood status, so in 2 generations of muggleborns marrying together, you get purebloods.

And yet even with that uncommonly broad definition, Halfbloods are still half of the population. That suggest that a lot of muggle blood is flowing into the wizarding world, either through muggleborns or by marriages to muggles. The second sounds like it should be rather more rare than the first: so yeah, it's fair to say they are "replacing" purebloods, in a sense that in only a few generation all wizards will be descended from them.

Yeah, but I doubt muggleborns would have access to these, which JKR herself acknowledged, so including those things would actually increase pureblood numbers.

This is kinda canon actually (or as canon as JKR's interviews are). She said all muggleborns had a wizard or witch somewhere in their family tree. It would fit canon to have squibs be sent for adoption though.

Interesingly enough, Pottermore also claims that all purebloods have muggles in their family tree, including the sacred 28, and the reason the Weasleys were known as blood traitors was because they freely acknowledged their muggle ancestry despite being on the list.

Fanon says a lot of stuff that just isn't logical. Muggleborns are increasing? How squibs are extremely rare (1 in 100 at most, 1 in 1000 at least) Muggleborns aren't increasing, Muggleborns aren't new blood to keep the pureblood lines active, magic isn't dying in the lines of Purebloods or any such fanon nonsense. Genetic fanon that is extremely illogical really gets to me.

I honestly don't really see how in a world of wizards, families have inbreeding problems unless they also hate pureblood wizards from other countries. Science tells us the minimum amount of people to avoid inbreeding is 50. Sacred Twenty-Eight covers more than half of that just marry purebloods from Beauxbatons and Durmstang and inbreeding should never be an issue.

*** 50 is the minimum number for a population to not die out from inbreeding, which says nothing about genetic defects accumulating. If you want examples from real life, look up the Habsburg, which married a in a noble population that was much bigger than 50 individuals, or look up the Beke of Martinique, who are about 3000 and are still accumulating defects like dwarfism.

**** That's partly correct it's not just dying out it's against inbreeding depression. It's literally called the 50/500 rule and is used in the conservation of populations. 50 is the minimum in Protecting against inbreeding depression, which means the group stays fertile and can continue to pass on their traits while incurring minimum physiological effects. I already know about the Hapsburg lip. 500 is the minimum to protect against genetic drift.

Regardless claiming things like Black madness because canon wise they marry 2nd cousins once, is actually ridiculous which was my point.

Secondly, the Hapsburg family has no comparison, you can't honestly tell me that there was more European nobility vs pureblood wizarding families across all of Britain, Ireland, and Europe. Every family in Beauxbatons and Durmstrang aren't related to wizarding Britain. Third cousins share approximately 3% of DNA, it shouldn't be that hard in the wizarding world to keep it at 3rd cousins.
