Vernon - depends on how much business Grunnings does in the EU, he might have been motivated to vote remain... I'd guess leave, too, though.

***** Not to get into the whole Brexit thing but someone I know cited the immigration of non-whites as a reason for why they voted leave. Some people are just thick and racist! I could definitely imagine Vernon doing that.

Weirdly this still hasn't happened three years after the Brexit vote.

**** I think you have the relationship the wrong way around. To be fair, so does most fanfic. But in canon, it's Petunia "wearing the trousers" in 4 Privet Drive, not Vernon.

In the prologue to PS (the only time we see Vernon's PoV), while he thinks wizards are silly and unseemly, he doesn't /hate/ them. What terrifies him most about magic/wizards is Petunia's extremely negative reaction to their being mentioned. It's clear that Vernon takes the lead from Petunia when it comes to disliking magic.

Her reaction and what little he knows about the magical world ("dark lord murdered harrys parents") is all he has to go by. I dont see how this proves she is "wearing the trousers".

They are a caricature of traditional (in their opinion "normal") gender/family roles.

She is the housewife that cooks, cleans, does gardening and gossips with the neighbours.

He earns the money, reads the newspaper and decides what to vote.

Because of the specific emphasis in the text?

  He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. *There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.* He didn't blame her --- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks...

  [...]

  Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat *nervously*. “Er --- Petunia, dear --- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?”

  [...]

  Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name “Potter.” He decided *he didn't dare*. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son --- he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?”

  [...]

  “Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”

  “Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.”

  *He didn't say another word* on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.

It's a repeated theme in the chapter that Vernon is willing to discuss magic, but has to work up the courage to do so because he is afraid of Petunia's reaction - and then when he does finally bring himself to do it, she reacts badly and he quickly backs down, though he continues to worry about it.

The picture painted is one in which Vernon dislikes anything unusual like people dressing strangely or using unknown slang, but it's very much Petunia who has a specific dislike of magic, one that Vernon defers to.

******* That actually raises the (in my opinion lovely) idea of Vernon secretly being super interested and intrigued by the prospect of magic, and having to spend a decade hiding his abject fascination with Harry whilst doing all he can to encourage Harry's magical ability/outbursts/potential on the down-low.

#+begin_quote
  Vernon could hear the sound of Petunia scurrying about in the kitchen below, even as his own regrettably unsubtle feet reached the top of the flight of stairs. He stopped and turned his head around, taking a moment to double check that his wife wasn't looking up at him. Thankfully, she wasn't, and the clangs and scuffles of her activity in the kitchen had yet to stop, so step by step he continued forward towards his nephew's bedroom door with all the stealthiness and sneakery he could muster. Once he was face to face with the nondescript slab of wood, he took a deep breath and then a third check. Still, no Petunia.

  He opened the door, slid inside, and shut it as quickly as he could without making a noise. Harry looked up at the intrusion, seeming a little bit startled. It seemed as though he had been doing something with the set of playing cards Vernon had gotten for him his previous birthday. Some sort of magic, Vernon hoped; they had, after all, cost three pounds.

  "Uncle Vernon, what," Harry started before Vernon cut him off by brandishing an opened letter in the air.

  "Hush, boy," Vernon started in a whisper. "I got a letter from your school, saying that you were found on the roof."

  At that, Harry shrugged. "I don't know how, honestly. One moment, Dudley and his friends were chasing me, and the next, well, I was on the roof."

  Vernon frowned. "Did you fly, boy? Or did you, what's it called, telegraph? No, tele... tele something up there?"

  "Teleport?" Harry asked, and Vernon nodded. "Uh, I don't know, I don't really remember."

  Vernon took a moment to consider this. "Well, did you grow wings?"

******* I agreed that Vernon defers to her dislike of magic.

I don't see how this automatically translates to "he defers to her opinions on politics"?

  It's the 2015 General Elections in the Muggle World and Vernon Dursley decides that it is high time that he did something better than the current MP. Little does he expect a family member to run against him.
