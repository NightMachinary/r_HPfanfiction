There usually some poem or something to do with that chapter. Personally I never read them, so I can't be sure.

I think you verb.

As long as it's just a short quote and not half the length of the chapter (or, god forbid, song lyrics), it can be quite nice.

My very first fanfic I wrote had song lyrics at the beginning of every chapter.

I re-read it a while ago.

Bad idea.

***** It actually wasn't as bad as I remember.

I gave up on it because the plot was irredeemable. And, well, you know, it /was/ bad. Characters that were at best /half/-dimensional, cheesy dialogues, cheesier scenes...But there were those bits and pieces that were really good, and the fact that I could recognise those strengths as the ones I've cultivated into actually semi-readable writing now...that made me feel really happy.

Sooo...MY BABY!

*** I think I'd be funny to do a song fic parody of sorts with a song that is absurd and incongruent to the story as its happening around. Write out some emotional scene and match Ms New Booty to it or something like that.

If it's short, I'll probably read it.

If it's a 20 stanza poem or a song lyric I ignore it and consider quitting the story altogether.

** Sometimes it really works, it's a really short way to set the scene, or give a tone to it. It honestly depends on the story, the author's own writing style, and what kind of quotes (or poem excerpts) are used.

I prefer it over authors who put an author note at the beginning, or the rare one who puts a recap of how the last chapter ended.

*** I do this, and they are generally to help set the scene, give context, or even give clues towards where the story is going. Generally speaking, I make sure that they are highly relevant to what the chapter is about.

I have pulled from Shakespeare, Cicero, Douglas Adams, Robert Frost, and Gabriel García Márquez to even Calvin and Hobbes, TH White, and Bob Dylan. As I said, they're generally a bonus for the reader that /actually/ reads them - though I know that most don't as attested to by this thread.

** The one time I actually read quotes posted in this manner was in linkffn(again and again).

You can't just ignore Niccolo Machiavelli.

Edit: Now that I think more on this, I also read the excerpts from the future history books, on Divided and Entwined. They were quite interesting and just the proper length to not skip.

** Depends on the quotes. I'll read the first few. Sometimes they're dumb, and I'll just skip the rest. Sometimes the quotes are actually cool and relevant. One of my favourite fics has Machiavelli quotes at the beginning of a large number of the chapters (not all of them). I love reading those quotes, and I frequently find myself picking up my copy of The Prince or Discourses to find the context of the quote.

** I did it with a tie-in story to something else, once. All the quotes were fairly short and were attributed to characters the readers met (so to say) in the story but did not interact with enough to know their character fully. It was fairly well received.

I've also once read a fanfic where at least some, if not all (don't remember now), chapters had in-universe things such as article/book transcripts or fragments of some documents, from the future of the story (that is, the period past the point where the story will/would end once it gets to the end), and I thought it a fairly nice bonus.

I don't see why anyone would place a piece of work that is not theirs in there, though. It's useless padding---you can always point people to the poem you inserted and leave it at that---and if you need something specifically for your story then I'm sure writing it yourself is a much better idea as it will at least be in your style, not to mention that unless the situation is wholly unsuited to it, in which case why would you want a poem there, (short) poems can actually be inserted into the story itself without breaking the immersion.

** It can be kinda fun but if its a long story it can be difficult for them to continue making sense.

I dunno if anyone remembers, but it always reminds me of the TV show Frasier. In the early seasons it put words up at the beginning of each scene, in some attempt to summarize or give you a heads up on what you were about to watch. I never really thought that much of them, bad or good, and if you re-watch the show on Netflix you won't even notice when they go away. You'll just be plugging away on Season 4 or whatever and realize, hey, where'd the words go? They'd been gone for that entire season and you never notice.

But seriously, if the fic is good then I don't care, but quotes or song lyrics or poems have never made me /want/ to read a fic more.
