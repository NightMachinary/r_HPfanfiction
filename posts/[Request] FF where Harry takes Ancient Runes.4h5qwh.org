I just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][RuneMaster]] and found runes very interesting although Harry was a tad OP. Are there any good FFs with lots of runes?

Thanks :)


** linkffn(C'est La Vie) Is an interesting take on Runic Magic.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

**** FYI, it's an incredible fic, but I believe it's abandoned. Still worth reading, but just a heads up.

***** This. It's an amazing fic but it's not likely to be finished. Definitely worth the read, though.

+The way it ended, tho, omfg. I can't tell you how eager I was for those two characters to meet.+

** Not yet complete but I've been enjoying linkffn(For Love of Magic). The rune theory is quite a bit different from RuneMaster, more arithmantical, and maybe less thoroughly explained, but Harry does interesting things with them.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** One I enjoy is linkffn(Runic Animagi). It's a little bit of a crack fic but involves runes to accomplish things he wants.
