That story is fucked. Hard to read, but in a good way.


** Antithesis does some truly beautiful things. Adrian as a character is superb. /I don't like him at all as a person./ And yet he remains incredibly compelling. He struggles with his decisions, feels remorse after committing a questionable deed. The most important part: *He feels like a kid in over his head.* The arc with Remus really made me feel sympathy for him; as a person he is going through so much and has the only anchor taken from him. He's just a kid, not a Lieutenant of the Dark Lord or an edgey powerful!Harry.

As a WBWL fic it truly is the best in the fandom in my opinion.

*** I love the story too- I'm curious though, what's the one thing you don't like about the story? I like to rate how good a story is by the thing I dislike most about it.

** Great story! Just wish the author could increase the size of his authors notes at the end of each chapter a bit
