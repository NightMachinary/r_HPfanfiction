** To me:

Sirius disinherited but Walburga and leader of the Black Family (Arcturus I belive) make him heir again because of his supposed ''undercover right hand of Voldemort who betrayed the blood-traitors and mudbloods''. So he inherited Black wealth and possesions and Harry through him and Harry inheriting 12 Grimmauld Place support this as otherwise, it would go to Bellatrix or Narcissa.

Or

Considering their surnames too important for the noble families (especially for a family like ''The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black'') it's possible that he becomes heir again but only after Regulus death.

I always headcanoned it as: Walburga burns him off the tapestry, but only Arcturus can actually disinherit him, and like fuck he's gonna let the Lestranges or Malfoys take over his family. Better blood traitor than gone.

**** That was always my headcanon too. Walburga can mangle the tapestry all she wants but only Arcturus as Head of the Family has the power to actually remove anyone from the family. Maybe he realized Bellatrix was off her rocker and hoped that by running away Sirius was safe from all of family madness.

***** An interesting explanation I've seen is that Arcturus was playing both sides. He may have let Sirius get kicked out, but he didn't disinherit him. Regardless of which side wins, there'll be a victorious Black.

****** I've seen that too. It's smart if it's true. And it probably is true because if all Blacks were as deranged as Bellatrix and Walburga, the family would have died out a lot sooner than they did.

** Sirius did. Read books:

" “This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,” Dumbledore went on. “*You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts*, and you inherit all of Sirius's personal possessions. The slightly problematic part of the legacy ---”

  The inheritance of the property by Sirius Black is almost certainly governed by the magical equivalent of the English Common Law concept of the Entailed Estate.

That's a very doubtful proposition. I see no reason why magical inheritance law couldn't be something compeltely loopy and utterly foreign to Muggle legalia.

**** Maybe, but then again, a separate wizard government predates the Statute itself (IIRC) and at any rate, 300+ years is plenty long enough for the system to evolve beyond recognition. If the /Muggle/ system evolved so much since the 1700's, why shouldn't the Wizarding one have changed in its own ways?

(You might argue that the Wizarding World as a whole changes slower than the Muggle one, but you have to balance that out with the fact that Wizarding Britain has a comically massive bureaucracy, which does have to keep itself busy /somehow/. Fudge and Umbridge, our main reference points for politicans, do seem fond of inventing new laws and decrees every few months.)
