When Harry was young, he was forced to cook. He got in trouble when the food was bad, so he learned how to make it good.

He picked up Cook books in the public library on his way home, and studied them when he could. Since he made breakfast and dinner during the school year he got plenty of practice.

He quickly learned the basic rules, and some simple dishes. He learned how to season properly, as well as how certain flavors clashed with others. He did this for months, and he noticed the Dursleys start he eat his food with more enthusiasm.

It wasn't until a particularly intricate meal that Harry noticed any odd reactions. He had served them, as well as uncle Vernon's boss and his wife. His aunt hadn't been able to make the food, she'd been too busy cleaning the house for company. So of course, she nade him do it with a few more than usual threats.

When they each took the first bite that was sprinkled with fresh parsley, they all froze. At first he was scared, what if he'd messed it up? He'd be stuck in his cupboard for a week! But then-

"By the gods Dursley! This is the best roast I've ever tasted! Where did you get this?" They were each shoveling the food in, and Petunia couldn't remember to lie.

"The boy made it." Once they each finished the apparently delicious food, Vernon's boss turned to him with greed in his eyes.

"I'll need to introduce you to my sisters friend, they run a top notch eatery and they're always looking for talent. You've got a bright future ahead of you young man, a bright future indeed!"

It had been a steady climb up the social ladder from there, and he had ended up working in a high class restaurant in central London. It was a preticularly busy evening, what with the head chef leaving Harry in charge of a bunch of incompetent imbeciles, Harry was finding it rather frustrating.

"Come on, we need to get that Cordon Bleu to table three!"

He looked over at the dish, and was about to send it out; but then he noticed something. He got a knife and cut it in half.

It. Was. /Raw./

*Unacceptable.*

"WHO MADE THIS?!"

His ten year old voice carried surprisingly well through the kitchen, and nearly everything halted.

"I-I did, Chef." It was one of the newer employees, one that consistently showed up late and gave him grief about his age.

"And you thought it all jolly good to send out /rubber!?/ This is isn't cooked you wanker!"

"Sir, I-"

"This chicken is so raw it's still clucking!"

"Listen kid! I came here to cook for a professional chef! Not some boy who thinks he's better than us cause he hasn't hit puberty!"

"That's it! Get the fuck out of my kitchen you useless sack of shite! We'll see what the head chef says about you tomorrow."

Harry didn't know it at the moment, but found out rather quickly that someone had recorded his episode and posted it on the internet.

And everyone loved it.

He was a quick celebrity, now instead of just notoriety in the British restaurant business, he was getting all kinds of opened doors like offers from America to come and be the star of a reality TV show.

He initially refused, wanting to keep cooking, but Vernon had ended up convincing him to go "for the experience." He knew it was bull, but it also had merit.

And for a year, he was in America, coming to failing old restaurants and trying to reinvent them. But it was really and oppurtunity for the world to see the now eleven year old cuss out adults who couldn't cook or run an eating establishment.

And that was exactly how Dumbledore and Snape found him when they walked into a washed up burger joint in America, thinking he was there to eat on vacation.

"JESUS CHRIST! If you can't cook fish then don't add it to the menu! This calamari is so uncooked I can still hear it telling Spongebob to fuck off!"

Harry took a while to come around, but all the same announced he was taking time to finish his education, and would come back for a bit after ten months.

Everything would be the same, but Harry would end up exceptional at potions, and would have no filter when dealing with incompetent adults.

Might add to this? Just thought I'd put it out there lol.

Also, when Harry gets into his later teens, you bet he's being thirsted after like GR haha.


** Take my upvote. This is something I would read.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: I would love to read Harry correcting Pettigrew attempt with the potion only to have him mess up like Neville.

** "WEASELY! DO YOU KNOW HOW TO FUCKING GIND UP SOME BLOODY EYE BALLS, BECAUSE THEY ARE TELLING ME TO BRING THEM THE ONE RING" Harry Potter voice boomed in the Potion Classroom as he ripped Ron a new one before Seamus and Dean's Potion explodes.

"THOMAS AND FINNIGAN! ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL US." Harry says as Neville give him two slices of bread and walks over to them and put their heads and asks what are they?

Dean replied with Idiot Sandwich and Harry tells them to get out of his classroom.

Everyone bar Neville (who Harry took under his wing) Daphne Greengrass, and Tracy Davis was attacked like this. Snape sat their and watched Lily son not james' ripped people a new one about potion

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

***** It's very worth pushing through. The competition only lasts about 1/4 of the 350,000 word story, because then it really delves into the war. It is heartbreaking. It's a really well written story. I would definitely go for it, especially since it focuses on war and war efforts about 1/2 way through.

*** I'm having trouble reading the first chapter. "Dumb-dumb-dore" "hardy har har" is is awful to read. And the "evidence" he's bringing out isn't presented as it could be to actually do damage. Like the actual evidence for the manipulations would be showing Dumbledore telling Neville, to tell Hermione, how to get past the devil's snare. Instead we get the rehash of what happened, and Harry adds commentary of outside events.
