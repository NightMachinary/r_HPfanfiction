Lucius knew exactly what the diary was. The most feared wizard in living memory keeping a mere journal? And an empty one, at that? It would almost make him laugh if the subtle, creeping invitation to /write/ didn't send unpleasant shivers down his spine.

The Dark Lord had been missing for twelve years before Lucius finally concluded that he was dead. The Horcrux was the one thing keeping the Dark Lord anchored to this plane of reality, the promise of a future under a madman's rule for his children, and his children's children, and his family line beyond.

Lucius would not accept it.

Nobody could suspect that the diary had been in his possession, or the Malfoy name would be ruined. He couldn't destroy the diary himself or his family would pay the price if (when) the Dark Lord, accursed scourge that he was, somehow clawed his way out of Hell regardless.

And so he foisted the diary off on the Weasley girl. She was disposable, careless and gullible. And most importantly, she was going to Hogwarts. The headmaster, as much as it annoyed Lucius to admit it, was competent. He would see the diary for what it was and destroy it.

The Potter brat might have seen it, but he was a lost cause from the very beginning. He would chalk it up to a scheme of the Dark Lord, which suited Lucius fine. He would deal with that inconvenience when the time came.

And that left only one trace back to Lucius' treachery.

He drew his wand and turned it upon himself.

/”Obliviate.”/

[This ended up being more of a mini-fic than a prompt, but I'd love to see anyone else's takes on it. Thanks for reading!]


** honestly a neat idea, would be Lucius visting muggle London slightly after getting away with claiming to be under the imperious. with some muggle cash so he could mock them and the customs they have.

he walks into a muggle movie theatre by chance and the teenage boy who serves him suggests a movie.

lucius actually has fun, and every few weeks he goes and visits the cinema eventually paying for his new friends university fees

** In my story "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief", he becomes a spy for Dumbledore. He remains the main antagonist, though.

  The writing on the wall said she'd been taken, that her skeleton would lie in the Chamber, that no one could find, forever. Everyone believed it because they still had no idea where it was. Ginny/Harry. Slow Burn.
