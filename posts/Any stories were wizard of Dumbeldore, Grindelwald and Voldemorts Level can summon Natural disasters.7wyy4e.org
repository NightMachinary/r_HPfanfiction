Things like causing earthquakes,tsunamis and Hurricanes. And summoning meteors down from space only for there opponent to obliterate it or summoning lava up threw the earth crust creating new volcanos. Storys were a clash between wizards of there level reshapes the land.

Storys were when wizards of that level clash the sky is spilt like when Shanks and Whitebeard clash in one piece.


** In linkffn(Animagus at War), La Pantera (The Dark Lady of Veracruz) creates a tornado as part of Voldemort's attack on Azkaban.

And then there was the battle between Dumbeldore and Edward Grayson against the Dark Lord Ngeze in the first installment, which left the city they were fighting in looking like it had been carpet bombed. (Which was the excuse used to maintain the Statute of Secrecy)
