What do you guys think of it so far? Often fan writers call their stories a /Bildungsroman/ as an excuse to write about their Mary Sue while ignoring anything resembling plot. But this seems to be the real deal.

The plot isn't anything original, but Harry has enough Issues to keep me reading. Thanks to convincing characterisations of Snape, Malfoy, Theo and the other Slytherins, the worst tropes of Slytherin!Harry are avoided. Magical core are mentioned, but don't play a role in the story.

Overall I've really enjoyed and am looking forwards to the sequel.

*** I'm fairly sure that wasn't an anthropomorphic death, but rather the actual spirit of Harry's mother or some vision of her in his mind.

**** Yeah, Harry figured it out at the very end, and refers to her as such.

I've always 100% thought the hate of this is completely over blown. Honestly there are way worse tropes for which to bring out your pitchforks.

*** Magical core can actually serve very well as plot devices. I really don't get the hate.

**** 98% of the time it's used to say that Harry's is inexplicably hundreds of times bigger than Voldemort's and there's no reasonable explanation other than 'fate' which is just a deus ex machina. There's also never a rational relationship between size and stamina, nor is there a reasonable explanation how the size of one's core affects one's ability to learn and reproduce various feats of magic. It's just Harry's is bigger therefore everything he does with it is automatically better and he's just got some amazing instinct. It comes out looking like a bad dick joke.

***** Well there are shitty and good versions of every trope. But the main point is that just becasue something mentions magical cores doesn't mean its a terrible fic. I've seen that sentiment expressed here and on DLP. It just boggles my mind.

****** It falls under the category of tropes that new and/or bad writers like to fall back on like a crutch. Each one on their own are indicitive of others likely being present, and in combination always result in a fic with a shitty plot.

It's like starting off the story with Sirius's will reading. You can automatically expect: a manipulative Dumbledore which is a horrible characterization, helpful goblins and infinite wealth which take away several points of hardship and potential character growth, and a shopping trip that is so horrifically procedural it makes you question your sanity.

It's just one of those things that have been absorbed into steaming pile of garbage ideas. If you play with those garbage ideas, it'll take a significant effort to clean and repurpose them or else your fic simply stinks.

Most of us are wary of getting involved in incomplete fics that even glance at those tropes because the vast majority of the time they either devolve into that sort of garbage procedural or get abandoned without presenting anything truly unique or interesting.

******* To add to this: every fandom has its own tropes that the better authors don't want to use, because of the associations. Larger fandoms tend to have more, and as HP is probably the largest it means that there's a much bigger list of tropes that make the reader go 'oh well, looks like this is a chance for the author to metaphorically (and sometimes literally) jerk off to their super awesome Mary Sue'.

******** I would like to see a fic where Harry's "core" is tiny, and he does terribly in his first year at Hogwarts. Then he learns to compensate by drawing magic from around him, which most people don't do because they have reasonably sized cores. This makes Harry in tune with magic, but only powerful in very magical places like Hogwarts, Diagon Ally, etc. Everywhere else, he is barely more than a squib. This both handicaps and helps him while fighting Voldemort, and could be a great plot device in the hands of a skilled writer. (which I am not)

*** If someone is using the concept with specific purprose, the least they can do is not /call/ it a magical core, but find a more original description. Otherwise the whole thing smells of laziness.

*** If I'm reading a fic that's bad, then I can tell it's bad without looking at what plot devices it's using. And if the fic is bad, I won't read it. I've long since stopped looking at what tropes a fic uses to give me an indication of quality. It's like asking what ingredients went into a cake to figure out when it's good. I'd rather just taste it.

*** It's just an indicator of bad writing, much like friendly goblins (or HHr /ducks for cover/). Nothing wrong with it by itself, but I find myself preparing to exit whenever I read the words 'magical core'.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
