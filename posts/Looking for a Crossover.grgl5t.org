  AU Death of the Endless offered Harry a way to save his friends and a few billion other people while he was at it. There's a catch. He has to use that Master of Death title that's hanging over his head and give up almost everything he's ever known. But there are perks. Oh yes, dating a Kryptonian can be challenging. Harry/Power Girl.
