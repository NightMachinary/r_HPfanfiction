So many prompts nowadays are really vague. They barely tell you about what's going on, and usually is a 2 lined conversation between 2 people that's impossible to decipher! Why?!


** Because it gives you the freedom to create whatever comes to your mind. They aren't as restrictive but can still spark up new ideas.

*** That is alright, if you choose the right words to say, then it can go well. You need to be careful with the words you say - because writing good vague prompts is hard. To write a good vague prompt you need to be clear in what direction you are heading in (Stuff like, what tone, genre, feeling you get from the prompt), but still give freedom to do stuff. And that's hard. Many people don't make it clear what direction they're heading in, so you have no clue what the prompt is about. Yes, there is freedom here, but there's no way to know what the OP's even talking about,

I beleive it is far better to just make a prompt that makes sense, and instead of having strict requirements, have SUGGESTIONS, be open to new suggestions from others, and discuss new ideas.

** Either that or it's the cliff notes of an entire story.

Writing vague prompts can be super fun, too. I used to participate in challenges where the prompts were just give randomly generated words. It helps flex the writing muscles.

*** Sometimes, vagueness is just fine. But if it is 2 lines of dialogue which are not clear in their meaning, that's when things start to go downhill. Stuff like 'She closed her eyes, and then opened her eyes and found herself as a teacher in hogwarts' - which refers to charity burbage, but the op hasn't said, is NOT fine.

**** Eh. A prompt is a prompt. If I were to write from prompts again, I'll interpret that dialogue however I please. I'm the one writing it. I'm not doing a free writing commission for someone. That's not what prompts are for.

*** About a few months ago for me, they used to have such good prompts. But ever since then they've started detoriating. Why?

** The opposite of this are the super niche extremely specific crossover prompts that only OP wants.

** Because often as Prompt or Challenge Makers we often hear that what we've come up with is to ridgid and too constrained that we don't give the writers enough space to do what they want.

And that's with my Paragraph of Extremely Basic Plot hook, a TLDR of the Plot hook, up to three Requirements using detailing needing elements like the Crossover series, pairing if at all applicable, up to three restrictions, and occasionally some requests that's more just cool shit that comes to mind.

That is often "to much" so three lines of unattached dialog is what's left as it gets as much as the author can put out without being "controlling"

*** I understand that, but a couple lines of dialogue is still on the far too vague side. If you just make it rigid but be open to new suggestions, then that would be far nicer.

** You're not alone in your dislike of the situation. Recently I asked if there were any way to filter out all posts with prompt tag, for this reason. Sad to say that it seems, reddid has no built in function for that, the only response I got point me towards 3rd party addon/script.

*** There are some really good, creative even, prompts. The problem is, lately, the quality's been detoriating. People have started posting vague shit or super specific niche crossovers that only op wants. There is some real possiblity for amazing ideas through prompts, but people are not doing that anymore...
