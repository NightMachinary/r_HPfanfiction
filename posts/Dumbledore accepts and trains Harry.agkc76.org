Are there any fanfictions out there where Harry uses questionable magic to deal with Voldemort and his death eater goons. But instead of Dumbledore despising and plotting against Harry he helps him and trains him to kill death eaters/Voldemort


** Not exactly the same, but Magicks of the Arcane has some great Dumbledore + Harry adventuring

** By the Divining Light and it's sequel Conlaodh's Song ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song]]) , as well as Dagger and Rose ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose]]) fits as well as any fic I've read.

I really recommend them! Dumbledore trains Harry in dangerous, secret magic in both these fics.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** Well, Dumbledore /teaches/ Harry questionable and highly illegal magic to deal with Voldemort in my story "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief". And the training by Moody that Dumbledore arranges for Harry and Ron has the other Aurors shake their heads once the two enter the corps ("Of course, we broke their limbs after Stunning them - that's standard procedure.")

**** Best Hermione-centric fic I read is [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]] by DianeCastle. Magic-less AU (though part of a series that includes crossovers with canon HP), Hermione, Ron and Harry are going to a school for spies - James Bond style. Covers the full 7 years and is complete. This story made me change my "HP without magic is garbage" opinion.

With regards to my own work, I aim to write a different story/theme each time I start a story, so I don't really have one I would value over the others.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
