So I've been loving stories recently that have some twist on Harry w/ a Death eater/Voldemort's Kid. Just finished reading the 95 chapters that are out for Eyes of Violet, and Green Eyed Monster is one of my all time faves (All though that story focuses on OC/Draco in which the OC is Harry's sister, but something along those lines would be great too). Honestly just been digging stories which feature main character/bad guy's daughter (Lot of good ones in BNHA ff too)

So anyway I listed the 2 really long ones I've been reading, and would prefer stories that are developed a ways, either complete or 40,000+ words, but anything and everything fitting the theme I am interested in so hook me up

Most stories like this feature the main character tip toeing the line between Harry's emotions and their own feelings towards their obligations towards their family/whatever BS is there, and I would really like to see a story where the main character very clearly chooses Harry, and the consequences that come with that choice, such as the backlash and mistrust they face from the "good guy" characters like Hermione/Ron, as well as the vengeance from Voldemort. I know a lot of these stories end up like this, but it tends to take a while to get to the point where the OC chooses the side a good. I would like a story where they choose the side of good early and it's explored from that aspect. Lemme know if that makes sense or no haha xD
