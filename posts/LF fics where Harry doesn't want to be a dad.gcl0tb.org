I just finished rereading Quirks by YelloWitchGrl ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3316643/1/Quirks]]) and I love it. The whole premise of Harry not wanting kids is really interesting to me especially since fanfiction usually portrays him as eagerly wanting children. Does anyone have any other fics where Harry is against having kids but ends up really happy once the kids are born? Preferably Harry/Ginny.

I'd even be interested if anyone has recommendations on fics where Harry and Ginny struggled with infertility? I'm in the mood for some angsty pregnancy fics!
