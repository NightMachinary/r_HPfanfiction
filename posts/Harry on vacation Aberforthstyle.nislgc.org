As it says in the title. Harry goes on a vacation to a sub-tropical/tropical vacation home that is owned by Aberforth (I think). It has to be quite an old fic, as it is quite a few years ago that I read it.

The only other thing I remember are a speed boat, don't ask me why that is something I remember, and that at some point they are attacked while shopping in the nearest village/city. And that in this attack Charlie Weasley dies.
