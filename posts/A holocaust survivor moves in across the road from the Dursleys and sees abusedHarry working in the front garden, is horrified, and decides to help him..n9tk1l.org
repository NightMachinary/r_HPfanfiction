Mega-abused Harry with all the bells and whistles. Survivor might recognise magic from past experiences in the camp. The survivor doesn't have to be Jewish, could be a gypsy (magic?) or gay.


** Very distantly related: anything about magical Roma.

I dimly remember post-Battle scene where Roma family of Romilda Vane (who turned out to be a courageous fifth-year member of DA under the Carrows) came with their trailer collecting her body. I would love to read the story, but I cannot recall what it was. The feeling was kind of similar to Mr Creevy in “A True Gryffindor” by backinyourbox, linkao3(10852959): we send our only son to this fairy-tale land of magic, and the only thing we've got from it was his body in a body bag.

  The sun rises over Hogwarts' broken walls. They've won, but the work has only just begun. After spending most of his teen years fighting a war, Neville Longbottom is suddenly thrust into the world of work, responsibility and love. This story is set in the Raindrops on Roses Universe (prereading optional!) and fills in the gaps of how Neville grew into the man who appears in that story.

There's more voices out there and I can't do all the work for you.

Gypsy is an actual nazi propaganda word. As in, Nazi's used it when they were searching for the people to snuff out.

That being said, there's some travelers who claim the title and are cool with it. And some who have learned the history and are not cool with it.

The word comes from "gyp" as in steal, because you know, "they're all thieves". So yeah, rooted right into prejudices and propaganda.

No its not, its a complete failure of an argument. Its the worst thing to have come out of the social justice movement, the idea that you can claim to be an activist whilst denying any responsibility for convincing anyone of anything.

No one will ever change their mind if you refuse to try and convince them. If you want people to believe what you are saying, the responsibility sits on you to provide them with the information necessary to change their mind. You cannot deny that responsibility and then be angry when their views stay the same as they ever were.

The definition of lazy activism - refusing to put any work into convincing people and then blaming them for not changing their views.

And? If you want to convince people of something you need to provide sources that are actually convincing. Tiktok videos, opinion pieces, and blog articles all carry the exact same evidentiary weight - precisely zero.

******* Tbf, the times I've heard Gypsy being used were not for good things.

[[https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Gypsy]]

#+begin_quote
  Usage notesEdit

  Gypsy is an exonym (a name given by outsiders, based on the mistaken belief that Romanis came from Egypt) and many Romani people find it offensive, as it has negative connotations,[1][2] such as that the people are dishonest or thieving (compare gypsy, gyp), and it is associated with discrimination and persecution of Romani. Many dictionaries recommend avoiding the term, or give it a negative or warning label.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Gypsy is still more common overall than Romani.[9]

  Roma (Rroma) or Rom (Rrom) are sometimes found as synonyms, although narrowly speaking, they refer to a subgroup.

** The only fic I've seen with gypsy/romani in it is 'The Godmother', a crossover with NCIS LA. And I'm pretty sure that the character in question being romani was made up out of whole cloth, though as I've never watch it I can't be sure.

However, I /am/ fairly sure that bits of it would be rather offensive. But it has Romani magic?
