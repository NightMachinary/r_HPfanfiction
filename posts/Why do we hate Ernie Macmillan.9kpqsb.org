It seems to a trend in fics where Ernie is just a bad dude or is the cause for something bad to happen. But then I read a fic where he was a decent guy.

Is there a reason I'm forgetting? I haven't read the books since 2009.


** in the books he is portrayed as stiff, formal and a bit pompous, a lot of people seem to dislike this traits

*** It went a bit beyond that. He was one of the more vocal people who accused Harry of being the Heir of Slytherin, saying all parselmouths were evil, using his own blood status to claim protection, etc. In book 4 he repeated the same mistake, wearing a 'Potter Stinks' badge and blaming Harry after his name came out of the Goblet. In both cases he actively worked to turn his classmates against Harry.

***** Yeah, Ernie cleaned up his act after the Voldemort reveal at the end of the tournament. It's possible that he matured a lot over his last few years at Hogwarts.

** I can't say I've seen a fic that's too critical of Ernie, but that might be because, he's one of my favorite minor characters. To kind of address some of the major points people brought up in the thread:

While he does suspect/accuse Harry of being the heir in CoS, I don't think it's that bad of a thing for a 12 year old that's scared for his friend to do. More importantly, when Hermione gets petrified, Ernie apologizes for ever suspecting Harry, saying he knows Harry would never hurt her.

In GoF, I'm sure Ernie wears the support Cedric Diggory badges out of house loyalty, but I always thought it was more important what happened the next year. Despite Cedric dying and giving Ernie reason to stay away from Harry, he actually does the exact opposite. He approaches Harry after their first Herbology class to express that he completely believes Harry's story of Voldemort's return and supports him. Later, he's a huge proponent of starting the DA, saying it's the most important thing they'll do that year. He's also the first person that's not the trio or the twins to sign the sheet, which helps ease everyone else who was worried about actually signing the parchment. Eventually, on the train ride home that year, he helps defend Harry from an attack by Malfoy, Crabbe, & Goyle.

Finally, and probably most importantly, Ernie's quick role of dialogue in DH is one of the most revealing. When McGonagall is announcing that Voldemort is coming and they'll evacuate the younger students, Ernie interrupts to yell, what if he wants to stay and fight, getting a great reaction from the other of age students. I always thought this was interesting, that it wasn't a Gryffindor, the house of the brave and probably those who knew Harry the most, that asked the question, but Ernie from the house of the loyal.

It's certainly possible to not like Ernie in spite of these redeeming qualities, as he's constantly described as pompous. I guess I was just biased by Harry's description of Ernie in OOTP, when harry says he quite likes Ernie, despite how pompous he is. It always painted a picture for me of someone who definitely thought a lot of themselves, but was still a good/nice person underneath.

*** This would explain why I don't really remember him in such a sour light as other seem to. When I the fics it did come as a surprise. Although their characterisation are not baseless if one only looks toward his general attitude (kinda pompous and has some blood purity values I've heard, which I like. Shows the trait is beyond just Slytherin and has a wider stretch in the wizarding community). But I don't think he's an outright 'bad' character. Although, with him being a minor role, it is easy to overlook either attributes, good or bad, and people who picked one or the other could be what lead to the resulting fics.

** Ernie, when we see him in the books is bombastic, pompous and in many ways I think is like a child version of Fudge, he is all bluster, but also knows when to admit he is wrong if I remember rightly but he does so in a self important sort of way . Like Justin Finch Fletchley however we don't actually see him interact a lot in the books so interpretations just go with the fanon flow

** We do? He's basically a more tolerable Percy without the family betrayal in 90% of the fics I've read. He's only presented as a cunt when 90% of the rest of the school also is, like the heir of slytherin debacle and the triwizard tournament (although I wouldn't really blame him for supporting Cedric over Harry or behaving in a strongly partisan way, he's bound to be more loyal to his house than some random ass gryffindor asshole).

*** Yeah he seems justifiable, hence why I was asking. I was wondering if there was anymore to it but it seems people just pick on him to be evil because he showed a negative inclination.

** If an author is in need of a non-Slytherin foil, he or Zacharias Smith seem to work interchangeably. Unlike Terry Boot, the characters have enough canon presence to evince a negative traits or character impressions that can be played up as needed. They share classes with the principal characters and cross paths with them. They are also clean enough slates that they can be added to without too much fuss. Also, they never (to our knowledge) dated any of the principal characters, so, unlike, say, Michael Corner, who dates Ginny and Cho, they don't trigger those who prefer particular ships.

** I haven't read them for a while either. From memory, he comes off as pompous and self-aggrandising, bragging about how many hours he's studying each day in the lead up to the O.W.L.s. Plus, he sided against Harry after Justin was petrified in second year. Nothing that inherently makes him bad, but enough that it would be easy to use those characteristics to write him as an antagonist.

** I've read a fair few fics where they've combined Zacharias Smith and Ernie into one main unpleasant villain with Ernie's name, which is very unfair to Ernie, because he was the first to demand to stay and fight, and Zacharias pushed past first year kids to escape the final battle. But I think it's usually down to a bad memory of two similar-but-different Hufflepuff minor students.

** It's the classic vicious circle of fanon flanderization. He is one of the only Hufflepuffs the books ever present in a negative light, so naturally any time a fanfic author needs a Hufflepuff to present in a negative light he's an obvious choice.

On an individual basis there is of course nothing wrong with that, but on a collective basis this means his average characterization in fanon is quite a bit worse than in canon.

Of course when readers constantly get presented with asshole!Ernie in fanfiction this characterization eventually seeps into people's perception of him which in turn subconsciously makes authors write him as even more of an asshole.

A similar effect can actually be observed for many characters that are often used for a specific role in fanfiction.
