I'm looking for a fic in witch Harry enters the veil looking for Sirius and actually find him. Other parts that i remember are that he is being haunted by Ginny's ghost, the Potters are alive, he and Sirius do this skit in witch both are Lord Black and they actually enter in an alliance with a Horcrux version of Riddle. With i'm not wrong the name was something like "a black business" or something. It's actually complete. I just can't find it. Help please.
