I have always loved two things:

The likes of Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility etc. Mr. Darcy and Colonel Brandon are the stuff of dreams 9and yes Alan Rickman makes me swoon).

SS/HG pairing with a good plotline

Today I found wonderful fanfic and would like to share.

"His draught of delicate poison" is the perfect read for anyone who has similar plot/character preference.

Sanpe is engaged, Hermione is pining and there is lots of attraction and light hearted moments. Both Snape and Hermione as characters adhere to the canon.


** u/deleted:
#+begin_quote
  -> Open fic.

  -> Snape has sisters

  -> Snape's sister is called "Skye"

  -> Close fic
#+end_quote

If you're going to add in OC siblings (which I dislike strongly in established main characters), you should at least be able to follow some of the established naming conventions. "Skye." God.

*** The names of Snape's sisters also bothered me. I did read the whole fic, though, and it was fairly enjoyable.

*** The other two sisters are called Storm and Shadow. Yeah I found that (and many other things) annoying too.

*** Well, to be strictly fair it is pointed out that Snape thinks the names are ridiculous as well.

My problem with this (having skimmed the first few chapters) is that it's so far removed from anything canon, it might as well be an original fic. I'm of the opinion that even in AU fics you should be able to recognise the source material. Frankly, if you changed the names in this you wouldn't have the faintest clue it was a HP fic.

ETA it's really a Georgette Heyer fanfic with HP names.

** It does appear to be very well written but I can't imagine how you could drag the premise out for 200k words. But I'll give it a try.

** I read it years ago, so I was shocked to see the publish date is 2014 on ffnet. The earliest iteration I can find is on the petulant poetess in 2006. For me, at the time, it was an interesting take on the Marriage Law trope. Before this fic all I'd read was "you need to get married to snape now otherwise you'll be killed!"

I thought it was great at the time (names of the sisters aside) but when I reread it... Well it's decent. It has great points, and it has absolutely ridiculous parts. Mostly I remember how wealthy everyone was in the fic :)

*** Ive always been into "scenarios" where either Hermione or Snape is jealous of the other receiving attention from the opposite sex. That's the one reason it was an enjoyable read for me.

**** In that case you might also be interested in The Problem with Purity [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity]]

Kind of like His Draught of Delicate Potions at first read I loved this one, at second read ergh- it has problems. (OP Hermione, I'd even go as far as to call her a Mary-Sue) But hey, it's got a lot of jealous Snape going on. :)

#+begin_quote
  A/U. At the end of war, the Wizengamot has passed a Marriage Law. The Order has opened Headquarters to house its youngest members during a summer of Ministry-sponsored social events. With Snape as a chaperone, and engaged to another woman, the advent of a busy Hermione, determined to see her friends in love-matches, can only be a recipe for disaster.
