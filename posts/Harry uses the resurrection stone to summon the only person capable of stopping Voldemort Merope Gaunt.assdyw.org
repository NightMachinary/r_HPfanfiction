** In canon, he despises her and sees her as a disgrace to magic.

In fanon, I can imagine a lot of great ideas including, but not limited to, being grounded, having his wand taken away, sending him to timeout, demanding he take out the trash, making him hug his aunt, bringing out cookies in a death eater meeting, and even forcing him to babysit his new little sister. The idea of a ridiculously overprotective Voldemort defending his little sister over the hazards of a slightly breezy day is hilarious to me.

Well, y'know, he /says/ that, as he must if he's going to seem consistent about his whole "blood-purism" shtick. But it could be his /real/ feelings deep down are much less clear-cut than he makes them sound.

**** These are the feelings he has shown since he first learned of magic that his mother couldn't possibly be a wizard because she died. Those ideas had quite a while to fester. He didn't seem to have any gripes with killing his own grandfatherish family, so I doubt he would have anything except maybe being nice enough to kill her quickly at best.

If you want to go realistic, then he likely would change his mind over time. People tend to become more understanding of the struggles of others over time. Hence why I enjoy it when Voldemort admits that he isn't annoyed by his true name, Tom.

Now, see, /that/ I don't think would ever happen, personally. He has many valid reasons to hate the name. First, it's the name of a Muggle. Second, it's the name he used as a young man, and thus ties him to a part of his life he'd rather have everyone forget ever happened. Third, it doesn't fit his delusions of grandeur in the slightest; excepting the "Muggle's name" bit I could perhaps see him coming to accept Riddle, which, after all, sounds pretty cool and dark-wizard-ish in its own right. But "/Tom/"? /Come on./

(It is my belief that if he had to give a first name to go with the last name "Voldemort", he would have said "Marvolo", which is at least a wizard's name.)

Another idea is that his name is leaked. People begin to fear the dreadful name of /Tom/ as much as the name Voldemort. Nobody names their kid Tom for hundreds of years. Dark Lord Tom is the most feared name in all of creation. He made the name his own.

Honestly, if his name were leaked, I think he'd just give people a combination of the spiel he gave the Death Eaters about his family, and of what Diarymort said to Harry in the Chamber when introducing the anagram. "It was an unworthy name which I cast out. Tom Riddle is dead. I am Lord Voldemort."

Mind you, it's still a funny thought experiment. Your scenario would be bad for the /Leaky Cauldron/'s business, I think... Oh, and since Harry made the Dark Lord's real name public post-War, I wonder if there /was/ a noticeable drop in mothers naming their children Tom. I mean, probably not. The Wizarding World is small enough, and wizards wacky enough when picking names, that it seems to me that aside from Muggle-borns it's a precious rarity for two wizards alive at the same time to have the same first name.

****** I'm not sure about real life... In literature that is definitely the trend in stories with old characters. The wise old man who faced countless trials who has grown compassionate. If you think this isn't a thing in the HP universe, then I refer you to a minor character. He isn't too big a role. Just Albus Dumbledore. I really do hate Beasts, but that is the trope being played. Dumbledore as a teen was young, arrogant, and dark. As a middle aged man he was arrogant and good. As an old man he would be old, wise, and humble. This archetype definitely exists.

** In this, Harry obviously did not throw the stone away while in the forbidden forest. It picks up in the middle of Chapter 36, The Flaw in the Plan, right after Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix.

​

Harry pulled off the invisibility cloak at last, and Merope Gaunt appeared beside him--thin and pale, in the not-quite-substantial way his family had been.

"I don't want anyone else to try and help," Harry said loudly, and in the total silence that followed his reappearance, his voice carried like a trumpet call. "It's got to be like this."

Voldemort hissed.

"Potter doesn't mean that," he said, his red eyes wide. "That isn't how he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?"

Harry shook his head. "Nobody. I'm not afraid of you anymore, Tom. This is one last attempt to save whatever is left of your soul. I've see what your horcruxes come to in the end, and I wouldn't wish that on anyone." A pained smile crept onto his face. "Not even . . . not even you. Merope?"

He gestured at the woman--the girl, really, barely older than him. Her hands were covering her mouth in surprise and shock.

"Oh my boy, my beautiful, sweet boy . . . " she stepped forward slowly, towards Voldemort, her simple dress fluttering in a breeze that affected no one else. The entire Great Hall had gone dead silent.

"What trickery is this?" Voldemort whispered, his voice hoarse and more human than Harry had ever heard it. Merope continued her slow, steady walk toward him, tears streaming from her eyes.

"My son, my son whom I loved, I loved you, love you, so much, so fiercely . . . " she made no move to wipe her tears, letting them flow down her face and down her chin.

"Get back, woman!" Voldemort shouted and he jabbed his wand at her. Merope flinched, but whatever the spell was supposed to do, it failed. She kept walking.

"No one can bring back the dead!" Voldemort hissed, his red eyes flicking to Merope, to Harry, and back.

"I brought her with me." Said Harry, surprised at how steady his voice was. "Please, Tom, listen to her. If we duel again, it'll be terrible for you." He thought of the twisted, shivering infant from King's Cross.

Merope was very close now. Voldemort jabbed his wand again and again, and a grey light shot from it, then green, then red, then purple. Each of them passed through Merope as though she were nothing but a memory, cracking into the flagstones of the Great Hall.

Merope reached up, and touched her fingers to Voldemort's pale, snakelike face. "Oh my boy, my Tom, my Thomas. What have you done to yourself? What have you let the world do to you? Make you hard and cruel. . . I'm so sorry. I was a poor witch and a poor wife. Please, my son, let me take you from here, away from the bitterness of what you've become." Voldemort tried to back pedal away, but she'd grabbed his robes with her small hands and he didn't seem to be able to dislodge her.

And Merope Gaunt, tiny and pale and shaking, pulled Voldemort into a hug, her tears spilling into his black robes.

"Please, my boy, my boy, my son, I know this wasn't what you wanted, wasn't ever what you wanted. Let me be a better mother than I was a witch or a wife, let me . . . please, please, let me take you from this place, you'll be at peace, I promise . . . "

It was such a tiny gesture, so small that Harry almost believed he'd imagined it, but for a brief second Voldemort relaxed into his mother's hug and gave the tiniest of nods.

It started as a hiss of pain from Voldemort. He sank to his knees, his wand falling to his side from numb fingers, still embraced by his mother. A groan escaped from his lips, and his skin became even paler, somehow, before Harry realized that he was becoming semi-solid, like a memory or a specter from the stone himself. The moan of pain gradually grew louder and louder until Voldemort was screaming in agony.

And then the two of them, the greatest Dark Wizard ever born and his mother, disappeared.

Later, after Harry had thrown the stone away and explained what he'd done, Hermione would badger him about it .

"I can't believe you're not more curious about it, Harry, honestly, it's not like he's never disappeared without a trace before."

"I trust that he's never coming back, Hermione. His horcruxes are gone, so his spirit doesn't have anything to anchor it to the world anymore. And I don't think he could have tricked Merope; they seemed a little all-knowing, to me. He's . . . moved on. She took him somehow, and I think he regretted, finally, what he'd done."

Hermione wasn't satisfied with that answer, but it was the only one she'd ever get.

** She looked almost precisely as she had in the pensieve---eyes slightly too far apart and wide with fear, hair and dress a bit unkempt, skinny but for the loose postpartum swell just below her waist.

“Merope,” Harry said.

She regarded him, then nodded a little.

“Do you know who I am?”

“Harry Potter,” she said quickly.

Harry nodded. “Do you know why I've summoned you?”

She looked deeper into the forest and sighed. He wanted her to say something, but she didn't.

“You've got to talk to him,” Harry said. “People have died. People are dying right now.”

“I know!” she snapped.

He hadn't anticipated this. In the memories he had seen, Merope was a nervous, abused creature---the kind of girl who would die of a broken heart after birthing a son to the only man she'd ever loved. The specter standing at the edge of the forest certainly looked the part, but her teeth bared in a snarl. Harry has expected a sad young woman. He met an angry witch.

Well, things had come too far to be dissuaded now. “You've got to talk to him.”

“It's no use!” Merope hissed. “He hates me. He hates everything but himself and my great-great-howevermany-greats grandfather. Turn the stone again. He'll listen to Salazar.”

“It's /your/ job,” Harry said firmly. “You brought him into this world. You abandoned him with people who wouldn't understand what he was. You set in motion all this violence.”

She crossed her arms and looked away. “I don't care if muggles and mudbloods die,” she said.

“Do you care that he murdered his muggle father? Didn't you love Tom Riddle?”

Merope glared. “Love him? I owned him. He was mine.”

“You're lying,” Harry realized. “You were obsessed with him, and when he abandoned you, it broke your heart.”

Merope's lip quivered. She clenched her fists. “We were married,” she said quietly. “In a church and everything. We were married and I carried his child. That should have been stronger than Amortentia.”

Harry regarded her coldly.

“It should have worked!” she insisted, snarling and glaring again.

Harry waited until her temper cooled. Her fists relaxed.

“Merope,” he said gently. “It isn't your fault that you didn't understand how love works. You... you had a rough go of it. I get it.” He pushed aside the memory of the /snick/ as Uncle Vernon locked him into the cupboard under the stairs. “But what you did to your neighbor Tom Riddle was evil. And what you did to your son Tom Riddle unleashed more evil into this world than you had thought possible.”

She glared. But, she nodded.

“Come with me,” Harry said. “Talk with your son. You guided him into this world and he's terrified to leave it. He needs you.”

Harry waited.

“Fine,” Merope said, turning towards the forest. “I'll try.”

She led him into the moonlit forest. Dementors hovered a dozen yards away, but something about Merope's presence disconcerted them. Somehow, she knew the way to go. As he walked, Harry tucked his wand under his robes. He knew he would try to defend himself if he could; he needed not to.

Before he was ready for it, Merope led Harry into the clearing where he had once met the giant spider Aragog. Death Eaters fanned out, arranging themselves into a wide circle around Harry.

No one seemed to notice Merope except for Voldemort, who stared at her aghast.

“How is this possible?” he asked.

After a moment, Lucius Malfoy cleared his throat nervously. “My Lord, I believe Harry has accepted your invitation.”

“/Silencio/!” Voldemort cast. Malfoy shut his mouth. Voldemort pointed a bony finger at Merope. “How. Is. This. Possible.”

“Shall we seize Harry for you, my Lord?” Yaxley offered.

“/Crucio/!” Voldemort cast, reducing Yaxley to a ball of shrieks and sobs. Voldemort pointed his wand at Harry. “Explain this, boy. The more you talk, the longer you live.”

“I've heard that one before,” Harry pointed out. “It's time to end this.”

Merope took slow, deliberate steps towards Voldemort, who stared at her with widening eyes. She reached out. Her fingertips just barely touched his cheek. His jaw dropped.

“My poor boy,” Merope said. “Look at what you've done to yourself.” She caressed his face again. “And you used to look like your Papa, too. So handsome.”

Voldemort pointed his wand at her heart. “/Avada Kedavera/.” The jet of green light passed right through her. The last thing Harry saw before it hit him was Merope Gaunt wrapping her arms around her son for the first hug in decades.”
