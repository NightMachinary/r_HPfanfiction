**** Ok! Here is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]]! Both with sequels and both are amazing! The Arithmancer's author, White Squirrel, has written some other fantastic stories as well.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling by Annerb]] If you don't mind Harry/Ginny. Honestly the changeling has almost no romance whatsoever, it primarily focuses on Ginny's journey through Hogwarts and the war when she is sorted into Slytherin. The real romance comes in the sequels, it has three, but honestly even if I didn't like romance, I doubt I would've gotten enough of Annerb's Slytherin Ginny with just the Changeling and I would've read the other three anyway.

*** i've looked at this before, but it has an unfinished sequel.

is the story a standalone, with a sequel that sort of extends it, or is the sequel continuing the major plotline(is the sequel important enough to read)?

if i have to read the sequel, i'll probably wait til the sequel is finished to read both of them

**** It's been a long time since I read it so I don't remember exactly how it transitioned to the sequel but I think it stands alone fine. I liked the original story a lot but the sequel kind of lost my interest so I never went past the first few chapters. I'd say you're fine reading the original story without the sequel.

** So 30 Minutes That Changed Everything, has it's issues, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1806836/Radaslab][Radaslab]] did finish a few stories. It has an unfinished sequel to continue the plot, though you don't HAVE to know more(though you might want to). Sadly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1806836/Radaslab][Radaslab]] hasn't posted anything in 7 years, so...

Anyways, the only real problem i have with it is information repetition. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1806836/Radaslab][Radaslab]] had a very annoying habit of presenting information as if it was new multiple times to the same people, or having characters who already knew the info acting as if it was news to them when it was necessary to disclose it to someone new. It doesn't treat Dumbles as a beacon of goodness, and it seems to bash Ron at first but it really isn't.

Of course it was one of the first HP fics i read, so its possibly just nostalgia talking... I'm actually going to go reread it now....

** Gonna recommend you a lot of non-traditional stuff. Most of these are well-regarded by people here but aren't really that popular at-large. If you're fine with non-Harry-centric AU epics, you'll love these.

Also, I second *The Arithmancer,* really one of the better super-long fics out there.

*Alexandra Quick* - in progress but it's in individual installments, 5 are complete. OC fic in America. Incredible writing. 1,300,000 words.

*Stygian Trilogy* - complete next gen fic. Has decent romance. Again incredible writing. 900,000 words.

*Pureblood Pretense* - magical society completely reimagined. In progress but individual installments, 3 are complete. 1,300,000 words.

*Albus Potter* series - next gen AUs. both of them are great, both of them complete, they are polar opposites of each other. Both around 1,200,000 words.
