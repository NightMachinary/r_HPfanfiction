By excluded,I mean they can't sleep in the dorms or use the common room,can't eat at the house table,wear the house colours or have points given or taken. Is there a plausible way to come back from this or is the status quo of the fic permanently disrupted ?


** yes?

I don't really understand what spectrum we are talking about but I guess that's fairly AU. I don't think people ever get 'banished' from houses thats purely a fanon thing.

Its mostly self-made fuel for their angst y protagonist to start wrecking some shit in vengeance.

** Depends on the circumstances. But in most banished form house fics it's Harry being ousted because of some event (triwizard entry most commonly). When the house eventually want him back he doesn't want to go back himself anymore because of what happened.

** There are usually some things one can do to return to a semblance of status quo.

Resorting - Self explanatory I think.

Or alternatively- The banished and their house comes to an agreement of a return.

And there's the third option that can be the anti thesis of a status quo, depending on when it happens/ what kind of fic it is: The character gets a lords chamber. Or just makes their own in some abandoned part of the castle.

*** Fourth option: their head of house comes down on them for trying to pull this bullshit.

**** That totally ruins the concepts of kids/teens totally being adults man.\\
That and if that is needed to solve the issue it'd be resentment going on from both sides for a long ass time anyway.

** In You're My Density, Ron tries to kick Harry out of Gryffindor due his personality change but because he went behind McGonagall's back he and his accomplices get out on probation and have to earn their way back. It's the only one I can think of where it wasn't a permanent break.

** No plausible way to come back from it, but it's not a situation that'd actually happen. Realize that the house system is not a magical sorting system that determines the outcome of your life. It's literally an adaptation of a real-life system used to organize students for classes and give them older students and resources to turn to in boarding schools. The main commonality amongst 'houses' and their variants is everyone having their own subdivision/place to sleep.

Talking about your house is more like an icebreaker than anything else- we're never actually told about the house most of the adult characters in canon, since it's not actually important. And you're joint with them for cheering in school competitions or pep rally type events. Some people get too competitive and take it too far, but most people just have fun with it. In real life, you're unlikely to be completely ostracized/shut out to the same degree people try to describe in fanfics.

**** And that's just not true- we don't know about Scrimgeour, Fudge, Kingsley, Moody, etc. We don't know the house for most of the Order members in general. And that's even when you consider Pottermore-exclusive stuff like Quirrel being a Ravenclaw.
