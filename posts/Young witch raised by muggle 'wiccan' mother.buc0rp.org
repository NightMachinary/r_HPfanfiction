I'm pretty sure it was a OFC whose mother was into the whole Wicca/Pagan thing, and because she could do magic she believed it.

Went to Hogwarts believing her mother was of good standing because she was 'high priestess' or something similar. I think she also carried a ritual knife and was very resistant in changing her beliefs to match the wizarding world.


** I think it could be this, I didn't read much of it though so I could be wrong. linkffn(12159362) The description mentions a rewrite, but it was abandoned after a single chapter.

  ABANDONED. See re-write with actual plot structure! Lisa always knew she was magical. After all, her mother was a powerful witch and Lisa was already mastering the arcane secrets of witchcraft. Then, an owl appeared with a letter. What in the Goddess's name was Hogwarts? (The Adventures of a Wiccan trained witch attending Hogwarts)
