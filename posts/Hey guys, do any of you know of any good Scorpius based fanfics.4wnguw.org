** - [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=179718][peppersweet]] writes great Scorpius/Malfoy family stories. I was actually talking to her about how similar some of our headcanons are to CC. Any of them are great. For something light, try Starving Artists (though it's also her older writing). She's the only one I know with complete fic that features a CC-like Scorpius and shaped my headcanon of him.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307670][An Improbable Fiction]] - Hugo-centric feat. Scorpius and Professor Neville on an adventure into the Forbidden Forest. Light and friendshippy.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=272808][Al Potter and his Very Epic Plan]] - Albus is willingly in Slytherin in this one. Also cute and friendshippy.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][And Capers Ensue]] - mine; ensemble heist-comedy with Scorpius as second lead. Scorpius is initially jerkish but has a lot of CC's dorkishness as the story goes on.

*** Thank you very much, I wasn't expecting many because Cursed Child only came out a little over a week ago. Thanks :)

**** Dorky, kind Scorpiuses aren't extremely rare pre-CC, so there's more fics out there than you think :) Most of the ones I read had one like that, though he wasn't always a major character.

***** I mostly avoided next generation fanfics and stuck with the characters we actually know and the marauders because I felt a lot of next gen fics were pretty poorly executed but I have recently gotten into them and am enjoying them very much. Scorpius is one of my new favourite characters though he doesn't quite beat Hermione or Luna.

** Cc came out a week ago. Which do you expect, someone who just happened to write him like the one in cc while having no info about him or a fic that was written in a week?

*** I don't mean exactly like him, simply close to it and there are some because [[/u/someorangegirl]] was kind enough to link me to them.
