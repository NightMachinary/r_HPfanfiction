So I have this kink thing for stories that pair a current student-or-just graduated Hogwarts aged Harry (14-18, up to early 20s) with the older women in the HP universe; even ones where the women are quite advanced in age, but are still attractive and arousing thanks to the author's use of the "their strong magic makes them look younger" technique [IE, 80/90+ but appear to be in their 40s]. Basically, I like the women to be (at least) mid-20s and older, but preferrably mid-30s or over.

90% of the stories [even new ones] of Harry paired with the girls close to his own age are worn out by this point. (I include Fleur and Tonks in this area, even though Tonks is canonically 21-23 by book 5)

I understand that in a multi or harem setting, there will likely be a number of girls his age, but a mix of older women (or very rarely, all of them older) is what I want to read. I've found a few in the years I've been reading fanfiction, but they've been very few and far between. And stories can only be reread so many times before they start to lose their ability to hold the desire to finish a re-read or read it again in its entirety.

The one very ultra-rare pairing I've found myself hooked on as of late is Harry/Perenelle Flamel. But for the life of me I can not find any good, and longer than a drabble, fics to sate this desire. I've come across maybe a grand total of 3 in my exhaustive searching, and two of those are based on hope and a slight story-listing & narrative-driven indication by the author that it might happen in the future (/if/ there is a future to be seen, judging by how one story hasn't been updated in *over 20 months*).

Anyone come across any HP/PF stories to recommend, be it the only pairing or part of a harem? Or other good stories with older women such as Amelia Bones, the Black sisters (Andromeda & Narcissa being more rare), Hogwarts professors, etc. The women starting out single/divorced/married matters not. Also, I am not adverse to the cliched stories, if it is fairly readable (grammar, etc).

Another very rare pairing I can never find fics for is HP/Gwenog Jones (Holyhead Harpies captain). She's not as canonically as old as I'd prefer, but still some age gap.

*ETA:* I would prefer to avoid time-travel fics that pair Harry with a now de-aged older woman. I want there to be an age gap(s) between Harry and his love interest(s).

Thanks.


** There is witches of Westfield by EJ Daniels It's post battle of Hogwarts and it's a mix of harem and weird pairings. It has andromeda black as part of the harem. It's a bit of a slow start but the ending it's not terrible

*** Thanks for the rec.

I've seen it but thought it was mostly a harem of just the females of his own age group.

But it's now on my 'to read' list.

**** Well, there's 2 Harry/Andy fics by Jacob Apples both with huge age gap. linkffn(Found in Ashes; What we Lost) FiA is basically a spin-off from the epilogue of WwL, but I found to be really fun. As for weird matchups, there's 2 Harry/Narcissa after-war fic called linkffn(House of Healing; Why are you in my house).

Now for a kinky bestiality trash smut fic with Minerva as main pairing but in a huge harem (Hermione, Medusa, Daphne and Astoria wincest, etc...) There's linkffn(Animagus Mishap). If that's yo thang. (not judging, got a good few hours "researching" this myself.)

  What happens when Harry Potter at age 29 is transported back in time with his family by a meddling phoenix? Well, when four of his kids are metamorphmagus, his better half is Andromeda Black and his sister-in-law, Narcissa Malfoy is on their side; the Wizarding World will not know what hit them. Begins in Prisoner of Azkaban, the start of book 3.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

*WWL* - haven't read yet, but is on the 'to be read' list

*FitA* - haven't read yet, because reading the synopsis implies the closing of the age gap considering there is time-travel involved; does it make Harry & Andromeda's ages a lot closer than canon?

*HoHS* - have read it. Quite like it but am not a fan of the author's stated implication that it will turn from HP/NM-B to HP/DG in the end.

*Wayimh?* - On the 'to read' list

*AM* - have read it up to a point before left it. plan to re-read and go further, sooner than later. And yes, at least sometimes, that 'is my thang'. The bigger the harems the better. (yes, even if some character development/interaction is lost in the process)

No, they came back as they were in the future. Same as Narcissa. But there's the whole Andy/Ted situation that gets quite interesting, because he's actually alive at the time, so he's still "married" to Andy... Also Tonks and Teddy interact a bit, but its weird. You'll see, its quite fun.
