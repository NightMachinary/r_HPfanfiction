** HP is a fandom I'd love to write, but it's too complicated for a multitude of reasons. British-isms, source material that I hesitate to revisit, and canon factoids that I just can't be bothered to research, along with a fairly large cast that would be too ooc in my hands. That being said:

1. HP but with Nasuverse mechanics for magics and lore (basically a fusion) where Harry survives cause his mother did the same ritual after his birth that Merlin did to Arturia (turned her into a dragon basically.) Hell maybe even have Harry get excalibur by giving himself to gaia.
2. An Urban fiction AU, where wizards and witches have an innate understanding of magic (no formal education needed). The Statute of Secrecy never happened, and wizards hide in plain sight. My plot idea was two-fold, with the trio meeting in a highschool and slowly coming into their powers and realizing that there are external forces playing with people's lives. Voldemort aims to conquer the U.K, and the British Gov is being protected by the Order of Phoenix, a secret organization of wizards led by Dumbledore. This story would eventually be the prequel to the Statute of Secrecy, while the main protagonists would go on to start their own magic school (*cough* Hogwarts *cough*)
3. An AU where magic is inherently weaker and has a smaller scope which would force people to be much more conservative with their magic, and some neat-o melee fights with swords and knives. This could also be added to concept 2 ^^

EDIT: Of course, if some kind soul decides to give these go, just pm me the link so I can enjoy the fruits of my ramblings

** From my notes:

Dudley gets his soul sucked out by the dementor. Sirius still goes through the veil, which kills his body and leaves his soul (similar to Voldemort). Sirius needs to find a body and happens upon Dudley's in a brain dead/coma like state in a muggle hospital. Sirius inhabits Dudley's body and hijinks ensue.

The farthest I've gotten to is where Sirius gets sorted again (start of Harry's sixth year), but I'm not really sure what to do after that. Still need a way to reintroduce Sirius/Dudley to Harry. I have Sirius/Dudley apparating back to 12 Grimmauld Place, it's just a matter of tying Harry in and getting Sirius/Dudley to Hogwarts.

** One idea I had was to write 2nd year from the PoV of the Diary. There could be mileage in its boredom and loneliness after years of inactivity, then joy at discovering a new opportunity, frustration with progress etc. Plenty of scope for scenes where the Diary shows Ginny (or Harry) events from its past.

Once I thought about it more, though, the trouble is that you'd basically be writing a story about grooming an eleven-year-old girl. And that's pretty fucked up. It could probably work if the target was an adult, but even then it wouldn't be a fun story to write or read.

** Funnily enough, I've been stuck on a few stories for a while and I honestly cannot make any progress with them.

The first one is one I have written about three times and just deleted and restarted. It's about vampires. The main character is a ten-year-old pureblood vampire (one of two in existence) who is saved by Dumbledore after his castle was attacked and destroyed by a rival vampire clan. Basically, vampires are masters of necromancy, being able to raise the dead with a simple thought. In all sense, you'd follow a boy who raises the dead animals of students by mistake, vanishes into mist, turns into his dark animal form (a cute black bunny -- how terrifying), and causes havoc by mistake.

It just gets far too edgy and I hate it. I'll most likely try again in a few months.

Number two is about the son of Salazar Slytherin. I have posted about this before, but it follows the only son of Salazar, who was swept away during a siege on Hogwarts and put into the Chamber of Secrets. Salazar dies and the boy is assumed dead, however, he is stuck in some spell that locks his body and he's a thousand years old when he wakes, finding the world different.

What I'm struggling with is the medieval era and the magic. I made this archaic system that was similar to a RPG. A human could only use one branch of magic -- the four founders being an exception and being able to use two. Silas could use four.

I have made some progress and the world has increased ten-fold from the first draft, but I'm quite stuck.

A quick one, but basically a fic about Tom having a twin brother. It's overdone, but I wanted to expand on it. I haven't got much to say about this as I started it in February and have written seventy-two words. -_-

** Ok, here goes. 1) Okay, typical Harry is a war veteran who decides to go back in time to change the past, but ends up as his own twin without any of his actual memories. But, as time goes on, he starts "seeing the future" both about stuff happening at Hogwarts and about the war, leading him to think he's insane or a seer.

2) This would be a rather different fic. Essentially, there's a necromancer who did some crazy ritual thousands of years ago to make himself immortal (not horcrux/philosopher stone type, but the real deal) but his body can die so he just floats around as a spirit until he posseses someone. He pops up as a dark wizard every couple hundred years. Latest reincarnation takes place in AU 'merica. Harry, after Voldy's dead, starts hunting dark wizards across the globe. So when the necromancer shows up, Death comes to him and tells him to deal with the bastard because its Harry's job as MoD.

3) SI who wakes up as a toddler in the world of harry potter. He looks out the window to see Voldemort in Godrics Hollow. Thanks to his abusive father being a bit of a war nut, he's able to steal one of his grenades which he uses to blow up Voldemort while he's attacking the potter's. They then adopt him after finding out about his abusive parents and (surprise!) he's a wizard. Kind of a crack fix, but the idea of some toddler chucking a grenade at good ol' Tommy boy really makes me laugh.

** I have... a few and they're all complicated monsters.

My "oldest" is a "Lily and James lived but nobody knows until Sirius joins them" fic. Harry's story stays the same until the Horcrux Hunt and then Lily, James, and Sirius start cropping up in his dreams. Ginny may or may not have been kidnapped (and joined them) during the Burrow attack - it keeps changing. Scenes include: convincing Ron and Hermione, Godric's Hollow grave robbery (for a DNA test!), and finding everybody in the Malfoy basement. Story problems include.... everything else, really, but mostly: what's Lucius' motivation? Writing problems: that's all backstory because I only care about the post war aftermath with emotions and recovery and where Harry gets everything he's ever wanted.

The one "I'd rather read." Dudley-centic, post dementor. Dudley's worst memory is Harry's eleventh birthday and the sudden realization that HE isn't special at all. It sticks with him and leads to drinking, anger, and stupid actions once he's back at Smeltings which leads to... "go to therapy and try or have legal consequences and your parents find out" or something. Dudley just doesn't want to get kicked of the boxing team, lol. Story follows the Dursley's into hiding and ends with Dudley and Harry reconciliation. Problems: all the OCs. All of them. Also technically happens in the same universe as that first fic. No, seriously.

And my personal favorite: a history about the founders as told by Helena Ravenclaw. The first part, Aka the ten or so years before she's born, is almost a comedy. Like trying to piece together a family history by sitting in during the "drunken story" portion of Christmas dinner. The second half is angry. Problems: research. World building. Things I DO remember because it's been a while: Ollivander was a title, a position in noble households - only the wealthy got a wand. Pre-Hogwarts "school was a foster system. Helga was running away with her stable hand boyfriend to get out of an arranged marriage - Hufflepuff was HIS surname. Hogsmeade is the pre-castle settlement. Rowena's got a rich, older husband. The school song and motto happened when Godric and Salazar were drunk - they stuck because they never came up with something better.

...

All 3 of these were NaNoWroMo projects at one point are another.

** Almost all of my fic ideas are WIP in my head. That said, the one that has been grabbing me recently has been a Hellraiser/HP crossover where Voldemort is trying to make Harry a Horcrux on Halloween 1981 using a Lemarchand Box as the vessel. He drops it, or tosses it in the crib while dealing with Lily and baby Harry opens it somehow. The Order of the Gash (Pinhead's Posse) shows up and realizes that Harry wasn't the one to summon them, but also that Volde has mutilated his soul so they can't nab him.

As Harry is touched by both the prophecy and the schism to their realm, Pinhead marks Harry as, similarly to Kirsty Cotton, he will probably now encounter more gateways and they want him to collect the pieces of Volde's soul for them in exchange for his life. In this one, Harry's scar isn't a traditional Horcrux, Pinhead can, and will, take it, but only once the rest of the fragments have been turned over to them. Harry will encounter his first new gateway in the Mirror of Erised and be informed of his fate by TOotG then, with some serious Dumbledore scolding for using such horrible artifacts (Mirror and the stone) around children on purpose. After that point, Harry will be taken to Leviathan and given some cenobitic powers and canon goes to hell with him focusing on the Horcruxes rather than having every year repeat again with minor changes.

I just can't come up with a good cenobite form for Harry, and figure out how to keep him in Hogwarts still, though the cenobites can't teach him Wizard Magic, so that would help as he's still a kid. I guess I want a plausible way for him to have a normalish human appearance unless he's in contact with a soul fragment. Yeah, I'm rambling now.

** A dark gamer!Harry fic.

Something I almost never see addressed in these fics is how terrifying it must be to learn that your entire life was a lie, nothing but a simulation ran for unknown purpose. Harry would repeat it countless times, sometimes trying to save everyone, sometimes trying to tell them everything, other times fashioning himself into a dictator and trying to conquer the world. None of it would change anything, the game would still restart upon his death, and he would slowly fall into madness, eventually just refusing to play.

The plot would follow a fresh copy of Harry, one who just died in the Forbidden Forest. With the help of the "old" Harry, who managed to latch onto his scar before getting deleted, he would eventually break out of the simulation and into the real world.

** For a while I've been thinking of writing a fic with quite a bizarre pairing - Tom Riddle/Rose Weasley. The essential plot is that Rose Weasley studies Voldemort's life as a controversial project for History of Magic, learning all about his childhood, his reign, etc. She becomes obsessed with finding out what made the man such a monster, not agreeing with some of the more widely accepted theories of the time. Some years later, whilst in her seventh year, she's accidentally caught up in some experimental magic and is thrown into the past into a time shortly after Tom Riddle has graduated. Unable to get back for now, but knowing the dangers of messing with significant events in history, she devotes her time to "stalking" Tom to answer more questions she had about his life, the magic he researched and created, when he began to lose his mind, etc. This, of course, leads to them eventually meeting and a sort of psuedo-romance as both try to unravel each others secrets.

The reason I'm not writing it is for one, I have an ongoing fic atm and think if I started a new one I'd never return to the first. For two, there are details I haven't managed to flesh out in a detailed way yet.

** A proper "Harry dates a Slytherin" story which does not try to promote house unity or "not all Slytherins are evil" but simply focuses on the characters and the challenges they face as a result of their "forbidden" relationship. I'm going to publish a Harry/Pansy one-shot this weekend, but that just scratches the surface.

A Harry/Hermione story that has them have an actual teenage relationship driven by lust/horny-ness and not the realisation that they love each other. Fuck first, fall in love afterwards. I just can't write this pairing for some reason. I like their dynamic, but perhaps I have simply seen to many stories with those two go in a direction I don't like.

A story where Harry has a "trope-y" girlfriend (eg Japanese Muggle OC) who then defies all expectations which come from her background. I have a 1k word WiP that's not making any progress.

**** I had a friend who got together with a friend because she was curious about making out with someone with a pierced tongue. A different friend gatecrashed a random party where he knew no one and by the end of the night was French kissing the host (he 20, she 16). They lasted over a year. The second friend also scored plenty of flings with girls aged 16-18 via a German Tinder ripoffs.

** I had an idea where because of his Horcrux status, Harry survives a LOT of things that would kill other people. The confrontation with Quirrell? He should have burned with him. The Chamber? He gets impaled by the Basilisk. The climax of Prisoner, he gets stabbed by Pettigrew, mauled by Lupin, and THEN Kissed by a Dementor. Forth year, he embraces his apparent invincibility when he gets submitted to the tournament. Picking fights with people/creatures that could(n't) kill him, making bets with other students that either don't know about it, or think he's making it up. The ending is he sets off a bomb in Little Hangleton that kills the current incarnation of Voldemort and his followers (Cedric isn't there due to Harry being Genre Savvy)

Then there's one I wanted to write where it's basically a crack fic full of stereotypes. McGonagall has goddamn bagpipes, Dumbledore goes down a chimney or five, Moody and Seamus end up doing stereotypical Irish things (drinking, being racist, etc) and Lucius and Draco Malfoy are just FABULOUS.

Anyway, never got down to writing them out due to the most I could think of were these summaries.

** There are quite a few:

I would love to write a Star Wars fanfiction, but even though I can read any SW fanfic, including the extended universe, and not get confused by the characters or the story behind them, I don't know enough about it to write a story confidently without butchering the Star Wars universe.

Another fandom that I love to read and would love to write about is LOTR (and the Hobbit), but just like in Star Wars, I feel like Tolkien's world is so complex that I would never be able to make it justice. From the various cultures presented, like that of the elves, the dwarfs, the hobbits, etc, to the finer details of ME lore, the Silmarilion, and so.

I also really like Pokemon fanfiction, especially those that take a grimmer look at the games and series, the darker reality's aspects of the Pokemon world. However, even disregarding my lack of complete knowledge, all the ideas I come up with aree for massive storylines, and to be honest, I have neither the time nor the commitment to write something on that scale.
