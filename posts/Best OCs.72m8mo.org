** Jim Potter (from Prince of Slytherin).

I like WBWL pics. I just hate how the "favored Potter son" is some egotistical idiot who everyone loves, but Harry will always outshine because he never learns. Nah screw that.

Jim starts out as a the typical BWL spoiled douche. But he learns. Unlike like most other fics, he actually learns. The things he does have consequences, and he learns from them.

Something about that's a huge breath of fresh air for me.

** Calypso Rosier was one of the best I've ever seen.

Why? She is interesting. On first glance, she has a friendship with Harry, and later even relationship, but is part of, or at least influenced by the side that works directly against Harry and his family. When we get to know her better, we see that she has nuance; depth. She has flaws, strengths, agency. We can always trace back a decision made by her to some sort of reasoning of her own. A lot of OCs have the problem that the writers base their decisions around the protagonist, making them hollow and uninteresting plot-tools. Calypso is a sidekick to Harry, but for her own reasons and emotions.

****** I was at that phase for a hell of a long time, and I must recommend that you at least get the story started. I changed a lot of things I thought I wanted when I was a chapter and a half in, and I wasted a good amount of time and effort for something that I feel is a better result. I mean, you do you, but sometimes it's harder to start something than it is to continue or finish.

******** It is likely that you will struggle to both get readership and maintain your own interest in such a long-term project. Maybe you could consider starting in a later year? Then introducing background concepts via flashback or when the MC takes a new character into their confidence?

I can't remember how many stories repeat a tired mantra: "follows canon early, but major divergences happen at the end of year 3/beginning of year 4." 75% of these fics do not make it to year 5. 95% do not make it to year 6. Avoiding that pitfall is much better than going for seven years. Numerous fics handle this issue in effective ways. Take a look at the writings of inwardtranscience - one is so dissimilar to canon that going back over early years is still interesting, one starts in book 4 and totally changes history, excusing it by suggesting that Harry was ignorant of his surroundings. Another method can be found in The Changeling, where the MC is Ginny, whose perspective is different enough to maintain engagement, yet also tells much of the early years very quickly - very little quoted dialogue, very brief overview of scenes, responses, and attitudes, etc. while still managing to effectively explain things through the context and lens of the story's purpose and goal.

********* Already in first, second and third year, a lot of important things shall happen, and if I would put them in flashbacks, that would feel cheap, and by using your last suggestion, I fear that not enough sympathy and empathy would be created.

Apart from that, I am planning on introducing more types of magic which simply have never been covered in the HP books.

As much as I appreciate your suggestions and concerns, I have actively tried to avoid that mantra.

Oh, important sidenote to mention, my story starts 19 years after the Battle of Hogwarts, and follows an OC in his 7 years at Hogwarts. /And the plotline of Cursed Child takes place in an Alternate Universe, I've always hated Time Travel/.

** Hm. One of my favorites is Indigena Yaxley from the Sacrifices Arc. She can reasonably be called batshit insane, but she's still pretty interesting. She is a formidable dark witch, intelligent, ruthless and capable. And although she has no interest in Voldemort's war, she is personally obsessed with honor. So when it is revealed that her nephew once swore to serve Voldemort, but later abandoned his service, she feels obligated to serve in his stead, to redeem her family's "honor". And serve she does. She proves to be the deadliest of his Death Eaters, slaying enemies and resolving problems no other servant was capable of. She is shown to have prodigious skills with herbology and dark magic, breeding humongous stone-shattering, man-eating plants and generally wrecking all kinds of shit. Her motivation is completely alien to the reader, but I found her a fascinating character to read about.

Another is Per Hossa from Greengecko's R trilogy. He only appears for a couple of chapters, but he makes a strong impression. He is a shaman of the Laplanders, an indigenous population group in Finland's mountains. He is first contacted by Snape, when Harry faces problems with his magic; when experiencing dark emotions, Harry begins to unconsciously summon gateways to the Dark Plane, a dimensional underworld, filled with dark energies and demonic-looking ever-hungry creatures. Per is one of the few masters of the Dark Plane in the world and agrees to teach Harry when he learns of his trouble.

This character too is fascinating and well nuanced. He is a man of few words, but resolute and jaded. Although he is a master of old magics, he has rejected wandlore; as such, common magics like transfiguration and apparition seem like miracles to him. The story paints well and subtly the desperation of the Saami, as well as Per: their constant struggle against a hostile land and a way of life that is quickly growing obsolete. And Per, despite the things he is capable of, is restrained. When a child is kidnapped by a neighbouring village, he does not strike back with terrible creatures or ancient curses.

As he hears stories of Harry's past, he asks him:

/"How did you, with your dark wizard hunted life, your prophecy-weighted childhood, with your . . . Death Eater father . . . how did you preserve such purity of heart through all of it?"/

And I believe this is when he decides that he will teach Harry to master the Dark Plane. Because like Per, Harry is restrained; he hasn't fallen to dark magic, to killing indiscriminately, despite all the shit he's been through. And like Per, he won't summon a host of demons to solve his problems. (of course, as you'd expect, later in the story Harry DOES summon a host of demons to devour a group of Death Eaters, lol)

I'm not sure how you are on Slash, but if that's not a deal breaker ( it's not particularly explicit) then you def want to check this one out. The world building in insane, Harry gets renamed fairly early in the story for protection purposes and we get to explore this VERY expanded universe. The story is chock full of OC's that all do very well, but as Harry's main side-kicks, those two are funny, interesting, and have there own story lines.
