The author (ACI100) has said he is not happy with the quality of the story and suggests users to read his other stories. He said he will be deleting the story in a few days. He has also said he will be writing a better quality Harry/Gabrielle fic in the future so people like me who were following it for that can look forward to it in the future.

** Maybe he'll rewrite it without that abomination of a title.
