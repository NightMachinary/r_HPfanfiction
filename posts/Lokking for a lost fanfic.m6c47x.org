:END:
I remember one fanfic i read. It is about a guy who gets reborn into harry potter, he is a dragon. When he gets a lover they get a dragon mark of sorts (turns them into a dragon). To get the mark they have to fully love him and get some of his blood (painfull expirience). He can multiverse travel with his lovers who can just enter his inner world. First world harry potter second world one piece.

I think from the HP world the veela girl gets one, cissy and som other i cant remember

Found it on webnovel If anyone knows the name of this fanfic please comment
