** Any preferences as to plot generally or characters?

Here are a couple that come to mind:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], probably my favourite time travel fic. Harry goes back in time to parents generation and with the help of Bellatrix becomes a pivotal player in the war and politics. Complete. 400k words

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2784785/1/][Lets do the Time Warp Again]] by Rorschach's Blot. A potions accident throws Harry back in time into his younger self's body, he decides to go nuts and do everything he's ever wanted to do . . . and get revenge on everyone. Complete. 36k words

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6820445/1/][Harry Potter and The Phoenix Burning]] by Mini-mid. Harry gets sent back to age 11 and to his fathers generation. Moves in with Potters and then both he and James go to 1st year together. Complete. 70k words. Sequel is 12k in.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3951749/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Quantum-Leap][Harry Potter and the Quantum Leap]] by Seel'vor. Harry Potter won the Second Blood War and defeated his enemies... and was left with nothing. Decades later, he contributes to the creation of a revolutionary new piece of technology and destroys the future in order to rewrite his own past. 274k words. incomplete Last update in 2010. H/Hr

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4612714/1/][Knowledge is Power]] H/Hr. Both get sent back in time to 3rd year. Complete 178k words

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/][Oh God Not Again!]] by Sarah1281. So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN. Complete. 162k words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6091629/1/][Triwizard Tournament: Take Two]] by Moonlight Ace. While chasing the last remnants of the Death Eaters still loyal to Voldemort, Harry is unexpectedly thrown back in time to the start of his fourth year of Hogwarts. This time round, things are going to be a little different. Harry/Fleur pairing. Incomplete. 48k words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] by joe6991. Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time. H/F. Complete 282k words Not the typical time travel fic but obviously time travel orientated.

Hope this helps! Those are all I could think of for right now, but I am sure some more will come to mind soon.

I generally don't read much time travel primarily because the ones where Harry is sent back into his younger self really bother me if there is a romance. While I get that he has the body of 11 year old or whatever, but it freaks me out they give Harry his adult brain and memories at that age and then he is attracted to other 11 year olds. Even ones like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]] where others are sent back as well still bothers me.

*** Thanks! I have not seen any of those I think, except Wastelands of Time, which creeped me out a little. And Oh God Not Again.

This is pretty much what I was looking for :D

**** I remember reading wasteland about 5 years ago and going WTF with every new chapter. Are any of his newer stuff any better?

Anyways, THE best AU I've ever read was 'A Stranger in an Unholy Land' but the sequel has been abandoned. The first book ties everything together things very nicely so it 'works' if you ignore that it's sequel exists.

It definitely has some of the best action scenes of any book, period.

Also, Quantum Leap is pure putrid.

** If you can handle an unfinished story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]] is one of the best.

*** I can handle an unfinished story, as long as it's pretty long (150k+)

So far, I really like this one. Thanks for your help :D

** Holy shit, this is probably the best of the best time travel fic: AU. Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours.
