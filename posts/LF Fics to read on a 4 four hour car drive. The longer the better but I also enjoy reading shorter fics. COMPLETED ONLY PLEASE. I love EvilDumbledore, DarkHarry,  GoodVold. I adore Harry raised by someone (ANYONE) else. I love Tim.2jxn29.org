#+TITLE: LF: Fics to read on a 4 four hour car drive. The longer the better but I also enjoy reading shorter fics. COMPLETED ONLY PLEASE. I love Evil!Dumbledore, Dark!Harry, & Good!Vold. I adore Harry raised by someone (ANYONE) else. I love Time-Travel. I also get great joy from reading bad Super!Harry

I also love when any of the main 3 are actually dark or bad people. Or bashing of one of them. Or Ginny tries to love potion Harry.


** Oh, I've got to save this. Except for evil (as opposed to just dark) Harry, those are all things I like to read from time to time too :D

Here is what I've already read (you'll have to sort it to the according "category" yourself, shouldn't be too hard with the summaries xD)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8009557/1/Two-Princes-of-Slytherin][Two Princes of Slytherin]]

Snape was the first one on the scene after the Potters were murdered. He was the one who took the Boy Who Lived. Ten years later, Harry Potter is dead to the world. Instead, he is Hadrian No-Last-Name. First year, from the Fire Prince of Slytherin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4612714/1/Knowledge-is-Power][Knowledge is Power]]

When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.

(Note the humor category)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow][Harry Crow]]

What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.

(Super Harry, Manipulative (or rather trying to) Dumbledore)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/Xerosis][Xerosis]] Harry's world ends at the hands of those he'd once fought to save. An adult-Harry goes back to his younger self fic. Semi-super!Harry, Voldemort/Harry, SLASH-for the idiots

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall][Harry McGonagall]]

Professor McGonagall has watched the Dursleys all day and can see what sort of people they are. When Dumbledore leaves Harry on their doorstep and disappears, she takes him away. HHr

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change][To Shape and Change]]

AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7683642/1/To-Recollect-the-Future][To Recollect the Future]]

Hindsight is 20/20, but when Harry's last steps into the forest set him back further than he'd ever thought, he never realised how grateful he'd be to have Snape there to help too. Mentor/guardian fic, time travel, but not cliched.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2814526/1/All-Through-the-Night][All through the night]]

Harry awakens transported back in time over 500 years. Hogwarts is still being built and, amid the bustle, Harry finds the warm, nurturing parental figure missing in his life, in none other than Rowena Ravenclaw. Will Harry ever go home? Will he want to?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5375201/1/Bound-by-Blood][Bound by Blood]]

When James and Lily give Harry up for adoption to better train his twin brother, Henry, the false boy-who-lived, Harry is left at an orphanage, until he's adopted... by the Malfoy's! Now, Draco and Harry re-named Adrian are off to Hogwarts!

(Warning: Has an uncompleted sequel)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142024/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorting-Hat-s-Gift][Harry Potter and the Sorting Hat's Gift]]

Take a WBWL-verse, add in some Slytherin Harry with Voldemort's memories, and add just a dash of Parselmagic, and what do you get? Harry Potter and the Sorting Hat's Gift, Book 1 of the Saga of the Lightning Speaker.

(Warning: Book 5 incomplete. Super Harry, grey Harry)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9048823/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Four-Heirs][Harry Potter and the Four Heirs]]

Merlin, not happy with how the future unravelled for the life of Harry Potter, intervenes early to set the course of history back on track. Implied Pairing Only. Smart!Harry Bash!AD Idiot!RW

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4253051/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Difference-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Difference of Time]]

Harry Potter's life has been an incredible journey, but his death will be even more incredible. Harry Potter dies and is sent back in time to rewrite his history. What will he change? How will he cope? Complete: NotSlash, NoPairings.

Looks like I'm through with my list - I know I have read more, but either it wasn't on a site where I have an account for favourites, or I didn't add it for some reason.

And I'll definitly make use of this to get to know a few more myself. It was kinda strange to read the LF-criteria as I'm often looking for exactly the same.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6606862/1/The-Son-of-a-Dark-Lord][The Son of a Dark Lord]]

Harry Potter isn't really Harry Potter. Neither is he the Boy-Who-Lived, and is therefore thrown away as trash. When he turns sixteen, glamours unwraps his true self and he leaves the Light to find his real family. Slash, HP/DM.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4978734/1/Rewriting-History][Rewriting History]]

Whenever Harry does something drastic, he always ends up in a strange situation. Time-travel-fic.

**** Despite not liking some parts (Dumbledore was a bit too stupid and I don't like the "young serious romances" if I think about their age too much) it certainly is on top of my list. Bonus points for being so long and a goblin raised Harry being something I haven't seen anywhere else.
