I was playing with Choice of Games scripting language and managed to deploy a test game through GitHub Pages. I'd like to make a full game, but I don't have any ideas. My main interest is HP fan fiction, so I thought I'd see if anyone here would be interested in this sort of format. Or I'd just be willing to help out somebody else who wanted to make something like this.

Thanks


** Give us a bit more description of what you are looking for. Maybe a sample scene from such a fic.
