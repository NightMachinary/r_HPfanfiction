** This is literally one of the main plot points of every dark/grey/neutral/blablablah Harry Potter fanfiction (if not every then 98 % of them).

Don't take me wrong but all you need to to is to write those words, press enter and choose what you want.

** Isn't that canon? When Dumbledore asked Harry what would he do if he never heard the prophecy, Harry's mind quickly goes to his parents, Sirius, Cedric, and all the evil done by Voldemort. If his brain is still functioning and events went mostly similar to canon, there's no reason for Harry to decide to switch to the other side.

*** In this instance there isn't any thinking involved, the prophecy only confirmed what Harry already know about Voldemort : be killed or kill Voldemort. I was asking about the side of the ideological war because Voldemort was leading a group that fought for a cause : Wizarding Pureblood Culture.

**** And why would Harry pick the pureblood culture when he is a half-blood, her mom and her best friend are Muggleborns, and her other best friend's entire family are considered blood traitor?

***** Imagine for ex, that the pureblood culture is for example not considering magic as a tool but a way of life, pagan rituals, not following the muggle religion. Noble customs if you want to add it. Family magics. And of course, dark magic being accepted. There is some depth to the pureblood ideology despite the racism. There is more to Voldemort cause that racism. One only has to take into account that Voldemort himself is a half-blood. No the situation is more complex that black and white. Because if it was Black and White : then simply put the Slytherin House at Hogwarts should have been disbanded and never reformed. Families in their entirety killed or imprisoned to Azkaban until the terrorist indeology was rooted out .

And Harry would have ample motivation to wish to become more wizard like because of the animals he was entrusted with by Dumbledore.

****** The Slytherin House isn't always a dumpster fire of pureblood supremacist, Slughorn himself is shown to have at worst patronizing attitude about Lily and Hermione being highly talented muggles, but he still openly praise them and likely would've used his contacts to help their career had the war didn't happen.

The pureblood supremacist doesn't really have much in canon aside from hating Muggleborns. Salazar Slytherin disagrees about accepting Muggleborns to Hogwarts, so unless the Muggleborns managed to find a sympathetic magical to help them at least controlling their magic, they're as good as dead.

The resistance radio specifically said

#+begin_quote
  Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational sport under the new regime
#+end_quote

about the murder of a Muggle family. There's nothing "deep" about the pureblood ideology, the average Muggle is completely harmless to a wizard, and would never know anything about the wizarding world unless they have a Muggleborn in the family or marry a magical. If they have /anything/ else to their goal, their reign wouldn't be so full of murdering and torturing Muggles.

******* Hardly harmless, it is enough that one family member speaks to another, that the PM confirms it and the statute of secrecy goes to nothing. And you forgets all the banning of some categories of magic by the Ministry that is canon.

********** And the Dark Eaters doesn't tell that to everyone during their reign because....? It would be as simple as taking a trip to a pensieve memory watching the seer making the prophecy, or even without any hard evidence, just say it out loud, "hey, we /know/ Muggles are going to eradicate us". Instead, all they did is claiming Muggles are inferior subspecies capable of stealing magic to justify the purge of Muggleborns.

For the purebloods to have any sensible reason to entice Harry to cross to the other side, this would be a very diverged AU, assuming Riddle is aware of this, he can just warn everyone who will listen, including Slughorn with his various contacts, instead of going killing people for reasons. That would be like knowing for sure a minority group in your country is involved in a conspiracy, but instead of bringing the evidence or at least stating the reason to the public, you just start killing them.

*********** Divergent yes, AU not so much as Riddle insanity can be blamed on the Horcruxes. And as he is the Dark Lord, once insane everything goes to the dogs because no death eather would go against his lord. Snape is an exception because of Lily.

************ Uh, Riddle creates Horcrux with his completely unrepentant murder at the age of 15. I'd say he's already fucked up beyond belief even before the Horcrux. And it still doesn't explain *why Riddle doesn't tell anyone about Muggle endangering Wizards*.

If he knows that /before/ summoning Salazar's Monster, then it means he decided the solution is to unleash a murderous monster to a school full of children and some of the most skilled wizards and witches, so a wizarding world without their literal and figurative future somehow will be able to defeat the Muggle?

And if he knows that /after/ rendered insane, then this is just an asspull. "Oh yes, he literally murdered babies. It's all for a good reason tho. No he can't tell you, he's insane, just roll with it".

************* Fucked up certainly , FUBAR I don't think so. Who in the sheep that is Wizarding Britain would believe him. The Great Albus Dumbledore is for muggles, he cannot make mistakes. It is Riddle speaking against the Great Dumbledore. Dumbledore only has to reveal that Riddle was in a muggle orphanage and no one will believe him after that. Why Fudge never used the full might of the Ministry against Dumbledore ? Because the public opinion would be against it. One word from Dumbledore was enough for Snape to escape prosecution. Secondly he could not tell it before being of age, because as Fudge and Dumbledore explained it no one believes children. Even more so if their are not celebrity or an heir to a rich estate.

************ Yeah no your throwing this far out if Canon while reaching into Canon as "evidence on why your right the ministry van on dark magic in Canon is only harmful and evil magic am I gonna act like the classification isn't shit since people could create new spells like sectumsempra and get a freebie but still what your saying is au because your changing purebred ideology entirely to justify genocide rapist and murderers if you wanna write one of those Auvergne the rich elite are being oppressed by people like the Weasleys and Hermione That's your story but can not try to justify it outside of that because it's impossible you can't point to Canon make stuff up about dark families being oppressed then use that as an argument while still basing it off canon
