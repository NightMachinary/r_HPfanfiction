I'm looking for a couple of romance stories. I prefer novel length but one-shots over 5k words would work with me. I want it to not necessarily focus on fighting or the war but on a budding relationship of some kind. No slash please, and sexual situations are fine but not required.


** If you haven't already, I recommend that you check out the works of [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/][Jeconais]], one of the premier writers of romance in the fandom.

** I've just finished reading [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7808517/1/Thoughts-of-Pudding-2012][Thoughts of Pudding]].

Focus is on romantic triangle between Harry, Hermione and Luna. It was abandoned in the middle at 140k words. For me it was one of those stories that resulted in an evening of depression that something so good will remain forever unfinished and now I am flailing a bit for something to read of similar quality.

Before that I remember enjoying [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4200568/1/The-Harmony-Bond][The Harmony Bond]] - also abandoned in middle, and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]] - finished.

PS. If you want to try other pairings with Hermione:

Fluffy Hermione/Draco: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3876231/1/Ambition-s-End][Ambition's End]]

More Actiony Hermione/Draco: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7030506/1/Turncoat][Turncoat]]

Even more action and a slower/dilluted romance: [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=367][Parade of the Sun]]

Very angsty Hermione/Draco that is all foreplay and no follow through because it's abandoned - God of the Lost. Hard to find these days though.

Hermione/Snape After the books. [[http://mirrordance.net/aashby/bnw/ChaosIndex.htm][Chaos is Come Again]]

*** I love Amends. It was among the first fanfictions I read and it opened my eyes to the darker and more complex depths that fanfiction can go. Really a great story.

**** I suggest the many stories by [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/profile/16292][lorien829]]. They're a bit formulaic, but then most romance writing is.

** I can't link as I'm on my phone right now, but My Dear Professor McGonagall on fanfiction.net has some amazing romance tales. "Really, Arthur" is my favorite, its fluffy and details their whole lives together.

If you just search for the Scorpius and Rose pairing over a certain length quite a few of them are good. Also for Harry Hermione there is Harry Potter and the fifth element but you've probably read that.

**** Haha, I never finished it, got to chapter 56 in maybe three or four days, but then it just got too much, that's like 700k words. Maybe it was about a week.

*** Nothing with links, but easily found when googled.

H J Potter was pretty good.

I'm most of the way through Delicate right now and that's been good so far for me.

Other than that I'm having a mental block because of how much I've read.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6026214/1/9-Years-with-the-Marauders][9 years with the marauders]] It's novel length focusing on the development of Sirius and Remus's relationship. It's amazing.
