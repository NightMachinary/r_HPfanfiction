Reading yet another fanfiction, and enjoying it, and then out of nowhere comes "pup".

Did Sirius /ever/ use that nickname in Canon? I may hate this one more than "Mione". And yes, I know, part of the fun of fanfiction is people extending canon or re-imagining the world. I just really hate that nickname, and more than that, I just don't see the sense in it. I see it as lazy fic writing.

What teen enjoys a nickname that makes them sound younger?

sigh.

And for the love of God, I actually saw one the other day where (a supposedly) dark!Sirius used "Voldy-shorts" and it was the quickest I've ever dropped a fic.

The nicknames are killer.

Technically, she allows for a shortened name twice, the first with Ron, and the second with Grawp when he called her "Hermy." You could also argue she allowed for a shortened/different form of her name with it being "Hermy-own-ninny" from Viktor Krum.

**** eh, I wouldn't call Krum's pronunciation a 'nickname' in a regular sense. English (probably) isn't his first language. "Hermione" is probably weird to him. instinct obviously wants to go like it sounds, then we add on that English in general has different sounds and enunciations than Slavic languages, thus it could just be legit difficult for him to say. *shrugs*

**** Not everyone likes nicknames. Someone once asked me if I really love to my husband because I call him by his full name, and I just don't understand this mindset. Sometimes people like the name they were given and they like to be called by it. I don't think it's out of the blue or crazy unorthodox! It's also very possible that she was called a nickname off camera and it wasn't important enough to make it into the books, because she didn't like the nickname. It doesn't have to be a part of canon in order for it to be inferred, because we do that all the time in fanfiction anyway.

I mean I get what you're saying but I think it's a little disingenuous as fan fiction writers to declare that something definitely happened off camera, because it's equally likely what happened off camera is that someone called her a nickname she hated and then they never did it again.

I guess the point I was trying to make is that these nicknames aren't canon, so authors should do their own work and analysis, and not just copy from other fics. The wrong nickname at the wrong time seems OOC and breaks immersion.

***** Damn, I made a mistake, my result was referring to "Prongslet", not to "pup". And even then I made a mistake by not including "pronglet", that makes the earliest appearance in this [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/437455/1/Darkness-Dying][story]] in 2001, four years before Robin4 used it.

As for "pup", the earliest mention comes from 2003 in a rather angsty [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1428257/1/Moony-s-Moon][remus/sirius fic]].

Searching was relatively easy by entering a set time range (1998-2002), sorting by date and going to the last results.

*** I think it's a bit unrealistic in HP setting because of the unfamiliarity between the characters. I mean, I too have to bear an embarrassing nickname from my family, but they call me this way since I was 2 yo, continously. Whereas, Sirius may have called Harry by a nickname before his 2nd birthday, but he did spend 12 years without interacting with him. So it's a bit weird for someone, even as a parental figure, to suddenly call a teenager he's reuniting with, but need to get to know again, something like "bambi", "pup" or "cub", imo.

But Sirius calling Harry pup or Remus calling him cub makes no sense. I could deal with if it hadn't become so universally used in fanfic. 'Lazy' is the perfect word to describe it.
