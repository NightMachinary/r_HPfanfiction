In this fic

Harry travels back in time to the marauder's era.

I think he changed his name. He fought death eaters in Diagon Alley and saved Lily Evans. He went to Hogwarts as a seventh year transfer student.

There is a duelling tournament of sorts. The winner fights Dumbledore. Harry fights Dumbledore and it ends in a draw.

Meanwhile in the Order of the Phoenix meetings, they are discussing about Harry being a potential recruit. Voldemort also tries to recruit him.

It has like 20 chapters or so.

The fic is incomplete.

Edit: Found it. It is A Last Resort.


** I'm pretty sure it's this one. Been a while since I read it, though.
