Thanks for contributing to the wiki.


** *Genre:* Family/Friendship

*Link:* linkffn(Choices by random-fruitcake04)

*Status:* Frequently Updated (in 5th Year, goes to 7th Year)

*Thoughts:* It has a seer Ron who is sorted into Slytherin, he has a different set of friends in Theodore Nott and Daphne Greengrass (my favourite interpretations of them actually). Harry and Hermione are still around and it might turn into a R/H pairing yet but the final pairings haven't been decided yet.

  Ron has the ability to see the future and he has the choice to either let it happen or change it for the better. Not Powerful!Ron. Pairings undecided as of the moment. 2nd chapter for fifth year now here! Thanks for reading! Will continue until 7th year.

**** This one is my guilty pleasure. The writing is not good (the author's first language is clearly not English), it's basically canon rehash and it uses cliches like magical cores and orbs (ugh). But I love the interactions between Ron, Daphne and Theo, they are great characters.

** *The Dark Lord Never Died*

*Genre:* Drama, Adventure

*Link:* linkffn(11773877)

*Status:* Updated every Saturday

*Thoughts:* Of all Ron-centric fics, I like this one best. [[/u/Starfox5]] wrote a very compelling political/romance story featuring a three way war between the British Ministry under Lucius Malfoy, Voldemort, and exiled Order under Dumbledore. Ron and Hermione were initially caught on opposing sides. Lucius was quite smart and cunning; and Dumbledore was one mean, manipulative strategist.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Ron never wanted to be a crime boss. Pity he was so good at it. Even if he did spend most of his time worrying about what would happen when his mother found out.

** *Genre:* General

*Link:* linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8218798/1/War]])

*Status:* Complete

*Thoughts:* Fairy quick read. Ordinary but serviceable writing. Dumbledore imparting life lessons through a game of Castle Quest is really fun.

  All's fair in love and war, and Ron reckons that's because they're the same thing. It's his sixth year at Hogwarts and he's got himself in quite a skirmish indeed. His soured friendship with Hermione has become a battle of wits, and that's hardly a fair fight. Seeking advice, Ron challenges his hero Albus Dumbledore to a game of chess.

*Thoughts:* Showed huge potential to be the story to the Slytherin!Ron genre what ACA is to the Slytherin!Hermione genre. Alas, it was abandoned after year I.
