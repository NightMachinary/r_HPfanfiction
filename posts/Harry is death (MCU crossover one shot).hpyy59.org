There was this one shot I read a long time back where it was pretty much the aftermath of the final battle in Avengers and all of the heroes were resting but then all of the people, animals and insects which died during the battle somehow got revived and Harry pretty much showed up reprimanding the avengers and saying he revived all the fallen.
