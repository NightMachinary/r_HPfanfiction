I've been looking for any type of fic where a fem oc or reader insert completely replaces hermione? She doesn't have to be muggleborn but I can't find any fics without hermione


** The only fic i can think of where hermione isnt a major player or even part of harrys inner circle is linkffn( DUEL) but its not a. Female oc or self insert.

*** This doesn't fit the OP's criteria for OC/SI either, but Hermione is not a major player in The Price is Right by Hi Pot and Noose. When he does well in the first classes, she takes it on herself to compete against him---he just wants to do the best he can, and sometimes surpasses her, but she wants to BEAT him, and is smug when she does and angry when she doesn't. Ravenclaw!Harry literally screams and runs away when she tries to approach him, and his friends start doing the same.

Here's the scene that classifies her as forever not-a-friend:

#+begin_quote
  Harry had toyed with the idea of being friendly with the girl, even jotted down some things they could do together if Granger ever became aware of her social deficiencies and corrected them. The idea was trashed when he overheard Brown offering to teach Granger ways to do her hair, and instead of accepting Granger scolded the other girl for wasting time on such frivolous magic. Harry lit the page on fire without a second thought.

  Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics. Harry's not going to let the wonders of magic take away his common sense, and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Meanwhile, money is fun, but magic is funner. AU

  What if when Draco challenged Harry to a duel at the beginning of first year it had a lot more significance then either realized? A duel not only for bragging rights but for injustice and eventual love. Harry/Harem

** In Victoria Potter Hermione is rarely mentioned, and when she is it's in a negative light. She's definitely not part of female Harry's friend group. That's the closest I can come up with to no Hermione. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13795605/chapters/31714617]]

** In a post Wizarding War world families are torn to shreds and in the middle of piecing themselves back together the Black Family, notoriously wicked for generations, is the target of Minister Fudge's wrath for a scapegoat to make it all go away. Only what he never expected was the uproar the youngest assumed dead member of the clan would unleash on him to ensure he rights all he has done against her family. Though soon enough she learns Fudge is only the tip of the iceberg, much bigger wicked fish are circling in those waters waiting for her to slip.

My oc centered series where Fred, George and her are the golden trio and work often with Percy and Cedric to save the school and try to keep Harry and his friends from meddling. Hermione is in it but more of a spectator role.
