  He hated his life, his relatives, and most importantly, his own weakness. So when he chances upon a Denarius coin, he took it, even if it meant damning his own soul in the process. And now, he's a Denarian, the host of a Fallen Angel, and the Fallen is hungry for vengeance; and for him, absolutely nothing will stand in his way. Based on Shezza's Denarian Renegade. Slight HP/FD.

**** Yeah, that's the one, don't think he's an Auror though. The saddest part is that it would have been a nuanced and interesting take if it was a regular brothel, but instead it turns into some weird libertarian wet dream about children's right to sex work. However, the protagonist is openly evil, and the story repeatedly reminds the reader about that. Sadly the writer forgot that other characters aren't as evil, and might object to this.

Amazingly, it is not the edgiest thing that author has written.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
