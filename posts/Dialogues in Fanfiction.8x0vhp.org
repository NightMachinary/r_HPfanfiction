I just finished reading a few smaller fanfictions - and while the plot was awesome, the dialogues were Kindergarten-Level.

In order to rectify that, please take note of this website.

[[http://www.spwickstrom.com/said/#modal-close]]

It offers 300 other words for "said" and includes definitions and explanations.

/edit

I see now that most of you are not interested into learning new stuff and simply prefer the american way. Easy. Simple. And if its a word I dont use daily its too hard.

Kthxbye.

That's the exact opposite of most writing advice, including professional writing advance. Said is an invisible world - a word that is both small and so common it is effectually invisible. You don't actually read it, your eyes skim over and the meaning jumps right to your brain. Saidisms (words used instead of said) break flow, slow down writing and generally give a cluttered feel.

Look at a popular professional book and you'll notice very few saidism. Most of the time they'll say 'said' and when they don't it will be other common words like 'asked'.

TLDR: ignore the OP. Use said.

*** Sometimes said can be bad, especially if the person is not talking in a normal fashion, for example during a fight. But for a normal conversation, "said", "asked", "replied" and "wanted to know" is all you need.

*** Hilariously the vast majority of criticism I get is the overuseage of Said in dialogue and not describing every detail of the characters. Both of which are signs of amateurish writing.

Most young writers and critics don't understand that every version of 'said' that isn't 'said' has a specific connotation that is often not the intent or just seems weird if two people are having a conversation. Using them wily-nilly simply lessens the impact when you need them to serve a purpose. Which is something a lot of young writers don't understand. Said is your friend. OP is hilariously reactionary to an opinion and an article he clearly didn't read. Or he'd have noted that his own source says 'there's nothing wrong with using said'. Because there isn't. Use it. And use it a lot.

*** Screw it, let's go to town. I grabbed the first Harry Potter book I could find (Halfblood Prince) and opened to a random page - 92.

On that page we have...

#+begin_quote
  said Ginny

  said Mrs Weasley

  said Ron

  said Ginny

  said Mrs Weasley

  said Ginny

  said Mrs Weasley

  said Ginny

  said Mrs Weasley

  Harry asked

  said Ron

  said Hermione
#+end_quote

On one page we have 11 'said's and 1 non-said (and that was one of the handful of common saidisms).

*** Its about being repetitive you skronk. If the author keeps using "said" over and over and over and over and over again. There is no balance at all. It simply shows that his characters are void of all emotions.

I learned writing in a different language than english, and we were specifically told by our professor to NOT overuse the word "said" when it comes to dialogues.

tl;dr your opinion has been noted and ignored.

No, it really doesn't. A character's dialogue and actions should convey how they're feeling without the use of said-isms.

Presumably your professor was teaching English to non-native English speakers. That is very different to people teaching writing to native English speakers. Where vocabulary can quickly go past purple into urple. Cutting 'said' forces you to think about what your characters are doing to /show/ anger or sadness rather than just tacking on 'ranted' or 'sniffled'.

God knows you speak a foreign language better than I do, and my writing in a foreign language would likely have far more issues than which word I used to denote the tone of speech.

Just as you are relaying what you have been taught, we are conveying how /we/ have been taught.

**** Feel free to also ignore JKR as well then...

Also the point is 'said' is an invisible word. Your brain doesn't read it, so it doesn't get repetitive.

***** And yes, JKR is known for overusing certain words. Its a habit most authors have. Just because you can ignore it most of the time doesnt mean that you should simply tell people "yeah whatever, if you use said all the time, its gonna be fine".

If you are not native to the tongue you will read it. And you will note that its overused.

****** Then perhaps the problem here lies with the reader and not with the writer? It's generally not the writer's job to make their texts sound natural to the non-native reader.

And as a non-native reader myself I do prefer authors to use well-known words since while I really like learning new words it kinda breaks the flow when I have to look up another one of the 300 alternatives for "said" every few lines ;)

******** I'm not saying that an author shouldn't use any complicated words, or that they shouldn't use alternatives for "said" when they are appropriate. But using a less-known synonym when there's no reason doesn't accomplish anything and many accomplished authors agree. Yes you can ejaculate words, doesn't mean you should...

** Yeah... not learning new stuff. That's DEFINITELY what it is. Not that using said is a helpful tool that keeps things from being diluted by trying to find fancy words where none need be used. What the hell do you mean the "american way", you hoity toity ass? It's not being lazy, it's simply refusing to bog down good writing with useless synonyms. Yes, there are some instances where said should not be used, but most dialogue is better with said.
