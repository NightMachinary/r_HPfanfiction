I'm looking for a good alternate ending fic. Preferably one that was written and released by Deathly Hallows. Any suggestions?


** The story has been written before DH and was passed around all over the world as a leaked copy of Deathly Hallows.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl
