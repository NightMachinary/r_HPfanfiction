** I have a story like this that's actually very popular and I personally don't think it's cringeworthy at all (or I wouldn't keep writing it.) What I did was develop a character very well and then go through all the years and make her big decisions so I could decide if they were good. Although she started as Harry's twin, I did decide to make it a hidden identity where she's actually the daughter of an interesting canon character that we know very little about so i can write in a believable backstory, etc. What I wanted to do from the get go was make sure she and Harry were different and less very different lives so she wouldn't be like an extension to Harry. Also, don't make your character really loud and cool and perfect or really distant and quiet and loser-y because those are overdone to the extreme. Have fun and good luck! :)

** Have your own goals. Don't shy away if they happen to take you away from Hogwarts or even that part of the world.

Write your own story. Don't just go along with the stations of canon.

Don't be afraid to change the setting to your liking in a unique way. For example, what if wands don't bind to people under 20 years of age? Hogwarts becomes a college and suddenly adult behavior isn't forbidden anymore.

Also, and this is a pet peeve of mine, no magical cores.

** Assuming you want other people to read and like your story:

The same +rules+ guidelines for writing interesting characters apply to self-inserts. The usual stuff breaks down to "make sure the character actually struggles to achieve what they want."

Basically, don't just write an idealized version of yourself - write a character who's engaging for the reader.

** You may think this falls into the â€˜don't write it' category. But don't write a self insert. Write someone who is more interesting than you. With bigger flaws.

That prevents it from becoming a wank fest where the twin is good because they are. Have your characters make bad decisions in line with their flaws and give them those flaws. We like ourselves too much or too little to do that well with self inserts.

I think that's where the problems with self inserts comes from.
