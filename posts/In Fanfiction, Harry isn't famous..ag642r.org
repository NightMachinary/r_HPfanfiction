This is just a thought that came to me, but, in fanfiction, Harry Potter is /much/ less famous than in canon. Not because people don't know who he his, but because /everyone/ seems to know who /everyone/ is.

It's like in most fanfictions they make the world feel much /smaller/ than it is, so naturally everyone knows everyone. In that kind of world, everyone knowing Harry Potter seems... well, not terribly special.


** I think there's a difference between folk knowing who you are, and celebrity. How Harry was treated in the leaky cauldron was celebrity. Hagrid walking in and half a dozen folk knowing him by name, and most of the rest knowing him by reputation, is just being well known.

However broadly I see your point. I think jk made the world small, but acted like it was big. Most fanfic authors make the world big, but then make it feel small.

FTFY. But yes, this is basically it. JKR made magical Britain tiny, just big enough to function, but made it feel equal to a big city or a small muggle country. As I've written before, a lot of the weirdness of magical Britain makes more sense in the context of small town politics.

But on the other hand, fanfic authors make the world bigger, sometimes by adding more schools, infrastructure, and population in Britain, but mostly by including other countries because JKR is so provincial. When she's not specifically writing about other countries, she makes it feel like Britain is the whole wizarding world, but even when you include other countries, it's still pretty small.

**** I think JKR made Magical Britain MUCH too small. The complexity of specialisation, size of government, size of the economy, etc. does not match a tiny community.

So Harry should not be a celebrity in the conventional sense, in the way that one is never a celebrity in one's small town. There is an element of commentary on modern Britain in this parallel magical world, but to add to the plausibility of the Statue of Secrecy (small numbers help with anonymity) makes other elements less credible. I guess realism was not a priority.

He meant the second one. You can have a fantastic world that ignores or defies our knowledge of science, but still be believable.

** That wholly depends on the fic being read, because it certainly does not happen in every fic. I find that in a lot of fanfics it is maybe understated a bit, not that Harry isn't famous but rather that because his fame is already established in canon it does need to be reestablished in the fic.

Besides that I think people knowing each other by face or name is also simply a device to avoid having to write about introductions the entire story, which is tiresome to read. I've seen fics where the whole "I am Heir Daphne Greengrass of the Most Ancient House of Greengrass, but please call me Daphne. Only if you call me Harry." swill is used again and again and I can't stand it because it's not how normal people interact.

**** Interesting, but that does not explain all muggleborn and muggles doing the same stuff. For Purebloods I can understand it from that angle, although the archaic interpretation of the wizarding world is also overused in my opinion.

***** For a few stories I think it's a cultural thing at least. Muffles/Muggleborns were brought into another country essentially seeing as magical Britain and Britain have been separated since before America separated I believe, it would make sense to learn and follow the cultural rules

*** Sure. I definitely didn't intent to paint every fanfiction with the same brush. I was just speaking in general.

I suppose I've just read a few fanfictions recently where people will notice that "plan is off" or "something is wrong" because they see someone they don't recognize. Like, that level of confidence is knowing everyone around you is astounding.

***** Referring to the ministry something I think is if we say the ministry started out small and slowly gained more tasks and power to uphold the statute of secrecy, it would grow and need more people working there but since it seems having only one or two kids is average from what were given the population doesn't increase with the demand for people in the ministry effectively.

***** Don't forget that most people are halfbloods, which means that magical/muggle couples aren't rare.

Also, their government has a huge area to cover and quite a few tasks beyond what a normal local council would have, like keeping the entire society secret. (Although my estimate would be somewhere around 500 employees, and even that might be a generous estimate.)

** i think to a certain extent, the smallness of the wizarding world makes sense, at least for harry's generation--

for one thing, while there's been debate about if JKR did it intentionally or not, many people noticed that her estimate of the hogwarts population was way off compared to the size of harry's class - but i think it's a safe assumption that his class would've had more students had there not been a war on (like, harry's parents & neville's parents didn't make it through, surely other would-be parents died before getting a chance to have kids). so we know his class is smaller than usual.

on top of that, if we assume that harry had at least some coverage in the newspaper, surely some extra fame would rub off on anyone tangentially connected to him - members of the DA, or classmates who had stories about school with him, or anyone who saw him in the final battle and gave a compelling interview. additionally, he spoke at the trials of the malfoys (.... i read a lot of drarry so pardon me if this is pure fanon but i feel /pretty/ sure JKR said this in an interview) so they probably would've gotten press coverage.

so, while i think it makes sense that right after the war there'd be a baby boom and the population would jump up again, i think it makes sense in a relatively insular community that the main players in fic (harry and other students at hogwarts with him) would probably know each other or at least know of each other, and might be a little bit famous on their own too.

** As far as I understand it, there is one school of magic in Britain, and there is how many that go there? Less than 200, I think, even accounting for the fact that the canon classes are smaller than normal (because of the previous war), it is still quite small. I would be surprised if magical Britain is more than 10k people.

And that is the same number as a small town where practically everyone knows who everyone of importance is.

And JKR said in some interview that magical Britain consisted of a population of about 3000.

Now I have no idea what she was thinking either.

*** The less than 200 estimate is based on all 7 years being the same as Harry's year (5 boys and 5 girls to a dorm, 10 students to a house per year). If that were the case then there would have to be at least one other magic school in Britain to take the extras. But the 40 students in Harry's year were only what was planned and not all of them are even mentioned in the books.

The thousands of students estimate is from (as far as I can tell) the first quidditch game the stands were packed with thousands of people. Fans tend to forget that parents, other relatives, scouts from pro teams, and important community members may also be in attendance; as they would at a school sports event in real life). Moreso because the travel times are more convenient.

***** Rowling is bad at math, she said as much in an interview once. I would pick a size between 40 (Harry's year) and 150 (his parents' year) and go from there. The staff is already inadequate for the number of students. They can't see any class more than 3 hours a week, and then only if they double up the houses for all classes like in the movies (even with 6th- and 7th-year classes being all 4 houses). This is with classes starting right after breakfast and ending just before dinner.

** i think that's more because everything tends to revolve around hogwarts. Boarding schools tend to have those everyone-knows-everybody type of vibes.

​

Though fanfiction can tend to make it feel smaller, cus as the fanfic authors know even minor characters so well after immersing into the fandom for so long, the familiarity shows through and is reflected in their writing. Where as JKR's canon didn't have time to address every minor character. It's the fandom that has developed randomly name-dropped characters like Daphne Greengrass into ones with loosley defined backstories and personalities.
