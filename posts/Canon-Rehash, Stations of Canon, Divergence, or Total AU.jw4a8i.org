On the scale from "Strictly following canon" to "Nothing recognizable from canon except a few names", where do people's preferences lie?

Personally, I'm a big fan of single-point-of-divergence fics (i.e. "for want of a nail"). I like stories that diverge from canon, but where those divergences all flow naturally from whatever the initial change/crossover was - piling on other unrelated changes tends to make it all lose focus. There are some of the so-called "Stations of Canon" that I prefer to still visit if possible, but they're a lot of more minor/humorous spots like the twins pelting Quirrellmort's turban with snowballs. Beyond that, I'd like the canon events to at least remain somewhat visible in the distance - I tend to lose interest in fics that have Harry go off to another school or make the main characters so different from their canon versions that they might as well be OCs.

*Edited to add:* I tend to most strongly prefer fics that have a single inciting divergence from canon (whether that's a single change or a crossover). "What if?"-type thought experiments are just a lot of fun for me, I guess.


** 2, 3\4, 1. When I'm reading fanfiction I don't want to be reading the same story as the books, if the thing you've changed doesn't change the story then skip to where it does and have you're changes as a prologue. There is always something to be said about knowing where a fanfiction is going to be, so that you can enjoy the different journey. Finally, the last two are often interchangeable.

*** When I say "Total AU" I'm referring to the kind of stuff that's barely even recognizable as a HP fic. If the characters' personalities are different, the magic system is completely changed, and it's set in the 1400s, at that point I feel like it's not a fanfic, just an original story with a coat of Potter-colored paint slapped on.

Most fics I've enjoyed do rehash bits of canon here or there, though the better ones do it quickly as an aside or a brief description rather than making me read through something I've already read (so. many. /Sortings/...). Sometimes, if it doesn't put me off completely, I'll just skim such scenes; it comes back to bite me on occasion, with the author burying a plot-relevant detail in the midst of the canon regurgitation, but that's not going to stop me.

** 3/4, 2, 1.

My favorite stories are total AUs and divergences that acknowledge the unavoidable stations of canon in passing. Or at least try to breathe some new life in them. Unfortunately, even many so called divergences force stations of canon. The most annoying is the need to stick to canon friendships and dynamics.

*** Yeah, I like the stations of canon for how they impact the character dynamics. And in fanfic I want to see how characters react differently and tell their own story.

Eg, I like the Goblet of Fire with the ball and favourite person. I also like the jealous friend after the champions are announced, but maybe there's a fourth friend who can sort the trio out, or maybe it's not Ron who's mad and the fight goes differently. How does this affect Moody's clues, what does this say about our Harry, can we trace anything back to the AU point?

** Divergence where the changes actually matter and impact the story.

Forcing the stations (and it's almost always forcing) actively detracts from my enjoyment of a fic.

** I like fics where something happens differently and Brigs even more changes to the story or canon compliant fics focused on characters that barely exist in the books or are dead before the books start.

Fics that rehash canon events to the dot are boring. There's nothing more disappointing than reading a story where for eg. James and Lily survive the Halloween and find it exactly the same as the series.

I also dislike total aus. I'm reading fanfiction because I want more stories in the universe I love. If I want to read something completely different then i won't look for it on FF.net or ao3.

** I don't like AUs because the sole reason I am reading fanfics is because I liked the original story. If you are going to write something completely different, may as well write an original story for which I can even support you financially. I usually prefer to read canon-compliant stories but from different eras or significantly different perspectives than Harry's. I am OK if there is some canon divergence occurring towards the end and even perfectly fine if the epilogue is ignored. I'm also fine if a story explores what-if scenarios but if characters or the world diverge too much from the originals I am back to point one.

*** You just summed up why I don't go for fics that are wildly AU, though I'm not as big a fan of fully canon-compliant stories - a one-shot or vignette is fine, but anything with real plot just leaves me going "I already know how this ends."

** I tend to prefer the single or double cannon divergance. My fic linkffn(13677583) has two points of divergance: a dark lord pre-grindlewald tried to make the elder wand his horcrux, (didn't work, it got him killed and Albus still used it for years) and my crossover ppl decided "I don't want to live on this planet anymore. Almost anywhere else is safer!" It's my first real fic, and I'm still improving my writing, but check it out if you think HP cannon doesn't have enough dragons in it.

  Elune, Night Elven Goddess of the Moon, has suddenly found herself needing to shepherd some dragons off-world. Maybe that Potter kid Fate gripes about at Poker Night would appreciate some dragons? Now rated Teen, with some violence and harsh language.

** I love canon-rehashes! My favorite ones are the ones that keep nearly all of the plot points from canon, but explore certain parts in greater depth or from a different perspective. I've gotten myself engrossed in fics that retold the exact same plot points, but from say Justin Finch-Fletchley's or Viktor Krum's POV. I've read others that explored the Shell Cottage parts but this time focusing on Hermione's recovery. These are some of my most beloved fics.

** I like point of divergence fics, but my favorite category might be one you didn't mention: filling in missing details from canon, with only the briefest mentions of the stations of canon, if absolutely necessary. How did Mad-Eye mentor Tonks? How did Andromeda and Ted get together? What was Remus doing between the wars? Stuff like that.
