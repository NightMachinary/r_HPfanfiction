/[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]]/ is often recommended here, but Annerb has also [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12569750/1/pick-it-up-pick-it-all-up-and-start-again][written]] [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12713008/1/we-can-still-be-who-we-said-we-were][three]] [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13143812/1/in-my-head-we-do-everything-right][sequels]], the last of which just completed. They all are well written, with a careful tone, and keep a delicate focus on the psychology and relationships of the characters.

Congratulations Annerb!

** Yeah, I just read it too! I didn't realize there was going to be a 4th part. I can't wait!

I feel like this is one of the strongest Ginny/Harry stories that really fleshed out their relationship and showed why they are a good match together.

** Both the Changeling and the Armistice series continue to be my favourite fanfiction of all time. Character development and relations are just so good. Slytherin Ginny feels completely canon. Everyone give it a shot if you haven't already!

** Can't wait for part 4 of the series, especially considering that the best subplot (where Harry always ends up in the Death Chamber) hasn't really been resolved.

Annerb is one of the best authors out there, so I would also recommend their AU mystery-romance [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16044434/chapters/37454639][we can't control (watch me unfold)]]. IMO, it's on par with the Armistice Series, if not even better.

** I read The Changeling when it was first published, and didn't realize then that sequels were coming. When I discovered them, did a re-read of The Changeling and blew through them.

I strongly recommend a re-read of The Changeling before you pick up the sequels. There's a lot about Ginny's relationships with her friends in the original that play into the sequel and it was good to remember those backgrounds.
