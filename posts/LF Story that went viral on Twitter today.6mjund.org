*Update:* As identified by [[/u/yarglethatblargle]] it is the first of a trilogy and called Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent ([[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/]]). They were started pre-OotP. I've been skimming the trilogy a little and everything in this main post is just from the first story. The second story has Harry in an alternate universe where Lily was spared, though I think he returns to his original universe for the final story of the trilogy. And despite the details shared here about the first story, it seems Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione are the pairings in the end. I know just reading the plot points make this sound crazy, but the stuff I've read, mostly from the second story, is actually quite good.

*Original:* There was a viral tweet today about someone whose friend had bought the entire HP series as an ebook and Order of the Phoenix was replaced with fan fiction. They shared some of the details from their friend, and it sounds amazing and I want to read it myself, but the person never mentioned the fanfic title.

Details from this story include:\\
* Dudley commits suicide by jumping off his school while under the Imperius Curse from Wormtail\\
* Harry and Hermione are together\\
* A wizarding age of consent being 15 is explicitly established\\
* Something about Draco and Ginny faking a rape scene\\
* Draco's dad tortures him\\
* Draco almost jumps in front of a subway after his mother disowns him\\
* Other girls at Hogwarts are charmed into falling in love with Harry\\
* Ron ruins his relationship with his girlfriend by calling out Hermione's name during sex\\
* Something about necrophilia\\
* Snape and Lily were implied to be lovers\\
* There are magical herbs that function as birth control/morning after pills\\
* Neville becomes addicted to a potion and then suffers withdrawal\\
* Harry has a pet snake Cassandra/Sandy with future sight\\
* Harry is a griffin animagus and Hermione rides on his back\\
* Petunia hated Lily because she refused to use magic to cure their mother's cancer

Okay, so what is this story?


** Just based off the pet snake thing, I'm 90% certain it's linkffn(Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent). I have been informed in the past that many people have stumbled upon it as being promoted as the 5th Harry Potter book.

*** Oh wow, flashbacks. I first saw this on a [[/r/harrypotter]] post from Tumblr talking about if Harry had a snake for a pet. This is the one where SPOILERS Dudley was given like a potion or something to be friends with Harry, just so his death would hit harder, right?

*** Oh, that author used to be one of the definite BNF in the fandom. +I think I remember some fandom shipping war kerfuffle with internet stalking involved?+ nope that was Cassie, [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/StalkerGate][StalkerGate]]. Anyway she was as big as Cassie Claire in my opinion. At that time there were very few epics in fandom and those two shaped a lot of the early fannon depiction of the characters.

If anyone is interested here is the fanlore page on the story. [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Psychic_Serpent][Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent]]

There are several tweets, but that's the first in the chain. Honestly, the text conversation is funnier than I could put into words.

*** I know, it sounds crazy. And this person thought it was the actual fifth book. And of all things, Dudley's death is what made them check with their friend to make sure they were reading the legit book.

** For some this is very much a back in the day thing. Back before OotP came out there was a lot of speculation and that's how a lot of this stuff came about. The sheer number of old Order of the Phoenix stories that came out around that time was just insane because people would use it to try to drive views.

** I started reading this based on the tweets, via buzz feed. Whilst out of context, it sounds bizarro, the author does a good job of making it flow really well. Even my post Deathly Hallows mind didn't complain about the deviations because of how logical the alternative outcomes seemed to be written.

That being said, I'm only roughly halfway through the first book. I may end up hating it!
