Just Another Orphan is an (sadly) unfinished fic that I found intriguing because of three aspects it included. What I'm looking for right now are good fics that have at least one of these three aspects. To cut it short, the fics I'm looking for must be one of these;

​

- A Not-Bwl Harry fic but Harry is still an orphan and suffered Dursleys.

- A Slytherin Harry fic but the fic starts from Harry's later years of Hogwarts (from fourth year at least) and Harry is not a lord and/or politicking mastermind but neither hated/isolated within the house.

- A fic in which Harry meets with Sirius when he is older than thirteen.

​

Thanks in advance.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10724650/1/][/Death Before Dishonour/]] is also abandoned, but it follows a Not-BWL Harry and his interactions with the other Slytherins starting at 6th year. I usually recommend it along Just Another Orphan as they're similar in quality. linkffn(10724650)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What-Would-Slytherin-Harry-Do][/What Would Slytherin Harry Do/]] is a humor story but it satisfies your second criteria. The timeline jumps around but it does start during Harry's later years in Slytherin. linkffn(3559907)

  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five
