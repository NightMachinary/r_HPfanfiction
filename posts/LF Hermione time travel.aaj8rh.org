But I think that I read everything complete/long so I'm looking for something recent. Is there a new fic with Hermione as main character where she time travel? Or maybe even someone from the future is in the past (when Golden Trio is in school) and fall in love with Hermione? Please, let me know! :)


** There is “Hermione Granger and the Serpents Renaissance” by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10991501/8/][epsi10n]], where Hermione is a reincarnated Salazar Slytherin.

As for more traditional “Hermione time travels” fics, I have one great rec: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11405979/1/Quantum-Entanglement][Quantum Entanglement]]

And one shameless plug, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12916745/1/A-Stumble-in-Time][my own fic]]

** This one is probably my favorite time travel fic I've read so far. And it's fairly recent! (published in August 2018, last updated at the end of November) It's got ~50k words at the moment. This takes place part way through Hermione's third year and is based on her perspective. She's not the traveler though. I blasted through the thing in one sitting and can't wait for the next update!

edit: I forgot the actual link, haha.
