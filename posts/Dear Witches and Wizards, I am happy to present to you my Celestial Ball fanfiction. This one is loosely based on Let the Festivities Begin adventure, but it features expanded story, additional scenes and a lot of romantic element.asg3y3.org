#+TITLE: Dear Witches and Wizards, I am happy to present to you my Celestial Ball fanfiction. This one is loosely based on Let the Festivities Begin adventure, but it features expanded story, additional scenes and a lot of romantic elements between the protagonist and Merula Snyde. I hope you'll find it fun

** Nice!! Your writing is seriously great. :)

I'm also playing the Celestial Ball now (about to pick my dress in a few hours, any suggestions??) and I'm taking Penny as my date. So I'm in the mood for CB stories.

I hope you keep writing this fic, it's a great ship. :)

** I enjoyed reading your writing as it offers more of a new perspective innermost thinkings of the character. Will there be more as for the story arc writings as I see only up to year two?

*** It's an event in the mobile game called Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery.\\
Playing the game for some time now but I felt like the story was lacking on romance and all that good stuff so I decided to write my own fan fiction based on the game/event.

**** Oh that's cool! I'll check it out. Um, do I need to play the game to get the plot, or can I just read the wiki synopsis?
