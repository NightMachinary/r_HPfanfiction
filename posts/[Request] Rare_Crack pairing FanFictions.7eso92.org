Hey There! Are there any fics you can recommend where Harry is paired up with a rare/crack pairing? I am curious to see the ways people use to make those pairings work and such. For example Harry x Andromeda Tonks, Harry x Narcissa, Harry x Amelia Bones, Harry x OC Sister or Harry x Lily and so on. Even people like Cho, Pansy, and Hannah Abbot, and such for example. Even Rowena Ravenclaw who got into the future via time-travel and got paired with Harry and things like that. I would very much prefer the pairing not to be slash or anything to AU to the point that it is not recognizable. Thanks!


** *Narcissa:*

- Linkffn(Narcotic Effects)

- Linkao3(Why Are You In My House?)

- Linkffn(The Favor)

*Sister:*

- Linkffn(Potters Against the World) --- Harry/sister/Gabrielle. I haven't personally read this one, so I don't know if it's decent or not.

- Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unnecessarily Amorous Relationship) --- short, but fun and worth a read.

- This guy has a bunch of stories featuring Harry and his sister, daughter, or mum. I believe it's mostly smut though: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4499780/James-Davey-Smith]]

*Fem!Harry:*

- Linkffn(11897565) --- Incomplete, but decent.

- Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived) --- Do yourself a favor and stop reading after Voldemort dies. Or maybe just don't read this one at all?

*Lily:*

- The only decent one I've read is linkffn(Dragonlily) and it's Harry/Lily/Narcissa and I think Fleur too? It's incomplete.

*Andromeda:*

- Linkffn(Starting Over by JackPotr) --- only one I could remember that wasn't just pure smut. Dunno if it's good.
