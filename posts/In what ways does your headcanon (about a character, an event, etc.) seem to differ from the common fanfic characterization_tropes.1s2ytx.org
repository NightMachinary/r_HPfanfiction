For example, I've always seen Marlene as older than Lily or even middle-aged, but in fics she's often portrayed as Lily's closest friend.


** Well, I certainly never imagined Wormtail as only being friends with the Marauders so they could make fun of him/half-heartedly like him. A lot of writers write the Maraudes as Remus, Sirius, James, and that loser tagalong Peter. I have never pictured that. I think some people do because they can't or don't want to imagine Wormtail as someone who truly loved and was loved by his friends and betrayed them anyways. I do like reading James/Lily and Marauder era fanfiction, where the Marauders are obviously important to the story, so this trope bugs me.

*** Consider that if he "truly loved" his friends, he wouldn't betray them.

There have to be some pretty big issues in a person to continue to pretend at being part of a group while actively plotting their demise. Good authors will try to make sure their characters have reasons for their major actions.

As for tendency to pretend that he was somewhat mistreated by the group - that's probably an attempt at shifting his morality to a grey area rather then just having him as this plain black villain that back stabbed his best friends no good reason.

*** I don't think Hermione would ever ever accept it as a nickname or allow people to call her that on anything close to a regular basis, but I don't mind it used extremely sparingly by Ron ('Mione, grab that, would you?). It's a natural shortening of the word, like Gin/Ginny or Hon/Honey.

But use by any other character but Ron (including Hermione herself), and it's the back button for me.

*** Reacting the same way to all these nicknames.

Considering how her name sounds when spoken, shortening it to 'Mione changes it rather strongly in a diminutive way.

Herms conveys a deliberately sloppy address and doesn't fit with her personality as portrayed in the books (sort like calling McGonagall "Mags" to her face)

"Mine" is the worst of them - doesn't sound anything like her name, extremely sappy for a "private" nickname, and is a commonly used word which would very quickly become annoying to a person if their "name" was constantly mentioned in unrelated conversation.

*edit The biggest problem I have with nicknames like that is that cannon books have already given good examples of nicknames for marauders and every one of them sound nothing like the original name yet still works fine as a nickname. Even laying aside whether she would tolerate one, Hermione has exactly the type of name that would prompt friends to adopt an entirely different sounding nickname rather attempting to shorten her actual name if they wanted to come up with something else to call her.

** I've always thought that the events described Snape's worst memory was actually a deliberate attempt from him to push Lily away. I'm not sure in which way this differs from common fanfic convention, but it's the explanation that makes the most sense to me.

I also see the wizarding world as being much larger and far more intricate than both canon and fanfic convention indicate. There almost /has/ to be, given the prevalence of sapience in the magical ecosystem. With so many different species exhibiting human-level intelligence competing for limited space/resources, the degree of interaction would be a lot higher than has been shown to be the case thus far. The most popular fanfiction convention focuses almost exclusively on Goblin/wizard interaction. This is an extremely limited perspective in my mind.

****** Neither, actually.

What I think Snape wanted to ensure was his own survival. If he didn't become a Death Eater, then he would have made for an easy target-his dorm-mates would have known where he lived, who he lived with and how to get to him. A perfect dry run for initiates. He also knew that, if he acceded but stayed friends with a muggleborn, then that muggleborn would end up being a loyalty test of some kind.

I am really not sure what his feelings would have been towards Lily when he made that plan-he's one hard bastard to get a grip of when writing him as a character for me. And I honestly don't think his emotions vis-a-vis her dictated his decision in the end.

What mattered to him was his own survival and, given that I don't think he could have killed anybody he considered a true friend if he tried (by virtue of having so few of them, for instance), she had to be removed as a potential initial target. The easiest way to do that was simply to make it look like they weren't friends. Whatever feelings he actually had, good or bad, had nothing to do with it.

Of course, given that the culmination of his plan led to the formation of his worst memory, the consequences said decision had on him from an emotional standpoint were profound.

But no. His survival dictated his actions. His desire to preserve Lily would have been a secondary consideration at that stage since it really wasn't clear whether she would survive to see her sixth year given her muggleborn status. Small family, located in a muggle suburb with few, if any, magical protections on location. Really, it's a wonder she managed to survive to graduation. Snape would have had to assume that she wouldn't have long to go. The best he could do was increase her (and his) chances of survival.

His regret at the act indicated that he did, in fact, feel things for her.

And, come to think of it, I don't know that I have ever read a fanfic that focused at all on merpeople. It just doesn't make sense to have these highly isolated, disparate groups living in such close proximity and we never hear anything at all about them.

** In canon, most purebloods are completely clueless about technology and Muggle stuff, and many fics show wizards lacking common sense and being just plain... stupid. But I don't think the Wizarding world would survive for very long in the modern world like that. I mean you got cameras everywhere in London, satellite imagery, special agencies spying on everyone, etc. So I like to think that there are wizards (most likely in the Ministry) whose job it is to keep up with Muggle tech, upgrade the magical protections and keep the Wizarding world safe and out of sight.

And in general, I'd like to think that purebloods who don't even know what electricity is (I'm looking at you, Weasleys) are a minority. Either their lifestyle is so comfortable and luxurious that they have no need for Muggle inventions (House Elves taking care of all the housework, etc.) or they're just pureblood supremacists who scorn all things Muggle. Or maybe they're just naive, traditional, and clueless like the Weasleys are.
