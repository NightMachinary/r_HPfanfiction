I just saw a post on Harry Potter about that and thought it would be a funny prompt.

Edit: Yeah, I get it, I get it.

Can't we just overlook all the technical problems and make it work?

Seriously, I understand, but I just wanted a funny prompt without having to read 9 comments about how it would just tear his arm off.

He can easily regrow it on the spot!


** Yes, that's constant question: why in the world, they didn't have wands on a strap? There is that one tool without which they are completely useless, which is so easy to loose, get taken from me, why in the world, they just didn't make a strap and bound it to themselves? Why, oh, why?

*** Older variant of the disarming spell that took the hand with the wand if the wand was attached to you?

***** That works well.

The prompt above does kinda get disrupted by it though. (Could be a fun side prompt. Voldemort thinking he is unbeatable only to fail in the first encounter would be hilarious.)

Having it be an older variant allows voldy to have a bit of success before someone like Hermione finds a copy of the other spell.

** I think the problem with a lot of the “common sense easy fixes” is that they will only work once. A wii strap around your wand, using a gun,... is the type of stuff you do once, the other side sees it and comes up with a way around it or copies it and then both sides are screwed. The Order sees Death Eaters with the straps? They'll copy it and use Sectumsempra or a similar spell to just cut their hands off.

**** Yeah but in those situations you could also use AK. They are usually talking about situations like the battle at the ministry or the final battle. People will see that and there is no way there won't be any evidence left.

If people get out alive and there's evidence left, then you're just not being diligent enough when sanitizing the situation.

****** Phenderix: Magic world on Nexus mods.

Complete with a ton of thinly veiled Harry Potter references.

I really couldn't enjoy it too much, (the characters are all generic voices from Skyrim) but the magic was neat. I spent days getting every dragon mod and magic mod.

***** Might not fit your interests, but what I play when I want a HP gaming fix is strangely enough The Sims.

Sims 3 plus the Supernatural expansion allows you to make witches and... witches (they didn't do gender specific names...). It came out when the HP series was popular the first time so is basically based on it.

So make your favorite characters (and least favorite) and stick them in a house together. (Though some of the enjoyment is due to the fact that I "acquired" most of the 500 dollars of dlc via other means, I don't know how differently it plays without the 10 expansion packs installed... )

Of course If you don't like life sims then that is probably not for you.

****** I've played a sadistic game or two of Sims, and I'm fond of total war and civ games, but I do prefer active characters when playing with magic.

I totally get where you're coming from though. I'm loathe to "acquire" software (not an ethics thing... It's just a security risk at best.) But Sims is pretty interesting.

******** Yep! Plus steam has made 98% of games dirt cheap and easy to download, and any old game I just buy a CD for it or go on GOG.

Media is fine though. There's been a few security issues, but for the most part it is dumb data. There's a trick to get better movies. Take the extended editions, and the deleted scenes and link them using mkv's linked files in the proper order.

Keep the audio the same format, but resolution doesn't matter. You get a vastly superior experience.

** When Snape "disarmed" Lockhart he blew him off his feet and into a wall. If he had a strap attached to his wand, that strap would snap in two. If he made that strap unbreakable, he would have torn his entire arm straight off.

​

There is some serious horsepower behind that spell.
