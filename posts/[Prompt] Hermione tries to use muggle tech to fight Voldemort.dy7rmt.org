Except he had to deal with this stuff already and is wearing shield charm robes.

** Death Eaters should be running with Protego enchanted clothes 24/7. In HBP, the Twins supplied the Ministry with so called “Shield Hats” that could stop charms and hexes. I can imagine Death Eaters developing much more powerful protective clothing.

They would also use apparition and disillusionment charm whenever convenient. It would be hard for Harry and his friends to identify targets after some early successes.

On top of that, Voldemort is someone who totally loves destructive things. Never, ever assume that because the Dark Lord hates Muggles, he would not adopt their modern inventions he finds useful. If Bellatrix runs around with a knife as secondary weapon, what's to prevent Voldemort from using a [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minigun][minigun]] that is magically cooled, lightened, recoil free, and fed by a vastly expanded magazine?

I think the following scene should rather be funny:

#+begin_quote
  Harry and his guerrilla fighters have finally surprised the Dark Lord in the Forest of Dean. He strode forward and declared: “Tom, your evil ways end here today!”

  To his surprise, a minigun emerged from Voldemort's enchanted left sleeve. Firing at 3000 rounds per minute, it cut down Harry to several pieces before he could even scream. Harry's friends returned fire after the initial shock, but their bullets bounced off harmlessly against Voldemort's robe, charmed with Dark Lord's strongest Protego Maxima. It didn't take more than 60 seconds before they were all silenced by Voldemort's minigun and killing curses.

  Looking at the carnage, Voldemort madly cackled: “Muahahaha! Honestly Harry Potter, do you really believe I was that incompetent as not to make a few cool weapons of my own?”

*** Logically, yes, but Voldemort only ever manages to get caught by Dumbledore and Harry anyways.

I'm just sick of fics that make the villains these unlearning incompetent idiots to make the heroes look better.

I got a good chuckle out of your response though.

*** *Minigun*

The M134 Minigun is a 7.62×51mm NATO six-barrel rotary machine gun with a high, sustained rate of fire (2,000 to 6,000 rounds per minute). It features a Gatling-style rotating barrel assembly with an external power source, normally an electric motor. The "Mini" in the name is in comparison to larger-caliber designs that use a rotary barrel design, such as General Electric's earlier 20 mm M61 Vulcan, and "gun" for the use of rifle caliber bullets as opposed to autocannon shells.

"Minigun" refers to a specific model of weapon that General Electric originally produced, but the term "minigun" has popularly come to refer to any externally powered rotary gun of rifle caliber.

*** That requires a level of forward thinking no one in Harry Potter barring Dumbledore displays.

Also, shields in Canon stop physical objects. This is not meant to bash Canon Hermione, but rather the stories that try to do a copout with guns being the answer.

**** Hermione is the other person who plans far ahead. In any case, fair enough about the goal. I just find the concept of Voldemort sharing a cell with Grindelwald hilarious. There's the tense, shrill Tom, always plotting an escape, and the mellow, philosophical Gellert, who just wants to have a pleasant prison sentence, which annoys Tom to no end.

*** Or you could portkey him into an active volcano, or, like, the bottom of the Mariana Trench, or something. Someplace where he'd die before he had a chance to realise what killed him.

**** That's not nearly as entertaining as having him share a cell with Grindelwald, who's mellowed out over the years.

*Grindelwald:* It ain't all bad, here. I've even got a still going. Not the best bathtub gin, but I'm working on it. Want some?

*Voldemort:* I gave up my ability to be intoxicated for an immunity to mind-altering Potions twenty years ago.

*Grindelwald:* Bummer, man. Wouldn't drink the stuff for the taste, that's for sure...

/[Even later...]/

*Grindelwald:* When I was your age, Tom, I looked into the whole immortality thing, too, and you know what I discovered? The harder you try to become immortal, the more people will be trying to kill you, that's what. I remember, old Nicholas was telling Albus and me, that for every year of life they got out of that stone, he and Perenelle, they had to spend half of it guarding the Stone and reinforcing the protections, and another third fighting off assassins. They never did figure out if it was worth it.

/[Even later...]/

*Voldemort:* But surely you still have followers on the outside who could help us escape!

*Grindelwald:* I've got some fans, sure. Sometimes, they sneak me weed. You can have some next time they do.

*Voldemort:* Intoxication immunity.

*Grindelwald:* Oh, right. Sorry, man.

My own damn fault---spelled the whole place to keep prisoners isolated from news in Europe when I built it.

Harry fired. Not that it was noticeable with his silenced and magically-enhanced sniper rifle, which was charmed so that it could hit a fly at twenty-five hundred meters, but he fired at Voldemort nonetheless. He closed his eyes and smiled in exhilaration. He had done it, there was no way he hadn't. Hermione assured him it would work, having cast the spells herself.

Harry opened his eyes, and looked at the corpse of his enemy... standing there, surrounded by a fading dome of purple light, looking back at Harry from his perch on the Astronomy Tower. Then, he heard a chilling sound, one that he had hoped never to hear again.

The triumphant laughter of Lord Voldemort.

Voldemort flicked his wand, then spoke. The words were eerily quiet, and yet carried all the way up to Harry's lofty position.

"You fools. You utter imbeciles. Do you think I am ignorant of Muggle weapons? Do you think that it will be that easy to win?"

"I grew up as Grindelwald's War ravaged England. I was there when the bombs fell. I am not so idiotic as to dismiss the power of Muggle warfare."

"And I am not so arrogant as to think myself naturally invincible. Thus, I devised ways to protect myself."

"And do you see, Harry Potter? Your bold plan has failed you. I have survived your best attempt. But you have not my forethought, and you will not survive mine."

"Fire."

Bellatrix fired. Not that it was noticeable with her silenced and magically-enhanced sniper rifle, which was charmed so that it could hit a fly at forty-five hundred meters, but she fired at Harry nonetheless. She laughed as she saw him fall, as she saw the Mudblood and the blood traitor fall beside him from her fellow Death Eaters' shots. She laughed as her Master swept through the broken doors of Hogwarts Castle, the limp body of the Boy-Who-Died floating behind him.
