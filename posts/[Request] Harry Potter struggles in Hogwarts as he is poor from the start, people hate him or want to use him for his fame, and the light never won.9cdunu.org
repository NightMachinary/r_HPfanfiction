**** Sounds like a Voldemort Won AU. There are only really 2 good fics in that category; those being POTDK and Champion. In Champion he is not allowed to keep the Potter name and is instead Harry Evans. There is a lot of hostility directed towards him at school especially when he represents Hogwarts in the Triwiazard tournament.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.

******** Throughout books 1-4 Voldemort was extremely weakened. Bringing himself to full strength was his top priority. Would doing your homework be your first priority if your legs got cut off? No it wouldn't.

Also even if Voldemort decided that Harry stood no chance against him, if there is even the slightest chance he was wrong then that's a liability. And Voldemort can't afford any of those. It would be better to Kill him off.

Also if Voldemort didn't view Harry as a threat then why would he duel Harry in the first place in goblet of fire? Why not let some death eater do it?
