** Blood... I sssmell blood...

I'm making a note there:

HUGE SSSUCESSS.

It'sss hard to overssstate my excssitation.

​

Hogwartsss Wizarding Ssschool.

Draco dormiensss nunquam titillandusss.

For the good of all, Albusss,

Excssept those filthy mudbloodsss.

​

But there'sss no sssenssse prying over cent'riesss-old sssnake.

They will all end dying unlessss they got mandrake.

And the curssse getsss ssspun and I make sssure they're gone,

All those mudbloodsss who are ssstill alive.

​

I am not even hungry.

I ate many ratsss sssomehow.

But then you piercssed my eyesss and killed me.

And took one of my fangsss.

And then used it againssst the massster.

Asss he burned it hurt because

Fawkesss had already healed you!

​

Now these plantsss of adult mandrake and everyone isss fine...

How convenient isss it they matured jussst in time?

Ssso I'm mad I got turned

Into a pile of bonesss urned

In the chamber where I came alive.

​

Go ahead and leave me.

I think I prefer to ssstay inssside.

Maybe you'll find sssomeone elssse to eat you.

Maybe Minerva...

THAT WASSS A JOKE. Haha. FAT CHANCSSE.

Anyway, this lake isss great.

It isss ssso ominousss and moissst.

​

Look at me ssstill talking when there'sss murder to do.

When I look out there I'm ssstill mad about you.

I've yet a war I want won, there isss horror to be done

On the mudbloodsss who are ssstill alive.

​

And believe me *I* am ssstill alive.

I'm rot upon ssstone but I'm ssstill alive.

I feel FANTASSSTIC and I'm ssstill alive.

While you're dying I'll be ssstill alive.

And when you're dead I will be ssstill alive.

​

Ssstill alive.

Ssstill alive.

  When Vernon Dursley tries to pass his baby nephew onto Aperture where he works he ends up a victim of GLaDOS when she activates but Harry survives and when GLaDOS senses his magic he is about to join a very unusual family. So when he goes to Hogwarts years later how will things change with him being raised by a mental AI and a loving but quiet woman.

  Petunia sends a baby Harry to her aunt, living in America, Caroline Evans. Some years later, Caroline becomes GLaDOS, and only Harry stops her from her rampage. Now, Harry is eleven, and he's heading to Hogwarts. Of course, with an amoral scientist/computer for a great-aunt and a mute big sister, the question is not whether he is ready for Hogwarts. Is Hogwarts ready for him?

  When Harry Potter is left with the Dursleys, his name is written into Vernon computer. Meanwhile, a certain Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System is searching the globe for any trace of the children of Caroline, two girls who were put up for adoption after their mother's disappearance in 1987. Their names are now Lily Potter and Petunia Dursley.

** Reminds me of an idea I had some time ago. Hogwarts is sentinent, caused by picking up by stray magic and whatnot over the years. After the Quirrel debacle, Hogwarts picks up Tom's soul and inherits his malevolence. Basically GLaDOS-level malevolence. Can't directly hurt people but can do it indirectly by manipulating things like doors, stairs, etc. Locks everyone inside the building as Voldemort!Hogwarts comes up with increasingly convulted ways to make the lives of its inhabitants miserable.
