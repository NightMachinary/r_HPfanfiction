I'm pretty sure it's on archive of our own. He saves the early female Targarians, is a glutton and pervert, huge and golden, and generally messes up the other throne's plans. Deanery's rides him and he helps raise the OG 3 baby dragons in the series. I cannot find this ANYWHERE but I know I read it.

(Sorry for any misspelling, I typed this in voice text on my phone.)


** I'm not judging or anything, but why on Earth would you want to find this fic

*** It's something I read in the past, and while it's not something I normally read, it was written in such a way that after I stumbled across it, I read the entire thing in one night. It's witty and weird and different but not so much that if was off putting. Honestly, it could be it's own independent piece off of got or hp, just on the world building oc'ness.
