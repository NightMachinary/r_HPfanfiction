But then he discovers an ability that he needs help with and only one person can provide that-Tonks. They bring the fight to the DEs in their own way so that the war will finally end.

** The metamorphmagus is used as a plot device in the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Linear Circle series]], but it is subtle and takes a long time before you really understand it (like maybe by the third story in the series). The story is so good, though, that I had to mention it.
