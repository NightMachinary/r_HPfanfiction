I want to read future fics in which Harry becomes an auror in which he has... adventures against the dark side, or whatever.

Preferably on the long side (80'000+ words?), with action/plot more important than romance, and doesn't have to be epilogue-compliant. Hell, it doesn't even have to be /canon/ compliant - if the war against Voldemort is still going on, if Voldemort doesn't exist at all, if Harry is a girl, if the story is set in space, if everyone is alive, or if everyone is dead, I don't much care. Any good fic goes.

Bonus if there are political machinations and stuff going on in the background. ... or the forefront, really.

FloreatCastellum is one of my favorite authors, it's H/G but the main focus is on the crimes going on in the auror department.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

Years later, Harry struggles with the balance of his latest Auror case involving a wizard ritualistically murdering Muggles, periodic contract renewals, and both the developing and deteriorating relationships with those closest to him.
