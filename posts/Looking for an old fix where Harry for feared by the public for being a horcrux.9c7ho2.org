Edit: fic, not fix. Stupid phone.

I read a story about 5 years ago where either just James or both James and Lily survived the attack, but Harry was still a horcrux.

Harry was raised as a normal wizard kid, but when he was little, people heard him speak Parseltongue. Rumors made the public believe he was really an amnesiac Voldemort in Harry's body, a la 7th Horcrux. Harry got sorted into Slytherin and was afraid to disprove the rumors because he throught everyone would turn on him, so he pretended to be a reincarnated Voldemort.

Does anyone know what it was?

Thanks!
