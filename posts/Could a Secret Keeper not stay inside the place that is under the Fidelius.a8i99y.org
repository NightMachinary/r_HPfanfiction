That way it would be safe forever? Nobody could find the secret keeper because they would be protected by the Fidelius.


** Bill lived at Shell Cottage, and he was secret keeper there. Arthur lived at +the Burrow+ Muriel's house, and he was secret keeper there.

The thing with Peter being the keeper for James and Lily is a silly plot device. Same thing with Dumbledore being the secret keeper of Grimmauld Place.

*** When was the Burrow under a Fidelius?

We know there was the whole ghoul/ron ploy because the Dark Ministry could inspect the Burrow. We also know that the Burrow is attaked and invaded by Death Eaters during Bill's wedding reception.

#+end_quote

+Well after the wedding, probably during Easter, since Ginny returned home+ Sorry, Muriel's house, that's where the Fidelius was cast.

When the trio escape from Malfoy Manor and get to Shell Cottage, that's what Bill tells them.

*** Who would you give the Grimmauld Place secret to instead? Dumbledore's the one who's most trustworthy (with the war effort), and most in contact with anyone who might need to get in. Sirius is a bit isolated to make contact with people, and people not already in the order might not trust who they think is a betraying mass murderer.

** There are two ways to go about this: this is an entirely possible thing, and all of the characters are morons for not doing it, completely ruining any possible tension or empathy for James and Lily, and possibly giving damning evidence that Dumbledore is incomptent.

Or, the Keeper cannot stay /permanently/ within the protection of the secret (as Dumbledore was the Keeper for Grimmauld Place, you can obviously visit and it not break the charm)

But most importantly, Rowling isn't the most logical writer and there are plot holes in the books big enough to fly a dragon through.

*** Sounds like you are reading too much fanfiction ;). You have the benefit of knowing how it went down in the end. But for characters in question, they had no reason to doubt Peter's loyalty. Besides, there is a good reason why Peter was chosen as secret keeper:

1. Dumbledore was the leader of the Order of Phoenix. He can't take care of security details of every lower-tier member when more important tasks are at hand. He can't play escort every time someone needs to meet the Potters.
2. Yes, the prophecy makes Potters and Longbottoms much more important. But again, from perspective of OoP and Dumbledore, it could very well have been a fluke. The Fidelius charm was the "just in case".
3. Dumbledore would have been the obvious safekeeper. In fact, as Voldemort you'd expect him to be everyone's safekeeper. A single point of failure. You want resistance to go on without him, not to perish with him.
4. Peter was a childhood friend. A friend who has proved his loyalty and skill. He was in fact as good as anyone else save for Dumbledore.
5. Everyone in the Order must have expected Voldemort to go after the Longbottoms instead as they were pure-blood. Potters' security could be a bit lax given this.

> Rowling isn't the most logical writer and there are plot holes in the books big enough to fly a dragon through.

That's like saying "Why didn't the eagle take the ring and drop in Mt. Doom?" or "Frodo should have expected Gollum's betrayal".

​

That's how stories are written. Characters make mistake (just like in real life) to drive the story forward.

***** .....Shouldn't that be obvious? Imagine James Potter dead in some ditch. You expect his six month Pregnant wife to be the secret keeper? Kinda defeats the purpose.

But I guess everyone here has a hard-on for edgy fic they read two years ago about lord Potter.

Did you forget about the Fellbeasts? The flying mounts of the Nazgûl? Not to mention the Crebain who could spy them. Or the fuckhuge Eye that could see them coming?

That's not a plothole, you're just ignorant.

** That is what Bill and Arthur (Weasley) did in DH, didn't they?

Although there is a plot hole there. Ron says that Shell cottage is under a Fidelius and Bill is the secret keeper, yet he is able to tell Dobby the address.

** Bill is the one that messes this up

My favorite fanon interpretation is used in a couple fics, where it's basically conceptual magic based around the idea of trusting someone else with the secret to keep it safe, even though HP magic doesn't really directly operate on those principles.

** I think it is possible. My way of going about it is that the person who owns the land cannot become the Secret Keeper but rather the Secret giver. This would make sense as Sirius is not the Secret Keeper of Grimmauld Place and James and Lily are not their own secret keepers in Godric's Hollow. Arthur becomes the Secret Keeper of their Great Aunt Muriel's house. The only thing that stumps me is Bill being the Secret Keeper of Shell Cottage. We could say that Bill wasn't actually owning the place at the time and it could have been leased or something, but I don't know if it could be true.

So the Secret Keeper can stay in the place forever, but they most likely won't, because it isn't their home.

** IF you wanna be consistent with canon? Maybe.

Personally it doesn't make sense. Keeper living inside the fidelius, mutual fidelius or oathbound keeper completely negate the fidelity concept. Where's the faith? If you make a situation where you KNOW that the secret can't be revealed because the keeper is staying in the same house/another house under a fidelius/can't spill the secret without dropping dead of a magical aneurysm, there's no element trust involved.
