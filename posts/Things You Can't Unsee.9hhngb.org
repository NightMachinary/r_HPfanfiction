Sometimes fanfic leave my brain broke. What else have you come across that just won't go?

Edit: Damn, this got popular.


** A Veela's Worth.

Easily the worst fic I've read. Another terrible one is one where Harry kills Hermione in the tent and fucks her corpse. Then Ron comes in, looks at the scene, and says he hopes Harry left her ass for him or something. Shit was so wild I laughed, but only so I didn't cry.

****** It was the first fanfic I ever read. Not just HP but anything. I'd only ever been vaguely aware of fan fiction at all, and thought it was nothing more than illiterate Trek stories that ended up with Spock shagging Kirk for no immediately obvious reason. Of course I now realise it's also about illiterate HP stories that have Harry shagging Draco for no immediately obvious reason, but that's not important right now.

DAYD seemed incredible to me, largely in a "You can do this?" sort of way. So I read more stories, and quickly realised that DAYD wasn't anywhere near as good as I'd first thought.

There are a few other stories like that: things that I praised at the time because I was still enjoying the novelty of it all.

I certainly wouldn't praise it these days though.

******* I dunno, I think it's just plain bad. The writing is technically sound, but all the stuff I mentioned above is just terrible. The boys are all manly soldiers, glorified and worshipped by the delicate flowers that are the girls. I'm fairly certain there isn't even a single character who isn't OOC, except maybe Harry, Hermione, and Ron, and that's only due to the fact that their dialogue almost all comes straight from the book. Also, the three leaders, all pure-bloods, go by muggle military titles (Commander, sergeant, lieutenant, etc).

In the end, characters become above all else for me. You can have a fantastic world and plot, but with shit characters, I'm not going to care. You can have a boring world and a mediocre plot, but with great characters, you can have something fantastic. This fic has shit characters, a plot that ends how we already know it does, and the sexism and outright insanity of the author doesn't help matters.

But some people love it. Go figure.
