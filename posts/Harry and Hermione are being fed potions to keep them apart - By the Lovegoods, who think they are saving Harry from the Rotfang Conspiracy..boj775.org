**** Nah it's not too bad down here. Sure it's hitting the low 30's right now, but at least it ain't in the high 30's. Plus after living here for so long, you get kind of used to it. At least it ain't Australia, I hear their temperature during Summer hits the low 40's regularly, f*** that.

Yes, f*** that, although it's currently midwinter so it's not a problem right now.

** Eh, I'll give it a whirl

--------------

On an otherwise normal morning several weeks after Voldemort's defeat, the six most significant members of Dumbledore's Army gathered together because the narrator said so.

And Luna had an idea. It involved two small vials of a strange, golden potion.

"I don't know, Luna. I had an awfully big breakfast..." Harry hesitated as he looked at the small vial in his hands.

"Please?" Luna looked up at him with wide, hopeful, gentle eyes. "It was a recipe I made with my father...the Christmas before...liquified treacle tart was the base ingredient?"

"Well..." Harry took the vial and uncorked it. Luna gasped, as if holding her breath.

"Oh, I have one for Hermione too!"

Hermione took her vial without a word. The eccentricities of the Lovegoods were a sore subject--though after a particularly fierce argument with Ginny defending Luna, and the weeks Hermione and Luna had spent together at Shell Cottage had smoothed over most of the animosity.

"What on earth?" Harry tried to take a step forward but found that he couldn't. It was among the strangest sensation he had ever felt. It didn't feel as if his legs were stuck; there was no sense of pain or even pressure.

"Luna! What have you done?!"

"Please don't be angry with me," Luna looked from Harry to Hermione to Ginny, her large grey eyes brimming with tears. "I'm doing this for your own good."

"What exactly did you do?"

"The potion...Daddy whipped it up...It will keep the people who drank the sample, in this case Harry and Hermione, from being within ten feet of each other at any time."

"What?!"

"It's for your own good!" Luna insisted.

"By keeping us physically separated?" Hermione scowled. "Did Mrs. Weasley put you up to this? I am a grown woman and am perfectly capable of making my own choices with regards to my relationship with Ron."

"Oy!" Ron said. "I've told Mum already that Hermione and I weren't planning on having children for at least a year after we were married."

"No! That's not what I meant!"

"Why even dose Harry and Hermione--Mum knows they are /not/ dating." Ginny interrupted. "No matter how many times Rita Skeeter lies about it."

"On that note," Harry took three steps backwards, noting that he could move away from Hermione, and then stepped on a very large beetle, squashing it flat.

"Harry, I fairly certain that wasn't Rita."

"I know, but one day, it might be."

"So wait a moment," Hermione snapped. "Luna, why the bloody hell did you feed me a potion that forces me to be apart from Harry?"

"Oy!" Ron called, "/Bloody hell/ is my line! You invoke Merlin and his pants...for some reason."

"Ronald! You cannot own swear words!"

"It's because of the Rotfang Conspiracy!" Luna insisted, tears streaming down her cheeks. "Please, it was for your own good!"

"Oh, what the bloody, buggering hell is the Rotfang Conspiracy? What did your lunatic father trick you into this time?"

"Hermione!" Ginny snapped, "That was mean! Say you're sorry!"

"Ginny, I have told you eleven times that I do not believe that people should be told to apologize....It always feels off..."

"Luna, answer the question!"

"Isn't that the one where the Aurors are seeking to take over the Ministry with Dark Magic and tooth decay?"

"Good memory, Harry--I only mentioned that to you once. But yes, it is. And you must be careful--they want to use you as their front-man and spread their awful propaganda!"

"Luna, of all the ridiculous fantasies!"

"Eh," Ron shrugged. "Is it that different from what Fudge and Scrimegour tried to make Harry do?"

"And Hermione--your mum and dad are dentists. They're huge targets--the Aurors might kidnap you to force Harry's hand and your parents to quit their practice."

"Luna! Wizards don't go to dentists! Most of them don't even know what dentists are!"

"Luna," Harry said as diplomatically as he could. "How long before the potion wears off?"

Luna looked at her watch. "About...thirteen more seconds. The first does was experimental but really, I can make more and--"

"Yaaaah!"

Hermione and Harry suddenly flew into each other at breakneck speeds, squishing Ginny who got stuck between them.

"OW!"

"Ouch!"

"Owwy!"

"There may be a few unintended side effects..."

As his best mate, his girlfriend, and his little sister untangled themselves, one final question hit Ron's mind.

"Luna, when was that first article on the Rotfang Conspiracy published?"

"Oh! Our April issue! The best stories are always in the April issue!"

"Did your father observe April Fool's Day, Luna?"

"Yes but what does that have to do with anything...uh...oooooh...oopsie?"

Ginny untangled herself first and pointed her wand at Luna. "I'm going to count to one hundred. That's your head start. One, two, three..."

Luna broke off running as fast as her legs could carry her.

"Skip a few...one hundred!"

Ginny tore after Luna, firing several jinxes of assorted colors. Hermione tried to follow, but then tripped over her own feet, and lay flat on her back, saying many more bad words.

"I'm going to the Three Broomsticks," Neville spoke for the first time all day and threw his arms around Harry and Ron's shoulders. "Guys night. I need butterbeer. Lots and lots of butterbeer."

*** You at least tried. Howver, I am afraid there is something a way more sinister behind The Roftang Conspiracy (and nargles, and ... have I mentioned linkffn(12407442) yet? No? I should ...). In my headcanon, Xenophilius went after the death of his wife really off the deep end. He just couldn't cope and he went to this fantasy world of his own and turned his originally eccentric but more or less sane journal into The Quibbler we all know and love (which turned out to be surprisingly popular in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_World_News][Weekly World News]] style).

For Luna, after the death of her very much beloved mother, her Dad was her whole world. Quite literally. With him going wild, most of their neighbours and friends (who were more friends of his wife anyway) left them (including Weasleys and Ginny for some time, unfortunately), and she was left with nobody else. There was no way how anybody not trusted as her father (i.e., nobody) could explain her the father was a bit off and there are actually were no nargles in the world.

Only a way later, when she really fell in love with Ralf, one evening on their mission to find fantastic beasts in South America, when moon was shining brightly, sitting around their campfire after the dinner, he was able to take her to his arms and lovingly explain to her that perhaps there is not enough evidence for the existence of nargles.

END OF PROMPT.

Oh, and I forgot to mention beloved story linkffn(Aftershocks by StainedGlassSkyscrapers) which is very very nice, very very sad, and very very unfinished (but suggested direction of the story doesn't seem to bring anything anyway, although I would love to see Padma/George relationship evolving).
