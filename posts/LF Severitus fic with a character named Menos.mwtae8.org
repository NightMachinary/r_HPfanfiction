I remember reading a Severitus fic where Draco is a healer apprentice and there is a character named Menos. He is in Harry's head and in the end, they destroy him with Legilimency. Ron and Hermione are a part of the story and there is also a scene where Severus fucks up and scares Harry, and Harry hides in a wardrobe. I think I read it on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]]?

PLEASE HELP
