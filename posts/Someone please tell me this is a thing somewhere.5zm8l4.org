  Snape's away on a 'special mission' from the headmaster. When the seventh year Gryffindors take their first potions lesson with his substitute, word of a Potions Master with a pedigree for insults far worse than Snape's passes through the school. Who is this Master of the Cauldron? Gordon Ramsay, Devil of Hell's Cauldron.
