More along the lines of Lord Voldemort wins the war, or it never happens, and is drawn/notices Harry because of his powers or similar.

Similar to Children of the Revolution or Schooled? Ideally a long one, but honestly any length, finished or not would be great!

Thanks :)


** linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) has this premise, and I liked it quite a bit.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".
