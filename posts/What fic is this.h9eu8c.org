** I have no idea if this is the story but I remember one where Harry from the future travels back to just before he enters Hogwarts. He has a conversation with his younger self and sends his younger self back to before Halloween 1981. The end of the story has 3 Harry's a baby Harry who grew up with his parents and an older brother (young Harry who was sent back to his parents time) and the Future Harry who went back to 1991.
