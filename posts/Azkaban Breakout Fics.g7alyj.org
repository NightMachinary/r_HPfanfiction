So, I'm looking for Azkaban Breakout fics: both those where characters are broken out of Azkaban, like the Voldemort break-outs or that time-travelling Harry one where he breaks in as a small child and freaks everyone out (can't remember the name of it, sorry); and those where characters break out themselves, like Sirius in canon or Rookwood and Bellatrix in Harry Crow.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D)

** Well you could try Don't Look Back in Anger by RobSt. In this story Harry is sent to Azkaban for "murdering" Cedric at the end of the 3rd task. He ends up "spirit roaming" eg leaving his body to escape the painful memories the dementors raise. It turns out that Luna can do this as well. The fic is a Lunar Harmony and is 140K words long.

  Can some angry words change everything?

*** Ah, Robst. Truly, the writer everyone in this fandom knows most. :D

I've read it before, but I did enjoy it, so thanks for the rec! Might be time for a reread soon. :)

*** If you're talking about the flagged violation at the top of the thread, that's because I used the word 'smut' in my little description disclaimer thing (I asked the Mods about it). It flags anything with any kind of synonym or slang like that so the mods can look it over for approval or not.

+If it's deleted a fic, I was asleep and missed it completely, sorry. English time here. :D+

EDIT - Oh, right, I didn't see your other comment. That's the fic I mentioned at the top, isn't it? Thanks for finding it! If it isn't, thanks for the rec! :D

** You could also try A Second Chance at Life by JasonZ0654, where Harry breaks Sirius out of Azkaban. It's roughly 61K words but regrettably it's abandoned (last update 2015)

*** I have not read this one, but I've never really been off of AO3 and FFnet, so that's not terribly surprising. Also, your fic violates rule 8, if the tags are right. I'd recommend editing out the link to avoid the Mods bringing you up on it. Is the smut skippable without losing plot or overmuch character development?

Edited to add: Aargh, the bot is still using my old wordy summary, even though the format doesn't come through right and I replaced it a while ago. Sorry about that.

  Sirius read: “Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes Permanent Hair Color, Flame Red. Colors ALL hair. Lasts until antidote is taken.” The meaning sunk in. “I'm not living the rest of my life as a ginger!”“You have something against gingers?” asked Fred menacingly. “He's just intimidated,” said George before Sirius could reply. “Let us assure you, Mr. Padfoot, that you are worthy of this, the most noble of hair colors, Gryffindor red. We based this color on our own hair, so you know we endorse it.”“It's more carrot orange, really,” observed Sirius. “Close enough.”“And the freckles...” Sirius said. “Don't worry, we have a potion to provide those too.” George tossed him a second vial. “Oh...good,” said Sirius hopelessly, catching it. It was pink with orangish-brown speckles. “You'll look very different without the trademark Black hair and alabaster complexion,” said Fred. “Trust us, changing your coloring is the least annoying way to change your appearance. Polyjuice is such a hassle,” said George.“Have you ever tried to pick your nose when it's not the shape you're used to? Difficult, very difficult.”
