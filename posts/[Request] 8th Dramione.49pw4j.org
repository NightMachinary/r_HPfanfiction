Hi! I've returned to reading fanfiction again, and of course to my ontp, Dramione. It's probably tons of them out there, and I really would like to read a 8th year Dreamione, trying to stay as true to canon as possible (but EWE of course). So no more war, Harry and Ron does not return to Hogwarts, Blaise or Theo is not Dracos secretly best friends. And not Pureblood!Hermione. Thanks!


** Try linkffn(Rebuilding)

If you're willing to watch Harry and/or Ron go back linkffn(Eight and Eighth)

I know I have more but I've never thought to sort by 8th year fics so I can't search easily. If I think of others I'll update.

  Up from the ashes of seventh year grow the roses of the eighth. Eight students return for their final year at Hogwarts, and Hermione Granger would never have thought Draco Malfoy would or could be one of those roses. DMHG, EWE Dramione Awards winner

  Hermione Granger returns to Hogwarts to help rebuild the shattered castle the summer after the war. She and the other summer resident - and eventually their friends - have to come to terms with how the war broke more than just the walls of the building. Extends through 8th year and into the first year of adult life. Dramione. Daily updates.

** There are loads, though I've not read them extensively. One of mine was favorited on fanfiction.net by an author who seemed to collect them; his/her name is LCB. She had over 150 stories on her list, though I don't know if they were all what you are seeking. Here's the link to mine, which I think meets the criteria: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11059561/1/Charms-Can-t-Fix-Us]]

...and this is my first post ever. :)

  8th year Dramione work-in-progress with no update schedule or acceptable summary. It does include, however, high quality alcohol, expensive sheets, and beautifully hand-illustrated star charts. Also bitterness, depression, and rage. You know, the normal stuff.
