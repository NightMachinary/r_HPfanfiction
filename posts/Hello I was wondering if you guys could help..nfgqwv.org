My class has been given the task of writing an article about topics my teacher doesn't know about. I was given the topic of fanfiction and online stories. I want to show her how good fanfiction can be but I need to show her that there are some downfalls. Thankfully it doesn't have to be formal. Anyway, I'm waffling.

I want to know if you guys could tell me what you like about fanfiction what gets on your nerves?

I will share the article after I am done.

I should specify, I have been given the task to write about the pros and cons of fanfiction in general. Like what do you guys love about fanfiction and what you guys dislike about it? I'm asking because I don't want it to just be about me as I am an avid fanfiction reader. I want your guys' opinions as well. You all will be credited for this.

Edit: Thank you all for the comments so I should say that after Friday will have to stop using the comments purely because I still need to write it for Tuesday. Even if you comment after I will still credit you for taking part in this question that I have asked.


** Pros:

It can flesh out the minor characters and a lot more.

You can build on minor character development where the author has to editorialize.

You can keep reading new content in a world you love and with characters you love. It's not limited to just the words the original author has written.

Cons:

You can get pulled into the fanfiction world more than the original one and it muddies the content a bit in your head.

The characters lose some of their definition, with fanfiction the authors make the characters who they want, and if you read enough of it you almost lose the original characterizations.

Tropes, even widely accepted concepts, become part of your head canon. For example, Dumbledore saying, “My boy”, and the use of defensive wards are two things that happen a lot in fanfiction but are not in the original work.

Most fanfiction is at least somewhat poorly written. It's either overly long, too short, has poor structure, isn't planned well, etc. Reading to much of it can actually make you a worse writer if that's what you're into.

I'm sure there's a lot more pros and cons, but those stood out for me.

** Let's start with the pros!

1. Canon Divergence. I don't need to elaborate on this, do I? Sometimes, the original story (canon) does not go the way the readers won't. For example : Most authors thrive on killing off characters (Some fanfiction authors do too XD) but it would be nice to know a variation of the story where that particular character stays alive. I have personally spent hours scrolling through works tagged "Tony Stark doesn't die" or "Alternate Universe - Nobody dies/Everybody lives".

2. Background stories - I want history! Flashbacks! Gimme more! An extension of this and the preceding point would be any variation to canon XD

3. Word length. I have read fics which is way lengthier than the original book series and with writing on par with or better than the original.

4. Creative outlet. Needless to say, people get to work on their creativity, and inspire people with the fics. I have seen works based on other works, GIFs/mood boards on fics, etc.

5. No unnecessary process to get a story published online. Usually to publish a book, you have to find a publisher, editor, etc but I have seen original works on ao3 that are (pardon my language) fucking amazing, I would literally buy a dozen copies if it came out as paperback amazing!

6. Friendship based on beta-ing works, comments, etc. In ao3, there is a system in which you can gift works to other users too.

Hmm I'm sure there's more pros but these are the only ones that come to mind right now !

** In terms of reading:

As the writer doesn't need to build everything from the ground up, it allows for more focus on developing specific points. The rough outline of the world, magic system and characters are already in place. While the author is free to change as much of these as they want, they don't have to and can get straight to the story. Especially for fantasy, for original works you often need to spend a lot of time worldbuilding before you can actually start the plot if you want the setting to be engaging, and as reader you don't always want to bother with that.

It is a way to run intellectual thought experiments. A lot of fanfics are, to a greater or lesser extent, what-if scenarios. What if Harry was in Slytherin, or what if Harry and Ginny started going out earlier are common examples. The fanfics which do this bring characters and situations to life by investigating how they would change and behave under different scenarios, and what the long term knock on effects could be.

Comfort. I enjoy reading for many reasons, and I don't always want to read for the same reasons. Especially with all of the tags, I have quite a good idea of what a fanfic will be like before I start it, as I know most of the situations inside out. Therefore if I just want to spend a couple of hours reading a particular kind of story, I can do it easily.

Convenience. Ironically I feel that copywrite laws may actually be hurting the publishing industry more than helping. Even if you discard the genres and tags you aren't interested it, and only go for 'good' stories, shear volume means that there is vast amounts of text to read completely for free. Most of it is over a handful of websites which have tags and other methods for filtering out what you are looking for, so as long as you have an internet connection, you can keep reading endlessly if you feel like it. This is probably more true for this fandom than any other, because it seems to be by far the largest.

A disadvantage can be quality. While there are many excellent fics out there, most aren't. You will end up reading some utter shit. Although a counterpoint is that this isn't exclusive to fanfiction. I also have Kindle Unlimited which gives me free access to a selection of books, and I have dropped some of them for being terrible as well. At least with fanfic if you don't like it you can close the tab and never look back. Books, especially in shops, can end up getting quite expensive if you are reading a lot.

I would say that fanfiction probably isn't safe for children. Quite aside from the tick-box 'age restrictions' on the internet for sex and gore. The internet being the internet, there are a lot of stories that do not show their author in a good light. Due to the age of the characters during the canon plot, the HP fandom can have a lot of issues with excusing or actively encouraging underage sex and grooming. Also, as the series was aimed for children, many of the authors are writing at and 'edgy' stage in their life. They are not necessarily malicious, but may just be before they have reached full emotional maturity and understood what is and isn't ok when it comes to dealing with others. A lot of stuff that labels itself as 'dark' or involves death eater main characters glorifies violence, abuse and unhealthy, often rape-based, relationships. That is not to say that these stories should never be written, but it may not be the best thing for them to be open access for people at impressionable stages of their lives.

Many stories are abandoned. While this isn't always much of a loss, there are many excellent stories out there which will never be finished, which is a massive shame. Even if what is there is good, suddenly running cold mid way can overcloud that with the disappointment.

In terms of writing:

It is a entry level way into becoming an author. Anyone can create an account on a fanfic site and post something , even just a few hundred words, and chances are someone will read it and give feedback. Also there is already a basis of world, characters and plot for you to build off. Especially if you don't want to or lack confidence in constructing everything from scratch yourself, then it allows a starting point. A bit like using a level-editor or modding a game rather than coding something from scratch yourself. In addition there are a large number of communities for you to discuss concepts and ideas with as you go.

It allows you to let you imagination run free. Many, if not most of those who write fanfic, even what ends up being novel length and quality, would never have started writing original works instead if fanfic didn't exist. Especially if you don't see yourself becoming a professional author, a place to write what you want, the length you want and at the speed you want can be invaluable.

** Oh shit I forgot about the cons XD

I honestly can't think of any except for the poorly written fics out there but I prefer to think of them as practice. After all, you never get good at something unless you practise it.

Oh wait no, I got some.

Because it's fanfiction, some people will copy works and post on other websites. And the creator can only report the work or ask them to take it down and there's usually no further consequence to plagiarism.

Comments are sometimes very negative. I understand criticism, I welcome criticism as an author myself but some are just plain rude and mentally draining to read. I have seen authors take down 100k+ fics because of them.

Hiatus/Abandoned fics. I understand that they have lives outside of fanfiction but it's honestly so frustrating to read a masterpiece and then see "Last Updated: 8 years ago". I ain't mad, I understand but it's just so ಥ‿ಥ, you know?

As an extension of this point, some people will continue on the fic without the explicit approval of the original creator and that's just another form of plagiarism as well. The reason often cited is "oh this is just too good to be abandoned, it's been __ years since the last update, it's practically free real estate by now."

** The greatest strength of fanfiction is that it is highly personal. People write fic because they enjoy the characters or the setting. Perhaps they disagree with a canon choice, or they just want to see what would happen to a what if. But ultimately, they do so for personal reasons, that are almost never born out of more mundane reasons like fame, money or obligation (though I suppose spite might be an obligation).

The downside of course is that fanfiction is highly personal. There is a reason that fanfiction of fanfiction exists after all, and it's that the only way to really get the fanfiction you want to read is to write it yourself. That means for those of us without the time, skill, or spoons to write our own fic sometimes have to spend a lot of time finding the fic that we want.

** Well, some pros are: 1.for the writer, they get to work on their writing and communicating skills via their works and they don't have to think too hard on world building since the world is already built by someone else. 2. For the reader, we get to immerse ourselves into further sections of something we clearly loved or enjoyed enough to seek out more of it. 3. we get a choice of what type of turn we want it to take. E.g don't like the Canon couple? Fanfiction has a plethora of options available but maybe you want to like the ship so some fanfics will look further into the ship to help you like the ship, doesn't always happen but it can. 4. If you haven't read the books (I'm guilty, I own them but I haven't read them), a lot of fanfics base main events and gather information from the books so you get an understanding on why certain things happened in the movies and we also get better insight to characters themselves without having to actually read the books. (I do plan on reading them though) 5. Sometimes the fanfics are simply better done and have better explosions and such than the original content.

Cons 1. Sometimes we forget what's Canon and fanon since it is seen so often in fanon that it gets taken as fanon 2. There isn't always a beta to point out plot holes and or grammar or spelling issues. (Althought Canon can often have plot holes that need to be filled by fanon and assumptions) 3. Bashing.

** One thing I do not like, is when authors use characters as mouthpieces for their own views, and it doesn't fit in with the overall tone of the story.

Using your characters to project your views to the world is fine if you take the time to give proper context, and make sure to build up your characters, so that it doesn't disrupt the flow of the story, or clash with your characterisation.

** Fanfiction can make readers think more deeply about the characters and the plot, asking questions that require digging below the surface. Consider how "Gone With the Wind" is seen in a different light from a slave's perspective in "The Wind Done Gone", showing more of what goes on behind the scenes in the household, or how the character of Mr Rochester in "Jane Eyre" is questioned and reinterpreted in "Wide Sargasso Sea". Harry Potter's interactions with Severus Snape can take on new meaning after reading Severus' perspective, eg in "The Snape Chronicles", which draws the reader's attention to just how impulsive and unreasonable Harry could sometimes be, and how unfairly Slytherin in general was treated by canon.

On the other hand, since it's usually noncommercial online publishing, with a very low barrier to entry, fanfiction tends to have immense quantity with far lower average quality than traditional publishing. It can be time-consuming to identify stories that will be interesting and valuable to oneself, and even then, there are likely to be many more typographical and stylistic errors than a paper book would have, as well as other signs of limited proofreading, such as excessive length.

Economically, fanfiction is a mixed bag. It typically doesn't and can't earn any money, but it does operate in its own communities offering non-financial incentives such as camaraderie and acclaim. Furthermore, authors of fanfiction are likely to be readers of it as well, so its free nature is a benefit to them at the same time as being a cost.
