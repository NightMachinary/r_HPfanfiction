Looking for fics where muggleborn are taught Wizarding ways or are adopted by Wizarding families. This could just be training at hogwarts or "adoption" into Wizarding families. Basically the Wizarding world absorbing muggleborn instead of excluding them.


** I can't think of the name, but there's a fic where Harry's parents die on the Continent when he's 8 and he goes to a wizarding orphanage made up of muggleborns who are taken from their parents and adopted out to wizards. I think Hermione had been adopted by the Malfoys. Tom Riddle was running magical Britain and liked Wizarding rites and rituals.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** That's one of the main plots of my story "Patron". Every muggleborn gets a Patron to guide their integration into Wizarding Society. An encounter with troll puts a unique spin on this for Hermione and Harry.

My story "The Dark Lord Never Died" has another version: In Malfoy's Britain, all muggleborns are taken from their families and raised as "Wands of Britain" - loyal janissaries for the Ministry. Hermione is one of them, and she discovers a conspiracy as she starts investigating a case.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I'm currently reading Riddle's World linkffn(9843418), which also adds some interdimensional travel stuff to it. For anyone worried about the slash tag, there is absolutely no hint to it up through the current chapter. It's a very long way off, I think. I actually forgot it was HP/TR, not gen, until I looked at the summary when I went to link this fic.
