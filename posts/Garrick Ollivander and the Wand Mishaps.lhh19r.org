Ollivander was on the verge of tears, of course his dedication to his long practised air of mystique and omniscience meant that none of this showed on his face, but nonetheless, Garrick Ollivander wanted to cry. For the third time just today he'd had to shoo out a particularly persistent shopper who was convinced that he would somehow be able to buy a "custom wand"! Where had they been getting these ideas from anyway, the wand chooses the wizard after all, the Ollivanders had only been making wands for /millenia/ after all, what would they know, even if your first wand is broken there is no guarantee your next will share wood or core.

Still... Garrick mused, that type was at least better than the 'spare wand' folk, honestly, do people think they need a spare set of hands? /The wand chooses the wizard/! Wand! Not wand/s/! Were they planning on switching between them from purpose to purpose? Garrick shuddered at the thought, a recipe for disaster that was to be sure..

"Do you know anyone who uses two wands at the same time dad?" a young voice drifted in through the doorway. Ollivander dropped his head on his desk with a thud.


** “TWO CORES,” screamed Garrick. He had had enough. This snot-nosed brat was asking for TWO cores in his wand as if that wouldn't destabilize it and destroy all of Britain if the boy was strong enough. “Out! Get OUT of my shop!!” He told the boy and his parents as he ushered them out of the store as if it would collapse with their mere presence. He needed to think on what to do. This couldn't continue. When Hagrid brought Harry Potter to the wand shop the next day, it was to see a CLOSED sign in the window, empty inside except for a single long box on the counter. If opened, they would see the box held a certain holly wand.

Sorry about my horrible writing, but this was a great prompt and I wanted to respond to it. Hope you, or some redditor, does something with it!! Edit: forgot that I wasn't on another site and tried to use a specific bot

** Leroy woke to a heavy thump near his head with a start. Bleary looking around he saw two things and knew something was up.

First was a stack of newspapers thick as his head. The second was his boss Veronica standing over him looking mighty wrathful.

Gulping he tried to remember what it could be. Sure the end of season party had gotten a wee bit out of hand. He was sure though they hadn't gotten any pregnant, this time, or destroyed anything.

Reading the first headline he groaned as memories started coming back into focus.

*Fiendfyre Flames Completely Cover Malfoy Manor!*

/The last members of the Malfoy family died last night in a horrible tragedy. A large group of distraught soon to be first years soon made their way to the manor once word spread. One young girl had to be restrained as she attempted to enter the building screaming about having to save her "Sweet sweet Drarry ship!"/

*Fisticuffs Fight in Diagon Alley.*

/Several soon to be first years of Hogwarts were brawling in the Alley today. The reason for the arguement was truly astounding. The group was broke into two main camps, one which "couldn't wait to see their dark prince Professor Snape" and the second which is quoted as saying "I hope he does the world a favor and dies using an Erumpent horn dildo". It became a brutal brawl after that./

*Largest Class of 1st years in nearly three hundred years at Hogwarts!*

/You read that right! This years class has the single largest group of nearly two hundred students headed off to Hogwarts. When asked why they accepted so many instead of sending them along to other schools in the isle Headmaster Dumbledore stated "We are still trying to figure out exactly what happened but the Quill of Hogwarts constitutes a binding contract."/

*Stop visiting my house! My wife is fine now thank you very much!*

/While we at the Quibbler appreciated the helps that came about and saved my wife Selene from a spell crafting accident we can safely say she is fine now! Please stop coming by to check on her. We also greatly appreciate the friends my daughter had made these last few days. However we have lives outside of endless play date everyday so please stop visiting so we can get work done!"/

Leroy stopped reading the first paragraphs at this point and just skimmed through the various article headlines.

*Goblins Confiscate LeStrange Vault!*

*Sirius Black Not a Death Eater! Petergrew was the Rat!*

*Harry Potter signs book deal with Gilderoy Lockhart in tell all of his childhood!*

Leroy let his head fall to the table and looked up at Veronica and tried to think of what best to say.

"Would declaring once again my eternal love for you help?"

He could tell it wasn't going to work this time as he didn't even catch a glimpse of a smirk from her.

"Okay fine, there was just over a gross of cases left! So I figured hey, it should work out just fine!"

Her eyes narrowed and he figured she was not accepting his excuse.

"Come on dear we had nearly 10,000 cases this season! It can only do good overall right?"

Finally she relented a bit, they had been exceptionally busy this season.

"Fine, but you owe me mister. I expect foot a massage everyday for at least a month!"

Leroy smiled and stood up kissing his wonderful and best boss ever on the cheek.

"Besides, you have to admit reincarnating all those Harry Potter fans together at once in one world is going to be super fun to watch unfold!"

She turned on him as he grinned cheekily bouncing to work. The job at the Heavenly Translocation Office never grew boring while Leroy Jenkins was on the case!

** "So let me get this straight. You want me to take this basilisk venom, a substance known for destroying pretty much everything it touches, and stick it inside a piece of wood. How do you possibly expect that to work?"

"Ummm...Magic?"

"Get out."

*** Nice. I like it. I've seen that used so many times, and that never came to mind. You've brought up these related thoughts, though:

"Basilisk venom, Mr. Potter? From what I understand, it is both highly toxic and exceedingly corrosive. Are you aware of how many small nicks and splinters I receive whilst working on wands? What makes you think that I, or any other wandmaker, would be sufficiently reckless as to work with such a substance? I'll thank you to leave my establishment now."

---

"Phoenix tears? Mr. Potter, should I attempt to put the most powerful healing agent known to wizards in a wand, do you know what I would then have? No, Mr. Potter, not a powerful wand. Not a wand of any sort. A sapling, Mr. Potter. I would have a sapling!"

---

"Phoenix tears and basilisk venom? I am not a potions master, Mr. Potter. I have no idea how the two will behave when combined, nor, given the expense and volatility of the substances, do I wish to experiment with them. Nor, were I so inclined, have you provided enough for me to test with every combination of wood and core with which I work. I shouldn't be telling you, or anyone else, Mr. Potter. However, please accept and understand this small bit of wandlore. It is the structure of the connection between the wood and the core that gives a wand the ability to channel magic. A wand without a core is merely a piece of wood. Neither can a heartstring, feather, or hair be used by itself."

"It is the structure of the connection between the core and the wood that determines how well a wand will work, and for whom. At its finest level of detail, that cannot be controlled. That, Mr. Potter, is why wandmakers maintain a large stock of wands, and why I say that the wand chooses the wizard. We make no custom wands. Phoenix tears and basilisk venom cannot be used in wands because they are liquids and have no structure. I have no idea whether the traces left behind after they evaporate will work as a wand core. Even if they do, the connection will be arbitrary. Such a wand may work for you, but in all likelihood, it will not."
