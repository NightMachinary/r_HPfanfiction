:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
If I remember correctly the name was "Porn Star" it was about how Harry, after the war, went to live in the muggle world and decided to start working as a porn star where he finds handsome Draco Malfoy and a lot of smut ensues. I think I read it on fanfiction.net but can't find it

  Don't let the title fool you. While there is plenty of smut, this is a LOVE STORY. Down and out Harry goes to work in a porn studio. And who should be there, but Draco Malfoy. Harry can't help wondering if they'll work together. post Hogwarts H/D SLASH
