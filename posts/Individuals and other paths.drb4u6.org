Soooo.... I love this series but once I started writing I started to realize a few issues with the series. Really minor nitpiks but it got me thinking... We've all heard that The Six Book is filler or the Last book was a hodgepodge of a RPG quest and stuff like that... but I realized that after the fourth book it stopped really focusing on the concept of indivual growth of the charecters and even in that book it just halted them without consequences...

One random example would how Harry is somehow a leader and badass dueler when he barely trained in anything or worked hard in school but could hold his own in any capacity and could teach his school DADA but rarely used magic in those situations where he was surviving?

My brain, as it is want to, pretended to have an interview with people about a story I would write with this and... well I came up with some really good thoughts on plots the series could have done to make the individual growth of the charecters more apparent.

Starting in the Fourth book...

When Ron and Harry split it would have been cool or helpful to see Ron's perspective and watch as he realizes that despite missing Harry he enjoys being on his own. HE realizes that just as he was overshadowed by his brothers he allowed himself to be folded into Harry's shadow because that is all he knows. He has no idea how to be his own person that this is what made the most of his laziness. It would have been amazing to watch him find a skill, hobby, freind or something that was his and his alone. Something personally impactful, ( Random examples include broom designing, healing for things like dyslexia ( Based on a facebook post) and other things) that would help him gain a degreee of independecen and a healthy seperation from those in his life. His father;s obsession with muggle stuff would be a great source of inspiration...

Actually if this Hobby got him an income, like the Twins and their shop, it would play into his feelings of inequality and the fears of poverty. It would address his laziness and how it has been impeding him. He would get freinds outside of Harry and Hermione and feel useful so that even when they recoonect he is still his own person...

I can see Hermione getting tired of Harry using her during the tourny, and how he is meaner to her without Ron and too dismissive towards her genuine passions ( SPEW for example) and that she is tired by how much of a leech he can be. I can see her perspective following as she develops a freindship with Neville, who she already cares for and helps. He would be a great person to work on her social issues with, since he is a pureblood that is horribly bullied but is just as into learning as she is. Be it as a freind or lover, I can see Neville follwoing her desire to free elves as he understands harassment, aubse and mistreatment in a way that would make him question the practice of Slavery. It would be a great tool for Neville as well since it would help him gain confidence a freind who cares about his interests and of course his magical skill. It would also be fun to see how he connects to Victor when she dates him a strange mix...

For Harry's perspective it would have been fun for him to have to truly be alone partially due to his own mistreament of his freinds and how he does tend to take advantage of others and be a tad entitled. It would be a great way for him to actually focus on those positive traits he shared with voldie, like independence and cunning. Lets see who he is without the world holding his hand. Let see him actually have to earn magical talent, something he was shown to have n the previous book with the patronus charm. He has potential but we rarely see him earn his talents and skills. Lets watch him focus on just how much skill he could have if he put his single minded obsessiveness into training and magic. Then I would actually be able to go " yeah it makes sense that he can fight deatheaters and train others to fight"...

Having Harry realize that thet adults, he might ask for help like with Remus, in his life are worthless and most do nothing... yes even McGongall who is overhypered and never did anything significant to help Harry ever. Having him gain a sense of personal value and happiness, that his life does have value.. and then having that go against the willingness of Dumbles to sacrifice Harry and Harry's tendency to allow people to walk all over him... it would make his eventual sacrifice feel like it had value instead o being just aniother total harry moment since he is a martyr

Most of all it would be nice to watch as each of the characters develop as people, with lives and issues and grudges that feel like they are followed through with... making them lose a touch of that codependence that made the series sometimes a bit repetative...

Yes, this might fel a bit fanficy but it popped in my head so... yeah...

Do you agree with me? Are the charecters too codependent and feel underdeveloped after the Fourth book... does Harry's sudden skills in combat feel forced and undeserved... or that Ron became even more neglected and didn't learn from the events of the fourth book on a personal level... or that Neville was way too ignored... Is McGongall wayyy overhyped?"

Would this make for a good fanfic? have you seen stories that actually help all of the Golden trio without bashing?


** I'm super bored so I'll bite.

No.

#+end_quote

No, the point of series is that the hero inspires the people around him (see Harry consistently give Neville confidence boosts from book 1 to the end) while also realizing he needs the help of those very people. This not only separates him from Voldemort but also Dumbledore to an extent.

#+begin_quote
  Feel underdeveloped after the Fourth book
#+end_quote

Yes, but not for most of your reasons. It's the holding of the idiot ball for plot.

#+begin_quote
  does Harry's sudden skills in combat feel forced and undeserved
#+end_quote

No. Harry, Ron, and Hermione go through books for the entire month of June in preparation for the 3rd task. Starting from PS we see he is quick on his feet and from CoS we see he can pick up defensive and offensive spells quickly. He reads the books Sirius and Remus give him for Christmas as well as the Prince's book the next year. We see him engage with Lupin in PoA over more than the Patronus. Harry reads when and what he wants, but he reads.

#+begin_quote
  Neville was way too ignored
#+end_quote

No. Neville is a background character we see often enough. In fact, one could say we know more about his early life and family than we do Hermione's.

Just a few more points: Hermione is as dismissive of Quidditch as Harry and everyone else, including Neville, are of SPEW. Hermione also snaps at him both in PoA and HBP when she and Ron are fighting. Even if he doesn't enjoy her company (JKR did her best to make them incompatible), he /does/ try to spend time with her when she and Ron are at odds.

The blind leading the blind. That Neville/Hermione paragraph also strips Harry of a good bit of post GoF character growth and the Harry-Neville dynamic. I didn't know it wasn't super obvious Harry had a hand in Neville's growth and vice versa.

We saw it in the graveyard when he threw off the Imperius, overpowered Voldemort's wand, and brought Cedric's body back.

** I pretty much disagree with everything you've said but this bit was particularly unbelievable.

With everything Harry has to deal with as a child and throughout his school years...for your takeaway to be that he had everything handed to him is mind boggling. I feel like we read two different book series.

*** In all Dangerous situations ( Which yes he never should have been thrust into) he was given a hand to the extreme bar THird and Second year.

Magic protection, the tourney on a platter, twin cores, the elder wand...

**** It's very gracious of you to now acknowledge Harry did accomplish something in years 2 and 3. I still strongly disagree that his hand was held throughout the series.

Yes, he definitely had a few get out of jail free cards that saved his ass a few times in the books. The only reason those protections came into play at all was because Harry stood and fought, repeatedly, despite the odds being against him.

Yes, the dual cores saved Harry in the grave yard. You disregard the fact that Harry chose to stand and fight instead of giving up or trying to run after watching Cedric be murdered, being tortured by cruciatus several times, fighting off the imperius, and having to face 10+ adult wizards. After all this he was still able to keep his head enough to summon the cup and bring Cedric's body back. How you can ignore this is crazy to me.

Like I said previously, it's like we read two entirely different book series.

** I agree that the DA's skills seemed a little forced and came to quickly. A year of practicing school spells for an hour a week and then six kids can take on a bunch of death eaters who are highly skilled and dangerous.

See what Harry is like without the world holding his hand. Don't know about that, Sure he gets lucky and he needed to to do what he did but saying that the wirld held his hand every step of the way is just completely destroying all his struggles. Second, fourth and fifth year he was ostracised by the school and left on his own, Hermione petrified in second and Ron leaving fir the start of fourth. You make Harry out to be exactly how Snape sees him.
