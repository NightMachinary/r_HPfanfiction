** I misread the title and was greatly pleased at the thought of them learning from [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skxhii6VFdo][Vinz Clortho]].

Of course, that is the other reference beyond just HP in that sketch video.

*** /If you think that Hermione wouldn't take it a personal challenge to better that school performance.../

'Hermione, you cannot do that!' Ron ran after his gf, trying in vain to convince her Clortho School was a lost cause (In the bg Harry dueled some tall student with heavy golden chain on his neck). 'You may die! It's a hopeless hell hole!'

'I know I can do it Ron. If I could help form DA last term and convince you to do your homework in 1st yr, I can totally reform American public school system!' (the student got face full of bat-bogey hex and slug vomiting curse and kneeled on the floor... Leaking and regretting all his life choices).

'We will all die...' Ron moaned miserably (in the meantime Harry just transfigured gang of his fallen opponent into pink ferrets, laughing maniacally. He knew school did not have a budget to turn them back). In the last ditch effort to put some sense into Hermione, he took an ace from his sleeve. '... /Or worse/, we get /expelled./'

Hermione froze. There was a bit of silence.

'*Good*'

Ron breather a sigh of relief. Crisis averted.

Hermione turned with fire in her eyes.

'Then I can apply for a headmistress post.'
