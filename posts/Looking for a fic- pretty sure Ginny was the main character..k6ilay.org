:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read it years ago and I dont remember much except that Ginny was a main character, there was a Polyjuice Club (it was a brothel but they called it a club), pretty sure Draco owned the club (but that may have been a diff fic), Blaise was there and was a girl, and Tom Riddle was there trying to kill (?) Ginny. I think there was something about Tom not being able to kill Ginny or he would die (because diary things) so she threw herself over a railing/banister but lived? As you can see I dont remeber much so google has been no help and I'd be soooo happy if someone here recognizes this probably 10 year old fic. Oh and I remember it being a decent length fic.


** You might be talking about the Draco Trilogy by Cassandra Clare. It's three stories, not on ff or ao3 but I think it's on Goodreads. It checks all the boxes-- Lucius owns a polyjuice brothel, Blaise is female and in a faux relationship with Draco for a while, Tom Riddle comes back obsessed with Ginny, it's MASSIVELY long.

**** Hahah it is OLD and there was so much drama around it... it's definitely one that sticks in your memory but it was so long and so much wild stuff happened in it (time travel to meet the sons of Gryffindor and Slytherin? Veela!Draco? Seer!Ron? Why not!) that it can seem like 50 different fics in recollection.

***** Exactly. Ron's wiggle dance in the mirror still makes me giggle.
