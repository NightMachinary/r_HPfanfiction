As we all know, Frank Bryce was the Muggle caretaker of the Riddle House, widely believed by the villagers to be the one responsible for killing Tom Riddle Sr. and his parents.

Bryce was killed by Voldemort after stumbling upon the Dark Lord conspiring with Wormtail about their plans to abduct Harry Potter. Bryce resolves to run and alert the authorities--but then Voldemort calls out to him.

Notably, when Voldemort confronts Bryce, before he realizes what's truly going on, Bryce stands firm against him, sneering at the name Voldemort gave himself.

So my request is precisely that--are there any good fanfics where Bryce escapes the Riddle House and manages to get word to someone about the conspiracy.


** Hmm...I dunno, at that particular point of divergence, it would be very difficult for Frank Bryce to survive after being detected by Voldemort.

I mean, he's got a bad leg, he doesn't have any means of contacting the police (unless he goes all the way into town), he believes that he's only dealing with some kids who broke into the house (so there's little reason for him to bring, say, a shotgun) until he reaches the door and starts listening in on Wormtail and Voldemort...

Hmm, that said, the discussion between Wormtail and Voldemort goes on for quite a while, a few minutes at least, before Nagini returns and exposes Frank.

If he left early, he'd lose out on hearing about 'Voldemort' and his plot to kill a 'Harry Potter', but he'd still know about the codewords 'Quidditch World Cup', 'Ministry of Magic', 'wizards' and 'muggles'...and the way those two talk about those, and the fact that they broke into a house in the middle of the night just to plot their next move, is highly suspicious in itself.

If Frank did leave the house then, he could go down the hill, call the police, tell them what he heard. And most likely be Obliviated by the Ministry of Magic afterwards, but then said Ministry would probably start investigating whoever's broken into an old muggle house and is plotting something big after the Quidditch World Cup.

There's earlier points of divergence, too; in the book, when Frank first wakes up and spies the light in the upper window, he thinks that the 'boys' have started a fire. It wouldn't be unreasonable for him to go down to the village as fast as he could and call a fire brigade. If he did, and the fire brigade came...well, who knows what would happen next, but it'd leave a much bigger footprint than Frank's disappearance alone.

There's also 'what if Frank DID have a phone and decided to call someone', 'what if someone noticed Frank heading up to the Riddle House in the middle of the night' (he'd have a lantern or a torch making him semi-visible, right?), or if you go way back, things like 'what if the police took Frank's claim of seeing a dark-haired pale stranger seriously, or someone else saw him', or 'what if the doctors took finding the cause of death of the Riddles more seriously'.

(And, random thought I had; Frank is described as not liking loud noises or crowds and isn't particularly social with others. Do you suppose he might have had high-functioning autism?)

I have autism. From my personal experience, it is a definite possibility - though he could also just be a shy, neuro-typical person.

*** I'd forgotten about Nagini alerting Voldemort about Frank's presence (though I doubt Voldemort didn't already realize they were being eavesdropped on).

However, if memory serves (and this may be me remembering the movie more than the book),Wormtail actually opened the door for Frank.

Frank's got a bad leg, but Wormtail is hardly a physical specimen of note. One good /whack/ with the walking stick means Wormtail's out cold.

And then that just leaves Nagini, since Voldemort doesn't have his shiny new body yet. Which still doesn't leave Frank in a good position, but not impossible.

Those earlier points of divergence are notable, but at the same time, I really do like how Frank was able to sass Voldemort.

As for not liking loud noises or crowds and the anti-social behavior, I didn't interpret it as autism. I figured Frank was a bit shell-shocked from his time in World War II. He was injured, apparently enough to leave lasting injuries, and never fully recovered.

World War II...oh great...now I'm thinking about Frank fighting in the War and coming across Grindelwald (though Frank was apparently injured and discharged around 1943--Grindelwald was deposed in 1945).

**** There's an idea; Frank saw Tom Riddle Jr. on his way to murder the other Riddles when nobody else did. Maybe he's actually a squib, or someone else with the ability to see and recognise magic?

Once he heard the early stuff about 'wizard' and 'Ministry of Magic'...yeah. In any case, Frank attacking Pettigrew isn't completely out of the question, he's spry enough to walk through an old house and slowly keep up the gardening for years and years. Winning against both Peter and Nagini though might be tricky...

...Eh, what if he looked at the lights in the house and went 'I'll give those kids a good scare this time!' and grabbed his old rifle from the war? Or even an improvised weapon, rather than just a walking stick? That'd improve his chances, being able to shoot or blow up Peter and Nagini.

***** Pettigrew was a very inconsistent wizard, so Bryce against Pettigrew alone, assuming Bryce had the element of surprise, could actually end up in victory for Bryce.

Was Nagini a horcrux at the time? If she was, it'd be impossible for Bryce to kill her, or even injure her in /any/ way.

****** Nagini was...possibly a Horcrux at this time. Most likely.

Rowling confirmed that it was Bertha Jorkins's death that led to the creation of the Horcrux inside Nagini, but the precise timeline is unclear.

But I doubt the same general rules for Horcrux-destruction apply for living critters.

Not necessarily. You're thinking of the fanon idea that a Horcrux automatically becomes immune to everything but Fiendfyre and Basilisk Venom, but that's not true. The other Horcruxes were just indesctructible because Voldemort had put a ton of protection on them.

Nah, I think it may have been more "Nobody liked the Riddles, so nobody paid them much mind."

And Frank might just be more alert due to what he was trained in during the War. He may have been a scout, and thus trained in paying attention to things otherwise not noticeable.

While the thought is certainly entertaining--imagine one of Voldemort's precious Horcruxes being destroyed by a Muggle weapon, I'm not sure it's plausible. The United Kingdom has very strict laws about gun ownership--would a civilian be allowed to keep a weapon he had from the war?

****** I'm sure that Frank Bryce could have still owned a gun, the fire arm crackdown really started in the 80s with handguns becoming illegal in 96 (all according to the Internet, take with a grain of salt) so the chances of a crotchety old man keeping a fire arm for protection while he works at a creepy murder house estate isn't out of the picture.

******* Hmmmm....that is something I hadn't considered (though I'm aware of the current laws now).

So if it is possible that Frank owned a gun, and brought it with him, then it's an entirely different game of Quidditch with respect to the events.

If Wormtail tries to confront him, and Frank shoots him (or just clubs him upside the head with the butt of the shotgun), Voldemort loses his only active servant, seeing as he's still mostly immobile and Barty Jr. is still under lock-and-key.

But what happens if Frank does escape? I doubt the local village authorities would listening to his ravings. Would he end up going to London to try and alert someone?

******** Assuming Harry still got the freaky dream, saw Bryce escape, felt Riddles rage at Nagani's death, at being stuck in a baby form, Harry could tell Sirius who is like wtf tell Dumbledore, who goes to talk to Bryce. Domino effect, riddle is still out there, still has potential to come back (if Pettigrew of all people could figure it out, I'm sure someone else could) would make interesting 4th year divergent fic assuming author could abandon cannon rails.

** Hey! I found a fic that kinda sorta fits? Maybe? linkffn(Souls Abound)'s premise is that the Horcruxes had a built-in function of doing their utmost to possess people and escape their hiding place if one of them was destroyed, and then gather in Riddle House where the main Voldemort, also alerted, would await them . This results in the ring possessing Bryce and the diadem possessing Trelawney, but, like Ginny at first, this is only part-time. When not being possessed by their respective Toms Riddle, Frank and Sibyll end up falling in love with each other. It's a very odd ship to say the least, but somehow the story makes it work, even if it's less than ideally written in other respects. Strengthened by their love for each other, they begin to be able to fight off the shards of soul inside of them, with Sibyll managing to destroy hers entirely. Since the other Horcruxes have been destroyed at this point, Frank then offers to kill himself, ending Voldemort for good (he's still a spirit at this point, so having the Horcruxes destroy would kill him instantly), though of course she won't have it.

  This story came from an idea of there being more than one version of Voldemort running around, due to his horcruxes being activated. Story begins with the Tom - Harry confrontation in the Chamber of Secrets. H/Hr
