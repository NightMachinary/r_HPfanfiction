I'm just wondering if there's someone who wrote that duel in much more detail than it was written in the book.

*** u/ceplma:
#+begin_quote
  Bellatrix was still fighting too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them, and Harry's attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed death by an inch ---

... and then the duel is taken over by Molly Weasley etc.

Yes, I would love to read that too.

** It's really not the same thing at all, and you'd be skipping 200 chapters directly into the climax of the story, but...

** There are some fics in which Hermione duels Bellatrix one on one, but I don't think there are any fics that merely elaborate on the details between the fight between Bellatrix and those three. Since that particular fight was pretty inconsequential in canon, I am not sure what the point would be of writing it in more detail.

*** Personally I just wanted to see more action in detail. That was one of the reasons I read the book in the first place after the movies. I heard that there is this duel at the end of the 7th book and I was expecting to see how she managed to stand against three opponents in more detail. I was expecting this scene to be multiple pages long and at the end I was just disappointed.

**** I guess you were a victim of Harry's PoV. We don't really get any detail of anything in the books unless Harry is paying close attention to it.
