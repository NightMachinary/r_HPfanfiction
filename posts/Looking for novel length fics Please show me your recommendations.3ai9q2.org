Hey guys!

I have a pretty boring day ahead, so I'd like to find something to read. I'm not really sure what I'm after which is why I decided to come to you lovely people :)

All I ask is that it's novel length, and contains no slash. I tend to prefer Harry or Hermione centric fics, but I'm open to something new

Thanks! :D

Also, I've no idea how to put flair on posts, could someone tell me how for next time?

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  When starting this, please keep in mind that A Year Like None Other was started long before HBP came out. It was always my intention to write an alternate 6th year and when the canon Year 6 was published, it meant that my own little saga seriously diverged from canon. So reading this, imagine that Years 1-5 did occur, but nothing we discover from HBP and DH is necessarily true this time around.The most important divergences are these: In this universe, Snape /is/ a pureblood and his father's name was Hostilian (which tells you a lot all by itself). Dumbledore never died -- and certainly not at Snape's hand! This story is completely finished and is about 760,000 words long. It took me a while to get it all posted here at AO3, but I am very happy to report that the whole thing is now online for your (hopefully) intense enjoyment!And now, on with the show, which begins with A Year Like None Other (completed), continues on into A Summer Like None Other (also completed) and wraps up with A Family Like None Other, a Year 7 novel that I am still writing.

** My all time favorite fic fits this description. It's called the Price of Love by RogueSugah. Hermione-centric, all canon relationships if I remember correctly. The FFN version is incomplete, but still good. I haven't been able to find the full version since Checkmate was taken down, though.

  Hermione & Ron spend the summer together, but the closer they get, the harder it becomes to share her secret plan even though she must. If love really is stronger than hate, as she believes, their feelings for each other may be enough to save them all.

  Hermione spends her days at the Ministry keeping an eye on pardoned criminals - a tedious task that has her dying of boredom, until it surfaces that Lucius Malfoy may be running a massive Dark market empire, and it falls to her to prove his guilt. And how else to do it, but with a dash of Polyjuice and a hair off Narcissa Malfoy? Really, what could go wrong?
