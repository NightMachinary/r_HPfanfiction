  Hard times lead to hard choices. What's more important? Freedom, or fate? Love, or death? Harry Potter stands on the edge of a precipice, and he is not sure if the right move is to turn and fight, or fall.

  They had a plan, formulated from before they were even born. That plan died. From its ashes rises a Harry Potter no longer willing, or able, to let others fight his battles for him. Outgunned, outclassed, outmatched, nonetheless Harry will take up the sword to change not only Britain, but the world.

**** What you were basically saying was that magic and society in that story contradicted with Canon.

Well, this is an extreme AU so the author could redesign his world as he pleased, as long as it is internally consistent. In fact, the Canon universe itself was hardly consistent, since JKR invented new magic plot devices or modified existing ones (Trace, Fidelius) whenever she wanted to advance her plots.

The only issue you raised and I totally agree with is '11 years old behaving like mature adults'.

Overall, this fic took a bunch of overused tropes and turned them into something actually interesting, and I have to give the author credit here.

***** But there explanations why those changes don't make sense. The comparison with canon aren't there to show that's different from canon. Wit of the Raven is different from canon, Firebird Trilogy is different from canon, Untitled Tome is different from canon. Those are good fics where changes are consistent and new rules make sense.

I DP&SW changes aren't consistent and changed universe don't make sense. It makes less sense than canon. That's why the comparison is here. Because if you have a base to work on from, and manage to end up being much worse than it, then you completely screwed up.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

The first one is a Star Wars crossover, and ends with Voldemort's defeat; the second one is a Stargate crossover and has them dealing with more existential galactic threats.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], linkffn(5604382), has the usual Dumbledore/Molly/Ron bashing. If you can get over that, the story itself is quite entertaining.

*** I second all three. Especially The Accidental Bond, while is does have some bashing, it is not overemphasized and it is a more serene, happy story. There is almost no lemon/smut included, you'll need to find that elsewhere if needed.

For the other two, you need to accept the Crossovers, especially the StarWars one. I do like all the stuff by Darth Mars, but your mileage may vary.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.
