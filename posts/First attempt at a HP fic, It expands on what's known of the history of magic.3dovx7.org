  A textbook journey through the History of Magic, from it's origins and interactions with the normal world to it's isolation and the darkness that is spreading through it. Chapter 1: Merlin's Rise. Mostly historically accurate!

** It's a very interesting start. You have me intrigued. It does seem like a textbook in that it never stays on one point in time very long. The story flows hitting only the important points in the story. I liked it and hope you keep going.
