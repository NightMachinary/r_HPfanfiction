** There's linkffn(Ah, Screw It) which is actually a crossover between /Harry Potter/ and /Stargate/, though one doesn't really need to be familiar with /Stargate/ to enjoy it, I think. The interesting part is while it does have a manipulative Dumbledore, he /also/ comes around eventually. The Weasley bashing is relatively minimal.

Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/RobSt][RobSt]] writes a /lot/ of fanfics that both bash Weasleys and have manipulative Dumbledores.

I would stay away from /In This World and the Next/ by RobSt, though. Even as tolerant as I am of Weasley bashing, I think it takes the bashing way too far, as it's a time travel fic, and rather than working to redeem the character before they commit unspeakably evil acts, they just punish them for the crimes of their future selves.

*** After reading the 1st chapter, gotta say I'm impressed. I don't usually like fics that are more than 200k words but I think I'm gonna read this one. Thanks for the suggestion!

**** No worries. I tend to go for longer fics myself, because read fairly fast. On a reread, it takes me a couple hours to finish reading a fic, assuming I don't let myself get distracted.

***** Same here. I generally don't read anything under 80k because I'll be done too soon and searching for that next fic.

****** I think for me the perfect length is around 150k words. It isn't that short that you end up wanting more and isn't that long that you start getting bored.

** I think this one had an OP Harry, though it's been a while since I've read it.

  This is smart! Powerful! Ravenclaw! Harry; How would the wizarding world react to a Boy Who Lived who is much different from what they expected? One that is set to change the course of the magical world forever? Grey Harry; Manipulative! Dumbledore; Harry/Daphne

**** Fair enough. Some people consider Harry to be a bit OP in Honour Thy Blood if you haven't read it yet. Robst and Sinyk's stories also often feature an OP Harry, though they are full of tropes and not everyone likes them. Parallels from Bobmin is also a good fic.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
