It's common for wizarding Britain to be described as "backwards" in fanfic. But is this really true?

The simple answer is that it depends what area you're talking about. So let's look in turn at those areas where wizards are more "advanced" than Muggles, and those where the opposite holds true.

*Areas where wizarding society is more "advanced"*

- Gender discrimination. Of the 36 Ministers for Magic, 11 have been women, going back to 1798. If you limit the scope of the question to Ministers since 1800, then women account for 42% of all Ministers for Magic. So it seems that wizards are significantly further along the path to gender equality than Muggles are. Additionally, throughout the books we never witness any indication of gender discrimination or any idea that witches can't or shouldn't do certain things.

- Racial discrimination. There's less to go on here, but all signs indicate towards race not being considered a relevant characteristic in the wizarding world. If race is a social construct, then it's not a social construct that exists in wizarding society. Not only do we never see any indication of racial prejudices against non-white characters, but there are good reasons to believe otherwise: the Shacklebolt family (black) and Shafiq family (presumable Middle-Eastern in origin) are considered part of the "elite" Sacred Twenty-Eight, and Kingsley seems to have been elected to Minister without any fuss.

- Social mobility. We know that all magical children in Britain receive an invitation to Hogwarts. Not all accept, but nonetheless, everyone has the same opportunity to receive a top magical education. Not only that, but students all have the same opportunities to make friends with individuals from other social classes. Draco Malfoy attends the same school as Ron Weasley. The Muggle equivalent would be if the entire British population attended Eton.

- Economic inequality. Economic inequality is a big part of the wizarding world, as it is in the Muggle world. You only have to compare the Malfoys and Weasleys to see that. However, the bottom rung on the ladder of wizarding wealth is much higher than it is in the Muggle world. The Weasleys are regarded by all as extremely poor; nonetheless, they own their own home, which also comes with a fairly large amount of land (including an orchard), eat very well, and send their children to the same school as the magical elite -- all on a single income. That would just not be possible for an equivalent family in the Muggle world.

- Healthcare. Wizards can fix even severe physical injuries easily, and appear to be able to cure Muggle diseases with equal ease. Magic creates its own dangers, but theoretically Muggles are also exposed to those dangers, it's just that wizards protect them in secret.

- Understanding of the universe. Muggles don't know that magic exists, meaning they are missing a huge element in their understanding of the universe. Most of Muggle science is just wrong in the HP universe. This extends to Muggles' understanding of themselves: they don't know that they have souls. Even in areas of knowledge which might be considered non-magical in nature such as astronomy, the wizards are well ahead - see the accurate, moving model of the entire galaxy Harry considers buying in PoA.

- Travel. Apparition, portkeys etc. all make travel much easier in the wizarding world. Not just quicker, but also more universally available. We see this in the way that a very large number of wizards are able to attend the Quidditch World Cup, travelling there with relative ease - likely a much higher proportion of the wizarding population than Muggles who are able to attend the football world cup.

- Environmental friendliness. Wizards are substantially more environmentally friendly than Muggles. They do not burn fossil fuels (or any fuels, for that matter). They do not produce waste (it can just be vanished). They do not need to build infrastructure or industry and thereby destroy natural habitats.

- Wholesomeness. Wizarding society appears to be more wholesome than Muggle society. It is a world where people spend their free time with family and friends, eating good food, enjoying nature, growing vegetables and rearing animals. They live in remote locations away from the pollution and rapid pace of life of cities. There are no social networks or influencers, no one sitting in restaurants staring at screens rather than interacting with each other, no one resorting to online dating because it's too difficult to meet people in normal life.

*Areas where Muggle society is more "advanced"*

- Criminal law. Harry's trial in OotP is a sham and fails to meet various basic principles of natural justice. Harry had no entitlement to representation or legal advice, he wasn't entitled to know the case against him so that he could prepare a defence, he wasn't even entitled to have advanced notice of the time of his hearing so that he could attend. Additionally, courtroom procedure and rules of evidence seem extremely lax, and there appears to be an overlap between executive and judicial officers, as well as between prosecutor and judge. It's basically mob justice, only the "mob" consists of the elite of society. In this regard, it represents justice as it existed in the early medieval era.

- Treatment of prisoners. Wizarding prisoners are tortured as a matter of routine. While the Muggle government has been found to have been involved in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binyam_Mohamed][torture of prisoners]], the scale is completely different. It's the exception in the Muggle world, whereas in the wizarding world it's the routine.

- Eugenics. Voldemort's Ministry was able to engage in a mini-holocaust without too much resistance. To a certain extent this was because a lot of people were afraid, and the common people did /eventually/ rise up against this Ministry (see Slughorn returning to Hogwarts with a large part of the wizarding population in tow in DH). Nonetheless, the fact that such a programme was at all possible is a black mark on wizarding society.

- Clothing. Muggle fashion is much more diverse than wizarding fashion, and Muggle fashion includes styles that show a lot more skin than wizarding clothing. We've never seen any instance of “modesty” being valued in the wizarding world, or people being shamed for wearing “immodest” clothing, but it's undeniable that the societal norms regarding clothing will mean that people will need to conform to a “modest” clothing standard in order to fit in.

- Entertainment media. Music, literature, film, video games, etc. Muggles have a clear advantage here, both in quality and quantity.

- Access to information. While magic does provide some ability to use magic to retrieve specific information (e.g. “Accio books about horcruxes”), the sophistication of these methods is unlikely to match Muggle databases. Additionally, in the wizarding world, knowledge is all behind barriers: you need to be a student at Hogwarts to use its library; otherwise, you need to buy a book. There is no equivalent to the free access to information which the internet provides.

- Communication. While magic is certainly capable of matching or exceeding the ease of communication Muggles enjoy (see the two-way mirrors), this is not deployed as a matter of routine. Muggles can in general contact each other easier than wizards can. Whether or not the “connected society” is a good thing is debatable, but I've already accounted for that with the reference to “wholesomeness” above.

*Areas where the two worlds are about the same*

- Democracy. Both wizarding and Muggle Britain have political leaders elected by popular vote. Additionally, both systems include a mechanism to force those leaders out of power if you're unhappy with they way they are governing. And in both systems, while the leader is in power, they are essentially an elected dictator.

- Detention of terrorists without trial. Sirius' detention without trial is reflective of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Demetrius][internment in Northern Ireland]].

- Dating and sexuality. Wizarding Britain and Muggle Britain appear to have similar dating cultures. They also appear to have a roughly similar level of puritanism, with boys unable to enter the girls' dorms. However, there are indications that wizarding Britain is slightly more liberal on this front, reflecting the Scandinavian rather than British culture on the issue: we know that Harry changes into his Quidditch robes in the same room as the girls, and we also know (from Snape's memory and the man at the World Cup) that the wizarding norm is for people to just wear underwear under their robes.

*Areas where comparison is not possible*

The main area where comparison is impossible is in the treatment of non-human intelligent species. Comparison isn't possible here for two reasons.

Firstly, because there is no non-human intelligent species known to Muggles.

Secondly, because we don't know enough about the nature of the non-human species. For example, is it an innate part of goblins' nature to behave in ways that humans view as greedy and treacherous, or is this simply a cultural difference?

If goblins are mentally the same as humans, just in a different body and part of a different culture, then a comparison to racism would be apt. But if goblins have genuinely different cognition such that they will always behave in ways that conflict with human morality, then there is no Muggle comparison. It would be as if you took all the racist beliefs about a group and said “Okay, but what if they were true? What if Jews really did eat babies and what if they really were treacherous by nature?”. If that's what goblins are, then there's no Muggle comparison, because Muggles have never encountered a situation where /the racists were right/.

The fact that we don't know the answer to these questions makes a comparison to possible Muggle equivalents such as racism and slavery impossible. Given that JKR already provided a magical analogue to racism in blood prejudice, and given that she has people within the "good guy camp" disagree over how to approach inter-species relations, I am inclined to believe that she was attempting something different and more morally ambiguous with inter-species relations.

*Over to you*

On balance, in light of the above, which of the two societies do you consider more "advanced"? Or is it too close to call? Or do you disagree with the analysis above?

Looking forward to people's thoughts.

If a "prefectly free" paper would be one which hires journalists solely based on their ability (and not, say, political affiliation), and then lets them say what they think without censorship, then of course neither muggle nor wizard media is perfectly free. But the wizarding ones seem to be further from that ideal.

*** So I did. On that front, I'd be inclined to make the category "quality of the press" rather than freedom of the press. Would most likely include it in section 3 - areas where the two worlds are about the same.

While the Muggle world has greater quantity and variety of press, I'm not convinced that the Muggle population are any better informed than the wizarding population is (which is also a function of how the wizarding population is like that of a small town). If that's the case, then the greater quantity/variety doesn't seem to produce any benefit.

If we'd been evaluating in a fixed time period - say, the 90s - then Muggles would win. But Muggle press has gone downhill a lot in the last couple of decades (another evaluation for which I will no doubt earn the adjective "boomer").

** Travers is implied to be a xenophobe, as he seemed to be disgusted by shaking hands with Ron when he was under the effects of Polyjuice Potion. Pansy Parkinson also mocks Angelina Johnson's hair, calls her braids 'worms'. Both are parts of the Sacred 28, so one could argue that some elitist families have developed such racial prejudices as well.

I've never thought of Wizarding Britain as backwards compared to muggles in any way, shape or form. People who expect it to be the perfect society seem to believe that such a state exists in our world, whether as a country or community. There's always going to be imperfection anywhere you go, which is part of why I am so attracted to wizard society, it's portrayed as imperfect. It really humanises people whom we normally wouldn't relate to; magic seems to overcome many Muggle problems, so they would have their own, and I wouldn't be able to relate to that (dementors, love potions aren't a threat to my everyday life). House-elf slavery is not good in-universe because slavery is unjustifiable in all cases, but from a literary perspective that makes us draw examples from real life, and is a good addition to the books as opposed to a perfect society with no drawbacks to it.

So I don't think that either Muggle or wizard society is more advanced than the other, it's like comparing apples to oranges, both have their own problems, which are there merely for the existence of magic, that alone makes both worlds incomparable. Magic will solve things and eradicate common problems in the Muggle world but it will /also/ create problems for witches and wizards. What doesn't exist in Muggle society cannot aid it /or/ hurt it because they've adapted without it, and what doesn't exist in wizard society cannot harm it or aid it as well. An example is transportation, muggles have cars and bikes and buses, wizards have flying and owls and floo network.

** Wizards do destroy habitats, though. We heard that the Ministry is forcefully decreasing centaur territories.

Instead of racism on colour, wizards have prejusice on blood purity. It's just as bad.

I also don't get the impression that wizarding astronomy covers subjects like black holes and the like. Their understanding of the universe seems more primitive than muggle understanding through for example astrophysics.

I'd say that the politics in the wizarding world is more like the American system than the British, as the election seems to focus more on the minister candidate himself, and not the political party he represents. It doesn't even seem like there's any political parties involved in the election.

Given that they act like cheap thugs (violence in response to insults), either it is crime control or pest control, depending on your interpretation of what exactly centaurs are.

And given what they were mythological infamous for (kidnapping and rape), you can make an educated guess what happened to Umbridge and whether or not punitive measures were justified.

Like, the two most common examples of Ministry prejudice (werewolves and centaurs) are pretty much justified based on their canon actions.

**** Their actions stem from them being angry because of their treatment. The centaurs, while maybe not being particularly helpful or friendly in the first book, weren't in any way violent or aggressive. That came in the 5th book once the government had started encroaching on their territory and trying to restrict their movements. And when it comes to werewolves, you're talking about people who are badly discriminated against, people who are frustrated and angry, turning to the one person who is actually offering them the freedom they crave.

Most of the violence you see in canon happens by creatures that are angry about being repressed, which considering muggle history, isnt that surprising. Now the goblins I'll give you since they actually do seem to thrive on violence.

Though I admit, I wasn't even alive for most of the period the books were set in (I was born in '96) and I'm about as aware of modern celebrity culture now as I was in the 90s, so my opinion isn't terribly well-backed by anything. To paraphrase a joke from Daniel Sloss, I tune into Celebrity Culture like someone who's tuned in mid way through the sixth season of Game of Thrones.

*** There are a lot of single adults in the HP verse, this could be because Harry was unaware of their spouses, but I'd say the HP verse could have used something like online dating. Remus would have had a way easier time finding someone that isn't opposed to dating a werewolf and wouldn't have had to spend years alone. Pretty much all Hogwarts professors are single, Umbridge, Skeeter, Amelia Bones, Shacklebolt, Moody, Charlie, nobody that lost a spouse seems to have remarried over a decade after the war.

I think the people that cant resort to online dating because It's too difficult to meet people in normal life are more likely to just stay single.

** The biggest flaw in your argument is that some of it is heavily dependent on non-canonical material. Yes, it's reasonable to use Rowling's statements in social media and on web sites to inform your view of canon, there's nothing wrong with that, but strictly speaking that isn't canon. Only the text of the books is canon - not even the movies are canon, and Rowling played a big role in how they turned out. Every single thing she has said outside the text is extra-canonical and how much weight you place on those statements is entirely a personal preference. I'm not saying it's unreasonable to use such material to inform your interpretation of the text, but I am saying it's not required to form an opinion about what's in the text.

If we're going to ask why people regard wizarding Britain as “backwards,” it's more legitimate to limit our inquiry to just the text of the actual books in question (which we can reasonably expect everyone to have read, even if people don't remember every detail) than it is to include extra-canonical statements made by the author at various times and places over the decades (which we cannot reasonably expect everyone to track down and read).

Let's take gender discrimination as an example. All that stuff about female Ministers? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think a single bit of it appears in the text of the books (except for the existence of Bagnold). If it does, I suspect it was a brief aside of a sentence or two, and I'm not surprised if people forgot it. Most people who have read the books probably haven't read any of that extra material. I doubt if even most fanfiction readers and writers have read it. They've read what's in the books, and that's where our primary focus should be.

What does appear in the text? We have housewives (Molly, Narcissa) and women with careers (McGonagall, Sprout, Pomfrey), but we don't see a single woman who is clearly identified as having a spouse, children, and a career. There are very good reasons why women fought for so long for the political, social, and cultural right to have all three, and the fact that this doesn't appear even once in the text (with the possible exceptions being Mrs. Granger, whom we don't really see or hear from, and the epilogue, though it's unclear if Ginny and Hermione are mothers while also having careers) is concerning.

Yes, women are clearly every bit as capable as men when it comes to magic, which makes the books better than many others we might discuss, but we don't see or experience true equality. In the books, women can have families and they can have important positions of political/social power, but we don't see and experience them with both. There are men with both, but no women. Even worse, the careers that we see and experience the most with witches are also those which women have traditionally been restricted to the most: teacher and nurse/healer. We hear about Amelia Bones and Minister Bagnold, but are they truly any more evidence of political equality than the fact that Margaret Thatcher was muggle Prime Minister?

Note: a brief reference to a witch having political power or having both a family and a career wouldn't be the same as having long-term experiences of wizards actively having both - the two are not equivalent in the context of a story. Such references may indeed qualify as evidence for the society being more progressive than many think, but they don't have the same effect on readers, which is important.

Knowing that Bagnold existed is suggestive, but also weak given the real-world example of Thatcher. But imagine that Molly was the Weasley who held an important Ministry position while Arthur stayed home, tending the orchard and raising the kids. Not only would that have counted as far better evidence of gender equality in society, it also would have sent a very different message to readers.

Therefore, we have here a very good reason to regard the society described by the text in the books as “backwards”. Even by the standards of the 1990s, women with families and careers were common in muggle Britain, but they appear to be rare in magical Britain. Why? No idea. The reasons could be social, cultural, political, economic, or even something else. But what we actually see and experience in the books does not rise to what muggle women had come to expect in the same time period.

Other parts of your argument are arguably worse.

Economic inequality, for example. It wouldn't be possible for muggles to have what the Weasleys have? When it comes to being cash-poor but having land and food, that's hardly uncommon in farming communities. Yes, the kids are also attending Hogwarts. So? We have no idea what's going on there. Maybe Arthur makes enough to send the kids to Hogwarts and not much more, which is why they are so cash-poor now. Maybe Bill and Charlie send money home for this. Or maybe they are on scholarships. Or maybe they don't pay anything because it's all government funded (which I seem to remember is something Rowling said in one of her extra-canonical statements; if she did, then I'm surprised you didn't use that explicitly).

As far as we know, Hogwarts is the only school Britain, so unless the political leaders are fine with leaving young witches and wizards staying untrained and uneducated (unlikely, given the Statue of Secrecy), of course the Weasley kids are going. Everyone going to the only school that exists, which is all we actually know, is not by itself strong evidence for being very “advanced” or “progressive”. What's more, poor kids taking classes alongside rich kids does not automatically translate into social mobility. Is there a single example anywhere in the text of someone starting out from a poor family and rising up to wealth? Or even just something like upper middle class? I can't think of any.

Wholesomeness? I'm not even going to address whether it's somehow inherently more “wholesome” to live in the country rather than the city, as that lies outside the scope of this subreddit. I'll just point out whether this is even a valid issue to raise is debatable at best. Nor will I address the total irrelevance of social networks in the 1990s.

It's true that we see that the Weasleys live in the country, and the Malfoys seem to be isolated, but that's it.

The Ministry is in London (probably not a surprise for historical reasons, but they clearly aren't trying to move their government away from all that “unwholesomeness” of the city). So is St. Mungo's, the only hospital we know about. So is Diagon Alley, the primary shopping district for all wizarding Britain. Children all gather in a London train station to travel to Hogwarts. The Black family home was in London. Even Amelia Bones may have lived in London or some other major city, given that the muggle Prime Minister was well aware of the mystery surrounding her death (I think it unlikely that he would have read and remembered the newspaper accounts if they appeared in any small community that wasn't his own district, and there were far too many other signficant things going on at the time for big-city newspapers to devote much space to a single mysterious death in rural England).

It's reasonable to suspect that magicals generally live separate from muggles simply for the sake of preserving the Statute of Secrecy, but we have little direct textual evidence of it - nor do we have any textual evidence that this or any other aspect of their living situation makes their lives any more “wholesome”.

Now, I'm not trying to argue that everything you wrote is wrong. For example, it's true that there's no evidence of racial or ethnic discrimination and bigotry. Given what Draco Malfoy is like (after having grown up far from the “unwholesome” city, no less), I think it's reasonable to expect him to have said something disparaging about race or ethnicity at least once if such thinking existed to any degree. So, yes, there are definitely aspects of magical society that are probably more progressive than muggle society. Not everything is socially or politically horrible.

However, on too many points you've stretched much farther than the text will allow - stretched to the point translucence, frankly. If we cut out all the extra-canonical material, and cut out all the stretched inferences that lack a solid textual foundation, we aren't left with much to support the thesis that magical society is more advanced. If we do the same on the other side... well, actually, we don't lose nearly as much.

We can weaken a couple of points. For example, IIRC technically Harry's hearing wasn't supposed to be a trial, so we can't be sure how indicative it is of actual criminal proceedings. On the other hand, strong criminal law rights should translate into strong rights in other proceedings, especially those held before a body acting as a jury. So the argument still stands and is solid, but I don't think it's quite as strong as written.

My point is, your arguments against the society stand on much stronger textual ground than the arguments in favor. So while wizarding society does have a few things going for it, on balance what we actually see and experience in the books is largely regressive.

**** No, I'm not confusing them.

The idea that the author loses the authority to tell us how to interpret a book is the essential point. If Rowling publishes a new book that tells the history of the Ministry, and this book includes stories about female Ministers, then that will be canon. Because it's a new book in the overall series.

Comments on Twitter on a blog aren't a book in a series. They are the author's personal feelings about events in the book. They are the backstory that the author had in mind when they wrote, but wasn't important enough to actually include in the text. They are later things that the author came up with.

None of it is canon because none of it is included in the written, published works that are at issue. It's all personal feelings about how the fictional world is supposed to work. Authors are certainly allowed to have their own opinions about intentions, motives, backstory, etc., and readers are perfectly justified in privileging those opinions if they wish.

But it's not required, and that's the point.

For example, an author might say that Character X had a certain backstory (childhood trauma?) which explains and excuses actions seen in the book. However, none of that backstory is actually revealed in the text - it was all just in the back of the author's mind. Readers may be justified in taking that into account when reading the books, especially if there are even slight hints in that direction, but the mere fact that the author mentioned it in an interview at a convention doesn't make this backstory “canon”. It'll become canon if the author writes a prequel book that includes such events, but not until then.

And thus other readers are just as justified in not taking that information into account. They cannot be required to rely up on in the same way that they should rely upon material that is actually in the text of the book.

Rowling's opinions about the history of the Ministry of Magic are just that - her opinions. She never wrote any books that explain this history, and the rest of us are not bound to those opinions when we read the text of the actual series and form our own opinions about the culture and politics of the society we see.

***** No, you're talking about death of the author. The idea that extra-textual statements by the author shouldn't be used to interpret a text, only those things that are within in. (It's one theory of literary criticism, though not the only one.)

The first problem is that you're doing it arbitrarily. From the perspective of The Philosopher's Stone, the Chamber of Secrets is an extra-textual statement. It's something else the author said about that world, but outside the text you're interpreting. So you're not drawing a line around the text itself, but for some reason you are drawing a line around books. There's nothing special about books. There's no difference between a statement published in a book or one published on a website, or in a movie or even an interview for that matter.

If you're not drawing a line around the text itself, then /you/ don't get to be the arbiter of where the line gets drawn, including some things but not others. Which brings us to the main point, of canon.

Canon is about authority: the authoritative statement of what is or isn't true within a fictional world. Unsurprisingly, it's the author who has that authority. She can say that Pottermore is canon, but the video games aren't, and that's her prerogative. You or any other readers, on the other hand, don't get to make decisions about where canon begins and ends.

****** Yes, I know I'm talking about Death of the Author. My point is that I'm not confusing that with something else.

No, one book is not “extra-textual” to another book in a series. No sequel has ever been “extra-textual” to anything it follows.

The point you seem to not be realizing is that only the story is capable of being canon - whether that story is one book, a short story, multiple books in a series, a poem, etc. Only the story. Comments made about a story by the author are not themselves the story. They are instead the author's opinions about the story, and those opinions are not something any reader is required to take into account when interpreting the story.

Doesn't matter if the comments are spoken in an interview, written in a blog post, occur as detailed notes on acid-free paper and preserved behind museum-quality glass, or 3AM drunken tweets.

And this is why 3AM drunken tweets don't have the same status as a published text simply because the author said so that one time. Such tweets aren't a story. They are commentary.

Story is canon. Commentary is not canon.

If an author wants something to be canon, they can write a story to make it so. Otherwise, they are just offering their personal opinion on what the story should mean to others, and that's not advice anyone is required to heed.

This is absolutely true, but it has nothing to do with the concept of canon. Readers have no obligation to care about canon at all. You do seem to be thinking that canon has something to do with death of the author. They are separate things that exist for different purposes. One is about the fictional world, the other is about how you choose to read.

Like I said, canon is about the authoritative statement of what is true or false in a fictional world. There's no limits on that beyond who gets to make authoritative statements. Thus canon can be overwritten: a later statement can contradict an earlier statement, and it's the author who gets to decide which is true.

The term extra-textual is self-explanatory: "extra" means beyond, "textual" refers to a text or work. Sometimes a single works might be published in multiple volumes, like Lord of the Rings. But the books of Harry Potter were written separately, after previous ones had been published. They were not produced as a single, complete whole. They are separate works from each other, and thus extra-textual to each other.

Again, canon doesn't relate to the story, it relates to what is true. Story just refers to narrative, and that excludes all sorts of things that I'm certain you consider to be canon. Published books like Quidditch Through the Ages, which is written as a reference work rather than a story. It's still canon, even though there's no narrative. And I'm sure you'd have said it is; but then you say Pottermore isn't, even though it's in the exact same format, except published online rather than in a physical book. You say the movies aren't canon, but your original reasoning was that it's because they aren't books. But they're published stories in the fictional world, so your current argument contradicts that. So is it based on being books, or based on being stories? It's hard to find a consistent justification for an arbitrary stance.

If the author wants something to be canon, all they have to do is say so. You're at liberty not to care about canon, or to strongly disagree with it, but you don't get to make arbitrary decisions about it is by saying some things are canon while others aren't. That's something only the author can do.

It always pisses me off when fanfic authors go "Oh, the Muggles have moved beyond such things (usually followed by "at least in enlightened Western countries"). Its so self-congratulatory, privileged, and false (as I recall, "Methods of Rationality" is particularly obnoxious in the is way, though its far from the only one, and has many imitators).

Systemic racism? Prevalent to varying degrees in numerous nations.

Police brutality and wrongful incarceration (often due to racism)? What do you think the protests and riots right now are about? Why do you think "defund the police" has become a popular sentiment?

Shitty tabloid journalism? Commonplace.

Partisan interference in journalism and education? Also commonplace, to varying degrees. Trump threatening to make it easier to sue the press and cut off federal funding to universities comes to mind, as do crackdowns on whistleblowers under various governments.

Lack of a trial? Talk to the guys in Guantanamo Bay. Or the vast majority of accused in both the US and Canada (and probably other countries) who are pressured into pleading guilty for a reduced sentence rather than risking a trial, for that matter.

Slavery? Legal in the United States to this day (the amendment banning slavery makes specific exemption for convict labor, and since the US has a couple million inmates, mostly non-white, slavery is well and truly still around).

Ethnic cleansing? US immigration policy.

Segregated ethnic groups? Not to the extent of the Wizarding World, maybe, but "Indian" reservations and ghettos.

On the flip side, the Wizards actually seem to be ahead of us on gender equality, and ahead of at least the US on health care, since Mr. Weasley's hospital stay didn't result in his family's bankruptcy.

If Jews really eat babies then we would have evidence supporting that and if (on top of eating babies) they were treacherous by nature, I don't think they would've been able to be accepted in any society, let alone be a cohesive unit.

My point is that if every single member of a group cannot adhere to some form of social construct, then the group would implode. If they can, then they are comparable to different groups of humans.

That's why races in most fantasy themed media aren't just classifications of humans. Humans, elves, dark elves etc are all classified as different races, in their universe.

But anyway, if Muggleborn is a race, then it'd be racism, but Taure seems to be saying that Muggleborn is not a race, and thus it's something we don't have an equivalent for. I have no idea what it would be, by that definition, I just know they're saying Blood isn't a Race.

The weasleys are supposedly a large family outside of Arthur and Molly's children but we are simply not introduced to many of them outside aunt Muriel. given the size of their property i dont think its fair to use them as a representative of poverty in the wizarding community when we have better analogues like Remus who is routinely discriminated against in terms of jobs as well as the various criminal elements of knockturn alley.

although supposition the economic welfare of people seems to largely be speciesist in nature as we see hags selling potion ingredients from stalls as opposed to the wizarding shops and the largely tribal groups of giants and centaurs.

it seems to be that of the two major wizarding communities we are introduced to, the larger Diagon Alley has a significant poor and dangerous community in Knockturn alley. the seedier and more rundown hogshead is the only place we see vampires (outside of the one at slughorn's party who is supposedly their as an oddity) and hags. Greyback , a malicious child molester, is seemingly the largest voice for werewolf rights and holds some sort of sway in that community.

wholesomeness is a fallacy you are using screens and dating apps while applying to the nineties. they also have large civil wars, insurrections, speciesism, slavery, and based on the black family rampant socially acceptable child abuse. majority of families are also small only contains 1 or 2 children and largely keep to their assigned house in terms of friends to the point house rivalries seem to transcend hogwarts.

you say speciesism is supposedly different then racism, one then has to ignore that racism was considered speciesism before we changed definitions.

the wizarding community is in only one respect more advanced and that is in gender equality. and that's likely only do to the equalizing factor of everyone having a wand.

** Wizarding culture is more advanced socially.

The fact that everyone receives the same type of education is something that the muggle world can't boast about, even if the amount of students is probably only a small percentage. On the other hand, for such a small community for blood purity to matter so much it's strange.

I think a lot of this could be changed based on what British culture you compare it to, if you compare it to Britain in the 90s as per when the books are set, it's would be a lot different than now.

** - /Social mobility. We know that all magical children in Britain receive an invitation to Hogwarts. Not all accept, but nonetheless, everyone has the same opportunity to receive a top magical education. Not only that, but students all have the same opportunities to make friends with individuals from other social classes. Draco Malfoy attends the same school as Ron Weasley. The Muggle equivalent would be if the entire British population attended Eton./
- /Economic inequality. Economic inequality is a big part of the wizarding world, as it is in the Muggle world. You only have to compare the Malfoys and Weasleys to see that. However, the bottom rung on the ladder of wizarding wealth is much higher than it is in the Muggle world. The Weasleys are regarded by all as extremely poor; nonetheless, they own their own home, which also comes with a fairly large amount of land (including an orchard), eat very well, and send their children to the same school as the magical elite -- all on a single income. That would just not be possible for an equivalent family in the Muggle world./

I have to disagree on these points. More so in what you've not mentioned.

Yes, all magical children receive invites to Hogwarts, but it doesn't mean that all children have equal opportunity to attend or that their opportunities are close to equal once they are in attendance. Simply allowing poor students into Hogwarts doesn't constitute social mobility.

Muggle schools are expected to pull out all the stops to close the gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers. Schools provide support in almost every way you can imagine, not just academically (I'm not sure how familiar you are with this, given your boarding school experiences), especially at primary school level where it is hoped the gap can be closed before secondary. Nevertheless, there is still support at secondary.

Hogwarts, by all regards, has enough students who are wealthy and/or have protective characteristics in their families that it should be easy to pull off, yet it is evident from staffing levels that this isn't valued/funded. We don't see any tangible support offered to Harry after Sirius' death, or in any other circumstances. There isn't any support to get muggleborns up to speed with the vocabulary and knowledge gap.

The closest we get to this idea is Harry's 'remedial potions' but there's nothing to suggest this is routine support for lower ability pupils. Nor are there vists for all/disadvantaged pupils visits to, say, St. Mungos or the Ministry to inspire career choices.

Families wealthy enough to afford a tutor, or who have a parent at home who is able and willing to teach are at a distinct advantage to, say, a family with the intellect of the Goyles but without their wealth. In fact, I would go as far to suggest that that families who lack academic skills but work in a more hands-on job (farming, crafting, or other specialised areas) might home school their children in their particular trade. This is what people did pre-Hogwarts, in any case.

Sticking strictly to canon, Hogwarts should need to have far more support in place for pupils lacking basic literacy skills than it does. At the very least it would need more staffing or drawing non-compulsory subject teachers into it. Besides, by age 11 the gap between those with quality education and experiences and those without should be huge, with a few exceptional cases. (Hermione, despite being muggleborn, has many protective experiences with well educated, financially comfortable parents who invest in her education and provide a range of experiences, e.g., skiing.)

Despite having a diverse intake of pupils, Hogwarts seems to function entirely as though it is a private boarding school with only a few scholarship pupils (who even then almost exclusively have parents invested and with the know how to apply).

Post-Hogwarts, unless perhaps you're lucky enough to make friends with someone to put in a good word for you, even if you worked much harder to achieve than a pureblood - chances are they will have better networking opportunities to get a job.

​

With regard to strictly economical inequality, it would be unlikely Arthur could have raised a large family on a single wage in the muggle world. I'll allow that. However, while the Weasley's are relatively poor compared to Harry and his friends (who, frankly, are all wealthy) and they do have second hand goods, it's my belief this comes mainly from having so many children rather than him having a truly bad job. (Yes, this doesn't help the children.)

As you've pointed out, the Weasleys have a house, land, good food. They have two parents who are accomplished at magic who can also use that to provide for them. (You can duplicate food, but not create it.) In the muggle world, no - the Weasley's wouldn't have gone to Eton but it seems reasonable they still could have gone to university.

By contrast, Remus Lupin's income is extremely low as he's taking jobs well below his skill level (and leaving them before they work out he's a werewolf). Nonetheless, some people are doing these menial jobs (we know the ministry has cleaners) and they likely have children. We know that petty criminals exist who likely also have a low income.

As for online dating, they're probably putting dating ads in the back of the prophet like people did before social media/the internet, or nose deep into a book or newspaper. People have been finding ways to ignore each other for generations.

The way I see it wizards devote their time to studying various ways of changing the natural order of the world, the impossible is their specialty, whereas muggles devote their time to studying the existing natural order of the world. A muggle would never know about the magical properties of stars and their phases, affecting various powers as they wax and wane, but wizards would never know about black holes or how the atomic elements are created. Why bother learning how hydrogen can become lithium through the long processes of nuclear fusion when a simple tranfiguration spell will do the trick?

If you're an anti-realist and a true scientific proposition means "X accords with the observable evidence and functions as a useful predictor of future states of affairs" then you are correct. So long as you restrict your domain of observable evidence to the non-magical, then the set of scientific propositions embodied by current science can still be true.

If you're a realist and a true scientific proposition means "X is the true description of the universe" then your position doesn't follow. The true description of the universe involves magic (and indeed, given that magic appears to have supremacy over physical law, presumably revolves primarily around magic).

**** My stance is that what you describe as the "anti-realist" perspective (a name which I find unnecessarily inflamatory) is what describes the "status quo" when it comes to the world. A sort of default baseline of activity, and that magic is what allows beings to deviate from that baseline and alter the natural order. We know from reading the books that magic changes the ogysical nature if an area when that area is exposed to suffucient volumes of magic for a sufficient amount of time. This would not occur if the presence and activity of magic were the standard state of affairs. Even if Magic were a core part if the natural order of thw world, say as if it were a fifth fundamental force alongside the existing four (Electromagnetism, Gravity, anf the Strong and Weak Nuclear forces), it would then only be an addition to the existing set. Lack of knowledge of one force does disqualify knowledge of the others. Isaac Newton had no clue about three of the four fundamental forces when he wrote his work on gravity and physics, and his work still holds true even now. I belive that Magic and science coexist in a fairly simple fashion, science (and by extension reason as a whole) are used to observe and explain what /is/, while magic is used to change it. Devoting oneself to the study of one would almost by necessity involve ignorance of the other due to their almost diametrically opposed nature. Furthermore, while we can debate the philosophical aspects of this question all day long (and I would be happy to do so), I have yet to see you produce evidence for your "realist" claim that physical law revolves arpund magic. JK Rowling very clearly wrote her story in a setting of a hidden magical society concealed within the /modern/ world. We have evidence from the books that various muggle technologies function the same way as they do in real life from the running of gasoline powered vehicles to the simple use of batteries to store electricity acting as evidence that at the very least rhe basics of electromagnetism works the same as it doens in real life. What is more, based on the history used in the world rowling created, we can know that events like World War II happened just as they did in the real world, and therefore infer that various scientific advancements of the era and just before then happened as they did in the real world. We can infer from the existence of World War II that Nuclear Bombs and therefore Nuclear Physics exist in the world of Harry Potter. We can infer from the existence of World War II that chemical weapons and therefore complex chemistry as a whole exist in the World of Harry Potter. All throughout the world of Harry Potter there is evidence that science and technology function as normal and that Magic provides access to abilities that are /beyond/ what is normal, rather than magic simply being the /supreme form/ of normal as your statement seems to imply.

I believe I have defended my position rather well, if you would care to do the same I would love to continue this debate as it is incredibly fascinating.

*PS:* If you do decide to continue our debate, I would greatly appreciate it if you did not insult my intelligence again by calling me an "anti-realist", especially without first defending or providing evidence for your claims. The burden of proof lies with those making claims true or otherwise, not with those who question those claims.

***** 1.  Anti-realism is the [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/#AntiFoilForScieReal][standard term]] for the position in philosophy of science. Sorry if you dislike it!

2.  I think you are focusing too much on spells. Magic is not just something wizards /do/; there are magical plants and animals and naturally occurring phenomena with magical significance (love, for example, has magical power). Furthermore, we know that there is a body of magical theory which describes the nature of magic in a kind of parallel to the way science describes physical things: Gamp's law etc. I think it's clear that there is a system of "natural magical law" which exists in parallel to "natural physical law"; some natural things behave according to magical law rather than physical law, and when the two interact, it is physical law which gives way (suggesting that the natural magical law is more fundamental).

3.  Additionally, we know that the system of natural magical law is fundamentally contradictory to the system of natural physical law. Magic is not like a fifth fundamental force, an extension of the same system as physics. Rather it is a system that describes the universe in fundamentally different terms to the physical system. Conservation of energy is not a thing and perpetual motion is possible; non-physical substances exist; action-at-a-distance is possible; the way matter is described by transfiguration theory will be fundamentally different to its treatment in chemistry, and so on.

4.  More fundamentally, beyond examples of specific phenomena, the magical system operates on a profoundly different basis to the reductionist, physicalist view of the universe.

5.  Protection spells are often placed on an address rather than a physical border. Job positions can be cursed. Secrets have their own existence. Linguistic items can be the subject of spells like the Taboo. "Food" forms part of the rules of transfiguration. All these abstract concepts have magical reality in a way which goes against the physicalist view of the universe.

6.  In the real world, what is a "secret"? Well, a secret would be a sub-class of information defined with reference to its social status. The precise definition of what social status renders something a secret would be a matter of opinion or arbitrary definition. Once you have defined it, the next level of analysis is to say that this sub-category of information is, in turn, something that exists within people's minds. The mind is in turn the brain, and information is essentially composed of electrical signals in the brain.

7.  So what is a secret according to science? It is an arrangement of electrical signals across the brains of a number of different individuals which fits the arbitrary, stipulated definition of what a secret is. The concept of a secret is not its own thing; it is a social invention which reduces down (as everything does) to a physical arrangement of atoms.

8.  In contrast, what is a secret in the magical world? It is its own thing which has magical reality; we are told that secrets exist in souls. Magic itself distinguishes between secrets and non-secrets; it's not something that is subject to the arbitrary definition of human opinion, but rather an objective fact about the world - a "natural kind". Those magically real secrets can be interacted with and magic can be cast upon them, including the ability to relocate them from one soul to another.

9.  Finally, turning to the "but technology /works"/ point: bridges that were (and are) built using the Newtonian understanding of the universe still remain standing, even though we now know that the Newtonian description of the universe is false. The fact that you build Object X based on Theory Y and Object X works does not prove that Theory Y is true; it simply means that, within the limited domain that Object X operates in, Theory Y is sufficiently close to the truth that Object X never encounters any of the phenomena which Theory Y is wrong about.

10. The relationship of Muggle technology to the correct, magical description of the universe would be equivalent to the relationship of "Newtonian technology" to Relativistic physics.

  Criminal law. Harry's trial in OotP is a sham and fails to meet various basic principles of natural justice.
#+end_quote

I want to point that Harry trial in OotP should not be used to judge their whole system. Harry was only supposed to talk to a panel of 3 Ministry representative in presence of his Headmaster, and the panel would have then decided if his use of magic was justified or not. In this situation, it's the Minister who abused his power to transform this into a political trial. The fact that he was able to do it show a failing of the system, but "Muggle" societies also showed the same failing in their history (as a French, the Dreyfus case first come to mind, but I'm sure similar cases could be found closer to the canon date of HP).

​

Concerning the whole question, I believe that Magical and Muggle Brittain are 2 separated entities that should be separated the same way France is separated to Brittain.

And because they are 2 different countries with 2 different cultures, you can't really "rank" them. While I was at university, I remember a teacher explaining "there are no superior cultures, only different ones". You can't say that one country is superior because its inhabitants are wearing lighter clothing, because for the inhabitants of the other countries, they are superior because they are wearing heavier clothing. The true question should be "Can the country produce both type of clothing, and does its inhabitant have the liberty to wear them". In HP, even if heaby robes seem to be favoured, there is no law that stop a witch to wear a tank top and a mini short. Of course, if she was to wear it while at school or in a Ministry reunion, she could be in trouble, but the situation is also true in the Muggle world.

Of course, there are some limitation with this line of thought, and as an example, the no respect of Human right should considered inacceptable even when encountered in a different culture. But I'm not sure we can really judge Wizarding society on this, since Muggle society never been in presence of "Non Human Intelligent Being", and only started to respect its own human pretty recently (Slavery had only been banned for around 100 years depending of the country when the Canon events happened, and the Apartheïd was still present in some countries). In comparaison, Muggle society seem to be pretty much free of racism (nobody is judged for his color, though some people still seem to have some xenophobic thought), and yet they have their own discrimination system with the Blood Purism.

​

Anyways, while it's difficult to compare 2 culture, there are other way to compare the 2 countries, such as its confort of life, and in this situation, I'm afraid that the Magical side is better.

Magical Brittain seem to have reached a post scarcity level of life. Even a poor family (such as the Weasley are presented) doesn't seem to have any problem to fulfill its primary and secondary needs, and is even able to give the best available education to its children. The only indication of their poverty seem to be in their lack of "luxury goods" (second hand books and clothing, difficulty to buy brooms . . .). In comparaison, Muggle poor are living on the street and some are not sure when there next meal will be.

When you look at the arguments of the people who believe that Magical Brittain is "backward", the most common arguments are "/they don't have any science/"," /they use old Muggle items/", "/they never went to the moon/", and "/they don't have smartphones/". And to all of this, I want to answer : *Magic*.

- Science is useless when you can ignore all of its law with a wave of your wand. Muggle learn why the sky is blue, Wizard learn how to turn the sky red if they would wish to do so.
- All societies are partially influencing each other thanks to their innovation. Paper was invented in China before spreading in Europe, the Industrial Revolution (and rise of the Industry) was first born in Brittain before taking over the world. And as all societies, Magical Brittain as been taking over some innovation it found interesting. Cars and trains have found their place into their society (though their use is limited and mainly to conceal themselves into the Muggle world), while others such as the planes as been completely ignored, mainly because wizard already have "superior" means of travel (brooms, floo travel, apparition, portkey . . .), same thing with the phones, they already had it at home with the floo.\\
  As for why are the Wizards using old items, the answer is once again "magic". Electric lightning was an amazing innovation because it was an more efficient and clearning way of lightning. But magical fire can burn forever without the need to clean after, so why bother to install electricity? Why bother changing your kitchen when the one your grandparents got still work perfectly after some use of the /Reparo/ charm? And the list goes on.
- The smartphone (and generally most of the new technologies) are an interesting point. Canon events happened during the 1990's when they were not yet widespread, but I admit that I can't imagine a magical equivalent of Internet, and even the smartphones may probe to be a challenge (though the magical mirror seen in OotP already show some promise as an equivalent).

​

Finally, I will only say that Magical Brittain is restricted by its own size. Its limited number (around 10 000 I think?), mean that the market is not big enough for the apparition of a true industry or a stock market. It would be easier to compare the country to a small city where everyone know each other, and where craftmanship and personal loans are enough for the society to work.

But back on the topic of muggle versus wizard Britian. I was always bothered by how much power Dumbledore was allowed to hold.

  It's true that the treatment of prisoners in the isolation cells was inhumane, and there were protests regarding prisoner treatment at Alcatraz at the time.

Azkaban is a prison where you are literally made to sleep on the floor, and are tortured by soul sucking demons, not very comparable. Alcatraz if it had never closed would probably not flag human rights violations nearly as much as Azkaban would.

In Alcatraz at least after it got rid of it's harsher practices you got fed regularly and had a schedule that you had to follow, from keeping the prison clean to exercise, like any other prison.

A step beyond that. It's not merely a semantic point. I am saying:

- It is possible for certain ways of seeing the world, behavioural tendencies, and even beliefs to be biologically innate. For example, the way we view the world in three dimensions, or how we view causality - these are all products of our brain structure. Another example: humans are by nature social animals; it is hard wired into our biology, to the point that we consider it a mental disability to e.g. not be able to intuit a person's emotional state from their expression or tone of voice.

- One can imagine a fictional race which possessed innate characteristics which differ from humans in ways that fundamentally conflict with what humans consider moral. E.g. a species that is hard-wired to kill their mates or eat their own young.

- These characteristics would be no more controllable than a person can control the fact that they see the world in three dimensions. Having intelligence does not exempt you from the constraints of your biology.

- This situation may exist in canon. E.g. hags may well be hard-wired to eat human children.

- Human relations with different species with different biological impulses and different ways of viewing the world cannot be boiled down to "they are intelligent therefore they should be granted the same rights as humans". Intelligence is not the be-all and end-all of how you should treat a being or group of beings. Granting rights to a species which is biologically driven to eliminate your own would be pure stupidity.

The fact that in human history certain races have been wrongly identified as having different innate characteristics to other races is a complete non-sequitur to the question of how you should treat a species where it is correct.

It definitely does, the Fantastic Beast textbook actually states that several highly intelligent creatures are classified as Beasts and not Beings because despite their intelligence they cant overcome their brutal nature, naming Acromantulas and Manticores as an example.

This also makes clear than in general the nature of even sapient beings can just differ from humans and that wizards chose to grant them rights depending on how in conforms with their own attitude. For example I assume that Hags and Vampires have a nature that makes them want to consume humans, but since they're Beings they seem to have been judged to be able to overcome it. Likewise Bill Weasley attributes the Goblin idea of Ownership to them being a different kind of being and mentions it to have resulted in many problems amongst wizards and goblins in the past.

Well, the counter-argument would simply be that this textbook reflects the prejudices of wizards.

There's lots of further responses that can be made, of course:

- We're not in a position to second-guess wizarding knowledge of the nature of magical creatures (or magic generally) as we only have an extremely limited window into the magical world.

- We know of plenty of magical intelligences which lack true agency/free will/the ability to choose to defy their own nature. The Sorting Hat, for example, would pass the Turing Test, but is perfectly content to act eternally in accordance with its predeterminated nature of simply singing a song once a year and sorting the kids.

- We know that souls exist in the HP universe; presumably it is the soul, not intelligence, which grants something the status of true being/consciousness. Everything else is a "philosophical zombie".

So I think the evidence is heavily on one side here. But it's not 100% conclusive so I prefer to still use the phrasing "may exist" rather than "definitely does exist".

****** I don't know why you keep fixating on house-elves when the argument is about intelligent non-human species as a whole.

In any event, the canon evidence is not so clear on house-elves. Dobby seems to be viewed by other house-elves as an aberration; just as there are humans who cannot look at a smiling face and intuit that the person is happy, Dobby is unable to be happy as a slave.

Now, there are two possible explanations here:

1. All house-elves are like Dobby, they're just brain-washed, or

2. Dobby is a genuine aberration.

The canon evidence does not determine the two. Indeed, JKR appears to have deliberately underdetermined the evidence by providing the counter-example of Winky, who is unable to be happy once freed.

So, are house-elves cognitively identical to humans such that their enslavement is like the enslavement of a human? Or are they fundamentally different creatures whose innate nature is such that they can only be happy when they exist in a state of slavery?

I know what answer you will provide, but I think the majority of people recognise the issue to be more complex (certainly the responses on the subreddit survey show people to be very heavily split on the issue, as did the recent thread on the same topic).

To be clear, I am not saying that house-elves definitely /aren't/ human-like in cognition. I am simply saying there's insufficient evidence.

First, slavery isn't OK even if most slaves were happy - the mere fact that Dobby was forced to hurt himself in punishment because he was a slave and had no rights condemns the whole system. Second, there is no biological reason for the elves to be slaves - canon is clear about that. If there were one, then it would have been stated when the matter was researched in the best library of the country by Hermione. Dobby isn't some biological aberration - that's never stated anywhere. Even if the elves had a biological urge to serve, as some dipshits slavery apologists claim, that still doesn't make it OK to enslave them. They could serve people without being slaves. As Dobby proves. It's not a complex issue. Elves don't need to be slaves, so keeping them enslaved is evil - as the fate of Kreacher and Dobby in canon clearly shows to anyone who isn't drinking the "slavery fuck yeah!" kool-aid.

******************* Like I said, other factors probably determine what constitutes as a species as well. Anyways, nobody is saying it doesn't count. I'm saying that it can't be compared in relation to Muggles. If this post were about Wizarding Britain and Wizarding Britain alone, I'd be in your camp - but it isn't. You can't draw a comparison between things that don't exist. Discussing this seems to be a moot point, since neither of us are changing our opinions.

******************** If you really think "Sure, there's slavery here, but it's not humans, so it doesn't count" is ok, then yeah, you won't ever get how that is the same as claiming it's OK to enslave humans as long as they're black.

********************* Where have I ever stated that slavery is alright as long as their humans? If your implying I'm racist against black people, you'd know how incredulous that statement would be if you ever get a chance to see a picture of me. I have repeatedly stated that house elf slavery is abhorrent and I don't support it, but that's not the point here. The point is that we have no way of knowing whether Muggles would do the same if they faced another intelligent species. Slavery isn't an apt comparison at all because all slaves were humans (unless you'd like to argue that slaves are subhuman?). Honestly, your incessant strawmen and shitty trolling is exactly what puts people off fanfiction forums. Since you clearly aren't willing to budge, I don't think there's any point in continuing this discussion any further.

********************** If house-elf slavery is abhorrent, then it has to count against Wizarding Britain in a comparison. Claiming it doesn't compare because elves aren't human is as shitty as "blacks aren't white, so slavery is ok for them".

** Agree with mostly everything except for the wholesomeness part.

It's kind of a vague term, and I might be misinterpreting things but I don't really see how Wizarding society can be considered more “wholesome”

I think you're trying to describe that rural, tight knit community and closeness that we see in certain small towns (at least here in the US). Is there a good word for that?

And while Muggles are more urbanized, I don't think they lack the family relationships that Wizards have. Perhaps on average Wizards might be better, but it's not a unique thing

Wizards seem to be more in touch with nature, and I think you did a good job describing that in the Environmental part. I just don't think it fits in the wholesome category if that makes sense

We learn a lot from Ron's family, but are they a good representation of most Wizarding family? I wonder how a family like Malfoy spend their time? How would their hobbies be different?

And finally, since I can't resist..... I would love to travel to the pre-phone world of the 80s and 90s and marvel at how friendly and talkative everyone is...

People used to complain about books and TV causing poor relationships and introversion. Now it's phones and games and social media

They're not perfect and do cause issues, but people overemphasize phones while ignoring things like urbanization and cultural trends

Just my two cent, but great write up overall

Also, a big fan of your VP story! You're one of my favorite author so thanks!

Telephones causing social isolation and poor relationships as a moralising point always made me laugh - like, do people who say that know what phones do? Literally, their primary functions are all about communication. :D

** Again you're trying to make sense of something that doesn't have it by definition.

The Magical Britain is: 1. Fictional and very poorly built (even Potterverse); 2. Shown though Harry's eyes who is child and have very limited knowledge about the world. Fir example, there's no way to check that the “accurate model of galaxy” is indeed accurate and created by a wizard or not just copied from a muggle astronomy book; 3. Child friendly - for example, with the existence of Obliviation and acceptance of bullying it's likely that each girl is raped multiple times during Hogwarts years by some of upper class students.

Also you are conveniently omitting that the whole Magical Britain is just a very small muggle town. The village will be always different from a city and a lot of what you are considering “backwards” won't exist there.

Let's go through your points keeping in mind that Magical Britain is just a village.

Gender discrimination - Potterverse fiction. If Muggle and Magical societies were the same before the SoS, the attitude to women was the same too. Also the main obstacle for a woman on the career path is children. Unfortunately you either have more stay at home moms or your slowly dying society. If the Magical Britain is still alive, women there had the role similar to mundane world.

Racial discrimination - if you want to play words, you can. But it's shown that Magical Britain has a lot of prejudice against those who are different. Prejudice up to genocide.

Social mobility - nope. It's a village with just one school. Malfoy would be glad to attend another school, but he doesn't have a choice in that matter.

Economic inequality - Hogwarts is the free state school. Outside of school supplies Weasleys don't pay anything and the mundane world has a lot if similar examples. Also house and land - it's a village and there's nothing strange in it.

Healthcare - magic. Also one thought. Weasleys is the only known family with more than 2 children. I wonder why? May be wizards can't treat infertility?

Understanding of the universe - wizardwank. Yes, magic is well kept secret - if (when?) a muggle discovers magic, he or she is immediately obliviated. At the same time in general wizards know nothing about the word outside magical - Ron and telephone, Arthur and electricity, Malfoy and helicopter, etc.

Travel - magic.

Environmental friendliness and Wholesomeness - medieval village. Also you're comparing here the Magical Britain of 90s and before with the modern world - it's unfair. At that time Internet wasn't such a big thing it's right now and therefore a lot if things you are listing didn't exist.

I'll stop here.

Once again it's meaningless to compare badly written fictional and real worlds. Especially if you are biased towards the magical.
