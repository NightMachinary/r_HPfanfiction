** Well, I hate to tell you this but on FFN there are only 7 HP/WH13 crossovers, one of which is in Spanish. Of the remaining six, one is complete and all of them are short.

Sorry bro, that seems like a great crossover opportunity so I'm actually quite surprised there are so few fics of it.

**** Yeah, but I hate AO3, so I'm not even going to bother checking there. Spacebattles/Sufficient Velocity don't have anything approximating a useful way to find their fics (as far as I know), so I can't help you there either.

****** It was made I think by people from spacebattles due to some technical difficulties spacebattles was having? I don't really know.
