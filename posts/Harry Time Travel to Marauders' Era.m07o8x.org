:END:
I don't remember much details but there was this one scene in which everyone gets to go to Hogsmeade but Harry can't go because he didn't have anyone to sign the consent form so he's at Hogwarts but then feels chills and realizes that dementors are attacking Hogsmeade. And he fires off this advanced version of the patronus charm and he has three of them. That's the one detail I remember perfectly - the three patronus.. So, anyone knows this fic? It was either on FFN or AO3
