I don't REALLY want to read anything like this; but I am interested in seeing if there ARE any fics like this at all. So if you've read any opposite harem fics, please post links here. And I don't even care if it's Fanon Hermione as the main character with the harem.

** Most of the ones I have come across are with Hermione but I imagine that there are probably ones with Ginny or Luna as well.

  Hermione Granger returned to England after years abroad. Of course things have changed back home, but so has she; though Hermione didn't know just how much she was still changing. No one ever said change was easy and in her case it was downright dangerous, but at least she wouldn't be alone. Not only do drastic changes affect Hermione's life and magic, but she will also end up bound for life to another person. The question is will she be able to choose her life partner or will it be out of her hands? I posted this story on Granger Enchanted back in 2014. Thank you so much to bunnyhops for all of her lovely beta work back in the day. She rocks!This is a Hermione/Multiple Wizard story, so if that isn't your cup of tea, feel free to skip this story. As a heads up, all the wizards are Slytherin!I like to create photo collages as I write to help create a visual for the scene or chapter. I've created a folder of photos for this story on my Flickr page (MissFantastic) in case you want to see what I envision. Of course, feel free to use your own imaginations as well!

** I think I read one on either adult fanfiction or a03 that was called "The Vine Witch" that features Hermione as the protector/consort of the Black family men.

The background was pretty good and the writing/character development was actually very 'realistic' for the situation.

*** I love Delphi! :) But that's okay, I don't actually want to read a story like this. Just wanted to know if they existed at all, because male harem stories are so popular in this FANDOM.
