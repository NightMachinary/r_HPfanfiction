Sorry to post again so soon, but this is another one I've been trying to find, when I Google it only ones where he immediately finds all of the founders.

He finds each portrait individually over the course of a year, and they have been hidden by Dumbledore. One was in an alcove in the dungeons, and had been silenced.

Hufflepuff had a study with a garden and taught Harry lots about herbology, later he invited Nevilleâ€‹ to help take care of the plants.

I think Gryffindor's portrait may have been under the lake.

    Shards of light glinted off gold, and Harry gasped a little at the sight. Inside was a full-length portrait that spanned from floor to ceiling, depicting a short, skinny looking woman, around who hung a shrewd air.

    "If you've stopped staring, you can move me out," she said, her voice clipped but her tones warm.

    Harry obliged, and soon the portrait was resting against one of the walls. [[https://i.imgur.com/xjHUmeN.gif][He couldn't help but stare as he read the inscription on the base of the frame. It read: 'Helga Hufflepuff'. He blinked and gaped.]]
