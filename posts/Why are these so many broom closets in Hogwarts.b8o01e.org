Question in the title.

Whenever there is a Hogwarts fanfiction scene which involves, as brits put it, snogging, there is conveniently a broom closet near the vicinity of the people that are going to be involved in the activity. In these scenes, those broom closets are not crammed with supplies or beset with anything else so that the snogging activity could happen without intervention until the prefects check the closet.

Why would a magical school need broom closets more than one? Do house elves even need them when cleaning the school? Does Flich need more than one closet to keep his cleaning supplies? Why are they always empty? Why wouldn't student snog in unused classrooms instead (which I assume there are a lot of them since Hogwarts is a large castle)?

Or is this a problem of my lack of perspective and there had been always one or a few broom closets in the school and student always go out their way to reach them in order to snog? If so, shouldn't there be a problem of traffic or high chance of getting caught by another couple trying to find a place to snog?

All of these questions assume that students keep their flying brooms in their dorms (which I think the case in canon) and school's flying brooms are locket away in Madam Hooch's quarters.

** Maybe Hogwarts didnt have house elves at the very start. Thus broom closets /storage rooms were placed all over the place. But as magic advanced and Hogwarts grew they were not needed any longer. Therefore they are now empty.

** The prevalence of broom closets is more fanon than canon, as they're only used twice in the whole book series - once in CoS, when Harry and Ron use it to hide Crabbe and Goyle, and once in PoA, where Harry and Hermione hide after using her time-turner. And that's probably the same broom closet, as both times it's described as being off of the entrance hall. At no point in the books is a closet mentioned as a place where students hook up.

I imagine a few fic writers had characters making out (or more) in a broom closet because it's a reasonably plausible option for privacy, and it just caught on.

*** Harry's dragged into one by Skeeter as well. And from the wording of Harry's view of Umbridge "looking around as if she expected Dumbledore to emerge from a broom cupboard", it's safe to assume they aren't uncommon.

**** Ah, nice catch! I hadn't though to also look for instances of broom "cupboards" being used as well. (There's also a line in OotP where Filch "dashed to a nearby cupboard, pulled out a broom, and began swatting at the fireworks in midair," for further evidence that they weren't hard to find.) Still, fics often make heavier use of them than canon, I find.

** They probably call them broom closets as a catch-all. It's just a bunch of closets sitting around so people can get cleaning supplies without walking 3 miles through the castle.

** Hogwarts is a pretty big castle (something like 7 floors plus some towers and the underground dungeon, not to mention said floor seem already pretty massive by themselves).

It seems plausible that the castle has several "broom closet" if only to store the impressive quantity of cleaning supply needed and not force someone like the caretaker to make a half an hour walk just to go get a broom and come back to the dirty area.\\
Of course, this would apply to a "normal" place, I'm not totally convinced for Hogwarts since magic can multiply and maintain supply and house elves can teleport at will inside the castle (but then there is Flich I guess).

*** So it's convenience mostly. Doesn't require the house elves to pop all the way to the other side of the castle, relieves congestion at the main supply stores when they're cleaning all at the same time, helps to keep specialist cleaning supplies in the area where they're used and from being mixed-up (nobody wants a repeat of the cauldron-and-toilet-brush incident).

** Im thinking when the castle was constructed cleaning spells weren't a big thing maybe. So if you are thinking 1000 years ago you had servant's, maybe slaves. Instead of lugging supplies up and down 7+ floors, + dungeons, that there would be at least one "broom" closet on each floor. now depending on weather or not the founders though of plumbing some of those closets could have been for chamber pots. Cant have the students running down 7 floors to go outside and take a piss now can you?

Yeah that's how ive rationalized to myself about why there is so many hidden areas to make out and whatnot.
