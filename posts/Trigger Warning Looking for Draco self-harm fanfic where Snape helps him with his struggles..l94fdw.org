Before you answer: Even if you don't find this exact ff, it's fine. I'm 100% down to read mostly anything that has this premise so if you found the wrong ff but it has this premise then it's fine too.

It was on ff.net and I think draco also attempted suicide once or twice in it. There was this scene where Draco missed class and Snape went to look for him only to find that he'd cut his wrist and attempted suicide. If I remember right, he cut his wrist with some glass from a mirror. It probably had 20k words at the very least and I don't remember if it was complete or not which means it probably was incomplete because I usually remember when a ff was complete, even if I forgot most everything else about it.

Also, before anyone asks, I'm not going to hurt myself. I'm actually reading ff like this so that I can experience self-harm without actually self-harming. And just in case that's not enough to convince you, I haven't cut myself in over a year. I've mostly broken the habit. :)

Thank you!


** I hope you find it.. Because I want to read it ðŸ˜‚

The only fanfictions I can think of surrounding Draco and Snape involving self harm, are 'To Fly' by Waiting to be Inspired (A fic that mainly focuses on Draco's anorexia, but has a scene in it where Draco cuts himself with glass), and 'Enrobed' which is part of the Covered series by Jessingaround (a dramione fic; follows Draco's struggles with self harm, and eventually suicide).

I also totally get reading angsty fics like this as a coping mechanism x

** I don't know of a Draco fic but in "A Year Like None Other" [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072]] (sorry, don't know how to link the bot) Harry struggles with self-harm at one point and Snape and Draco are among the people who help him through it.
