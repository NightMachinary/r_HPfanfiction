So, it seems like a lot of people on here are very critical of ideas introduced in fanfiction that deviate from canon, especially those about purebloods.

So of course, in canon, the pure blood supremacists can be seen as ethnocentric, because they have 0 idea of what muggles can do, they feel the muggles are infinitely inferior because of their inability to use magic, and they want to use their magic to lord over them. Again, without really understanding them at all. They take this out on muggleborns through systemic discrimination, because they are associated with the muggle "filth" by nature of their birth.

However, I'm curious what you all think of the fanon idea that the reason purebloods hate muggleborns, is because muggleborns waltz into the Wizarding world thinking it will be just like the muggle world, plus magic, and then say that the Wizards are doing everything wrong, and the wizarding world needs to "catch up". They don't bother learning the culture, traditions, religion, reasoning, etc, of the wizarding world, and of course learning the history is quite impossible, with Binns teaching.

Therefore, they see the wizarding world looking a lot like medieval Europe, and come to the conclusion that they haven't made any progress since that time. Some muggleborns may even think that, having access to the vast advancements and superiority of the muggle world, they should 'catch them up'. The purebloods in these fics naturally take offence and see the muggleborns as ethnocentric, offensive, and ignorant.

In some fics, this is rather well-explained and world-built. However, it naturally requires a divergence from canon, since it seems JKR actually does consider wizards to be 'behind' the muggle world, or at least no explanations are offered to the contrary. For this reason, I can completely see some people writing it off as "pureblood apologist nonsense being made up to excuse bigotry".

What do you think?


** The best "justification" I've found is humanity's historical hatred for the magical. Wizards and witches are burned and persecuted. Several magical creatures are hunted, hated, or reduced to something to be domesticated. I mean if I was a wizard I'd dislike normal people because if they found out, holy shit, I'd be attacked without doubt.

I don't think that's a real great justification though.

*** Another potentially interesting clashing point would come from the muggleborn side of things, best summed up as 'they've had the power to rewrite the universe for millenia, so how come I am still stuck going to school on the same planet?'

Basically, the expectations muggleborn have when confronted with a magical society fall quite short of the reality of the situation. The dumber ones don't hide it well enough, which leads to problems with the more traditionalist purebloods who get angry about alien immigrants bitching about the shortcomings of a society their ancestors spent their lives building and improving.

It's a matter of perspective here: 'where's the spaceport, I want to take a vacation in the Andromeda cluster' would be my first reaction to finding out a magical society full of /fucking wizards/ exists.

From the magical side of things, however, it's a magical world where any chump with the power and/or knowledge to do so can, with little to no buildup, pretty much ruin magical society. Where there's a huge variety of sapient species... all competing for a very limited amount of space. Basically, it's a hilariously unstable civilisation that takes massive amounts of time and effort to keep afloat. So when a bunch of English-speaking foreigners barge in and act all pouty anout how backwards wizarding society is when it's a miracle that there's a society that has survived this long at all, well... it leads to problems.

***** There's also a case to be made for there having been ethnocentric muggleborn enclaves in the past, too, what with the number of places in canon that, far from the isolationist tendencies displayed by places like Hogsmeade, Hogwarts and Malfoy Manor, went the other way and installed themselves within or on the fringes of muggle communities.

How those enclaves came about, what happened to them and how they eventually either disintegrated or switched from hosting muggleborns to becoming a pureblood's disneyland is anyone's guess. However, I do believe that Ottery St Catchpole can be seen as such a former enclave.

The Lovegoods, the Weasleys and the Diggorys all live a stone's throw away from a town in Devon. They don't need to, given that distance is irrelevant in a world of apparition, portkeys and buses that break the sound barrier and that electricity, gas, water or sewage infrastructure is simply not a concern for such a house. The Burrow could be located on the moon for all the difference it would make. So why do they live there?

The same question can be asked of Godric's Hollow, too. That's not even considering London, with the Ministry, the Black Manor and Diagon Alley hogging the nooks and crannies of one of the most densely populated cities in Europe-if not the world.

Other countries, if they put more effort into keeping their world hidden than paying the Obliviators overtime, must be shitting themselves whenever they imagine just how close the British Wizarding World is to one of the biggest tourist destinations on the planet-and that's not even considering the fucking absurd number of CCTV systems in use there.

It's a ticking time bomb as far as I can see. One wrong move by a drunken idiot being kicked out of the leaky cauldron could potentially end up on youtube for the world to see-effectively nixing the Statute at the worst possible time, as is the nature of such things.

So why take the risk?

****** Which is where Dark Lords come into play. A Dark Lord makes for the perfect proxy-loud, dangerous and divisive, the enemy nation will be too preoccupied with fighting this latest threat to actually counter your other plans. If they lose, well there are plenty of prospective Dark Wizards that can be trained, funded and equipped to pick up the slack. If they win, you get either a puppet in charge of what's left of your enemy's government or someone running your enemy country whose beliefs will wreck what little power that country had maintained through the civil war.

Or you could completely screw up and end up with a Dark Lord being best buds with their mate Hitler, but such situations can be happily avoided through the judicious use of common bloody sense-and making sure you pick people who /didn't/ play 'what would I do as an evil overlord' with Albus goddamn Dumbledore.

******** No, my pet theory on this one is that Grindelwald was actually a joint project between the German and English Wizarding governments.

Unlike their muggle counterparts, German wizards had taken full advantage of the fall of louis 16th to begin expanding into territories formerly occupied by french magical forces. By the time Napoleon Bonaparte steamrolled central Europe, the various tiny nations, duchies, kingdoms etc that had yet to be united by the Prussians into the second Reich had close to zero trained magicals on hand to defend against the onrush of a freshly reunited and incredibly pissed of Grande Armee Surnaturelle.

After Napoleon's spectacular failure at Waterloo, it became quite clear that the man had done the seemingly impossible and had gotten the French magical community to fight for him rather than with him. Though the effect on the outcome of normal army-to-army battles could be summed up as jack and shit, magical battles were an entirely different story. Everyone that opposed them, from the chief warlock of the brits to Vlad Tepes, commander in chief of the carpathian defence forces, got minced when the innocuous-looking muggle cannons everonr thought the French magical forces were using as some kind of ubiquitous decoration piece, opened fire with hollow shot filled to the brim with very nasty potions, cursed grapeshot and chainshot enchanted to act like a cursed bludger. And those were the milder surprises they came up with.

Hence the german wizards dying like chumps at home while there's mass panic in the magical colonies to the tune of 'nope, not getting involved in that. '

History ensues and Wellington becomes a popular choice of footwear. The prussians make the french army their bitch and basically unite Germany on their way back home. Once they get there, the find a bunch of zauberer waiting for them to say sorry for the delay.

At the end of the 19th century, the situation in the magical world was just as dire as it would become in muggle one. Magical Britain and magical Germany were both best buds after napoleon and were on the verge of signing a mutual defence pact by that stage.

In order to cement the alliance, they decided that their two most promising radicals would do to the muggles what Napoleon did to the magicals-unite them into a fighting force that would ensure that the magical colonies and their muggle counterparts remained under their rule whilst keeping any silly muggle squabbling like that whole business at the dtart of the 1870's in check.

Those radicals? Albus dumbledore, touted as the founders' equal in mind and magic and Gellert Grindelwald, the wizarding version of a mad scientist and budding evil overlord.

Cue world war one.

Afterwards, the magical community of Germany and every single muggleborn in Western Europe had either fled for America or died in the trenches.

Grindelwald and Dumbledore had fallen out somehow and gellert'd left for darker pastures. The whole initiative was abandoned but had, unwittingly, already been a partial success. For gellert stopped in vienna and gave a random hobo some advice.

So when Hitler came to power and asked for Gellert by name, the up-and-coming Dark Lord obliged him only to find a familiar face standing there. And thus, a friendship made in hell was born.

****** People set to be executed were not allowed personal items and usually spent a great deal of time in prison first. During that process they were stripped and dressed in simple, humiliating clothing (or nothing at all). Sometimes they were hung (and killed this way) before their bodies were burned, sometimes not. Those hung first were usually guilty of some secular crime, like treason.

The Knights Templar who were killed in this way, for example, were said to have been stripped naked (or to their underwear) and burned alive. Heretics usually received this sort of treatment, though these were usually men. /Male/ witches would have been burned this way, at least, and female witches would have been stripped and dressed in different clothing long before the fires were lit.

** This is not a novel idea and has been explored in many fanfics. However, as you say, it's distinctly non-canon. The biggest problem with it is that there is absolutely no indication that Muggleborns are at all critical of the wizarding world. Hermione, for example, has adapted so completely to the wizarding world that she's perfectly happy to change her parents' memories.

In complement to this, there's no indication that Muggleborns face active discrimination (pre-Voldemort's Ministry). Anti-Muggleborn beliefs are generally considered a thing of the past: the reaction of most wizards to the word "mudblood" is analogous to how Muggles react to the N-word, and a Muggleborn has held the highest political office.

Like the real world, the discrimination Muggleborns face is likely entrenched discrimination. Wizards don't see a Muggleborn and think "I can't give them this job because they're a Muggleborn". Rather, it's that non-Muggleborns have intangible advantages (aka privilege) such as family connections that help them get a foot in the door, etc.

The whole point of "bloodism" is that it's analogous to the forms of discrimination in the Muggle world, so it's not surprising that they mirror each other closely in this way.

In the end, pureblood philosophy is a form of irrational bigotry, something hardly unique to the magical world. Giving it any kind of reasonableness undermines that very important theme. Voldemort is /not/ a political revolutionary: he doesn't have a vision for the world that is based on some twisted but essentially rational philosophy. /Grindelwald/ was that villain, with his utilitarian philosophy of wizard rule for the Muggles' own good.

Voldemort, by contrast, is all about his own power and hate. There is a reason why Voldemort is known as "the Dark Lord", whereas Grindelwald is called a dark wizard. Even though they had comparable skill with magic, Voldemort's ambitions are fundamentally darker and more mythical. Grindelwald, for all his evil acts, never sought to be more than a powerful man -- he didn't make horcruxes, and accepted death when it came to him. Voldemort doesn't want to be a man; he wants to be a godlike figure who surpasses his humanity and reigns as Lord for all eternity.

*** I'd like to point out first Hermione's rather dismissive comment in first year that wizards are lacking in logic, and therefore she as an eleven year old girl is better than most wizards who would, in her opinion, not be able to figure out the logic puzzle with the potions. Then I'd like to point out SPEW, and the legends about brownies that house elves are based off of. I seem to recall them turning into gremlins or something like that if they get paid, in a mythology I can't quite remember now. Either way, crusader coming in to "fix" how things are done.

It's interesting what you said about a muggleborn minister of magic, I seem to have missed that. I'll wiki it, thank you.

About the blood prejudice reflecting real world prejudice, and an important moral being lost if it is excused, I can see kind of what you mean about that, but I disagree... I don't think anything should be held so sacred that fanon authors can't have their own interpretation. I've read fanfictions that take Fudge and Umbridge and explore their motivations, instead of making them cardboard cutouts of an idiot and a psycho. I thought it was fantastic, and I think the same can be done for purebloods. It's interesting to me, the fics that consider /why/ something might happen, and that just maybe it has an understandable reason for happening that we can't see.

Voldemort is a fascinating subject. There are a bunch of different interpretations of him - has he gone crazy, has he always been crazy, is his agenda misunderstood, have his plans changed over time.... I think that, in canon, Voldemort/Tom Riddle did not meet /one single/ human being in his life who was good to him or good for him. I wouldn't be surprised if he was ashamed to be human, and share a species with the same blind selfish assholes who shunned and abandoned him, but later fell under his influence because he was pretty and said nice things. I think both his desire to surpass humanity and his desire to punish, torture, or kill everyone else, are perfectly understandable. His entire life story is just really really sad.

In general, there appear to be very good reasons why wizards don't have logic. Logic is based on the idea of non-contradiction, but magic allows contradictory states of affairs to coexist. When it comes to magic, Muggle logic needs some significant modification...

I mean, he can be as crazy or evil as you want, but he was presented as an absolute genius and incredibly powerful wizard in canon (at least in his younger years).

On the house elves, the only example we have of her being right is Dobby. The other three elves we see; Winky, Kreacher, and Hokey, love their families, even if Kreacher can't stand Sirius /because he goes against the values of his mother, the person Kreacher loved and respected most/. Winky falls into depression and alcoholism and rushes into another job at Hogwarts upon being "emancipated from slavery". And the other elves want nothing to do with Hermione's hats. Besides, what if she succeeded with her hats? Would the Hogwarts elves end up with their lives in ruins like Winky?

******* But where does it say they are being indoctrinated? They are magically bound to their families, which I can understand as being tetchy on the one hand, because house elves like Dobby and Kreacher should be free to work for whoever they want (in their case, they'd probably want to switch) but on the other hand, with the amount of shit they have on their owners, I can see how it would be an absolute disaster if they were free to go. Politically, economically, and socially, their secrets could destroy the wizards who owned them.

Mythologically, however, house elves are based off of brownies and hobs. I think the brownies work in houses and the hobs work in barns or stables, /regardless/ of what the people in the house want. Now, those are, in the stories, muggle houses. I can see that brownies and hobs work in houses because that's what they /do/, kind of like beavers build dams because that's what they do. Wizards see them, realise they pose a danger to them, and bind them to only be able to work in a specific household in order to not spout off at the mouth about everything that goes on in that house. Is that not as good as being able to work in whatever house they want? Yes. Should abusive masters like Malfoy who force their elves to punish themselves be held accountable? Definitely. Would house elves rather be free? Well, free and doing what?

What matters is that they are fully sentient. They're capable of having desires and ambitions, they can love and hate, they can feel pain, /they can learn things and are capable of change/. With these things taken into account, to enslave them is still wrong, /even if they have some magical predisposition to work/.

If elves want to work, let them work. But you can't enslave them and trade them like chattel. In doing so you prevent them ever even having the potential to choose. Even if that choice were a foregone conclusion in 99% of cases, it's still a vital moral imperative to allow them that choice.

Further, given that elves have the ability to learn and change in response to what they learn, I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that they will always choose to work on the basis of some biological desire for work. Given sufficient freedom and access to education, they may well defy their biology and choose otherwise -- much as humans do.

2.) Every time someone else is TOLD what's best for them, it makes me so furious. Like, seriously, violent tendencies stir beneath my surface when someone says /I'll save them even if they don't want to be saved/ or /they don't know what they want/ or /they don't know what's good for them/. That's you excerting power over someone else. That's you doing the same exact thing as those "enslaving" the house elves - taking away their /choice/.

You can say they've been "indoctrinated" all you want, but all you can see is that they don't agree with you, they don't share your values, therefore they must have been brainwashed and enslaved.

*They're a different species!* Literally, not a different race, religion, skin colour, blood status, lack of magic, etc, they are literally not human. They're like aliens.

Yes, they are sentient. As sentient beings, they should have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

But what that means for them has every chance of being /different/ of what it means for you, and by saying that they have been brainwashed and are unable to choose, you're devaluing them just as much as their owners, possibly more depending on the truths of the world we're in (since it wasn't exhaustively explained in canon, only implied).

Also, what is education if not indoctrination? Students learn whatever the teacher teaches. If that is that the world is flat and two thousand years old, then that's what students learn and take as facts, off of which they base the rest of their decisions. Since this would presumably be education TO house elves BY well-meaning wizards (and witches) like Hermione, who presumably know as much about house elf history, culture, physiology, magic, etc, as we know about the Martians, they may as well be being taught that the world is flat and two thousand years old.

I think you'd agree with me that you can't come to a developing country, give them techy shit, and tell them what they should or shouldn't do with their lives. You don't have a "white man's burden". What you should do is allow those people access to the tools they need to form their own civil society (which our own structures are usually standing in the way of, since we benefit from exploiting them).

The problem with house elves, though, is that they, for some reason, need to live in the houses of people and keep them clean. I don't know why, I don't know about their history, culture, physiology, etc. But back when they did have the choice, *they chose to work in houses*. You'd agree that muggles had no ability to enslave them, right? They couldn't even see them most of the time! But, they /still/ chose to work in muggle houses! Why? No idea! I don't know enough about house elves to say, *that's up to the individual author of whichever fic we are reading at the time.*

The thing is, wizards could see them, and house elves posed a *danger* to wizarding security. So they had two options. One, they could kick them out of their houses and ward against them. But the house elves provide free cleaning, which wizards don't like to do, and therefore benefit from. So the other option is to take measures to prevent the house elves from ever spilling the secrets they discover. The second sounds like a win-win. So they make an arrangement.

That may have been at some point centuries in the past. House elves may have evolved to the point where they've forgotten about it. Or the agreement may be repeated every time a new house elf comes into existence - I don't see any evidence in canon or in mythology that house elves are being "traded". It may be as simple as "swear an oath that you'll obey everything I say as your master, or leave". It may be a more protracted formal agreement. Dobby may have agreed when he was very young to serve the Malfoys, and changed his mind later on. Just like Regulus. Or maybe it started out as a mutually beneficial arrangement, but the wizards forgot why the house elves were there and began taking them for granted and as inferior, weak servants, instead of symbiotic partners.

The point is, *we* don't know, /Hermione/ didn't know, she barged in and tried freeing elves when she knew shit about it because she thought her ideas and values were more valid than anyone else's ideas or values (and really, the only person providing a counter argument to her was Ron, and all he managed was "they like it!" because he didn't really /care/ or bother to think about it), and that anytime someone says they know /better/ than the person they're deciding for, I get the intense urge to punch them in the face.

But don't worry, I won't, I promise ='(

** My interpretation of this problem is simple: both sides have differing tech trees-that is, different methods and capabilities by which they improve upon their situations via the levering of knowledge.

Let's clarify:

How wizards would see the difference between the muggle and magical world-and how that ties into modern blood purism.

The muggle world relies heavily upon large-scale infrastructure to deliver modern conveniences. Electricity, gas, television, cars, phones, computer networks are all widely in use only because they have the infrastructure to back them up. In the muggle world, science, planning, engineering and maintenance requirements all have to be worked out and implemented in advance long before the relevant technology that uses whatever is being delivered to power/provide content for/regulate the tech is adopted on a wide scale. Similarly, technologies are leveraged by turning widely adopted systems as platforms for additional utility. For example, while the TV used to be a receiver with a set amount of channels available, it steadily evolved into a fully integrated entertainment system capable of interfacing with cassette players, cd players, dvd players, the internet, gaming consoles, computers, usb systems etc.

There are hard limits on what technologies are achievable/capable of being produced at costs lower than their potential returns. In the case of mechanical systems, these limits are imposed by the materials available and the underlying mechanics. A car, for example, cannot go faster than the speed of light. I think that mach 2 is the current record-achieved on a completely flat plane with a motor that doubles as a jet engine.

So, in order for muggles to advance their capabilities, they need to push the limits of what is possible given their available knowledge, materials and less finite resources like manpower-and money.

Science, which is basically the push by muggles to understand the underlying forces of the universe (with engineering acting as the study of how to twist/exploit/obey said forces for fun & profit) is the key to this effort-by advancing their understanding of the universe, muggles figure out what can and cannot work and then compare the results to their current systems. If anything can be made significantly better using this new understanding, they'll eventually get around to improving upon it. It's a lot more complicated than that, since muggles have this principle they call 'design' that can actually improve upon things by quite a lot if done correctly without requiring correspondingly massive leaps in science. It won't always work, but it can sometimes.

So take it from a muggle perspective-their world is one of limits, obstacles they have to constantly and consistently overcome in order to move forward. Be it science, be it work, be it government, be it the environment, their world is a constant stream of problems requiring solutions. These problems also help elevate them-each obstacle overcome gives the muggle world more solutions to yet other problems. On the other side of things, the penalties of failing to adress problems spur muggles on to do better next time should they make it through the ordeal intact.

This may sound arduous to wizards, but it's the simple truth in the muggle world. If you want something to work, you have to make sure you do things right. Get things wrong and it won't work. The harder the problem, the longer it takes to fix it. The longer it takes, the more effort and cost is involved. Simple, but not easy.

However, this world of rules and limits also makes it easy to see just how well any effort is going. Wealth, knowledge, success, happiness, while not easily measured, make getting a snapshot of how a muggle population is doing in relation to its neighbors easy. Muggle governments regularly issue releases detailing the various ways in which their societies have measured up against global standards of success. You can trace the frantic pace of their trade through financial market figures that are on instant and public access throughout the world. The capabilities modern muggles possess would have astonished our forebearers, if not even ourselves at times.

Muggles have, in the past century, developed many methods of instantaneous communications systems. They have built machines capable of going into space. They have made wireless that can transmit images (the aforementioned tv) and built electrical difference engines that can talk to each other. They have gone from horse and carriage to motor cars, steam locomotives to commercial jets and are starting to build their own mechanical house elves. If you are curious, the muggles call them roombas. They are quite dumb, but it's the thought that counts.

Of course, with such advances there is little doubt that the consequences of conflicts has become much direr as well. If you wish for any details on this matter, contact the muggle liaison committee about a muggleborn's report on world war 2. It will prove very enlightening to those of you out there who believe muggles to be powerless, harmless or stupid.

Then you have us wizards.

We have few, if any, restrictions on what our magic can and cannot do. Gamp's law and the requirements for potions-brewing are some of the few areas of magic that are nigh impossible to find loopholes for.

Similarly, we don't necessarily need anything apart from our wand and our wits. With the right spell, /anything/ can be achieved, up to and including time travel-though I would advise against trying any of the spells that enable you to do so. There is a reason most ministries rely on time turners, time portals, time rifts and time machines to travel through it. The slightest error and you may find yourself splattered across the universes which, according to the house elves, is a right pain to clean.

And, because if you don't believe that a spell will work, then /of course it won't/. Belief is extremely important in magic, mayhap more important than your wand. After all, wandless magic is not unheard of. Faithless magic, on the other hand, isn't. As a consequence, many of us wizards and witches have to suspend our disbelief at least twice a day in order to make a spell work. After a while, you tend to leave your disbelief switched off.

And, whereas in the muggle world, wear, tear and the neverending march of progress results in radical changes to occur on a regular basis, the magical world's greatest changes often happen without any outward changes in behavior, scenery or equipment. Strictly speaking, wizards don't /need/ infrastructure at all. The only reason we use it in the first place is because we are, well, impatient and don't want to waste our concentration on lighting candles or some such willy nilly.

Our world is one where knowledge is sacrosanct, /the/ enabler that gives us the keys to powers only dreamt of by muggles. Our imagination is the only limit though, mind you, the more radical imaginations out there are, understandably, rather unintelligible when asked about their take on this subject.

Now take this from a muggle's perspective: here is a world in which no new products, systems or buildings have appeared in the past century, where nothing makes any logical sense, people believe in, what is at first glance, nonsense and where absolutely everything muggle civilisations have ever achieved is automatically dismissed as muggle rubbish since, to a wizard, the original spell conferring a wand user with a similar ability is almost always close to a thousand years old and horrendously outdated.

Is it any wonder, ladies and gentlemen, considering the differences between our two societies, that muggles consider us barbaric when every indicator they possess suggests we, by their social, economic and technological standards, are horrendously behind the times?

Is it any wonder, then, that blood purism is still seen as relevant today when muggleborn come in here and act like such muggles would until they find out /why/ things are as such? That the first exposure of wizard-raised to muggle-raised tends to end with both sides seeing the other as savage ignoramuses in dire need of an education?

It is simply the same problem that has plagued us wizards since the dawn of our world, the arrogant pride of denizens from two civilisations refusing to acknowledge the other as equals happening over and over again.

Is it anyone's fault? Perhaps not, but it's a problem muggles probably have a solution for and one that we probably have knowledge for that can solve this problem once and for all, for the sake of both our worlds.

Both sides have much to learn from the other. So let's start.

Welcome to your seventh year muggle studies classes. I am professor insert-non-hyphenated-name-here and, as you may have noticed, we are bringing in some /changes/ to the syllabus as of this year. By the end of it, you will be holding your NEWT practicals in downtown muggle London, where you will be graded upon the number of interactions with muggles versus the number of times said muggles started laughing in your face. You fail that aspect of the test, then I am sorry to say that the best you can expect is a D in your NEWTs scores.

Now then, to business. Who was your teacher last year and who amongst you deigned to open your textbook during the summer?

** I've seen pretty bad stories around this. Some write about "traditions" of purebloods like Samhain and throw it into a Light vs Dark debate that involves Dumbledore killing traditions by forcing Hogwarts to celebrate Christmas and not having etiquette classes. These stories also use nobility/Lords and don't just write about a pureblood-elitist society but glorify it. Even crazier ones involve the Ministry/Voldemort kidnapping Muggleborns to be adopted (or blood-adopted) into pureblood families.

I would love to see a good fic exploring the conflict between purebloods and Muggleborns.

*** That's good to hear. It isn't that I am 'up for a spot of muggle torture' but I just dislike that one side is completey evil, wrong, backwards, bigoted etc. So I have found myself looking from the other side to try and figure what tweaks or missing/unmentioned additions could round out the Dark and Pureblood leaning side of things. I realize canon doesn't leave any leeway but taking a step back or trying to make real the setting requires more than we are given in canon otherwise it is laughable and +unrealistic+ internally inconsistent IMO. Even if one side /is/ 100% right I think the other side deserves a fair shake.

(pro writing tip-not to you but so many published authors still do this :/- don't fucking preach if you are are keen on one particular issue or fall into one political theatre or religion then leave it out or make damn sure you work hard to give the side you oppose as legitimate as possible).

**** I agree, I find the idea of a pure and evil/dark faction... rather impossible. Very few, if any, people wake up and say "I'm gonna be evil". It's usually more along the lines of "I want this and that because <reasons>."

Stories with a good protagonist and an evil vile horribly dark opposition should be read as propaganda. (We won the war, we wrote history. Of course we were the good guys and never did any of this horrible stuff that the losers/villains did.)

*** You know, I think maybe you've given me the best new points to consider, the ones everyone seems to have missed. 200 years ago, muggleborns coming into the wizarding world would have come with stars in their eyes, cos holy Jesus who knew life could be this good.

So... Is it possible that the current kind of blood supremacy started when the muggleborns started coming in and going "lol wtf what is this we had this like 500 years ago we have machines now what". I mean, Salazar didn't want to teach muggleborns, but that could be explained away in several ways.... Off the top of my head I can think of 1.) Christianity; 2.) a security risk (as you've pointed out, the statute of secrecy is taken very seriously), or 3.) modern wizards putting words into Salazar's mouth (often comes up in fanfic when people say that what Salazar really meant was twisted around through history, usually involving the basilisk). I'll have to check the HP wiki to see if it says anything about the platform of previous dark lords, and what they said about muggleborns.

Also, I thought the thing with Dumbledore's father was that he didn't bring up the part about the boys attacking Ariana and ruining her magic? I mean, I might be hallucinating, but I always thought for some reason he didn't mount a defence. And you're right about the intermarriage being supported is really weird considering the laws. Can't just obliviate a husband or wife, and of course they usually tell them eventually, and sometimes they end up leaving, which is again a breach of the statute....

***** I wrote so much to answer this x_x and Safari crashed ='( basically I agree with everything you say. Well, I wanted to ask you a question, so let's see how much I remember.

If I remember correctly all the way back from September, when the Britons were in control of the Britannic Isles, the shamans and priests were like.... Absolute top of the social pyramid. When the Romans came I think whoever sucked up the most was in power, but when the Anglo-Saxons piled in, whoever was the strongest had the power. And what can witches and wizards be if not the strongest? The same with the Vikings - power to the strongest. Also, Odin and his eye, sounds to me like a sacrificial ritual that would be a one-way ticket to Azkaban in the modern day. Also, hedgewitches and cunning folk were extremely important to the health and well-being of the community. But when the Anglo-Normans came in, with their fancy French "culture" and "civilisation", the law took that position of upholding health and safety. There were no more warrior bands, there were armies. And they came with the idea that God said magic is demonic (which, unfortunately, he did) and that witches should be burned (which he never said once in anyone's life and is completely the opposite of what he told everyone to do, but why not only listen to rules when they benefit you?

So the statute of secrecy is implemented ,and we have very unsatisfied community of witches and wizards who were at the top and now not only have to cower in fear before people infinitely weaker than they are, but also they are punished by their own government if they try to defend themselves. Recipe for extremism? Ohh yes.

So what I wanted to ask you, is whether you have any ideas on how it could have been handled better. Whether it's from the time the Christian missionaries came, from the time the Normans came, from the time the Statute was implemented, from the time of Grindelwald or Voldemort or the modern day, whenever you have ideas for. What could have been changed to eliminate the inherent tension caused by the statute? Because your ideas are awesome and you write even more than me ;0 <3 <3 <3

******* You know, whenever I hear the Dark Lord talking about switching muggleborns with squibs, it makes me think of the stories of Changelings, where, if I remember correctly, muggles believed elves had replaced the muggle's sweet, fat baby with a creepy magical mischievous elvin monster that they didn't feel like going to the trouble of raising so they pawned it off on the poor human parents. I feel like this sounds a lot like a folktale description of muggleborns might, especially by someone like Petunia. If that's what medieval parents thought of their muggleborn children (since we don't have any evidence of so-called royal elves, or of them pawning off their babies on muggles) then it would probably (definitely) be a blessing to switch them, both for the muggleborns (who would be accused neither of being elves, nor of being servants of satan) and for squibs (who wouldn't have to look at everyone performing levitation charms and cleaning charms and warming charms and thinking fuck, I wish I could do that.) The unplottable/segregated locations is also a good idea (although I don't think the Malfoys are the only death eaters with a big mansion, though they're probably the only ones who are comfortable enough in their own bank account to have albino peacocks as pets without fear of being called gauche) and one that is probably already being utilised. A lot of people write fics worrying about how the muggles are expanding, but I feel like you're right that it wouldn't be so hard to get them to move. The muggles could call it 'gentrification' before promptly forgetting the place existed, and the muggle repelling wards could stretch further than necessary to avoid speculative development. The major problem would be a way to fool Google maps.... The only fic I've read that addresses this is Xerosis, and tbh I'm really not too happy with the solution that fic came up with. Or the ending in general. I always thought unplottable meant literally unplottable like Google maps has no chance, but for the areas protected only by muggle-repelling wards, it might be a problem. Maybe that's why wizards live so close to muggles, because when muggles see a place they think they own, they don't feel tempted to go take it. Alternately, they could kick everyone out of Russia and set up isolationist borders, which I think not too many muggles would find a surprise (although Syria would be deeply fucked, which would be sad, but of course I doubt the Wizards would care) I think Russia is the largest amount of land with the smallest concentrations of people, and of course wizards can utilise all of it to the fullest, thanks to Magic.

Well, that post was very rambling..... But thank you for your reply ;D

******** glad to hear back and that it wasn't 100% useless. I did read a fic recently that had (I think it was a minor mention) said the radioactive chernobyl was a cover for a wizarding nation/city of some sort.

I haven't read into unplottable but I probably should as it always confused me that Hogwarts is unplottable but is right next to the largest concentration of wizarding kind in britain/only magic only village and so I am not sure what that really is supposed to mean. Obviously it won't show up on maps, but neither does Hogsmeade which isn't unplottable and it appears as an old castle ruin to muggles so it can in fact be seen by anybody. Durmstrangs unplottable I can picture where who knows where it is, even what country, in mountains by river, next to ocean or sea- people can't find it (muggle or magical in my mind).

I've never put much thought into the whole changeling thing but by happenstance a similar type situation cropped up in my head for the -ever in progress world building but not actually writing story- so I can see that working. Ddoesn't even have to be squibs, which I hadn't thought of before either, they could just take muggle orphans- who they may even of had a hand in making orphans- and replace the muggleborns with them. Though I am not sure at what time period mind alteration and concealment spells were advanced enough to pull this off routinely (given that muggleborns aren't going to show any signs, typically, until several years old). which makes me think...

ALSO going back to the older posts- I can very much see purebloods being resentful of muggleborns due to the difficulty this causes. At least historically (maybe not since 1900s/mid to late 1800's). Muggleborns start doing magic- either goes undetected (ie no nation wind tracking system- which I don't even want to think about the whole trace/down for birth etc.) or it is detected. If undetected then rumors/information of wizarding kind spreads, fear is spread, muggleborn may or not have life in danger- may just learn to control it or harness it in potions/poultices for who knows how many years and may result in burnings or being run out etc. This is all bad bad bad. Then if his/her presence is made aware later to wizarding kind then they have some untrained and unknown magic user (I mean think of trusting your world to a complete stranger, or trusting a foreign doctor who holds no degree etc.). If muggleborn is detected then if you leave them- problems follow, or you expose your world to at least two muggles. The alternative being removing the child (and possibly replacing with squib or other baby) if removing then you now have to cover the expense of that child- whether as a wizards council, ministry, or a single family. So anyway you cut it just the very existence of muggleborns, despite being magical, causes all sorts of problems for purebloods. That and their obvious link to muggles (whether removed from family or not) and I can see the disdain/resentment of muggleborns (/attending Hogwarts)...... Of course if you go back far enough to the founders time then what was the muggle and wizard interaction like? Godric had a sword and there was goblin made armour- would it not stand to reason that muggleborns that went undetected, or even those who were trained by other wizards/witches would then sort of defect or align/sell their services to muggles. Sort of like how Malfoys patriarch might have aligned himself with William the Conqueror but this is seen as above board where muggleborns from Salazars time aligning with muggles lords/rulers fighting the king/a lord who has the backing of the wizards council is bad form.

Well that's your longer than needed, and not at all requested, rambling response for the day :P

********* Hmm, I think the Malfoys aligning themselves with William the Conqueror is seen as perfectly acceptable because 1.) the Malfoys are French, 2.) William the Conqueror is French. I feel like the Malfoys came to England as part of an invading army, so they weren't really selling out their own wizarding community. Whereas, muggleborns aligning themselves with muggles are seen as selling out their new community. It's really complicated because on the one hand, blood and kinship was /extremely/ important back then, but on the other hand, there was always a complex struggle of figuring out which ties were strongest and which ties to honour first. Throwing in the magical world, now you have feudal ties, blood ties, marriage ties, adoption/sponsorship ties, magical ability ties, species ties (for magical creatures like vampires/werewolves), location ties...... Say you live in Lancaster, and you have an uncle in Yorkshire that you've never seen, but was your father's favourite brother. And that uncle's son (your cousin), kills your neighbour's wife. Say your neighbour has lived next to you your whole life. Now the neighbour forms a party to exact blood vengeance from your cousin. Who do you support? Now say both of you were magical and your neighbour wasn't? Or say all three of you were magical, but you and the neighbour were both werewolves? Or what if he didn't live in Yorkshire, but in Glasgow? Or worse, Dublin? Who do you support?

So yeah, loyalty ties in that time period were very complicated. A lot of fanfic expands the Malfoy example to say that in pureblood society, blood ties are supposed to be above all else. So purebloods could value their family above all, but they would come to muggleborns and say you should place more value on your new culture than on your family. Seems like a cause for tension right there. Today, there's less emphasis on loyalty ties like that, personally I think they're much more fluid and less binding (and definitely less dangerous). But I think the tension and resentment could easily have continued on.

Personally, I think Godric just had armour and a sword because he was a "hero" and liked to get involved in a lot of shit. He personally might need it, I don't think it's indicative of any full-scale armed conflict between purebloods and muggleborns, or wizards and muggles, or anything like that.

I think magic developed differently than technology. Headcanon-wise, I think magic started out extremely powerful, but difficult as all hell, and as it progressed it became less powerful and less showy, more formal and structured, but also easier to use and learn, and faster to pop out. Canon-wise, obviously we have no idea, but I think wizards would have been able to catch a muggleborn's first sign of accidental magic even back in the time of the founders, and /definitely/ today. I think before the 1600s the world's population hovered nicely around 1bil? So it would have been an absolute cakewalk to monitor such levels of the population. After the pre-industrial population boom, I think they would have had some trouble catching up, but I think they would've got that infrastructure set up eventually. My evidence for this is basically the Trace ^{^{"}} but also, it just seems something completely possible, if they actually wanted to. As for your comments about purebloods resenting muggleborns for the shit they put them through, I think you're spot on. I can just imagine, Wizengamot 1450: "/This/ is what they're spending our tax dollars on??!!!"

I'm not sure purposeful orphan-making would ever actually get state-sanctioned, but life was hard enough back then. Parents usually had a boatload of children, and babies died all the time. If there weren't enough squibs, parents could simply believe their child "died in the night". As we can see in the Evans family, magic doesn't pop up in every sibling, and even if it did, the couple would just believed they were cursed and burn some poor widow at the stake whose laundry they'd accidentally dropped into the dirt one day ten years ago, so she /must/ hold a grudge.

I would never want to live in Chernobyl, but it's an interesting idea. I also just realised - how bout Atlantis? I mean, if other fanfic authors can move the wizarding population to the moon.... I'm scared of deep water but it would be a fun idea to explore :D

As for Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, and Durmstrang, I always thought Durmstrang was the only one truly unplottable out of all of them? Cos I thought when a location is truly unplottable, it's actually impossible to know where exactly it is, you just know the general area. If you keep walking in a straight line or even a search grid in an area, you would never find it, even with magic, because it pushes the boundaries of physically existing. Hogwarts, I thought, is in a set place, it just has some serious muggle repelling wards and other protections on it, which include projecting an illusion. I think that's a terrible illusion though, cos hey, I'd definitely want to explore the ruins of an abandoned castle.

Also, thank you for your reply, and for being patient! I moved to Germany on Sunday, and I had basically 0 internet connection all week except when I'd go hang out in McDonald's to bum their wifi. Very trying time in my life x__x and it's snowing, ew, why can't I live in Hawaii TT_TT

Anyways, most of that was totally unnecessary ^{^{"}} but I hope you find something in my long disorganised information-dump useful ;0 and I feel you on the world-building but never writing. For me it's plotting and outlining but never writing

*********** Ohh no, you shouldn't keep your bed waiting ;D it loves you truly.

Thank you for writing all that ;0 I had a bit of a hard time following it, but I think I understood the general points?

So, the first thing I want to do is say your ideas about how the curse on the DA position came about are fantastic. The promise was broken, allowing the position to be cursed. It's very similar to what I believe happened in the case of Lily - Voldemort told Snape he'd spare her, he offered to her to stand aside, but he got impatient, and he AK'd her before she verbally rejected his offer - causing magic to put that protection he promised her onto Harry. Of course, there's room in my headcanon for Lily to have invoked some kind of ritual, where she was the human sacrifice needed to create a powerful shield against one aggressor; however it's also possible that just the free magic and Voldemort acquiescing to Snape's request caused that effect.

Next about spells having a power assigned in their incantation. The way Harry was able to use sectumsempra without knowing what it did, causes that explanation to make sense. A culture of words having power can also be seen with the way everyone is so scared to say Voldemort, and how he eventually puts a taboo on his name.

But, with the idea that you can't use a spell for a purpose it wasn't meant for, I kind of disagree with that? I mean, for the cutting spells, I can more see that there's a difference in the /scale/ of the cut. So for like, cutting apples or cloth, you need a very thin cut (well it depends which way you cut the cloth - if you cut cloth with the same spell you cut apples, then it would be a deep but narrow cutting range, if you use a different spell then the width of the cut varies). So if you use the spell for cutting an apple stem on a human, you would give them something about the size of a paper cut. I absolutely think if you overpower or underpower the spell, it will have an effect. I think if Voldemort pushed his strength into an apple-stem cutting spell, he could blast clean through a person - but it would be a hole the size of the apple-cutting spell. So it would look more like a puncture wound.

So that's one possibility, but my headcanon goes more like.... The castor has two tools to help him make magic - the word, which provides accuracy in the effect, and the wand, which helps control magical output (strength).

So to make an analogy: the word is an outline. And your /magic/ colours in that outline, and then when the outline is lifted up you see what your magic drew. And how strong the colours are depends on how much magic you put in, and how accurate the picture is depends on your intent behind the magic.

But, even if you have an outline of a cat, you can draw the nose and ears longer and the tail shorter and make a picture of a chihuahua, but /since you're making those changes freehand/, it wouldn't be as good a picture as if you had used the outline of a chihuahua. /Unless/, you're a fantastic photorealistic artist. So the wizarding equivalent of a photorealistic artist would be someone with an iron grip on their control, who could then technically make freeform magic, without using a specific spell.

In my headcanon, freeform magic isn't the same as silent casting, in which you're still using a specific spell with a specific incantation, but you're saying it in your mind instead of out loud. It's not like inventing a new spell, either, because it's not easily replicable, it's drawing a new picture every time and of course that makes it a lot harder than just using an outline, and makes it require a lot of concentration - but not necessarily a lot of power.

I think that by people who have practiced enough to be able to use freeform magic, it's mostly used as an emergency measure, and, depending on the wizard in question's skill in arithmancy/ancient runes, it can be used as a 'mockup' to test what a spell will look like, in the process of spell creation. I think that would be most useful for magic users who aren't very good at arithmancy/ancient runes, though, because I feel like by using the tools those two subjects provide, you can kind of "put together" a spell, without needing the skill or concentration necessary to "draw it freehand".

But anyway, completely freehand magic is like, the absolute extreme end. My point was that I think you can kind of... /tweak/ what a spell looks like (meaning what effect it has) even while piggybacking off the shape/effect provided by the word. But, of course, for the average user, the closer the spell you're using to your desired effect, the better it will turn out, and the more closely your intentions follow the lines of the spell, the better it will look (work). So obviously someone who wants to draw a unicorn would be better off using the outline of a horse than a cat, and obviously someone wanting to, for example, make tissues, would be better off modifying a transfiguration spell to make paper towels than a transfiguration spell used to make cardboard, if by happenstance they don't know the exact spell used to make tissues (or if there isn't one, in the esoteric cases).

For example, say you're hiding from a group of bullies (or death eaters, or something) in a corridor in Hogwarts. In charms class, you learned how to make pineapples do various dances. There's a couple suits of armour in the hallway you're hiding in. You don't want to go out so you can be in range to jinx your attackers, but you want to incapacitate them anyway. You want to make the suits of armour do martial arts and beat the shit out of your attackers. But that's not something they teach in charms class, for obvious reasons, and you don't know the spell for it. Instead of using the spell to make things tapdance, or waltz, or samba, or something, while praying that they do martial arts, you use the spell to make them capoeira, because that's as close to a martial art as a dancing pineapple is going to get. The movements of martial arts are already there, so if the /intention/ you use is also for martial arts, a charm to make things dance will do a functional approximation of a charm to make things fight. And boom, you can beat up or at least distract your attackers without poking your head around any corners.

At least, personally I find that theory more appealing. Because if spells only do just what niche they're intended to do, then some of their functionality goes away.

As for what you were trying to say about spells losing power as belief is lost in them, first of all this would be a great explanation for why magic doesn't work in the real world (sob) and I agree that it would piss the purebloods and dark arts users the hell off, that their magic being outlawed, or being too difficult or esoteric for regular use, is causing it to become weaker. But it's very depressing to think about. I think the idea of rediscovering, and then translating, lost ancient spells, would be fantastic wizarding careers, right up there with solicitor, genealogist, and ward-master in "things I'd want to do after graduating Hogwarts". Now, of course the way magic is used changes over time, and that ancient magic would require different methods and skills and controls than modern magic, but if spells lose power as they are forgotten/fall out of use, then all that ancient magic would be entirely useless. And that's just a depressing thought /;

Concerning Dumbledore and the Elder Wand, I think that, if the Elder Wand chose based on power, it may perhaps be influenced by his /perception/ as the most powerful wizard in Britain, it may also be influenced by his positions as headmaster and head of the Wizengamot and Supreme Mugwump of the ICW and Order of Merlin first class, or whatever, /because/ holding sway over so many wizards is a type of power. So the belief that he is the most powerful adds to his power because it gives him power over the people who hold that belief. However if the wand were to choose solely based on magical power, then I don't think Dumbledore's perception as the most powerful wizard would matter in the slightest, because what everyone believes about Dumbledore's magical strength has 0 influence on Dumbledore's /actual/ magical strength. *Unless* of course you subscribe to the idea that a strong enough belief in something causes magic to grant it (but this is treating magic sort of semi-sentiently, or at least influenceable-y? Like, you can't influence electricity through thought, for example, but you can influence chance through thought (that random-number generation thing). For example, I read a fanfic called A Necessary Gift, I think, where everyone believed Harry had a certain magical talent, and then Harry actually developed it as a gift from magic. So, if everyone believes Dumbledore to be the strongest, it would influence magic into increasing his magical reserves/core.

However, I think the elder wand doesn't choose people, it's just passed along through right of conquest. Although the whole 'right of conquest getting the loyalty of wands' thing is super problematic anyway, but if it chose based on magical strength, I don't think Draco Malfoy would be able to have won it from Dumbledore, because although Draco might have been magically powerful (we don't know), it's reeeeaaaalllly unlikely that he'd be /more/ magically powerful than Dumbledore.

*********** I think the Wizengamot is basically the wizarding equivalent of Parliament, with both elected and hereditary seats. I can see it originating in Britannia as a 'council of elders' type thing, maybe with some especially talented younger wizards getting in there. Some of the members of the Wizengamot may have a lifetime right to be on that council, because of some sort of achievement or service they performed, or special quality they had. Maybe the other seats had some kind of 'right of conquest' entry, that in order to get a seat you had to fight someone already on the council, or beat their accomplishment or record, and if they lost then you were more worthy than them and you replaced them. There would probably be some rules in place to prevent someone from being challenged every five minutes, or else nothing would ever get done. However, as time went on, settlements grew larger and more structured. Raw strength became less important than order and security. Perhaps those rules of challenge grew stricter, as more people were competing for seats. Maybe they noticed that really strong people were sometimes boneheads, or sadists, and they didn't want people like that representing them and making decisions for them. So they created rules that allowed the general public to veto a candidate even if they won a seat through conquest. People learned that if they wanted a seat on the Wizengamot, they would have to convince all their neighbours that they weren't assholes or idiots. So they put more effort into "campaigning", as it were, if they think they have a shot at a seat. So in the end, it developed into elections for some of the seats.

Additionally, as the standard of living increased above subsistence level, some families increased in power and wealth. Perhaps these families, and the families which produced incredibly magically talented or strong individuals, were able to demand that their lifelong seats on the Wizengamot become hereditary seats, /because they */could*/./ They were the strongest.

Now. The Dark Arts. I'm having trouble figuring out what you're trying to say in that whole section. I can totally understand purebloods blowing their lids about muggleborns coming in there not really wanting to learn magic and then the spells that they don't want to learn lose their power as the brats fail at them. The problem is, it seems like muggleborns aren't the ones being lazy? It seems like people like Ron, who grew up with magic and doesn't see how special and fantastic it is, are the ones being lazy about it. Hermione, for example, as a muggleborn, shows up and thinks, /wow, magic!! Look at all these things I can do that defy the limits of what's possible! I am literally doing the impossible right now!!/ so it seems like they'd put hella more effort into learning magic. Especially with the fear that, /what if I don't belong here? If wingardium leviosa doesn't work for me, does that mean I'm not a wizard?/

What I /can/ see is the purebloods being traditionalist. Like, they put a lot of effort into keeping their bloodlines magic-only, presumably in order to keep their magic strong and to keep their genetic talents like metamorphmagic etc. So I can see these families drilling into their kids' heads that they /have/ to have faith in this spell, unless they want it to stop working for everyone. They prolly scare the shit out of their kids by saying "if you don't do this spell right, you'll break it forever". On the other hand, muggleborns come in and they think magic is a thing like electricity, and their actions don't have any impact on anything outside their vicinity. They don't understand how /their/ doing badly could possibly impact magic as a whole. So maybe they're halfhearted or scatter-brained in their efforts, causing the purebloods an aneurism and giving them a reputation of just not /caring/ about magic. That could definitely cause conflict.

And I mean, I can see how if, as a whole, there was an exodus away from magic itself, this could impact magic. If less people believed in magic, or just stopped doing it in general, or came up with some weird science-y explanations for what they were doing, then magic could conceivably suffer some loss of fuel or regeneration or something. It's possible depending on fanfic headcanon of where magic comes from, what's the linking between internal and ambient magic, etc. But it doesn't make a lot of sense to me that spells themselves lose power if they're not used, because to me a spell doesn't have inherent magic of its own. It belongs to magic as a whole, it guides the castor's own magic into a desired effect, but it's not like it's an independent entity with its own allotment of power, the way a wizard or magical creature, or even an enchanted object, is.

With the Dark Arts in specific, and what you said about having to really /mean/ them, I can't figure out your intention? Did you want to say that Dark spells are an exception to the power of the incantation that you were discussing before with the apple-cutting spell? Because it seems like you meant to say that with apples and guillotines, intention doesn't matter, you just have to choose the correct tool for the job. But then with the Dark Arts you're talking about needing intention to make it work - is that in /addition/ to choosing the correct spell? Or in exception to it. Also, are you classing sectumsempra as Dark Arts? Cos some people do and some people don't, but we can see that it didn't really require intention to cast. Harry didn't want to hurt/maim/kill Draco, yet he was able to use it.

The last paragraph I was able to catch on a bit more to what you're trying to say. I agree that your acknowledgement of what you're really doing may have some impact. Whether it's on the result of your spell, or on your magical core, or on how "corrupting" the Dark Arts is.... I don't stick to a uniform magical theory in between fics, so sometimes the corruption of the Dark Arts is purely a psychological "power corrupts" type thing, where the Dark Arts can simply /do/ more than light ones, and so wizards kinda go nuts off of pushing the boundaries of what they thought possible. Where they keep using the Dark Arts because they feel so much /stronger/ than they did before. On the other hand, I've also used the theory of magical cores with different alignments based on the type of magic you've used in the past, and so wizards with polarised cores would be impacted differently than wizards with neutral cores or cores polarised in the other direction, because the spell they were using was in alignment/completely against their own magic. So the Dark Arts were only dangerous for wizards with a purely Light core.

So yeah, I think acknowledging what you're actually doing (like if you use a pain spell to discipline someone, you acknowledge that discipline can be achieved without causing pain, and you're doing it because you /want/ to cause pain, for one reason or another) can have an impact in either of those scenarios, and in ones not even mentioned. For example, in intention-based magic, the more honest you are about your subconscious intentions, the more successful the spell. Or, in a psychological view of why certain types of magic are corrupting, acknowledging your desire to cause pain can either create a backlash of disgust, or destroy any inhibitions you may actually have. So for example, Voldemort never had any inhibitions to start with, because his entire worldview was "fuck everybody!!!"; Dumbledore went "oh shit D;" and had a backlash where he avoided corruption by staying away from temptation; and Bellateix had inhibitions to start with but when she acknowledged her desires she went like "hellll yeah!!!" and just.... Gave in.

And firing off spells with no regard for form or precision or purpose, /personally/ I feel like it just wouldn't work. Like if you just jerk your want and say "wingardium leviosa" in a bored tone of voice and stare forward with your eyes almost crossed, you're so bored and upset, it would prolly be like if a wizard waved their hand around and sang Taylor Swift's Blank Space. A spectacle, not a spell.

/But/, under your 'words have power' theory where the mere words of wingardium leviosa themselves have power, then maybe it would be more like.... Swinging your legs around when you're supposed to be practicing kicks. Possibly something similar to the effect it's supposed to have would happen, because it's a tool with a limited range, but since you're just fucking around with it without purpose, it would be a complete accident. Also, I'm not sure if just waving your legs around would detract from muscle memory. I feel like it would, right? Because you're adding more sensory memory to distract from what you've been drilling it to do? But then again, no matter how many things I do with my hands, I still haven't forgotten the rotating movement you need to throw a proper punch out from your hip. So, maybe muscle memory is independent of how many external stimuli you add? And for magic, maybe it's moreso the belief that the words won't do anything as you're throwing out the WL than it is just fucking around with it, that causes the degeneration of its magical ability. I just got hit with an epiphany of the belief-based thing going on with Dumbles and the Elder Wand, remember? That if everyone thinks he's more powerful than he really is, magic will grant him more power? Well depending on magic's level of sentience, depending on whether it gives the believed in power as a 'gift' or as an automatic consequence of the belief, it may also work the other way. That if a bunch of people think WL is worthless, as an automatic consequence, magic will make it /actually worth less/. And that's what causes the spells devaluing thing, not necessarily lack of use, but the consequence of that lack of use on the wizarding population.

/In conclusion/, to finally wrap this up, lol, I think that your idea of words having power is really cool, and makes sense in a certain context, but it would cause problems if it was an overarching sort of law that applied to everything.

Thank you so much for all that you've written for me ;D these discussions are a lot of fun, I think =}

************* Okay, so, I understand what you're trying to say about the muggleborns weakening magic in a different way through a lack of taking care of the spells. If magic was an on-off switch type deal, and it could not be the blood of muggleborns that weakens magic, then it makes sense it would be the behaviour of muggleborns that weakens magic, assuming that muggleborns weakening magic is fact. The problem, of course, which I think you noted, is whether the problematic behaviour that weakens magic is limited /only/ to muggleborns or not.

As for the dark arts, your analogy makes sense. That the Dark Arts are more powerful because the practitioners of the Dark Arts treat them with care, reverence, and even fear. Like taking out the priceless heirloom china for Christmas, you're going to hold it with the fear of dropping it, reverence, you'll be super attentive to everything, walk slowly, warn people not to bump into you, set it down gingerly, etc. And the everyday china is going to be chipped and manhandled and some plates and cups will be broken cos you just kinda jam it into the dishwasher and then pull it out and stack it up as quickly as you can so you can go back to watching Vampire Diaries. So the care taken with the Dark Arts will show, when the spells are still lovely and shiny and new even centuries later.

This also makes sense with your idea that in the 1500s everyone was super strict, and kids handled spells like the Queen's china because they knew it was more than their lives were worth if they dropped it (failed the spell).

With rituals though, and that detailed level of magic, I'm thinking those were more in the 500s than the 1500s, and yes, they were super long and precise and detailed, and therefore more powerful. In my opinion, in Europe in the 500s when a witch or wizard wanted a cup of tea, or a book off a shelf, they got up and got a goddamn cup of tea, or book from a shelf, and if they couldn't reach it they used a ladder. They used magic and rituals for things like protecting towns and cities, bringing rain, getting rid of rain, improving the harvest, getting rid of diseases, decimating armies, catching prey, things like that. If they were super rich witches or wizards they called a house elf or muggle and made them get the tea or the book, but they didn't just flick their wand and go for it, because magic was something important.

By 1500, European witches and wizards were swish-and-flicking away, because magic had evolved to a point where it was for the good of the individual, moreso than for the good of the family/village/country, and where it was used as an everyday convenience rather than a powerful tool. At that point, they could very much still have had the strictness that kept spells shiny and new. But as time went on, and from personal experience I can tell you, they didn't care if their spells had chips in them, or if one or two got a handle knocked off, as long as they were still useable and did the basic job they wanted them to. Rituals had to be precise and specific because, I think, if you didn't do exactly what the ritual says, it either wouldn't work at all (the better option) or it would work incorrectly and you would be in deep and serious trouble. Of course if you didn't have the correct ingredients for a ritual, you could modify it to make a /new/ ritual, but you can't just toss in pine needles where it asks for porcupine quills and pray to God nothing explodes too badly. Well, that's more like a potion. Let's say, you can't use arabic numbers written in cow's blood where it asks for Roman numerals written in the blood of kings, because Roman numerals are confusing and you're afraid of being hung for treason. With a spell, if it asks you to make a circle with your wand, and you make a bean-shape because you're doing a roll to avoid the entrail-expelling curse someone is aiming at you, you don't care if you put a chip in the spell by forcing it out through a bean shape instead of a perfect circle, as long as whatever the effect of the spell is still works and blows that douchebag's head off before he can re-aim at you.

The biggest hole I can see in this theory, though, is that it doesn't make sense to me why the nature of the spell itself should be affected by those who use it. It's counter-intuitive, I think, because it feels like saying that if one person saws the front off a mass-produced rifle to- actually I have no idea why people do that, but for whatever reason - then every rifle mass-produced on that line is now going to be screwed up by that person screwing it up. I mean, looking at it from the "why do purebloods hate muggleborns" perspective, it makes sense. It's a valid argument. Muggleborns come in, find this idea counter-intuitive, ignore it, and muck things up for all of us. But, it's still going to be counter-intuitive for your readers as well, so saying "that's just how magic works", I think it might make readers feel uncomfortable. Kind of like reading Romeo and Juliet where readers just pull their hair and say "no. Why. Why author why. Stop having the universe be stupid!" If you have a super-legit explanation for why the use of spells by one wizard impacts the quality of that spell for future use, then it might come to be accepted, and it definitely works out the whole muggleborn angle, but, I can't think of such an explanation ^{^{"}}

Finally, though, I wanted to go back to your statement of muggleborns diluting the blood sounding like crap. That's a premise we've been using to argue the words have power headcanon, but I really don't agree with you that magic is like an on-off switch. In the stories I read, a lot of the time, wizards have a different amount of raw magic at their disposal. And of course it regenerates with rest, and food, and all that, but the fact is that some wizards can use more powerful spells, more spells, for longer, etc, before becoming exhausted.

Of course, this can be affected by training - you can "exercise" your core by practicing more magic - but only to a certain extent. Your base core and how quickly you can improve is determined by your genetics. Also, in a lot of these stories, what type of magic you naturally find easier is impacted by genetics. Makes sense to me - for example, I'm a language person. My cousin is a science person. Some people are math people. Some people are artists. Some people would die to be artists, practice so hard to be artists, but just don't have the vision to be anything more than architectural/technical artists, so they start WWII because the world is cruel so let's watch it burn.

So, with muggleborns, the question is, is their magic "brand-new" - ie, gifted in the womb and overcoming their muggle genetics completely, thereby making them "first-generation purebloods"? Or, are they the descendants of squibs. And if they are, what exactly are squibs? Witches and wizards born without a magical core? Or just without access to their magical core? What "revitalises" a long line of squibs enough to produce a muggleborn? And are witches/wizards a different "species" from muggle, the way veelas and elves are? (And faeries, banshees, harpies, nymphs, sylphs, phookas, dryads, undines, succubi, incubi, centaurs, mermaids, nagas, lamia, etc?) In that case, intermingling with muggles would "dilute" the wizarding blood and make the resulting offspring hybrids. So again, are muggleborns the result of hybrids which show more wizarding than muggle characteristics? Or are they "first generation wizards" which were born into a muggle line through an act of magic, rather than genetics? Or, are wizards already a hybrid, between muggles and magical creatures? Thereby each generation of muggle weakens the creature blood, and wizards with the highest percentage of creature are the strongest? Or maybe the creature blood passes down creature talents through muggle blood regardless of how far back it is, but they remain "locked" in the unused genetics until the owner has a strong enough magical core to access them? How is the size of the magical core determined? Luck? Different genes? Or is magic a genetic trait like red hair, making muggles and wizards the same "species", and muggles can be "carriers" of magic; no magical creature hybrids involved? Anyway, it all depends on the world building of the fic you're reading, there are plenty of good explanations and no reason to choose just one as your headcanon (personally I pick a different one depending what works best for the fic I'm trying to write) but the point is, I don't think the idea of muggleborns weakening blood should be dismissed as 'crap' right off the bat ^{^}

*************** Well I wouldn't say it was a completely useless idea. It made for some interesting discussion, at least, and even if 100% of it didn't pan out, I think there are still some salvageable parts that can be incorporated into a larger magical system~

I'm not sure what fics you've read where magical cores have been used as an instant power-up. I mean, I've read fics where Harry had blocks on what magic he has available to him, and when he releases them he gains access to a whole bunch more power, I've also been tossing around the idea in my mind of a sacrificial ritual where you absorb the magic from a witch or wizard being used as sacrifice, and that when prisoners in Azkaban are kissed, their magic is extracted and sold on the black market for anyone with too many scruples to acquire their own sacrifice, so I guess that would be an instant power-boost too. But from what I've read, magical cores are used in a way to set parameters. Things like "Hermione and Ron will never be as powerful as Harry", things like that. What happens in those fics is that, as Harry uses his magic, his capacity to use more magic increases. It's described kind of like training a muscle. And when Harry uses powerful spells or has to partake in a crazy battle or something like that, he collapses and passes out for a few days, unable to cast so much as a lumos until he regains strength.

What I agree with is that there are many different things that impact your ability to cast magic. Things like understanding of theory, spell repertoire, muscle memory, cognitive speed, agility, but also personally I think your connection to magic, and your ability to feel your own magic. I think it's like the difference between Hermione and Snape in potions. Hermione takes the instructions as perfect and brews a technically flawless potion. Snape uses intuition and his knowledge of the byplay and effects of things like ingredients, heat, stirs, direction of stirs, lengths of time, methods of ingredient harvesting and preparation, and goes above and beyond /flawless/. Hermione looks at it as a checklist to tick off to get a 100, while Snape says screw the instructions, screw the test, how can I make my answer a masterpiece, and he gets a 120. It's the same, I think, with magic. People who understand more about how and why magic works, people who /feel/ it better (especially in the stories where magic is a semi-sentient entity) are the ones who are capable of using their magic more easily, with less effort and more results for more complex things.

As for my ideas about Tom, well, he's not just a genius. Yes, he's an ENTJ, and they're made to rule the world, they have drive and determination and self-discipline in boatloads, but also, Tom was bred out of adversity. I mean, I gave my opinions on his upbringing somewhere else on here, but Tom I think he looked around and he saw all these worthless people doing things and he thought to himself, I know I'm special, I know I'm better than all of them, and I'm not going to let them have any more knowledge than I do. I think he used learning magic as a way first to prevent himself from ever being weak, because in his orphanage he could terrify everyone with his windless magic but Dumbledore Setting his wardrobe on fire had shown him that here in the wizarding world that wasn't going to fly. So he had to learn real magic to make sure he could always defend himself, and then he had to learn more magic than anyone had ever known because he was miles better than them, and because personally, I think Tom was in love with magic. The muggles were worthless scum, the Wizards and purebloods were no better, not a one of them had ever proven themselves worthy of breathing to him, but the magic was beautiful. It protected him, it came to him, it made him special. He felt more of a connection to magic than he did to humanity, and I think that's why he wanted to learn every little thing there was to know about it. He would have thrown himself into theoretical lessons like History of Magic, not because he wanted to know what the worthless scum of the past had done, but because he wanted to know what magic they had known back then which had been forgotten. As for being able to multitask like a boss, I think that had almost nothing to do with his magic and more to do with his own personality and the way he'd been forged into such a driven, ambitious person in the fires of his life. Of course he may have used some forgotten knowledge to give himself boosts, like improved memory, faster cognitive speed, etc, but I think he was just the kind of person who would take on the entire world and win, because they just couldn't imagine losing.

Yeah, Tom Riddle is kinda sorta maybe my idol #•_•# I wish I was that driven, charismatic, self-disciplined, intelligent, motivated, and badass.

Damn, is Taure a he then? It's really hard to tell on here, since clicking on someone's name reveals only past posts. I'm not surprised, he seems to have put a lot of thought into things. But I don't agree, I think genetics play a role in magic just as they play a role in anything else. There may be magical ways to circumvent them, for the inventive or unscrupulous or determined or wealthy enough, but I do think there is a hereditary component to the size, strengths, and limits of one's magical ability.

Also, it really plays 0 role on my opinion /what/ she intended in canon. Canon is done, flaws and inconsistencies and all. I don't want to completely leave the realm of what is discussed in canon - I think jk did a super job incorporating all these small mythological details, tying together everyone's birthdays, wands, etc, the anagrams she did.... Of course there is the problem of Pollux Black and Marcus Flint, but with how complicated her world is.... And that thing with asphodel and wormwood being a loaded question, good lord, it seems like almost every detail in the books has some hidden significance. But, I don't think the point of FanFiction is to stay within the realm of canon, and the people who say a character would never do this, or this type of magic doesn't even exist in the series, it really makes me wonder if they missed the basic premise behind writing fanfiction. Anyways.... Enough rambling. And you laugh, but I warn you not to count on my mental stability =P

** I think a lot of those views of muggleborn ethno-centrism come from people trying to write fanfic from the POV of Slytherins / Death Eaters and trying to reason why they would have these beliefs. Writers then tend to glorify pure-blood traditions, nobility and why things should stay status-quo. It can be fun to write about, but it comes across as a society where the wealth and power is controlled by a very small, pure-blood population. (Basically the wizarding world's version of the 1% or royalty) It can come across as very "pure-blood apologist nonsense" even with a well-done explanation.

I do think the wizarding world, as presented, is very stagnant and very prejudiced. There is probably a lot of systematic discrimination and I wonder what it was like for muggle-borns to find employment after school. I can't think of any adults we met who were muggle-born and held a high position. Werewolves, like Remus, are shown to be stigmatized to the point of poverty. JK deliberately used this as a parallel with people who had HIV/AIDS in the 80s/90s. They also discriminate against "half-breeds" or other humanoid magical creatures like goblins, veelas, centaurs etc.

I think there are a lot of ideas put forth by muggle-borns from the muggle world that challenge the wizarding world as it is and make pure-bloods uncomfortable. Roughly how white-privilege can make some whites uncomfortable or male-privilege can make some males uncomfortable in our society. Not all of the ideas by muggle-borns are going to be good ones, but that doesn't mean that all of them are completely off the mark.

** I like the idea a lot. I've seen a few fics that played with it, and found them quite good.

It does make sense. It's not like the Magical Culture is ever explained or taught to anyone. While there is a Muggle Studies class, the closest opposite would be history of magic... which doesn't teach much of anything.

A lot of fics have had a "Muggle students pamphlet" of some sorts that explains things to muggle born students, but I don't think that's cannon.

Quite frankly, muggleborns are dumped into the world with no introduction aside from a professor visit (WHY is that not an official job at the ministry? "Hi, your child is magical. Here's some books on magical culture and recent history, a muggles guide to raising a witch or wizard, and a phone number to call in case of serious accidental magic. Here's contact info for other muggles who have raised magical children, and are volunteered/payed to help you with any questions. Your child will be expected to choose a magic school at age 11."). And by all appearances, just expected to "pick up" on the culture as they go. We've seen how well that works out with Hermione's crusades(s) against things that are "wrong" and offend her muggle sensibilities. Since it's a children's book, it's never explored further, since it's not the point. But I'd wager my arm and leg that she's not the first, or the last. And that the purebloods have a certain amount of reason for not liking muggle borns and blood traitors, exactly for the reasons you outlined.

Blood traitors obviously being pure bloods who have embraced muggle culture (or it's imported variant), or at least have ceased caring about magical culture.

In 7 seven years of Hogwarts education there are zero classes on traditions, etiquette, politics, social conventions or any of the other things a muggleborn should know about according to you.

Without university to repeat the process, the friends you make at Hogwarts are the friends you're going to have for life.

Primary school and secondary school catchment areas are not aligned. You don't have a primary school associated with a particular secondary school, except in the private sector. On top of that, parents often move, or have different preferences regarding what kind of school they want their kid to go to. Generally they will "shop around", looking at a few different schools that they are close enough to send their kid to, and pick the best. Naturally, different parents pick different schools and the class divides. Add on to that certain parents deciding to go private (or if the primary school was private, going state).

Technology has given me a very remunerative job. I might prefer a different type of job that wouldn't require as much technology, but that would postpone my retirement by decades. Of course, this is a social thing as well as a technological thing.

I was in a long-distance relationship for a while. Without technology, I would never have seen this other person before moving out with them, and I would have communicated far less.

You're comparing video game adventures in which I can save the world and blow up galaxies to the "adventure" of possibly taking a hike or visiting the zoo.

If I didn't have electronic entertainments, I would read during that time instead. I wouldn't be hiking all the time. So it's not exactly a fair comparison. I'd spend more on books than on video games (Europa Universalis IV has given me five hundred hours of entertainment), but on the other hand, I'd spend less on bookshelves than I do on my computer. Except without modern technology like computers for layout and the offset press, books would be much more expensive, so it'd actually cost more.

At least video games aren't life-threatening...

And what if you are afraid of heights? I don't think I would ever want to do more on a broom than hover a bit, because I would be terrified of falling off. And the books prove a lot of times that there are no spells to prevent that at all...

I'm not saying that it's unrealistic to have as a hobby, but not everyone should be expected to like that. I'd also much prefer video games to flying, duelling or playing some of the weird wizarding games like gobstones... Do wizards actually have any cool board games? The possibilities are endless but it's never shown at all...

I can certainly understand the problem with wizarding society, magic can't be used to solve /everything/ after all (See for example the "The Five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration").

What do you think of the speeder bikes from Star Wars? Those hover about two feet off the ground, only a little higher than a motorcycle. You can do that with a broom. You still have the problem of splatting into a tree at 200km/h, which means you're pretty much restricted to slow speeds and open fields or /very/ slow speeds...

#+end_quote

The wireless exists, yes. It's just as good as the radio -- possibly with magically awesome reception. I very rarely listen to the radio, instead using my music library, which has much more variety than any station but NPR.

Going into a pensieve just to listen to a song is absurd. I can't do anything else while I'm in there. I'm stuck listening to the music -- and any other sounds that happened to be going on during that time, getting extremely familiar with the room I was in at that moment -- until that memory ends. That's a great way for a dozen people to experience the Ring Cycle without paying for everyone's tickets, but it's not useful when you want background music.

  If you think video games are more exciting than flying a broom or duelling there is no hope for you.
#+end_quote

Flying a broom is in the same general category as riding a motorcycle -- it's a physical activity with a level of danger depending on how complex your manoeuvres are and how many obstacles are in your course. Unfortunately, the factors that increase the fun are the same as those that increase the danger. Dangerous activities do not appeal to me.

Duelling is all well and good, but it seems to take effort and energy. I could probably duel for half an hour per day, assuming I had the space and a willing partner. Once I got good at it, I could probably do it for an hour a day -- probably five or six five-minute sparring sessions. Naturally we'd need appropriate restrictions on the spells we get to use. That would end up being nothing dangerous -- no cutting curses, for instance -- and things that aren't dangerous tend to be weak, easily deflected by a shield.

So these duels would pretty much be: put up a shield, wait until your opponent gets bored enough to send a spell at your shield, then dodge and try to send a spell at them in between their shield dropping and them getting it back up after their spell. Plus some environmental effects. Probably not very interesting.

But even if it were as interesting as video games and I magically got the stamina and willing partners to duel for hours on end, it's not as interesting as /creating/ video games.

And you aren't doing that. You're taking a very small window into the magical world and saying this is all it is - despite the many logical extensions that can be made - and then comparing it to an entire culture. Rowling's world is extensively fleshed out, but it can't compare to a culture that you've spent your entire life immersed in, so naturally there are gaps. This is where you seem to be diverging from the rest, in that you imagine that is all there is, where others are taking things to their natural extension - obviously there are games beyond what is described.

Canon tells of people listening to it. It says nothing of watching it. It doesn't say anything about two-way communication over it, or sending items over the wizarding wireless, or anything like that. Many things are possible without violating canon, and even without making canon seem silly. But we'd expect wizard television to be mentioned at least once in seven books if it were regularly available in any acceptable quality. Similarly with the rest.

#+begin_quote
  The same with duelling - why restrict yourself when you can magic away most harms?
#+end_quote

Because I am risk-averse. Because a poorly aimed cutting curse could pierce me through the head and leave to instant information-theoretic death, which (apparently) not even time-turners can solve. Or simply slice a limb off or destroy an eye, and judging by Auror Moody, magic can't regenerate those things. Because even if I can fix any injuries within hours and am somehow guaranteed not to die, I'll still be in pain, and I dislike pain. Because there are similar things I could be doing now without magic, and they aren't interesting or fun enough for me to want to do them.

You seem interested in magical duelling. I'm not. I'm not you, and there is no legal or moral requirement for me to be you. I can have my own interests that you don't share, and you can have interests that I don't share. You seem sufficiently happy with risks to engage in full-contact magical duelling. It's your own health that you're risking; go ahead. Don't expect me to join you.

Yep. In other words, it's a reasonable (but technically incorrect) way to express a very sensible and worthwhile idea.

For instance, instead of asking "Is there a magical solution to my child's asthma?" you would ask "How will going to this school affect my child's asthma?" Maybe there will be a magical cure; maybe there will be a magical treatment; maybe you'll have to continue with nonmagical treatment (which might cost you an arm and a leg to import into the magical world -- or maybe they can copy your kid's inhaler for a nominal fee using magic). You don't care about the mechanism. You care about the result. Instead of asking "What sort of magic will my child have to learn?" you'll ask "What are my child's job prospects like? What quality of living can she expect to have for a reasonable amount of effort? What's her expected retirement age? What's her expected lifespan?" and so forth.

You aren't asking explicitly about magic. You don't care whether there's a magical mechanism behind it. You care about outcomes. Magic affects those outcomes, but it's not the only thing that does so.

Ain't nobody got time to be re-charming the wood every time he almost explodes, burns, or disintegrates it, and stone is sturdier than wood and drywall. They can be temperature comfortable without central heating or AC. They can make light without electricity. They can entertain themselves without Internet or devices to access said Internet.

So far, Hogwarts's only appeal is that apparently they have a monopoly on learning magic and that if you want to be a wizard you have no choice (unless you are fluently bilingual and go to BeauxBatons). Nothing in Hogwarts suggests that it is actually a good school in and of itself.

Hogwarts very clearly does NOT have "magical heating" or "magical light". In the books it's all about "candles and fires" or doing it yourself with a lumos-spell. They don't mention anything that even remotely resembles "magic central heating" or "magical lamps".

Hogwarts students are not cold. They are not uncomfortable. They are not bored or lonely. They are no more separated from the outside world than students at Muggle boarding schools.

They're not cut off. Once they've made friends at Hogwarts, that is their society. It's a community all to itself. Add in Hogsmeade and you've got everything you could want.

Also, you've said it a few times now so I should probably correct it: it's not 10 months. Remember that most of the children go home for Christmas and Easter holidays.

I think you're mischaracterising the Tri-wizard. Firstly, it's not routine. Secondly, in the absence of a dramatic plot by dark wizards focusing on your child, they're not going to be in front of a dragon unless a) they volunteer as an adult and b) a magical object which can comprehensively test aptitude decides they are up to the task. Thirdly, Muggles schools have dangerous sports too. A few kids die each year playing rugby, for example.

Umbridge was obviously an awful teacher. A measure of that was plot-related so rather unique circumstances, but the point is taken that Hogwarts has had some awful teachers. However, the Muggle world is not immune to awful teachers either (at least there are no instances of Hogwarts teachers sexually abusing kids...).

  Cut off from what? Do you feel cut off from Beijing in Belgium? Of course not; Beijing is not part of your community. It's not something you consider as part of your normal activities.

If I were to move to some school in Bejing I sure as hell would feel cut off from Belgium, my parents, my family, my friends, my hobbies etc.

By your logic nobody is ever cut of from anything.

  Kids at Hogwarts are not cut off from their community.

That depends entirely on what you define as "their community". You're acting as if casually giving up your entire life is just a minor detail to consider.

It is at age 11. By the time you're an adult you're going to be a completely different person, no matter which path you take. It might as well be Hogwarts.

Not analogous. Going to Hogwarts is not just going to a school. It's more like changing your nationality. Kids who go to Hogwarts no longer (or very quickly cease to) identify with the Muggle world -- that was the whole point of my original post in this thread.

The analogy here would be going to Beijing, becoming Chinese (to the point that you're indistinguishable from the natives), speaking their language, adopting their customs and games, and making new Chinese friends who you feel much closer to than any friends from your old life, who are a rapidly fading memory. You visit your parents three times a year.

Now are you cut off?

But I think you're underestimating the "it's magic" element. Being a wizard is essentially like being a god. That's going to be a significant element in a parent's decision making. Not to mention that the kid is going to be begging to go, utilising all their powers of emotional blackmail.

********* I'm sorry, I've never been to London, I wasn't aware all your fancy modern buildings are made out of stone just like the medieval castles of days past.

1.) *why in hell would people waste time making "magical lamps" when lumos is practically the first spell anyone ever learns?* Why would they make "magic central heating" when you can cast warming charms? Or have runes embroidered into your clothes, maybe, to keep your body temperature even regardless of external temperature?! It's utterly useless!!

What you're doing is saying "how can we recreate what the muggles have, using magic?"

What I'm trying to point out (and I think Taure was, too) is "how can we most easily meet our needs using magic?"

Imitating muggles? Probably not it.

2.) there is no mention of other schools on the Britannic isles in canon, but I do believe (not positive though) that canon calls Hogwarts /the/ best school of magic. Now, it may be they had that reputation 500 years ago and are resting on their laurels. Do we have any proof of that? Nope.

3.) There's a fic out there for you. I forget what it's called now. With the non-boarding school for muggleborns in London. Harry drops out of Hogwarts, while Hermione goes on to become a Hogwarts professor, and Harry's new school steals all of Hogwarts' students and forces it to shut down because why not shut down the most magical place of our entire childhoods to replace it with some modernist day school in London that looks just like your high school? You loved your high school, right? It was a million times better than Hogwarts? Why would anyone ever want to study in a frickin /castle/ when they could have just another institution of learning and +suffer+ education?

  There is no Hogwarts without magic because the point of Hogwarts is magic.
#+end_quote

Right, but what do I as a parent want to know?

- What's my kid's life expectancy if they go to this school?
- What are their job prospects?
- How does the staff prevent bullying?
- What level of health care does the school provide?
- How healthy is the environment? An ancient castle seems like it'd be rife with must and mildew -- not good for my kid's lungs.
- What's the quality of the food like?
- How are the facilities and equipment for quality of enjoyment and education?
- How good are the professors?

The answers might involve magic. They might not. I'm concerned about outcomes more than mechanisms. Let's see how Hogwarts does:

- Life expectancy: pretty good. Suicide seems to be rare compared to muggle schools, while murder seems to be more frequent.
- Job prospects: we really don't know. We don't see any clear signs of unemployment in the books. But the stuff taught at Hogwarts won't let you get your A-levels, so you're not getting a job in the muggle world without a lot of extra work.
- Bullying: the staff does very little about it, and some staff members take part in it.
- Health care: very good. Madam Pomphrey seems exceptionally skilled, and her talents are largely going to waste.
- Environmental health: we don't see anyone becoming ill, ever, so probably very high.
- Food quality: a nutritionist would probably scream at the cholesterol and fat content, but nobody starves, and it seems like it's enjoyable.
- Facilities: we don't see a whole lot of it. The school's training brooms are possibly not so great, and there are several easily accessible unsafe areas.
- Professors: you've got two that are brilliant and good at teaching, three that should have been sacked years ago, and an inability to keep a defense professor around.

I'd be moderately worried to send my child there.

** IMO this is a symptom of a much larger problem: JKR never answers the question of where muggleborns come from.

Curiously, blood is a key ingredient in a magical ritual used to return Voldemort to corporeal form. So in her universe, blood is clearly important at least in a very practical way. Unfortunately for FF writers, the blood problem isn't easy to explain away through Mendelian genetics or paternal uncertainty.

I only read H/Hr, so I've never seen the OP's scenario made manifest. I can see how other ships would run into that problem more frequently. For me, it has to be enough to say, "There are wizards because wizards exist." If I start thinking about the broader context JKR pulled her world-building from (e.g. Mabinogi and other folklore), I'll invariably go crazy due to the uncredited theft she perpetuates. Of course it doesn't make sense that in a universe where nearly every person Harry meets comments on his resemblance to James that heredity should be so grossly overlooked. It's better to just "go with it."

*** Aww, that's really sweet :0 I have a lot of ideas, outlines, and vague beginnings, but no, nothing published for Harry Potter.

The problem is that I like to write about characters infinitely more witty, intelligent, charismatic, diplomatic, and socially skilful than I am, so when I get to the dialogue portion I'm like ehhhhhh.... Now what? Because naturally if I was able to come up with witty things to say, I would do so in my life as well ^{^{"}} generally I rather keep my mouth shut to avoid removing any doubt about my level of intelligence.

And in addition to that failing, I also have a terribly short attention span and get three more ideas before the outline for the first is finished /:

I'm always willing to share my viewpoint, though, if you have anything you want to discuss ;) and I hope I'm willing to be corrected on it if someone comes up with something reasonable that I missed.

As you can see, I use a lot of words #0.0# so if you ever feel like reading them, ask me anything ^{^{"}}

I often find that when I'm talking to someone with writer's block, whether helping a sibling with homework or a friend with a resume, it's best just to ask, "What are you trying to say?" And then they say something great, and I reply, "Well, write that then!"
