** So for those unaware this is a middleman website scam that orders from China for cheap from eBay or some other website. Then sells them "free" for shipping. They make 5 or so bucks off each one they sell depending on the price.

Sometimes they don't even bother ordering them themselves they just place an order and use your shipping address.
