I was hoping some one could help me find the name of a old fic I read. It was a time travel story and I remember it started at a memorial site where he meets I believe fate and he tells her all about how the hero of the war is sham. Harry had become immortal due to interrupting a ritual. That's about all I can remember.


** Is it this one?
