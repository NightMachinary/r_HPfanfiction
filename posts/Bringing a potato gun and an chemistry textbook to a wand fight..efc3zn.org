Do you know how easy it is to make a explosive device out of common materials, or that a sufficiently powerful potato cannon can take someone's head off without the need for ekectricity? I mean come on, Pottassium tablets and good old Dihydrogen monoxide will react and cause an explosion if digested together, banish that into old voldys mouth and no more dark wizard. Harry has to kill him. Does destroying the final horcux of an dead but not really wizard count as killing it? I would argue yes.

  Well, I've just been bitten by a story bug that gave me an idea for a D&D-style talking, shape-shifting, spell-casting, plot-derailing sentient Dragon (specifically a Silver Dragon) taking baby Harry from either the wreckage of the Potter's Cottage, or the doorstep of #4 Privet Drive, and raising the child because he can.

Have you written this story? I saw the comment above and would really like to read this.
