** I'm certainly a picky reader but my criteria is writing quality first and foremost. Yes, there are a handful of pairings and subjects I actively avoid and there are very few of the subjects I really want to see. I wish more writers would try for a 'Rowling-esque' voice. But (unless I'm reading for a review request) I decide within the first few paragraphs if I'm going to read on, and if a writer appears not to know how to use dialogue tags, paragraphs, punctuation, etc, or uses Americanisms like 'gotten' I'll usually give up.

*** "Gotten" is an americanism? What's the british equivalent?

**** “Got” is the British equivalent. It's also acceptable in American English, due to one starting off as slang and then simply becoming popular enough that both can be used.

Edit:

Though, as [[/u/l33t_sas][u/l33t_sas]] mentions a bit down this chain of comments, as the reason why “gotten” started being used much less often in Great Britain is the perception of it as archaic, wizards might very well prefer that form over “got” and thus use it much more often than you'd expect (on average, because everyone speaks however they want anyway) from someone living in GB.

***** This is an oft-repeated claim, but is straight-up apocryphal nonsense. /Gotten/ is just the the past participle form of /got/. The /-en/ suffix is the old way of making participles which is still common in many words (/eaten/, /woven/, etc.) but has been falling out of use across English dialects (e.g. most people these days wouldn't say "he had /bidden/ at the auction"). It just so happens that the older, original, /gotten/ is still common in American English but is less common in British English. It's hardly an "Americanism" since the UK never actually stopped using it. It's just perceived as American because Americans tend to use it more than Brits.

*edit:* [[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=gotten&year_start=1600&year_end=2000&corpus=18&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cgotten%3B%2Cc0][Proof]] that /gotten/ is old and the UK never stopped using it. You can see that its use decreased in the mid 1600s, soon after the US was settled, but that it never fully went away in the UK.

****** Right ... I will counter what you wrote by saying that I never wrote that it is an Americanism, just replied to a message that took it as one. What I wrote is that its equivalent in British English is “got” as one is more popular in USA and the other is more popular in GB (considered archaic over there, because why not), and that one started as a slang (a long time ago, because slang is not a thing that only happens nowadays, though I did not specify when it had happened) which is why both are acceptable.

So while I do appreciate the attempt at providing info, I will note that you sound quite rude here with that starting sentence of yours. It might be that I could have written my previous comment better and that I failed to make something as clear as it should be which would put at least some of the blame on me, but please do try to actually make sure that you get what is being said before you publically dismiss what someone else wrote as nonsense.

******* Apologies if I came off as brusque. I didn't read your comment carefully because I had to run and assumed you were saying 'gotten' started as slang, but you weren't specific. Nevertheless, just as both forms can be used in the US but one is more common, the same applies in the UK. The [[http://corpus.byu.edu/bnc/][British National Corpus]] has many examples of /gotten/ in spoken English though it seems rare in texts. Wizards being quite archaic for the most part, it might even come off as /more/ authentic if you use /gotten/ in dialogue of old-fashioned pure blood wizards, especially since the statute of secrecy came into effect when /gotten/ was very common.

******** Thanks, it makes it a lot better that it was not intended to be that way (I have the same problem occasionally, to be honest). And you make a really good point about “gotten” possibly feeling more authentic when used by wizards, I'd forgotten about that one but now that you said it I can see them using that form a lot; I'll go and edit the first message in the whole chain to make it a bit more visible for those who don't want to dig deeply in the comments.

****** That may be technically true. You can find it in Shakespeare and Chaucer etc, because it is archaic usage in this country. The graph is not much help because it doesn't, as far as I can see, show where or in what context the word is used and it likely has started to creep into popular usage. But nowadays it /is/ read as an Americanism and it's disingenuous to say it's not; when I see it written I always assume that the writer is American (or nowadays possibly a Young Person who has absorbed a lot of American culture). I would be very interested to know where it appears in British literature post 1800 or so. I'm pretty sure Rowling doesn't use it and it's not a word I have ever used myself.

******* Yes, arguably it is an "Americanism" (inverted commas because there are more dialects than just British and American English) but it's still not super unusual in British English (apologies I can't link directly to the results, but you can do the search yourself). Looking at the [[http://corpus.byu.edu/bnc/][British National Corpus]], it seems to be a lot more common in speech than in writing, perhaps because it seems to be proscribed and people avoid proscribed forms while writing.

** Your bulleted list isn't so bad, but the paragraph below it definitely limits your choices. There's not much else to say other than either write what you like to read, expand your horizons into crossovers, or become less picky.

Also, it would be helpful if you listed some things that you /like/ in a story (besides Harry/Ginny). It would help with recommendations.

I completely agree with your post and I wanted to just comment on this part.

This piece of advice here is one of the best for very picky readers or readers who can not just find exactly what they want to read. As enormous as the HP fandom is, there are still some subject/pairing gaps in its fics. The only way, really, to fill in that gap for you is the just write what you want to read. You don't even have to publish it. Just have your fic as something for you to enjoy.

I have written several fics because of the lack of published options and when I get in the mood to read 'xyz' then it's nice because I know this fic has exactly what I want to read. Besides, I think it's a lot of fun writing and you really get a much better appreciation for fic authors who publish their works as well.

That is absolutely true. That's pretty much why I started writing fanfiction, and while you might not be much good at it to start with (most of us aren't), you will get better the more you write.

** I haven't found a good fic in the wild in months, if not years. And the amount of new stories that I actually finish is under 10% probably. There's just so many bland and boring stories that it's hard to get attached. Like, I can not go on FFN for 3 months, and then I'll go and check out Harry/Daphne, and see the same nonsense repacked in different stories, so nothing is actually new. Same thing from pretty much every other section as well, and it's disheartening. So then I go write my own stuff.

** You are, but you say that like being a picky reader is a bad thing. Perhaps I'm picky for not reading every James Patterson novel ever, but I'm not going to spend my time reading run-of-the-mill thrillers just so I can say I read them. In fact, I wish more people were picky readers.

** I see no problem here.

Your preferences sound an awful lot like mine, except that I'll read most het pairings with Harry. I've read hundreds of stories, but I've only favorited 55, and I like it that way. I keep my standards high.

I can't recommend many specific fics, but my strategy is to check the list of stories over 100k words that have updated in the past 24 hours on FFN each day--and that have more than 200 favorites. I find that even the few of those that interest me keep me in as much new material as I can handle.

** You shouldn't be considered picky, and you aren't to me. However, you are when looking at the % of fics that are and are not what you describe, I think (but I'm not sure). No offense, but if fics about ACTUAL Canon are scarce and people who like them picky in the fanfiction world then I wonder how many people in it are a fan of the Harry Potter series and how much people are fan of the alternate universum series 'Harry Potter And Draco Malfoy/Snape and their leather pants' or 'Harry Potter and Hermione Granger' (sorry I was confused when you said Ron/Hermione I was thinking about Harry/Hermione) (although I have to admit JK Rowling fueled the love for the second with her casual remarks and encouraged doubts about her own canon). However, this is ooold news already so I'm sorry for ranting. I highly recommend the stories of StarFeather, one of my favorite authors who stays true to the story/world from the books and actually expands it with his own creative ideas, inspired by mythology. He writes a lot of Harry/Ginny, and his portrayal of their relationship is romantic.

**** Is it this StarFeather? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5852385/]] I think he changed his username. I am an occasional beta for him. His stories are beautifully imaginative and he adores Harry. Sometimes he struggles a bit with syntax as he is ESL, but the stories are charming and very respectful of canon.

** I'm with you on a lot of this. I've done searches specifically for Harry/Ginny post war, canon-compliant fics over 60k words and have only really come up with about 30 that I would recommen, and even then I had to broaden my criteria to slight AU.

It's interesting you said you can't stand Ginny with someone else because I completely agree, though I know it often means the story isn't totally realistic (i.e. when they break up for 3 years but Ginny never dated anyone else). It's not like I would think Ginny promiscuous for dating anyone else aside from Harry, but when I read it, I have a negative gut reaction. I think it's because we grew up reading a story from Harry's POV so we put ourselves in his shoes. So if we read that Ginny is dating someone else, its almost like reading the details of an ex of our own dating someone else.

** I see nothing wrong here, in fact you have all of my dislikes there, plus a few. However, I've never been a huge fan of Hinny, maybe if Ginny had been given more character development before this point, I would have enjoyed it, but canonically, I like almost every other pairing.

I'm with you though on not reading M-preg (why?!), Slash, Next Gen, OC stories, Severitus, or WBWL (Because James and Lily were characterized as shallow, petty, abusive, assholes right? /s).

I do find a few of the things in your list fun to read, Harry in America is alright, I like the ideas people come up with for the American Wizarding World, and any Ron, Ginny, Molly, and Dumbledore bashing is my guilty pleasure, but yeah, we mostly agree here.

So yes, you are picky, but who says that's a bad thing? It just means you don't read the vast majority of the fics on FFN or Ao3, which is fine, as almost every single fic on there is complete and utter crap.
