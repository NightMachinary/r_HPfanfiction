Ok, I understand we all grew up on Harry Potter, and when we were 11-17 we were like "yeah, I'm trustworthy, why keep secrets old man" but I'm kinda surprised how many adults write fanfic in which Harry should have been more informed. Dude is a fucking child and it's a war. I understand Harry is at the center of it, but damn, many 11 year olds still believe in Santa and need nightlights to sleep. As it was, telling him at 15 was arguably too young. Even at 18 I would have broken down into a ball learning this stuff. Imagine if our top 5 star generals went to a 15 year old and told them ALL of our top government war plans and secrets. We would go ballistic. Quite frankly, I would love to see some fanfiction that starts Hogwarts at around 17, as then they would be a realistic age when the war starts to be involved.

TLDR: Dumbledore was right, don't tell children war secrets!


** I dislike the argument that, just because the rest of us have had normal childhoods that lacked several attempts on our lives since before our birth, it was okay to keep the 15 year old in the dark. This is the whole point of Dumbledore examining Harry's life in The Lost Prophecy: it was asinine to keep him in the dark for the sake of a childhood he didn't really have.

*** 100% You can't look at this like "what if someone told /me/ war secrets when I was 15??? It would've traumatized me!" when you didn't grow up in an abusive/neglectful household and proceed to face death every year since the time you were 11. Harry's already traumatized with a life full of adults he can't count on. You're only furthering the damage by lying and hiding things from him, especially when there is no childhood innocence to protect by doing so.

He needed support and trust and knowledge of what he he was going to have to do and face. Instead he had to grow up in the dark with even less ability to trust people.

**** I acually grew up in a very abusive household. I also lived in one of the most crime filled areas in the country. I was probably in more life threatening situations than he was at end same age all the way till the goblet of fire. Trust me, growing up getting the shit beat out of me and shot at DID NOT make me more "prepared for a war". Nor did it do so to anyone I grew up with. Some folks who didn't escape (I was fortunate enough to have moved) did eventually join the military at 18. But trust me, they weren't ready at 15 and some didn't get in at 18 because their trauma made them poor soldiers. So trust me, I know exactly what I'm talking about. Let's stop this narrative abused folks = perfect adults. Abuse allows you to mimic adulthood, which I did well for years. It does not make you one.

***** I never meant to imply that abused people are perfect adults. Nothing about his situation, war secrets or not, would've allowed him to grow into anything but a traumatized adult who never had a childhood. Ideally Harry would've never had to be involved in the war, but he wasn't just involved, he was at the very center of it. I just feel like it caused more harm to keep him in the dark like they did. There were obviously benefits and consequences either way, and it's fine to have a differing opinions on which choice was better.

Yeah I agree with this. No need to tell an eleven year old, especially when the war isn't even on at that point. But keeping him in the dark in OotP was fatal to the person Harry needed the most, and like you say at the end of GoF - he saw it all. A friend of his was murdered in front of him. He has the right to know why.

*** I do think though that telling him only at the end that he was Horcrux was a good move. If he knew he has to die just before the mission is complete I don't think he'd have focused much on the mission or try to postpone for as long as possible. Also to destroy the Horcrux, Harry had to go willingly to his death. Even if he knew that, I don't think he would have actively sought Voldemort saying "kill me pls" because death was a potential outcome and it's not easy to experiment with your own life.

The problem is that past a certain point, Harry is obviously and irrevocably involved in Voldemort's plans and needs to be told /something,/ age be damned.

You could argue against first year. Voldemort was still a shade.

You could argue against second year. It was technically the horcrux, not Voldemort himself.

You could definitely argue against third year. Voldemort wasn't involved at all.

Fourth year is when it becomes stupid. Voldemort's back, he has a body, and has proven both his ability and willingness to kidnap Harry for murder. Not telling him anything at this point is flat-out stupid. Molly can argue all she wants about him being a child, but /he's the target./ It's not their choice anymore, he's involved whether they like it or not. The least they could do is tell him what's going on so that he doesn't run off half-cocked on faulty information and get someone killed.../oh wait, that's exactly what happened./

*** This. Also, not telling him doesn't mean you shouldn't actually ACT. People mention how Dumbledore did nothing about the Horcruxes... How about Lucius Malfoy? You can't really tell me that magical assassination isn't a thing, nor that it wasn't fully justified for his crimes.... Especially knowing Voldemort was coming back. Of course, killing the Death Eaters residing in Azkaban for life would've been an obvious step to take, given that he controlled the Dementors in the first war.

Above all else though.... WRITE SHIT DOWN! Dumbledore was old, if he had died of old age before telling Harry, how would the Horcruxes have ever been found? I can agree with trying to delay telling Harry for as long as possible, but not fully sharing with anyone was insanely stupid.

** I don't think anyone expects Dumbledore to tell Harry everything, but half the problems in the books came from Harry being told nothing, so he feels a need to find out the answers by himself. He was an active part in the war so keeping him so in the dark was dangerous. Someone should have sat down with him and explained why there were things he did/didn't need to know so he didn't feel excluded and betrayed, especially in book 5. If Dumbleore was worried the connection with Voldemort was a security problem, then tell Harry this rather than just ghosting him.

Also Dumbledore doesn't tell *anyone* his plans. Despite having the entire Order of the Phoenix, full of competent, trusted individuals such as Moody, he still seems to go Horcrux hunting by himself when he is meant to be running the school and then leaves the rest of the job to 3 teenagers. This suggests less operational security than control freak.

If you want someone to be a war general or to be a weapon, then you need to know what you are facing. Dont put the entire world on the shoulders of a child and expect them to come out on top. It's like telling an 8 year old that they are responsible for the well being and safety of their siblings. You put too much pressure on them.

** I agree with the thesis, but I think the argument that Harry wouldn't react well to that information is the weaker one. Much stronger is the argument that,

1. there was nothing that Harry could do with that information that would be actually conducive to defeating Voldemort; and
2. it created yet another way for said war secrets to leak to the other side, particularly during OotP, when Harry had a direct mental connection of unknown nature with the greatest Legilimens alive.

Once Harry was as ready as he would be (HBP), he was read in on all secrets that would be useful to him, and relevant books were left where Hermione would find them. (He could not be read in on Dumbledore's plans, because if he had known them, he wouldn't survive Voldemort's AK at the end of DH.)

Maybe when he found out about them with the pensive Dumbledore could have told him how to destroy one. Also Dumbledore knew he was going to die in the 6th year so maybe inform him of more stuff.

But generally people put to much trust in harry with the secrets than they should be as hes 15 doesn't know oclumency and other important stuff needed to hide major secrets

** Harry has a good heart. He does a lot, because he believes it's the right thing to do.

The majority of 11 year olds wouldn't try to fight against a troll. Most 11 year olds would just ignore what was going on in year 1.

Same with all of the other years. Harry didn't. Harry is different then that. Should he have been told at 11? No. That's too young.

But, he should have been told more info as Voldemort was actively trying to kill him.

By third year, Dumbledore should have gave him more info. Told him about Sirius (Even though admittedly, Dumbledore would have been wrong about Sirius), he should have warned him, since everyone thought Sirius was going to try and capture him.

Dumbledore, should have told Harry by his 4th year, more information. Not that he's almost certainly going to die, but he should have trained him more, he should have better prepared him then he did.

He never had a normal childhood, he was never a normal child. He never was going to be "just Harry." like he wanted to be. He had a crazy murderer trying to actively kill him, he had Death Eaters, who would have been willing to kidnap him, if they thought they could help.

Harry's lucky, things didn't go worse, then what they did.

The earliest point where Dumbels had even a hint of plan was after year 2. I will not go into his reasons for harry in PD nr.4 now because I think the JKR would not have worked out the plot further than the normal Hero trop aka Cinderella at this point (year 1). It was a 7 book series so even 18 would have been difficult since every book was a school year.\\
Should Dumbels tell him at the end of the last book. There are books for young people / children that is the age.\\

** The problem was that they put him in a vacuum. They gave him no information to work with at all. When someone feels like their life and the lives of everyone they love rely on them being informed, and you completely block any and all information, they're going to get desperate. They're going to try and find information on their own, and end up taking risks that they shouldn't have because they didn't know how big the risk actually was. They essentially left Harry stumbling around blind on a bridge, where any misstep could end up with him falling off. They don't need to give him flood lights so he can see the whole bridge, but at least give him a candle so he can see his next step. It's only understandable up until the end of GoF.

** Year 1: There is no war, no secrets to tell. Dumbledore knew Tommy was recuperating somewhere but since he had no evidence and he wasn't entirely sure there was no need to tell Harry about it.

Year 2: There was nothing to say. Dumbledore knew the Chamber was open but he had no idea who was doing it. Admittedly, he could've handled the situation better and stopped the bullying, he legit had no idea where the entrance was or how to speak Parseltongue. In fact, he wasn't even sure if Tommy was part of the issue.

Year 3: Tommy wasn't involved but he could've told Harry that "Sirius Black was his appointed godfather but his parents made a mistake because he cost them their lives. Don't go after him, his vying to kill you for his master." Though Sirius was innocent in the end, it could've prevented/curb any need to go into Hogsmeade.

Year 4: Shit hit the fan at this point. While Dumbledore did not want to cheat, he could've hired someone to train him for the tournament. It would've helped him in the graveyard as well. It's also this year Tommy gains his body back, so he could explain why he was being actively sought out by Tommy.

Year 5: Tommy is at large once again, tell him about the Prophecy, get him to the Ministry and shatter the orb. This could've prevented Sirus' death. Another alternative, get an Occlumens, who Harry can trust not Snape who holds no regards for Harry.

Year 6: No need for all the cryptic shit, tell him outright about the Horcruxes and what you think they are. Hunt them down and think of a way to destroy them before you die or I don't know, keep a time-delayed letter and have it arrive during the Horcrux hunt to make shit easier.

​

While I am against the use of child soldiers, if you have one in the centre /and he is the fucking target,/ share some damn information so they don't run on half-cocked plans and ruin your own plans.

**** Heh. Fair enough. :D

In terms of your actual post, I do agree with you - to a point. By the end of first year, Harry has already demonstrated that not telling him things just leads to him making assumptions and running off half-cocked to attempt to get himself killed in various inventive and idiotic ways. Don't tell him everything, I agree that's safer for everyone involved, but telling him nothing is more dangerous for him due to his impetuousness and oddly-intuitive ability to fall into the middle of every major situation in the country. I'd say give him enough that he knows why he shouldn't get involved and understands that other people have it handled/have a responsibility to handle it and that running off on his own is a bad idea.

** Year 1: He was actually told too much about the plot that was going on. Thanks, Hagrid. Also thanks Dumbledore for the "Don't go into the third floor corridor unless you wanna die, no we're not going to tell you what's in there." If they'd made the Thing™ being guarded sound uninteresting (just claim it's something for the Alchemy elective, or whatever) Harry wouldn't have bothered going back in there.

Year 2: Dumbledore probably didn't have a clue that Voldemort's diary was doing things until it was too late. There was nothing to tell here, everyone knows Voldemort was horrible and would leave horrible stuff lying around.

Year 3: I think if someone told Harry "Oh, by the way, Sirius Black is your godfather" right off the bat, he'd have done something stupid.

Year 4: THIS, specifically the end of it, is when you tell him every goddamn thing. Voldemort's at large, has already proven that he's after Harry Potter personally. You tell him there's a reason for that, and that he needs to learn Occlumency ASAP so he's not a security risk on account of his connection to Voldemort. That gives him something to /do/, especially if you treat it as Part 1 of training him to survive the oncoming storm.

Year 5: And here we see the consequences of Harry not being told the few things he needs to know at this point.
