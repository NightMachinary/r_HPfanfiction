Something along the lines where the catholic church is the primary church throughout europe (and/or caucasian cultures), children who show magical potential are taken from their parents for the child's safety(the malleus maleficarium still exists hunting muggleborns down to exterminate), and so on?


** Not quite what you're looking for but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6523209/1/Death-Eaters-and-Benadryl][Death Eaters and Benadryl]] has a few scenes with hunters looking for muggleborns. Also has some stuff about the muggleborns and some half-bloods banding together to survive outside Hogwarts. Not the greatest fic, but alright.

*** It's mostly a bluff, though - the Watchers sacrificed a few Slayers to make the Wizards think that the Slayer was unstoppable, and then mainly left them alone, dealing with vampires and demons. The Watchers need and recruit wizards themselves as well.

** I'd really want to read a fic like that, OP.

But then again - I'm writing the twenty-sixth revised version of my story's first chapter. I might use that as a reason Voldemort got so much support.

****** Okay, so to clear your misconceptions up:

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2001) is a small book written by JK Rowling. It's contents are small lexicon about magical creatures and how they behave, written by the fictional character "Newt Scamander" - the revenue from this went to charity.

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) is a movie, with the screenplay written by JK Rowling. The movie is about the adventures of Newt Scamander in 1920's New York. It features a group called the "Second Salemers", which consists of some Muggles who are deeply covinced that Magic is real and bad, and see it as their life-mission to convince the general public that witchcraft is real and to basically 'catch' witches and wizards.

You can also buy "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them - The Original Screenplay" by JK Rowling.

The revenue from the latter went into Rowling's (and Warner Brothers) pockets.
