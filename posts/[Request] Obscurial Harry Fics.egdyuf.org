I read my first fic that had Harry becoming an Obscurial, and I really liked it, and I'm craving more. List it all, not really any constraints, everything is fine, completed/uncompleted are fine, ANY pairing, and any bashings are okay as well. Preferably anything greater than 20k+ words and in English


** Which fic did you read?

*** Into the Diary on AO3, it's incomplete, but was updated recently and only 36k words so kinda short but a good fic IMO. I'm binge-reading fics that one was a slash pairing, but I'm good with any pairing.
