I just read one with Remus being the traveler. I didn't like it, mainly because the whole plan was to tell Dumbledore, which is, probably, the right thing to do, but it was not all that exciting to read about.

But i loved the idea. I think every character but Harry, Ron and Hermione would be interesting, but my mood is remus-ish, so if there are other stories with him out there, that would be neat. Ideally there would be no weird grooming romance, but if the rest is awesome i can cope.

Thanks!

Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1546436/chapters/3275699]]) some awkward slashy tropes, but also the brilliance of having Draco travel from mid 6th year to right before 4th

  Narcissa Malfoy is done with crazy, and she is determined to fix the mess her life has become. She has brains, a plan, and more than one dark spell to help her. But before she can put her plan into motion, she discovers a shocking secret about Hermione Granger, one that the girl doesn't even realize about herself. Before Hermione knows it, Narcissa has cursed them both, sending them back in time to deal with the Dark Lord in the form of the child Tom Riddle. Of course, Tom is no ordinary child, and time doesn't take kindly to being rewritten, so this will be a bumpy ride full of awesome, magical women, pragmatic decisions, and, rest assured, dear readers, plenty of sex eventually!

**** There are, although none I like as well as Puppet of time. There was a thread awhile back, so search the sub and it should pop up. I think it has all of the others.

Door of Time doesn't currently have any mpreg, and I suspect it'll be quite some time before it does - the romance isn't even settled yet.

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

** I remember a couple. One where Draco Malfoy travels back in time, and another where Severus Snape travels back in time. The writing is well done, but one of them had a Mary Sue, and both were copy pastas of JKRs books from first through whatever year. Let me try to find them for you.
