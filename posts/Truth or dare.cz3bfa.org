** A group of Slytherin students play "Wizard or Mudblood" (basically, truth or dare involving alcohol laced with veritaserum and a time limit on the dares), Harry ends up joining them in a few games over the course of several months. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9117317/1/The-List]])

This is a really depressing story about Harry having a magical terminal illness, making a bucket list that Draco helps him complete, and struggling to cope with everything. Overall, it's an amazing portrayal of the stages of grief and desperation, like when a close friend reveals they have cancer, while maintaining a lot of teenage behaviour. The characters call each other names, get up to stupid shit when unsupervised, and feel every emotion incredibly deeply. It's abandoned, but has enough of a conclusion; the author wrote that a close family member died after a long illness and couldn't write this story anymore.

  "Succorbentis?" Malfoy asked quietly, his face immediately hidden by that insufferable mask. "You have Succorbentis?" Silence. "You know it's an incredibly rare disease, right? You know it's incurable, right?" Silence. "...No wonder you're in denial." Ron/Hermione/Gryff Bashing
