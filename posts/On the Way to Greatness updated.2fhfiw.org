** For those like me, who have troubles distinguishing between specific abandoned good fanfics when one of them gets updated, here are my past notes on this one (spoilers, obviously):

#+begin_quote
  Harry is sorted into Slytherin. ◆Harry is good with Neville, Hermione and the twins, but not with Ron. ◆Voldemort casts a killing curse at Harry after his ressurection ritual, killing his soul fragment attached to Harry and destroying the connection between them. ◆Voldemort offers a pretence of truce to Harry through two DEs during Harry's visit to the village, Harry says that he'll think about the offer to stall time. ◆Arthur dies because Harry doesn't have the vision of the snake's attack. ◆Dumbledore imposes a zeitnot on Voldemort by making Harry send an appeal to see the prophecy. ◆A major battle in the DoM ensues, during which Harry kills Goyle Sr. and initiates the brohter-wand globe phenomenon with Voldemort. ◆Afterwards, he learns from Dumbledore about Legilimency and Occlumency, because during the dome-effect he was able to read Tom's mind for a little while. ◆Malfoy Sr. gets arrested, Fudge dies on the path of Tom's killing curse.

  Dark magic corrupts somehow (?). Harry loses control over his magic because of it during 5th year winter and kills two Lestranges with a mass-area fire spell. The story is abandoned at the point where Slughorn gets poisoned and Harry saves him with a bezoar.

  Realistic (+-) power levels for Harry and other children. Realistic psychological reactions to war, combat and deaths.

  8.5/10
