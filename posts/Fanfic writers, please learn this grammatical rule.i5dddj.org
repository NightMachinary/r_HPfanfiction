I have read this mistake one too many times, and I'm sick of it. Fanfic writers (or anyone, really) please note:

Apostrophe (') is used in abbreviations like you're, (you are), it's (it is) we're (we are, not where (where are my keys?).

For possessive form (drink your tea) there is no apostrophe on any forms of pronouns (my, your(or yours), his, hers, its (note the diffence to the abbreviation it's), our (or ours), their (or theirs)).

Sorry for the rant, but it gives the reader a poor impression of your writing ability.

Edit: this counts for pronouns. For nouns, plurals are without apostrophe (three bears, trees in the forest), but possessive nouns are with apostrophe (the tree's leaves, the world's creatures)


** my recent one is 'should of/could of' instead of 'should have/could have'.

I mean, seriously? and that too in 'with strength of steel wings', the same author as 'blindness'. Love both to death, really amazing world-building, writing style is awesome, the flow is done quite well, and then everyone says 'should of' as if they're illiterate.

This is not correct. The apostrophe is used for possessives after a noun.

** One that always drives me nuts is seeing people mix up "except" and "accept." I'm aware they sound a lot alike, but they're spelled entirely differently and not even close to eachother in meaning.

I mean, when people mix up "affect" and "effect", it's still annoying, but at least the two words are very close in spelling and meaning, so it's easy to see how one might mix up the two.

Another one I've seen often enough to annoy me is "steal" vs "steel". I don't really people accidentally referring to the act of theft as "steeling", but I do see people refer to the act of bracing themselves as "stealing".

Be happy you are being given these wonderful stories for free, if it bothers you so badly, don't read those authors, or reach out and offer to edit their work for them.

In my own work and writings, I'm a stickler for correct grammar and making sure the syntax is just right; but in other's amateur work, I can let it slide, I can correct it in my head as I read and move on, I can appreciate that these wonderful people are donating their time and their soul to share their stories with me and may not have the resources (money, or even time or knowledge) to get a proof reader and editor.

Non-natives may still make those kinds of mistakes, but they usually will either make way more, or way less.

Yes, you can. So can most people. But you know what happens if you have to stop every 3 words and correct something? It gets tiring. And if the plot is mediocre and the pacing is off then adding those mistakes just makes the work not fun. And then I drop it, I and many others. The author just lost a bunch of readers.

You know what's funny though. We, the readers, actually want to /read/ stuff. It may sound strange to you, but the readers are also humans with desires. As such, people like me and OP will make threads like these in order to encourage authors to get better and write better fics. That way, the author improves and gets more readers, and I get more fics to read. Win-Win.

You sound quite condescending saying "I am a professional but I don't hold these poor smucks to my standards, that would be unfair!". What if they don't have time, money or knowledge? Does that mean that they don't deserve to improve? That they don't deserve to be given a chance to improve? You didn't mean to sound like that, but that's how it came out. It sounds quite insulting to all those people trying to get better despite their limitations.

**** Honestly, if I have to stop every 3 words to correct something, or I just can't tolerate the way something is written, I ditch the fic and go find something else. Id not comment to say that I've ditched it, usually plenty others have said the same, and to keep bashing the author would feel cruel in all honesty. Believe me, i too want to read stuff, I spend an inordinate amount of my day reading, like more than is probably healthy, there's a reason I'm currently on book 50 of the year so far (though thats a slow year, a few years ago, thanks to depression, I think i did 33 novels in 45 days, insomnia makes for a lot of reading time). I dont tend to read fics that are less than 100k in length just because that is my preference due to how quickly I read. I never said I was a professional (I'm in accounting, not literature), I simply meant, I wouldn't hold fan fic writers to the same polished editing standard that I would expect from a traditionally published author, because they don't tend to have the team of professional editors and proof readers behind them, it just doesn't seem fair to do so. I've often considered reaching out to become a beta reader, its actually something I'd love to do at some point; unfortunately I'm an absolutely impatient binge reader and only read completed fics because I hate waiting for the next chapter to come out. (Though if proof reading/editing a novel length completed fic is something an author would want doing, i'd be so down for that) I appreciate that peoples writing style and their grasp of language gets better as they evolve as writers, its one of the reasons I love long fics, especially those written over a number of years, I love watching the storytelling and their voice evolve and become clearer, its actually a joy.

You may feel I was condescending in the way I worded my post, I felt the tone of the OP was condescending as well, so I matched it (or I did in my head, I'm not a writer, dont claim to be, while I'm articulate, I know i ramble and dont always present the clearest point)

I find that you can usually tell a native speaker from the way they write, I'm a lot less patient with their mistakes than I am with those who you can clearly tell arent native speakers.

But hey, if I enjoy what I read, I keep going, if I don't, I stop. Life's too short to read bad fiction.

** The rule I'd like more people to learn is the one concerning the use of "I" and "me" in compound subjects and objects. To get it correct, see how the sentence reads with the "I" or "me" by itself.

"Harry and me went to Diagon Alley" produces "Me went to Diagon Alley." It's understandable, but unlikely to be something any of the main characters would say. It should be "Harry and I went to Diagon Alley."

"He's giving private lessons to Neville and I" produces "He's giving private lessons to I." Also incorrect, and this one should be "He's giving private lessons to Neville and me."

The same applies to "he/him" and "she/her."
