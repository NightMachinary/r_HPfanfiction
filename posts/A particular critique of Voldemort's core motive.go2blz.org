  I have honestly always wondered why Riddle didn't fight against the purebloods. There are a lot more half-bloods and muggleborns than there are purebloods, he could have easily rallied an army of half-bloods and muggleborns and toppled the pro-pureblood Ministry pretty easily.

It is a very intriguing topic. Logically speaking, this is a much better plans as it allows him more scope and justification. And he can also tie in his own blood status unlike lying/hiding it. And don't forget families who would join him simply for shared glory, or 'blood traitor families' such as the Weasleys.

** Voldemort wants power yes but I never got the impression that power for power's sake was his "core motive". He truly believes his blood supremacy rhetoric.

** I mean I always thought a better idea would be to imperious/confound/convince muggleborns that they need to revolt, in which they kill purebloods nearly indescriminatly or Voldemort kills “blood traitors” framing the muggleborns while muggleborns kill blood supremists. Then everyone is against the muggleborns and Voldemort and his death eaters would essentially be saviors for doing what they did. Then Voldemort could be a leader that everyone WANTED to begin with making it more difficult for anyone to stand against him.
