Some author use that trope in their story. I don't understand what the need for that other than to look cool. I personally prefer the mc to stay under the radar. Especially if it is self insert fanfic. Thoughts?


** Because Lord Hadrian James Xavier Potter-Evans-Pendragon-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-Slytherin-Le Fey-Merlin is the most powerful being ever to exist and is crazy smart, especially with his betrothed Lady Hermione Jean Dagworth-Granger, his useful and faithful goblin allies, and his dedicated sexual harem featuring all of the girls of Hogwarts as borderline Veela, and as a fanfiction writer I need a blindingly obvious way to express that fact.

** I don't see the point of completing NEWTs early, unless one plans on entering the work force, but completing OWLs allow for a certain amount of autonomy. Assuming they're old enough to do so(or an emancipated minor, I suppose), having taken one's OWLs allows one to keep their wand, even if they happen to get expelled from school, and allows them more freedom to pursue education independently.

** Usually the reason is to 'emancipate' Harry from his 'magical guardian', Dumbledore. In canon, as far as we know, Harry already is 'emancipated' since he's an orphan, and there's no such thing as a 'magical guardian'. It's a very cliche and unnecessary trope. If an author wants to get him away from the Dursleys, for example, they could just have Harry take some gold from his vault and rent an apartment. Dumbledore might explain about the blood wards and try to convince him to not do that, but there's no indication he has any legal authority over Harry.

*** I agree that there's nothing in canon about Dumbledore being his guardian, magical or otherwise. But Harry's not emancipated in canon, he's the dependent of Petunia and Vernon. Emancipated means that you're legally responsible for yourself; no one else is obligated to feed you or house you, etc. (Which is why so many emancipation fics focus on the Wizengamot scene at the beginning of OOTP.) Nobody, magic or Muggle, thought that toddler Harry could be responsible for himself at the moment he was orphaned.

Now, if Harry wanted to take gold from his vault and rent an apartment, he could probably do that at any point. But it would only work because his guardians, the Dursleys, are the ones with the power to tell him no and they're not inclined to do so. (That sounds like a great fic idea, Dumbledore trying to convince the Dursleys to call Harry back from his apartment.)

The only canon reason Dumbledore has power over where Harry spends his summer is that Harry lets him. Technically, he couldn't stay at the Burrow or Grimmauld Place because the Weasleys and Sirius didn't give him permission, not because Dumbledore didn't. Theoretically, Harry could have kept asking people if he could stay with them until one said yes. (Another fic idea: Harry going down the class list from Abbott to Zabini, Dumbledore going down the same list convicing the parents to say no.)

*** That's actually something that constantly bothers me in Dumbledore!Bashing. Dumbledore is said to be manipulating Harry and keeping him there, but the fact is that in no moment he actually made any effort to keep Harry there beyond talking him out of it (and even this was only him telling Harry about the protections and not letting him stay at Hogwarts during the summer one or two times I think). As a fanfic I've read some years back pointed out he never held his wand pointed to Harry's head threatening him, he never threatened to have something even mildly annoying done to him or anyone else (and no, pointing out the vague threat of the DE doesn't count when they seem perfectly able to be hired by Dumbledore). Hell, even when he pointed about the DE he wasn't actually descriptive or incisive enough to believable convince a hot-headed teenager that had already shown not being adverse to breaking the rules if he thought it justified that he should not do something he had set his mind to do.

This actually makes me think the Dursley's were more of the type who would shout at him and maybe occasionally hit him (inside the admittedly lax constraints of the socially acceptable for the time period -end of the twentieth century [only relatively recently did we change those constraints to something more reasonable). Oh, it is definitely still awful and it still makes no sense to me that Harry would keep contact after graduation, but not something like the death-sentence-worthy outright torture we find in most fandoms.

** It could also be done to complete a particular type of apprenticeship I imagine!

I mean I actually haven't seen this, but it would make more sense than just "Harry is real smart and will be in school the same amount of time anyway"

** Mainly it's for Smart! Indy! or OP! Harry, to show “how smart he is”. Also so that the authors can have the characters do newt level and above newt level magic early while they're still in school.

** I believe one fic the plot point was that if you didn't at least have your owls if you attempted to leave hogwarts and/or the wizarding world your wand would be snapped and your magic bound. By completely your owls early the sooner you have the choice to leave hogwarts without "consequences".

**** It did say it would be bound. And I don't think they bounded the prisoners magic. In one fic I read they had the prisoners wands in a box in the warden's office. Talk about stupidity.

Secondly," added Matthias, "Because Hermione has not yet completed her OWLs, the law states she is to remain in magical education. If you pull her out, her magic will be bound, her wand will be snapped and all three of you will be Obliviated of all knowledge of the wizarding world.

In the story I'm Still Here by Kathryn518. Regulus is still alive and in prison. Harry rescues him from Azkaban so he can get the locket and when he does so he finds a chest of wands in the warden's office. Not sure if the story is truly abandoned or just her and her writing partner's extraordinarily slow update times. I really hope she gets back to it.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding?

** I read one story where the character took their transfiguration newt early, mainly as a plot point to get her and another character spending more time together. And do something else that I can't think of. I don't mind when the character might take one OWL early, especially if they're establishing a special skill they have with that class. But if they take all their OWLs early then it becomes wish fulfillment to the extreme.
