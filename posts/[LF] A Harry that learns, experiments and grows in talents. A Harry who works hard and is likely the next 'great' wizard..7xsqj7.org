**** It's one of my favourites but the story only covers from the end of the 2nd to just after the goblet chooses in the 4th. Sadly it was abandoned just before the plot starts to heat up. I say read it if you like to hear about their training and all that, but maybe skip it if you actually want to see them put it into action.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** My favorite types of stories are ones where the main character (be it Harry or another) are using magic in ways that are outside the box and unique. A few stories come to mind.

- [HPMOR](hpmor.com) was my first fanfiction and it sounds a lot like what you're looking for.

- As someone else mentioned /The Art of Self-fashioning/ is great.

- /With Strength of Steel Wings/ linkffn(9036071) has cool runic magic and you follow Harry as he does some questionable but awesome stuff to his body to get stronger.

- /The Arithmancer/ linkffn(10070079) is really interesting but it focuses on Hermione as an arithmancy prodigy instead of Harry.

  AU. Book 1: Harry Potter has a pretty good life; a loving family, a great group of friends, he's powerful, and he's about to go to Hogwarts. Unfortunately, Dark Wizards keep trying to kill him, and not everyone around him is quite what they seem...
