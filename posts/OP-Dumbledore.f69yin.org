An insanely powerful dumbledore capable of taking down even Voldemort with one or two spells, but he isn't all there mentally anymore after taking down his best friend/lover grindelwald. Unpredictable and loony with a tendency to conjure muggle sweets in his opponents mouths mid-cast.


** Voldemort: AVADA KE-phew... lemon drop?...

Our favorite professor turned headmaster starts whistling poorly in an attempt to hide his small prank. Harry looks at him from the side exhausted and incredulous along with everyone else in the atrium.

**** I think it was discontinued at some point. It's still pretty good though. Dumble's isn't a major player though, just a side character. Still, a pretty nutty Dumble's.
