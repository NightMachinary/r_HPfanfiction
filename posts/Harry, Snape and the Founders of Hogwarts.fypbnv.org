:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
looking for a fic (probably on ff.net) where harry and snape are transported through time or something to the time of the founders of hogwarts/head of houses. harry is injured/unconscious and snape has to look after him, but they don't know where they are until the founders find them. harry has extra powers, snape becomes a mentor/father figure and it contained a scene wherein harry gets kidnapped and taken to a cave or something along those lines.

i think it was pretty lengthy but it's more 4 or more years since i've read it. thanks for any help :) sorry it's not very detailed :/
