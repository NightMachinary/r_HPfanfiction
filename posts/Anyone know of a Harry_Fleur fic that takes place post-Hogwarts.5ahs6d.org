#+begin_quote
  After the Final Battle, Harry immediately realises that he is changing: the part of Voldemort that had lived and festered inside him for so long is gone, resulting in certain changes in Harry's character that he will have to recognise and understand. But how will this affect his relationship with his friends? And who will be there to get him back on his feet?
