Bonus points if it's Albus Dumbledore who gets sick of Snape's shit and instigates the comeuppance.

***** He was played absolutely /horribly/ by a great actor, you mean. Alan Rickman was fucking amazing and his Snape was entertaining, but it was absolutely /nothing/ like Snape was in the books. All the crap we hear about how tragic and great Snape was stems from the utterly off book portrayal of him by Rickman. Well, most of the crap anyway.

***** It's not easy to see the story if you view it on mobile since all of the font is the same color with no obvious signs for what to tap on.

The story was really good though.

I love Snape mentor fics, but too many stories ignore that a lot of what he did is just inexcusable. Explainable, but inexcusable.
