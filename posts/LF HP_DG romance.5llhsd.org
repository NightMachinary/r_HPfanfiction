** linkffn(Days to Come by chris400d; The Grass is Always Greener by kb0; A Fine Spot of Trouble by Chilord) are the first three that pop to mind. Oh, and linkffn(Beltane Child).

There's also linkffn(Big Brother is Listening to You) which has a marriage contract, but it wasn't specific to Harry and isn't what got them started. James Spookie has a trilogy that is basically this. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar) has a Harry/Daphne pairing, but isn't a romance. I'm fairly certain linkffn(Thanks to a Snake) is contract free, but I could be wrong. A darker one would be The Ties that Bind or The Ties that Lie (I forget the name).

All I can think of right now, but if you dig through my comments I have lists of Harry/Daphne fics. I'll see if I can edit in a link here.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** One of my favorite fics is 'To Be Loved' linkffn(5599903). It's a fairly standard canon rehash AU that drifts of from canon more and more towards the end. Daphne and Harry meet in first year in front of the Mirror of Erised and then slowly strike up a friendship over that.

There's nothing special or extraordinary about it but for some reason i just keep going back to re-read it once a year.

Oh yes, the tendency to assume fanfictions are always canon. Just because most fics write out the Dursleys to be incredibly abusive doesn't mean thats canon.

Canon Dursleys were in fact very indifferent towards Harry. Only Dudley actually tried to beat Harry up. Canon Dursleys were content to pretend Harry didn't live with them.

I read the beginning of the fic but i couldnt read anymore, Harry is just so out of character for no reason. Also it's another fic that just gives Harry really powerful wandless magic because he "practices a lot."

**** Canon Dursley's aren't indifferent, I think there's lots of other evidence of Dursley's hitting him:

Vernon fights him for letters and ends up grabbing him by his shirt and throwing him into the next room.

Petunia tries to hit him with a frying pan which he ducks by instinct (gained through experience).

Aunt Marge lets her dogs chase and bite him while saying he should be beaten more often.

You've got the starvation and the bars on the window in second year, the living in a cupboard, the sleeping on the floor in some shack in the sea...

The Dursleys were pretty fucking nasty, in my opinion.
