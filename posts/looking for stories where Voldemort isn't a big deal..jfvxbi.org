I don't mind if he was permanently defeated before the story starts or if he's just a non issue. I want to see what HP could be w/out having to look over his shoulder all the time. I would strongly prefer active or completed stories. I don't care what kind of pairings, slash, het or none, just no ginny please.


** The House of Potter Rebuilt linkffn(11933512)

Main focus is Harry training for future adventures and to ultimately rebuild the House of Potter reputation and the actual house. Voldemort is around, and he bugs Harry from time to time, but he's really not the focus and Harry defeats him almost as afterthought. Literally. Harry defeats Voldemort with a device he developed to avoid Peeves.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** I really did try to read through Harry Crow, but it was a struggle to make myself finish the first ten chapters. If I had to sum up the problem, it would be something like: Harry is the most extreme Gary Stu I've ever seen, and all the other characters are very one-dimensional, either his doormats who think the sun shines out of his backside as soon as they meet him (regardless of how well or how badly he has actually behaved), or his enemies who are reduced to caricatures of themselves and are just there for him to steamroll.

I guess I can see how it might appeal to someone with quite different tastes from mine, but frankly, when reading it so that I could say I had, I really identified with the scene where Professor McGonagall felt an urge to throw up.

But you do you. If you like it, enjoy.
