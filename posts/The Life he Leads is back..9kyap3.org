** Yeah, so I got a PM that convinced me to post it again. I doubt I'll write any more, what with the ending being a matter of public record nowadays, but it's there if you'd like to read it.

I'm not really a part of this community anymore. I've read Fanfiction for, more or less, ten years and I've enjoyed my time thoroughly. I am proud of what I've written, of that there is no doubt. I hope people enjoy my story still and, kindly, ignore the rough writing offered by my own shortcomings.

If there's one thing I learned throughout all of this it's that I search for joy far too extrinsically. The reason I wrote was because of the joy I gained from others, not myself. In stopping, I re-evaluated what exactly I enjoy about writing and have fallen even more deeply in love with it.

Now, I write for me.

So, have a good day everyone. You're all good people.

Thank you.

*** Haven't you posted other stories before (not counting The Life He Leads)? Your profile looks familiar to me for some reason (the questions + answers section). Whatever community you're now part of, I wish you the best!

*** This is the first time I'm reading this fic. Just finished it. It was beautiful. I was sad to see it ended too soon.

I didn't understand what you said about the ending being a matter of public record. Could you please clarify?
