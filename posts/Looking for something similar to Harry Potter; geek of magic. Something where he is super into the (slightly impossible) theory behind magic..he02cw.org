** My first thought was [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/689909/chapters/1267386][The Spellmaker]], where Harry learns “proper” Latin as a child and uses it to do magic before he gets the letter

** This is maybe not exactly what you are looking for, but I think you would probably enjoy it, something of a more technical Harry.

** Victoria Potter linkao3(13795605) seems pretty close here - Victoria is pretty strongly into learning magical theory. (And the story has a great take on magical theory in general, IMO)

*** I remember the fic author having a big ole document with their theories on how magic would work. Super interesting stuff, although it's been taken offline ages ago.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** Not sure if you are aware/interested, but The Arithmancer series is basically this but with Hermione. Starts a bit slow but picks up rapidly, preferred this to HPMOR. Linkffn(10070079)
