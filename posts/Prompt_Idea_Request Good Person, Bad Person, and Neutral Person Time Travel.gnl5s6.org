Story where a person from the light, a person from the dark and a person from the neutral side were pushed to the past, causing conflict and tension, not only for whichever character we follow, but for the audience as well.

You wouldn't know what the heck was going on, causing rifts and tension, and whoever we're following as well as we, the audience, will be surprised.

Normally the time travelers are the good guys, all on the same page, with the same goal, it'd just be more interesting if there were more stories that had bad guys, good guy and neutral time travel

This fic is similar, although I'd be spoiling it if I elaborated more.

  'I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--?' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all?'
