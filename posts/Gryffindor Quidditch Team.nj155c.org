I just realized how weird it is that in Harry's first year, the team consist of a first year (Harry), a second year (Katie), four third years, and a fifth year (Oliver Wood).

It seems kinda strange that there would be no sixth or seventh year students at all, but then again didn't Slytherin win the cup like back to back since Charlie Weasley left Hogwarts? Must've been a real shit generation for playing Quidditch in between!

Also, in Harry's first year, how did Katie get a spot but they didn't get a seeker? Was there no one trying for the seeker position during tryouts?

It is a bit odd, but not that unbelievable. There do not appear to be any second string or backup players at Hogwarts (which is what is actually strange, but it might also just be a side effect of Rowling making Quidditch intentionally stupid), so there are only seven players per team coming (usually) from six years. So it's probably pretty common to have one or two years unrepresented.

Yes, but Rowling also said that Charlie graduated the year before Harry started. And even if we ignore that, he couldn't be more than a few years older than that anyway.

Or the only people who tried out were really bad.

Yeah Rowling definitely doesn't understand or care about sports lmao

That being said i think it was more about her just wanting to keep the same characters/names. Pretty sure Katie and Alicia's years are not specified in the first book

*** All valid points! Although to your last point, even a bad seeker would be better than playing without one, but I guess we can just suppose that Wood just hadn't decided yet on what to do when McGonnagal took Harry to see him

It's not that weird. Imagine Harry would have attended Hogwarts without Voldemort. The Team in his seventh year would probably have been:

Harry (7. year)

Ron (7. year)

Ginny (6. year)

Dean (7. year)

Demelza (4. year)

Jimmy (4. year)

Ritchie (prob. also 4. year, as he wasn't seen at the Battle of Hogwarts and the adult Gryffs stayed and Ritchie and Jimmy seem to be friends)

So after that year only Ginny would have been a seventh year - everyone else on the team would have been from younger years. If the situation was similar to this one the year before Harry came to Hogwarts it would made sense that the team is younger - then there is also the point they were utterly defeated by Slytherin the year before Harry arrived, so maybe there were older students in the team that were replaced like Jack Sloper and Andrew Kirke were in HBP.

Charlie Weasley left Hogwarts the year before Harry arrived. The only possibility for the six years without a cup for Gryffindor is that even with Charlie they didn't win the cup every year. Which would made sense. Even with Harry they didn't win every year: they didn't win in first and second year and only won in third, fifth and six year by points and not by winning every game.

Katie was already reserve if I remember correct (one of the girls was).

And yes, nobody trying for seeker would made sense. Especially if Gryffindor-Team wasn't very popular at this time: we see that in later years. In fifth year Angelina has troubles filling the team after Harry, Fred and George got themselves kicked out. On the other hand in sixth year Harry has to sent away first years because the Harry was so popular.

** In Canon, Slytherin had been winning the /House Cup/ six time in a row, and would have a seventh time without the last minute points given by Dumbledore. As for the /Quidditch Cup/, it's a little bit complicated, mainly because Rowling suck at math.

In PS, there is a character (I think McGonnall, or maybe Wood) mentioning that Gryffindor didn't win the Quidditch Cup since Charlie Weasley left. But, it is also implied that Charlie is around 7 years older than Ron, and had just finished school when Ron started. Which means than in PS, Gryffindor should either be the reigning Champion or, (if you play with the dates a bit) had not won since 1 or 2 years (which is still totally acceptable).\\
I guess that can still be summed up by Wood being over dramatic.

Concerning the youth of the Quidditch Team, that's only because Rowling didn't want to bother updating the team, and so readers didn't have to learn the names of new (semi useless) characters. Everyone remember Harry's first team, but outside of Ginny and Ron, can someone give me the names of the new additions to the team in HBP (without looking it up)? Because I sure can't.

Also concerning the lack of seeker, the obvious (Doylish) explanation is that the position needed to be empty so Harry could take it. There are no Watsonian explanation for it, so everyone is free to decide why it happened. Personally, I think Wood found players he was satisfied with for the other posts, but all the Seeker were so lackluster that he decided to hold his decision for a bit.

*** yeah I probably confused the House Cup with the Quiddtich Trophy.\\
I could name the other players, but that's just because I read a lot of Ginny POV fics in which they tend to feature more. So that's a solid point

Demelza Robbins was a Chaser and particularly good at dodging Bludgers

Jimmy Peakes was a short and broad-chested boy. If memory serves, he was a third-year and tried to stay behind at the Battle of Hogwarts, despite being underaged.

Richie Coote looked weedy but has good aim.

Edit: I'm a doof. I got Coote and Peakes mixed up.

** Wood has insanely high standards. This is a guy that makes the team wake up stupidly early for practice. The Seekers that tried out were probably god awful, and he was spoiled by having Charlie Weasley as a Seeker before Harry started at Hogwarts.

My issue is that Harry carried on playing Quidditch after they treated him like trash after the Dragon incident, and even Fred and George, the "Pranksters" were involved in it, and it was never brought up again.

** You want to have the same players on the team for as long as possible, so you don't have to train a new team all the time. Preferably, you don't even hold tryouts some years, because you don't need any new players. And when you only change players every few years, and only have seven positions to fill with seven (or rather six) years, you're more likely than not to have only some years represented.

Also, in Harry's first year, two spots on the team were to be filled, which suggests two people left last year, and so were most likely seventh years.

â€‹

As for Katie getting a spot but a seeker not being selected, what do you base that on? IIRC, Harry gets on the team in his second week or so, so it's entirely possible the tryouts haven't been held yet at that point. Or is it established somewhere that Katie got on the team before Harry?

McGonagall and Wood of course would know that in the upper years, there's no good seeker, could even have some idea about second years from their flying lessons and just generally being in school with them. Or McGonagall could simply have known the team needs a seeker and after seeing Harry, she didn't see the need to look further.

** I did find it strange at first but then I thought that McGonagall decided to go with a different strategy considering her house lost for six years in a row and instead of going for brute strength (as Slytherins had) she went for flexibility and speed.

*** Also talented Youth ensures long term Victories rather than a one and done program. We see it in NCAA basketball. The top programs recruit the best high school seniors, they play one season and leave. This can mean even though programs do well for long periods of time they can do decades without winning big because they can't build on the positives of the previous year save the guys you treated as Goobers to beginning with and are looking for more raw talent in their positions
