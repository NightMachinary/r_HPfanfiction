** I know it's just a plot device to get them together, but I highly doubt McGonagall would choose Daphne over Hermione for Head Girl. I mean, by that point she'd have already basically saved the country with Harry and Ron, while Daphne spent the past year chilling at Hogwarts and that's without taking into account that McGonagall would likely favour someone from her own house.

**** Without Snape or Dumbledore in charge, I doubt Malfoy would have ever been made prefect, much less head boy.

We don't see much of Zabini or Nott, but nearly every time we see Draco, he's flouting the school rules and social etiquette.

***** All I'm saying is if Draco can be named a prefect anything is possible, even with Dumbles not being around any more.

It wouldn't be that hard to come up with a scenario. Daphne could have been secretly helping the other students the prior year, etc.
