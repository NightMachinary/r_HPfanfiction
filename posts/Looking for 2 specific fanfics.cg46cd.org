I read these 2 a while a go and i wanted to read them again but cant for the life of me remember their titles. They are both HHr

The first is where harry mows his neighbours lawn who then invites him to a big fancy evening party which hermione is also attending.

The second is where harry does something to annoy the dursleys so they call someone to pick harry up. The guy picking him up is hermiones dad because he works for a youth detention centre and hermione is there when he picks harry up.


** Idk either of those but linkffn(The Perils Of Innocence) is similar in that Harry and Hermione run into each other pre Hogwarts and get along pretty well.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
