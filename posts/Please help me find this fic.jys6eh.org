:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's been a long time since I've read it, but I'm looking for a Wrong Boy-who-Lived fic on Ao3 in which Harry is the brother of Nathaniel Potter, the supposed “Boy who Lived”. He's neglected by James and Lily Potter and was virtually raised by tutors. This only changes when he comes to Hogwarts where he sorts into Ravenclaw and (gradually) gains a mentor in Severus Snape. Additional fact: He's a Seer and sees visions of the future through his dreams. Thanks!


** I read a lot of WBWL fic, finding it interesting to compare the ways this trope plays out. I can't find the one you're looking for in my spreadsheet, but here are some similar ones:

In /Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/ by The Santi, Harry is Ravenclaw and has a brother named Nathan.

In /Unsung Hero/ by Meghan Reviews, Harry is a Ravenclaw, brother to Boy-Who-Lived Daniel. Harry is neglected, but I don't remember the extent of it other than he gets hand-me-down robes from Daniel which are transfigured from Gryffindor to Ravenclaw colors.

In /Invisible/ by debstheslytherinsnapefan, Harry is a Ravenclaw, very neglected by James and Lily, brother to Boy-Who-Lived Nick. He's not a Seer, but is mentored by Snape (eventual Harry/Snape pairing with mpreg, unicorn blood cures for horcruxes, prodigy!Harry invents lots of new potions, atrocious writing, read at your own risk).

EDIT: Adding /Harry Potter and the Veela/, which I haven't read, but it's listed as WBWL with Ravenclaw!Harry. Can't tell you anymore, it's not a priority on my reading list.
