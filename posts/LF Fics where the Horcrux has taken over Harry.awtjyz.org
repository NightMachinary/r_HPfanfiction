Or Harry is influenced by it, or he's similar to Tom Riddle, or the Diary Horcrux comes to life. Well written 60k+(or a good oneshot) Not Seventh Horcrux because I've read that.

  Having spent over fifty years as a notebook the fragment of soul who still refers to himself as Tom Riddle regains influence over the mortal plane and finds reality to be an ephemeral thing while Harry Potter, a young boy of eight, discovers that things both are and are not what they seem. AU

  HPTMR slash. AU. Harry has been raised from the time he was five with full knowledge of what he was, a Horcrux, and how someday he would need to die to avenge his parents. Thus, when he finds Tom Riddle's diary in his second year, he recognizes it. Horcrux speaks to Horcrux, a game of persuasion and manipulation. Twoshot. COMPLETE.

Exactly what you said. Harry is manipulated and influenced by the Horcrux.

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore watched two visionaries start as driven, powerful, brilliant young men, and become monsters. He has no heir, no protege of equal power to step in should another one rise, and he is old. So when he hears of a Chosen One with power the Dark Lord knows not, he thinks maybe he doesn't want this boy prophesied to defeat Lord Voldemort to grow up in the Wizarding world. He thinks of the bonds of family, and the opportunity he has to shape his world's politics, and of a corrupt magical elite who've signed on with two Dark Lords over hatred of Muggles. He thinks Harry Potter should grow up loved by his family, and Voldemort be destroyed so there is no need for Harry to ever realize his power, and he acts to make both of those things happen. Because he's Dumbledore and what he wants, he gets. Usually. When you dabble with improvised ritual magic, you should be aware there might be unforeseen consequences. For example: souls touch.

  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark... Warning: Deals with Stockholm Syndrome and dark themes.
