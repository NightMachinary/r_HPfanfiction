I'm searching for a story where HP is fighting in the war against LV, but is an adult. There shouldn't be an prophecy about them. Big plus if he has an normal time at Hogwarts, and don't have to deal with ridiculous things.

Why? I'm tired of reading stories there a teenager defeats LV, there the teenager is an idiot (hothead), inexperienced and very little knowledge. I hate the thing about "Chosen One" too. It's ridiculous.

I want to read something that is more "realistic" than every fanfic that is closely based on canon. Think HP as an adult fiction.


** So many stories make LV out to be a deranged rageful idiot who curses anyone who blinks. Instead he should be a sinister, conniving, strategic and evil Lord. I'd like to see more stories like what you're saying, where an adult Harry is fighting a war against injustice.

*** Yes, this is a big reason I like MoR and the Firebird trilogy. In MoR LV is smart and isn't deranged, but has a bigger goal. The Firebird trilogy gives a reason for how LV hates society (institutionalized raped as an minor on the order of the top governmental body with the population's support).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2980054/1/][The Resistance of Azkaban]] is a great fic with your criteria but it unfortunately DOES include the prophecy. It is a HP is fighting LV 25 years later story with a realistic plot , good character development, great action and a pretty good ending. It's not exactly what you're looking for but you might enjoy it.

** It's a tall order, I think. The thing is, without Prophecy, sacrificial protection, and wand shenanigans, Harry's just a very talented light athlete with a relatively high, but not particularly extraordinary, capacity for learning an performing magic; and he is also very stubborn, which may or may not be a consequence of Voldemort-related experiences. So, Harry without prophecy just isn't in Voldemort's league. Nobody in his generation --- not even Hermione --- is.

Consequently, such a fic --- unless it gave Harry some arbitrary powerups that nobody else has access to or thinks of using --- would have to feature Harry as a part of a team, which isn't a bad thing, and I'd love to see more fics like that, but there aren't many fics like that.

For that matter, if not for Voldemort-related experiences, Harry would have probably ended up a Quiddich pro. (Harry likes DADA more than other subjects, but compared to the sheer joy he experiences when flying and playing Quiddich, his career choice is clear.)

*** I agree with everything you're saying, but I feel Harry is completely a product of his environment. I think OP was looking for something more along the lines of the prophecy never happened, so LV stayed in/continued gaining power, and presumably HP didn't grow up with the Dursleys.

**** It's complicated. For one thing, if Voldemort hadn't been discorporated, then Harry (and everyone else) would have grown up in a very different world: they would be children of civil war. So, would there even be Quiddich at Hogwarts, rather than military drills? However, in that situation, Harry would just be just another soldier --- an unusually good one, but one among many --- to be deployed by the "grown-ups" as needed; and, like I said, that's not a bad thing.

Would being raised by Lily and James have made Harry more scholarly or ambitious? Maybe, maybe not. Nature vs. Nurture, and all that. (Also, early exposure to magic means early exposure to flying and to Quiddich. Just sayin'.)

One cool and underused --- I think --- premise might be the Battle of Hogwarts going differently. Say, Voldemort is killed, but most Death Eaters, including Bellatrix, survive and retreat, while the Elder Wand is destroyed. A brutal guerrilla war ensues between the Death Eaters and the reemboldened Order of the Phoenix, with the Ministry, having lost much of its staff and viewed with suspicion by everyone, shedding most of its functions, limiting itself to its core function of enforcing the Statute of Secrecy. Hogwarts becomes a neutral ground, with all teachers taking Unbreakable Vows of neutrality in the conflict as a price of keeping it running; but, of course, the students aren't limited by such vows. With powerhouses like Dumbledore and Voldemort, as well as arbitrary powerups like the the Elder Wand, gone, wizards who are skilled, yet not at the level of those two (e.g., Bellatrix, Shacklebolt, the Malfoys, Harry, Hermione, the Weasleys, etc.) begin to matter even if they aren't a subject of a prophecy; and tactics and strategy begin to matter, because where Voldemort could defeat practically any number of Aurors, Bellatrix has even odds against two.
