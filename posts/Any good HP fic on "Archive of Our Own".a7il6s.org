I'm asking cause I can't navigate well on that site, And when I do, 90% of the time in the tags of the fics there are rape or some other messed up shit which I don't want. Can anyone suggest me some good fics on there? preferably at least 90+ words, thank you.


** I love AO3, it's so easy to get around and you can easily read an entire fic without having to go chapter by chapter.

â€‹

Play with the search function, go to a fandom you like [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter%20-%20J*d*%20K*d*%20Rowling/works]] and start with the simple search on the right side. You can exclude many things. And start with sort by kudos, you'll get the stories that people have liked. Once you find a fic you like, check the authors page and see what the author has favorited.

I don't pay a lot of attention to more then the first line of tags, and if the tags are longer then a couple lines I tend not read it.

** I see you posted this in multiple fandom subs. My suggestion: learn how to use the search. [[https://archiveofourown.org/faq?language_id=en]]

You can exclude pretty much anything (including rape and violence, higher ratings, relationship categories, and any other tag) from your search. "creator chose not to use archive warnings" should probably be excluded if you absolutely don't want to risk reading fics that might have that content as well.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/faq/unofficial-browser-tools?language_id=en#triggertools]] there's also programs like ao3savior that let you create global blocklists for tags you don't want to see.

There are over 67,000 HP fanfics on the Archive rated General audiences or Teen and up audiences that do not contain: Graphic Depictions Of Violence, Major Character Death, Rape/Non-Con, or Underage. If you tailor the search to what you're looking for, I bet you'll find at least a few stories you like.

**** Yeah, plus that tendency to include tags for ships that are just there for the author to shit on them.

Like, if I'm searching for Harry/Ginny I have to add a rediculous number of other filters just so I don't get what feels like 80% fics where Harry cheats on Ginny with Malfoy.

And even with all those gone there's still plenty of stories that just mention Harry/Ginny in passing while focusing on someone else entirely.

The tagging system of AO3 is a hot mess and could really use some kind of rework.

Yay, insecure butthurt shippers who are salty and make cheating and bashing stories because their ship is delusional. It's either Harry cheating with Malfoy on Ginny because she "sucks" or Ginny is "cheating whore who only cares for Harry because of his money and fame". Author who publish such trash and readers who read that shit are the worst part of fandom.

****** First off it's not. Yes, there's lots of slash but there's lots of non slash too and while the LGBTQ scene is definitely a huge aspect of the site it never claimed to be exclusively for LGBTQ content.

Secondly my issues with the tagging system have nothing to do with slash and everything to do with the fact that it doesn't differentiate between ships that are actually shipped by the story, ships that are anti-shipped (which are included simply so they can break up and make room for the real ship), and all the other 20 ships the author included because they were mentioned in a throwaway line somewhere.

Heck, even if a story is explicitly tagged with "former Alice/Bob", the tag is counted as a variant of "Alice/Bob" and thus still shows up in "Alice/Bob" searches, even though it's the exact opposite of what someone searching "Alice/Bob" is looking for. That's just bad site design.

**** Then they're the ones who lose out on you as a reader, but there are plenty of others that aren't overtagged

I'm not sure if it's ao3savior or not but I've heard there's another plugin that hides the freeform tags

I just use the tag blacklist like someone mentioned above with the ao3rdr plugin and find it makes it much easier to search without having to manually block things out

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

**** Sure, in the sense that writing any canon 'good' character as an antagonist is 'bashing'. In my opinion, the author of SaS does a good job portraying Dumbledore and James' perspectives so that it's believable why they would think of themselves as being in the right. That puts this fic on a different level from what I would call 'heavy bashing' in which the bashed characters are one-dimensional baddies.

The trick is to exclude the Creator chose not to use tags option. That particular bit cuts down on the pedo/rape ~significantly~.

**** Not who you asked, but it really does depend. I'd take a moment to browse the first few pages of your selected fandom & see which fics have been marked CNTW. I've been in fandoms where every fourth fic was CNTW, not because of any messed up stuff inside, but due to a combination of people not wanting to deal with warnings, not wanting to spoil the plot, not understanding what CNTW even means (some people believe it means "no warnings apply," which it doesn't) or because the fandom was old and mostly reposts/imports and they were default marked that either by the authors or the importers.
