After being roped into a study period in the library with Hermione, Harry bites the bullet and decides to actually do some reading of course relevant material.

History of Magic, a lot less sleep inducing out of the classroom, leads Harry to a book on the separation from Muggles and the History of the Statute of Secrecy, an interesting read (even if he refuses to admit he's engrossed).

However. Page 187 begins a section of the book that notes notable breaches of the Statute, ranging from some rather humorous articles that has Hermione scowling for the interruption, to some downright wicked entries that had his brows climbing into his messy fringe.

But something jumps out as he reads, a word he had never seen before that made up a startlingly high number of the breaches over the centuries.

Obscurial.

Hermione pride and amusement in seeing Harry lurch from his seat and hunt through the index to find becomes changed to a perturbed curiosity when he returned with a few tomes and he quickly paled at whatever he was reading.

A half hour later, still trying to get his attention, she followed him to a section with newspapers (both of them under Pince's leery scrutiny) and she eventually got a hint of what he was looking for.

An infamous Obscurial from a few decades earlier, likely present in an American newspaper.

With her assistance, Harry was able to find pictures of the day the President of MACUSA ordered the death of a scared young boy for daring to lash out at people who had abused and manipulated him. Further research finding it commonly reported; Ministries around the world quick to murder scared, hurting children to continue their facade.

Madam Pince looked ready to step in when his balled fists scrunched up the papers in hand, but (to Hermione's shock) she seemed to think better of it.

All of his feverent reading culminating in an article about a man posing as the Head of MACUSA's DMLE at the time. Words jumping off the page to strike a dangerous chord within the incensed young man.

Who DOES this law protect?

《I think, for a Dark/GreyHarry it takes a huge leap, and a lot of cognitive dissonance, to have him side with Voldemort's ideology. But Grindelwald's spoke to everyone in the magical world, but especially kids like Harry who suffered under Muggles personally. We need more Grindelwald-esque Dark Harry's》

** Yeah, a Grindelwald Harry, who talks to all of wizardkind and not just the purebloods would be much more threatening than a Voldemort one.

I imagine poor Albus` reaction when he sees Harry starting to walk Gellert`s steps.

*** Imagine you live in a small community with fantastic powers. Powers that can make you immune to fire and sword and all the tools of the medieval muggle.

Now imagine those muggles outnumber your kind 100 to 1.

Now imagine those muggles hated magic as a sign of the devil.

Now imagine you have children, who are not yet capable of defending themselves.

Wizards seem to have fewer children, while most characters in canon appearing as only children (or at least are not explicitly a sibling). Wizards have their magic react to their emotions. Even ‘modern' muggles are filled with hatred and intolerance (as happened with the young Dumbledore girl Ariana).

*** I've seen and argument that the Statute really wasn't about wizards being afraid of muggles but about not wanting to spend all of their time and effort helping them.

For example, magical medicine could make a massive difference in the health of the muggle world. So too could spells and other magic help with power generation, food shortages, droughts, defense, etc. The world could easily be seen as the amount of good witches and wizards could do in the world as a whole outpaces their ability to do that good at all. If every witch and wizard that could was brewing healing potions nonstop, it wouldn't be enough. Perpetual motion based power generation could be achieved through continuous casting of basic charms, but what wizard wants to get caught spending 12 hour days at the power plant.

Does great power come with great obligation? Its a moral question, and while its one thing for one person to decide to dedicate their life to helping others, its a completely different thing to have every magical person pressured by muggles to do what they can do to help.

*** In the case of a war between Muggles and Wizards, I believe wizards would litteraly destroy the Muggles (they can create "safe zone" thanks to whatever they do to make a place Muggle Free and Unplottable, can teloport, have mind reading and mind control, not to mention the ability to unleash untold destruction on a miles radius zone). Hell even the "Witch Burning", the official reason for the Statue of Secrecy is almost playes as a joke in their history books (even though it was truly bothersome for wizards, for all their powers, accident can happen like with Nick, and children can't use flame freezing spell or Apparition outside of accidental magic).\\
But even if Wizards can destroy Muggle in a true war, the question is "Why would they bother?".

From what we have seen from canon, Muggles have nothing of interest for wizard (they don't need land since they can "expand" a place, they have no ressource shortage since even a "poor" family can easily feed 7 children and have guests in the summer, and since they mainly use magic to work, they don't even need obedient manpower), and the rare things of interest for them (like the KnightBus or Ministerial cars) can easily be obtained and enchanted for their need.

So when presented with "Witch Burning", some wizards probably thought about conquering the Muggle world. But a conquest would need a lot of effort to submit the different Muggle countries, followed by a lot of effort to keep the populations obedient, not to mention than the threat would not dissapear (some muggles, angry about their condition, could still choose to target magical children as a revenge, no matter the cost).

In comparaison, it was probably easier for wizards to just disappear and then maintain the secrecy (even though accidents still happen like with Dumbledore's sister).

**** While concerted efforts by Wizards(and disregarding their laws) could make the Muggles self-destruct(say by Imperiusing World Leaders and making MAD a reality) the damage caused to the planet would be enormous and I don`t think Wizards can clear out radiation.

Wizards could most likely have conquered the Muggle World until the early 1920s, but after they got airplanes, machine guns, and nuclear bombs, not to mention the massive populational boom, it`s just too hard.

The problem is that humans by nature wouldn`t accept Wizards that easily, and there would probably be several disasters happening due to their actions.

** Really interesting idea. I've been hoping for a while someone might write something like this but I still haven't found anything. There are mostly just the ones with Voldemort. But I really think that this might be interesting for Harry. He was always confronted just with pureblood bigotry but nothing about criticising the Statute of Secrecy like Grindelwald did and not as you are describing it. Harry could really sympathize with Credence and this belief knowing what it's like to be hated for his magic.
