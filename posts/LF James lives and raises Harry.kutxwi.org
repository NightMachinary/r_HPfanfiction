As simple as the title suggests , I'm looking for stories, doesn't matter the length, where James somehow lives and raises Harry either alone or with Sirius and Remus helping him. I have read two one-chapter stories about this, but I wanted to know if there were more :)


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9555569/chapters/21605777][I won't just survive(no you will see me thrive)]] has this, except that James was in a coma for 14 years and he becomes the DADA teacher during 5th year(In disguise, of course).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4019373/7/Common-Sense][Common Sense: A Father's Love]]: The Potters survive Voldemort's attack, but James decides he needs to take control of his life (three chapters, part of a snippets thread).

** Unfinished and the James raising Harry part is not the focus although he did live and raised Harry in this one. Recommending this because I loved the James and Harry interactions: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7552826/1/An-Unfound-Door]]

** An older one, but there's A Different Beginning by Breanie. Not sure which sites it is/isn't on, but I believe you can find it on SIYE.
