Hi! I'm looking for a good young Remus Lupin fanfic. Not the love at first sight and stuff like that I want one where they actually fall in love or they're already in love. It has to have good grammar and space between paragraphs. I don't want a shy OC / y/n because I prefer reading fanfiction with strong female characters. Please don't take any of these to heart I'm not bashing those types of books they're just not what I like to read. Thank you <3.


** How are you with Wolfstar? Because I have a tonne of excellent young Remus Fics but they're all Sirius/Remus.

Linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean89) is the best one. Remus is a little yobbo and it's just brilliant to see him grow and mature into himself, learn to trust and open up, get sucked into different problems. Even Sirius's backstory is explored and explained which is fantastic. All the side characters are fantastic and completely unique/endearing. So strong, you'd love Mary. It's just fantastic. The pairing isn't relevant till like chapter 50 and even then it's not sappy or romantic or pining. More desperate and inevitable.

I've a few others along a similar line to this but Remus is generally a bit softer, more anxious, worried, stammering. If that's how you headcanon him I can give you those too.

If slash isn't your thing then I apologise I got nothin 😅❤️

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??
