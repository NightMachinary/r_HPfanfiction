I've been using the @voice app to be able to listen to my chosen fanfics in the past few months, and I'm wondering who else uses them? Which ones do you use, and what drawbacks/pros have you found in using them?

For me, I enjoy that mine has different accent settings to choose from, so I can have my stories read in a british accent. However, I dislike that it pronounces certain words as if assuming they are the shortened form of something. Things like "I" get read as "first", and when people are trying to write Fleur's accent the "ave" gets pronounced as "avenue" etc etc üòÇ, and I have yet to find a way to get the app to stop doing that for specific words. But otherwise it's been great! I can "read" while I do dishes or whatever else and it's awesome üòÅ


** I use cool reader and it has the same drawbacks but without the accent feature. I use it while I work so I pretty much just listen to fanfics all day lol. Maybe I'll try that one out at some point.

** I use Marvin and it's in general pretty good.

"No." in dialogues gets pronounced as "number" and it uses two different ways to pronounce Hermione, depending on the context. The pronounciations of the Hogwarts houses is rather idiosyncratic and pronouncing Weasley as "wealai" needs some getting used to.

But other than that it's perfect for listening while driving on my bi-weekly 90 minute commute. (Which of course is currently not happening)

** I do. It is really awesome when doing something else (e.g., driving). I use either CoolReader or previously FBReader on my Android phone using native Google TTS.

Sometimes it is quite funny experience, because all TTS systems have a horrible time with abbreviations. Sometimes there is ‚ÄúDrive Granger‚Äù, other systems have ‚ÄúPrivet Doctor‚Äù, there is "Street Mungo Hospital", currently the system decided that the word ‚Äúsat‚Äù (as the past tense of ‚Äúsit‚Äù) is an abbreviation of ‚ÄúSaturday‚Äù, so I have these awesome constructs like ‚ÄúHermione Saturday on her bed‚Äù (sometimes it feels as an incredibly dirty euphemism).
