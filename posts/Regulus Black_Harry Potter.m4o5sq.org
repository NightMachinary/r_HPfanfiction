Can I have this pairing with Harry in the past? Definitely slash please.


** I probably have recommended this one to death but here you go. FDitH: I'd classify it as gen. There is a lot of sitting around with lots of introspection. But the characterization and world building is perfect.

I didn't enjoy [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17229320/chapters/40515260][/A Step In Time/]] nearly as much purely because of the Slytherin etiquettes but maybe you might. But it could be abandoned anyway?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14245221/chapters/32850018][/A Second Chance at Happiness? Maybe?/]] Harry is quite edgy in this but I never quite finished it because their relationship was moving too fast for my tastes.... There is a sequel too.

#+begin_quote
  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.
