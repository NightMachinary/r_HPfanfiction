Where Harry makes a deal with some being to get power.

Over 100k+ words, no romance.


** Linkffn(Something Wicked This Way Comes; Denarian Renegade; Denarian Knight; Too Young To Die).

I can't remember which Denarian story has the deal but I'm sure someone on here will be able to narrow it down.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
