A member of an anti-darklord group older than the Order of the Phoenix by like five thousand years. The world's youngest super spy for the muggle government, a genius already working for the DoM. Whatever. Harry's in a super club before he even gets his letter. Preferably this makes things go horribly AU and not plot regurgitation.

Slash, crossovers, dark!characters and bashing are fine. Please no harems, genderbending, mpreg, romance/smut-centric plots or pottercest. Thank you!


** Linkffn(Grimm: A Fairy's Tale by Krahae) Not necessarily apart of an organization but he does have his own group.

  Pre-Hogwarts. The stuff of legends, myth and majesty were the realm of the Fey long before wizards named him Boy Who Lived. Maeve of the Unseelie Court has decided to take one of wizarding kind's myths, to shape as her own. Vastly AU.
