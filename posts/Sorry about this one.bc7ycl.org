The fic i'm trying to find is one I read a few chapters of a year or three ago. Harry is a metamorph, runs away from the Dursleys (around age seven I beleive), morphs into Vernon and uses his identity to steal all of his money. There was also a part where Flitwick is amazed that he wandlesley summoned a briefcase. This has been bothering me since I realised I forgot to bookmark it the day after.


** Hmm...the only metamorph Harry that comes to mind is The Hidden Hero. In that one he hides his identity and goes to Hogwarts disguised as a muggleborn. He does get kicked out of the Dursleys and does live alone for a while, maybe it's the one you're thinking of?

  AU What if Harry knew he was a wizard and about the prophecy before he went to Hogwarts? What if he was kicked out of the Dursleys and decided to attend Hogwarts disguised as a muggleborn? Harry Ginny
