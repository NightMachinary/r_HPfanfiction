**** Well because Scabbers is a rat and rats are cute, and turning a cute rat into like a teacup would be cute. :) Because teacups are also cute, so yes. :( At least if you pretend Scabbers was a normal rat the whole time. :( Do you think JK Rowling planned him to be Pettigrew the whole time or not? Was he ever JUST a rat?

***** I think the confusion here is you misinterpreted OP's title. He said transfiguring Scabbers into /Peter Pettigrew/, not a teacup.

Having your rat suddenly turn into an overweight man with whiskers is probably more traumatizing than spiders.
