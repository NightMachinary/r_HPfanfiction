I'm gonna write a fic and it needs a setting. Ted and Nymphadora are both cockney and I think Andromeda would have stayed in London after leaving the Black House. It should be an area within flying-motorbike distance of Surrey. Maybe somewhere that was cheaper in the 60s/70s when they would have bought the house, but got gentrified later on? So they don't live in a crap area, but Andromeda's trust fund and her and Ted's salaries as young people would have covered it. We know they had a garden because Harry crashed into their pond. Any thoughts on good settings? Fellow Londoners, please pitch in!


** Harry mentions Voldemort chased him across 3 counties to get from Surrey to the Tonks', if that helps. Personally I get a north london vibe from Tonks.

** Bexley was an affordable suburb of London in the 90s, based on my research for my own story.

***** Your not wrong, I mean the centre of it is affordable.

I live around the outskirts of it so it's a little more expensive bc the houses are generally bigger but still affordable for a avergae person with a job that pays well.

Though I would think that the Tonkses would live in Liverpool, partly bc I'm a Scouser.

****** I could see that. Especially with how Tonks herself kind of embraces the punk-vibe.

*** That's a good shout, and Bexley is near where I'm from so maybe I can extrapolate. The main problem I'm having is I wasn't alive when Harry Potter was set so I'm either gonna do some research or just set it a couple deades later. Haven't decided yet.
