Hermione is the most Shoehorned character in the Fandom. "You thought this was a nice Harry/Fleur fic? But it was me, Hermione!" I've seen fics where Harry is a bigot on the level of Malfoy, and i swear there's one where he's actively raised by Voldemort, and he is still subservient to Hermione, rather than seeing her as "Mudblood Filth"

Yeah, I'm a little jaded. The Books made Hermione seem like a good character, and then the films took away all of Ron's good moments to give them to Hermione, and i started to dislike her, and then Fanfiction either makes her Emma Watson in looks with a Magical Wikipedia brain that's smarter than all the professors, or shoves her into every pairing...

She's shoved into so many pairings, so I'd like to see a cracky fic where Hermione either Is, or is paired with Dio. Bonus points if at one point you get "Kono Hermione Da!" moments.


** Someone should write a crack oneshot where every girl Harry dates turns out to be Hermione in disguise (magical or Muggle) sooner or later. He tries to take countermeasures, but Hermione always has some zany trick to defeat them.
