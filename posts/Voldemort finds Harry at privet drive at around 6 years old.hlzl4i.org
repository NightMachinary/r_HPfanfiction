Looking for a old fic where Voldemort found Harry at privet drive when Harry was young (pre-Hogwarts age) and took him in. Pretty sure it was a crack-fic or at least there was a lot of comedy and i remember Harry been close with Barty Crouch Jr (also remember a few jokes about Barty coming to burn Hogwarts down if Harry got sorted to Hufflepuff).

Also pretty sure it was abandoned early into 1st year
