I am looking for well written Hermione/Severus Fan Fictions. I have been through the FF.Net archives and picked through the popular works so, in particular, I am aiming for something more obscure. Please recommend something that is done - or regularly worked on - and isn't terrible - My Immortal comes to mind for something I would classify as such. The former has, on many occasions, stolen a fragment of emotion I will never regain and the latter.. well, we shan't speak of it.


** I rarely read this pairing but I LOVED [[http://web.archive.org/web/20050203192623/http://www.witchfics.org/fr/index.html][The Fire and the Rose]]. The premise of this fic is that during 7th year, due to a botched potions accident, head girl Hermione and Snape switch bodies (like a freaky friday situation). They have to stay that way for SIX months (!) during which time they come to intimately understand eachother and slowly fall in love. I seriously loved this fic - the writing was great, the characterizations were great and there were tons of funny parts too. There's a sequel that I plan to read too, but I read that it was nowhere near as good as the first part so I haven't tried it yet.

** Yessss, Hermione/Severus. These are all older fics. Some (Heart Over Mind) I know were popular back then, but some may be new to you anyway. They're all nicely written and all have good characterizations. I haven't used the ficbots before, so hopefully this works. (*My read-again-and-again stories.*)

- Acquittal // linkffn(5219111}

- How It Happened Doesn't Matter - Deslea // [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=24819]] Hermione knew sex was a weapon of war. She prepared for it on her own terms, and when it came, reshaped it by her will into something to end the war. What she didn't bargain on were the choices she would lose when the battle was done. Trigger warning for dub-con, AU from end Book 5.

- The Essence of Sunset - shefa // [[http://sshg-exchange.livejournal.com/239729.html]] [At link, can highlight to view more specific summary.] My chambers are dark, lit only by the glow of the midnight moon. The castle creaks with rawness of stone and antiquity of magic, filled with the power welling up from beneath the mountain and the fire of intention fuelled by our four vibrant streams of magic, combined. It is nearly impossible to recognise this expanse of land from just six months ago: pristine grasses as far as the eye could see, cresting on a tidal wave of green, the shadow of grey stone a skeleton underneath. A spider's web holding together an enterprise that, tonight, feels like folly. I had expected to feel exultant.

**** Yes! I can learn new things. :) Also, I see I did not include the summary for /Disguised Affections/: Severus' memory is wiped when he is attacked by Death Eaters. Dumbledore hides him amongst the 7th years under a glamour and the watchful eye of Hermione.

/The Gilded Cage/'s Hermione is not necessarily sympathetic or kind which is different and not everyone's cup of tea. I loved it a whole lot but it's certainly a heavier, harder HP story. And funnyily- I don't remember walnuts featuring at all. :)

I cannot recommend /Being Hermione Granger/ enough!

** Snape/Hermione Fanfics (In order of my recommendations)

Tattered Man by Aurette - Short fic but it is my all time favorite!! It moves fast and is beautifully tragic. It has an ending I've dreamed of for 2 years. Amazing.

Camerado by MillieJoan - Great! #2 favorite SS/HG fic. There was what you could say is a "happy ending" but didn't disappoint with my not wanting a happy ending. Snape teaches Hermione Occlumency and has her initiated into the order with Dumbledore. Sort of Cannon.

Phantom of Hogwarts by Good_Witch - Very good. If you want to fall into a new world for a couple weeks, this is it. They fall out of character a little but still very enjoyable. The ending is happy but I loved it none the less.

Touch the Air Softly by Jessa L'Rynn- Great ending. Severus and Hermione are pretty far out of character and the story moves fast. It isn't really what it seems though so hold on! Finish it!

Denial by Little Beloved- Good. Snape fell way out of character after a few chapters. Normally I would have stopped reading because of that but this was a well written story. It pulled at my heart several times and I stayed. Marriage law fic but not shit like most of them and no, it is not a marriage between Severus and Hermione which I loved. Adultery but not what you would really think of adultery. Worth the read.

If The Choice Were Mine To Make by SCF3- I really enjoyed this. Hermione left the wizarding world behind and ends up running into Severus years after the war. She stays in contact and he helps her while she's in college and to heal. Harry and Ron are dead. Happy ending but not terrible

Pet Project by Caeria - Really good. Angst a little but most of it is a student/mentor relationship with a very slow build and realization of feelings. I personally loved it until the end, it was as if someone else wrote the last 2-3 chapters and made it some dramatic fairytale. Very different to me than the rest of the writing in the story. Other than that, it was perfect. Just stop reading at the last 2-3 chapters and pretend you read it and come to your own conclusion.

I know, some are "main stream" but they are on my order list.

**** I agree with above. I definitely enjoyed reading it and it's fun to come back to but - no offense to you or the lovely author - it definitely is loooooong. As I've gotten older, I'm definitely less interested in reading about super-powered/perfecft characters, as well.

** What E'er Therein Is Promised by Deeble on Ashwinder is the best one I've read (so far!) I've read it quite a few times over the years.

Looking forward to checking out all these recommendations though!
