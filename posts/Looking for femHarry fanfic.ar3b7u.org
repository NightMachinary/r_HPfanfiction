I am looking for a very specific fanfic that I want to read again. It's a fem Harry fic that was turned into a boy by lily potter. I remember that runes were how she did it and that in this story lily potter is not good. I also remember that FemHarry and Fleur are paired together.


** That sounds like "Son of Potter, daughter of Black". The morality of Lily is never clearly defined (Harry is Sirius child, but it is unclear if Lily cheated or if James could not father a child IIRC). Not sure about the pairing though.

*** That's an excellent story but it's not quite the same. The story I read was different in the sense Harry grew up knowing that he was actually a she but was glamoured and no one else could tell or remove it. I wish I saved the story it was quite good

  Harry felt he had lost his chance at family after watching Sirius fly away only for his godfather to show up during the summer. Sirius teaches Harry what he needs to know, helping him become the true Lord Potter. Then the Tri-Wiz comes and the deepest, darkest secret of the Marauders is revealed - Harry was born the daughter of Lily and Sirius. Eventual Fem!HarryxTonks

  Not all is as it seems in the life of Harry James Potter. Lily Potter was not the person everyone thought she was and her child pays the price. Some secrets are hidden under a thin layer of lies and sometimes we carry our prison with us.
