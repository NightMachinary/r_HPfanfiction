What I remember is that Harry is working on learning the Fidelius Charm and it has a bunch of steps you need to matter first. The scene that sticks out most in my mind is Harry in Diagon Alley I believe, transfiguring or vanishing a large group group of items with a single sweeping wave of his wand. I thing Mcgonagall saw this and was impressed.
