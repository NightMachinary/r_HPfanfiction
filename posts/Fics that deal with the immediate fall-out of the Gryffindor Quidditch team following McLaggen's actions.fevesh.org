In /Half-Blood Prince,/ Ron mentions that however much Harry wants to get even with McLaggen for costing Gryffindor the match against Hufflepuff, the rest of team would likely have already have dealt with them.

Any fics that focus on that? I can't imagine McLaggen would be willing to admit it was his fault.


** I have a mental image of Fred giving McLaggen the mother of all bitchslaps, then using a Sticking Charm to attach a receipt to his forehead so that everyone knows he's already been thoroughly slapped and any more would be redundant.

*** While this is certainly an interesting take on the Quidditch subplot, it's not quite what I had in mind.

That said, I did enjoy this.

** I've always wanted a fic where Harry decides to go through with using Sectumsempra on McLaggen
