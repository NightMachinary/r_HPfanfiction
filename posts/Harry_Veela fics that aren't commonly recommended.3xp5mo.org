** Ummm , like no Harry/Fleur or Harry/Draco (which often is a Veela in some fics) ? Maybe be a bit more specific? I saw this one: linkao3([[http://www.archiveofourown.org/works/985941/chapters/1943148]]) which has Veela Snape, very uncommon it seems. I remember reading this but not finishing it. Not sure why though, it's been a while.

  Veela!Fic. Both Snape and Harry have Veela blood and are bonded. From Snape's POV as he tries to work out why Harry isn't reacting the way he should be to their bond.

      So I figured I'd try the two most common cliches in the HP genre at once: mpreg and creatures\. The mpreg won't happen until later, as this might end up being a bit slow\-burning\. I'll add more tags as I add more chapters\.
