** I've just finished reading it and I have to say that it was a rather brilliant take on what a real relationship between Tom and Harry would look like. A very emotional, gripping and dark story, where an abused Harry is actually realistic. So, thank you, for recommending it.

I was kind of surprised how squeamish people on this thread are. Honestly, it's like you have never seen the REAL dark side of fanfiction. This is nothing.

** As much as I like fem!harry, I can't imagine her in any sort intimate relationship with Voldemort, sane or not. It just gives me the shivers. Just my personal taste.
