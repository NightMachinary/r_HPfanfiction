  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

** Malfoy's mouth shut and he gave Harry a cruel smirk after his latest barb.\\
Harry just sighed, before pulling out an empty bottle and peering into it.\\
"Whatcha looking for, Potter? Your sanity?" Malfoy snarked.\\
But Harry just shook his head, "I'm looking for a fuck to give, Malfoy," he answered, turning the bottle upside down, "But it seems my fucks have runneth dry."\\
"We could get more the next time we're in Hogsmeade." Ron offered, before he shook his head, "Wait, no, there's a shortage at the moment."\\
"Tell me about it," Harry grumbled, "I even borrowed some fucks from Gringotts so I could have fucks to give, but now I'm out again and still owe them the fucking debt."\\
 \\
"Hey, here comes Luna." Ron pointed out.\\
Indeed, Luna Lovegood was approaching them, Malfoy using the distraction to slowly back away.\\
"Hello, Harry and Ron. Or Ron and Harry." she greeted them airily, "I was going to go hunting for fucks this afternoon, did you want to come?"\\
Harry shook his head again, "Sorry Luna, I think fucks are out of season. They'll have migrated south this time of year."\\

** Somewhat related, but had a silly idea for one that uses the fact that you lose your magic was never stated and is fanon where the contract literally forces you to compete so if you didn't prep at all you'll likely hurt yourself trying. Crouch Jr 'competed' by entering harry as his proxy champion in the idea, so when harry sleeps in one day Crouch gets increasingly fidgety until he just starts screaming and dives into the lake. I have no idea if any stories currently exist using this premise. One could argue that the goblet works that way in cannon as Harry tried to win even though he only had to compete.

** I've read at least 2 fics where he makes minimal effort.

- Sits in a chair reading a book while the dragon glares at him.

- Wades into the lake, shouts "accio", and gives up when it doesn't work (accio doesn't work on people).

- Lets the merpeople fetch his hostage and pays them with their favourite food.

- /Just/ enters the maze, then sits in a chair reading a book.

One fic had him using "accio" to get the dragon egg. Then he mocks the organizers for bad planning. I think he mentions something about wizards having no logic or common sense. Then he uses "accio" again to get the hostage (he accio'ed the hostage's clothes), and mocks the organizers again. Then he uses "accio" /again/ to get the cup. Every time the organizers claim it was a completely unexpected solution.

I remember one fic where he was so angry that he pounded the egg flat with a large hammer.

**** u/CleverestEU:
#+begin_quote
  this was actually Hermione in Too Many Champions
#+end_quote

First, I must admit that too often I read fanfiction in order to nitpick it apart and seek inconsistencies - both internal to the story and in regards to established canon.

Rather surprisingly - to myself that is - with "Too Many Champions", this proved not to be the case. I ended up reading a coherent story that progressed nicely from the premise till the end. And with seeds for further story-points having been planted well in advance without the way too common blindly obvious blinking highlighting of "now you read this part carefully, lad; it will become important later on, you hear me!?"

Frankly, I enjoyed the reimagining of the events of The Goblet of Fire portrayed in the fanfic. Inconsistencies were few and inconsequential, the writing style (and the general behaviour) of characters was extremely similar to that in the canon books and the few grammar mistakes I spotted may have been simply my own imagination (seeing how english is not my native language).

But just in order to get my nitpicking-quota fulfilled;

- to me it nearly always feels "wrong" when the main characters get referred to as "the couple", "the teens" in the text (or "the duo/trio", which I think didn't happen in this fic, but falls into the same category)
- leaving Ron as "less than a side character" ... somehow just feels bad
- the characters making plans B/C/etc. for each of the tasks felt unnecessary since they never got used
- the last chapter was fun, but felt mostly unnecessary for the story

Overall... I liked this one :)

**** No there's a one shot where Harry uses Accio for the entire tournament. Ends it by summoning the stand the TWT Cup is glued to, since they'd finally put an anti-summoning charm on the cup.

Inspired another one shot where he uses nothing but the Patronus Charm.

**** linkffn(12562072)

Although my favorite part of this story is when the aurors ask him if he has a way to contact Sirius, and he gives them three off the top of his head.

#+begin_quote
  “She has a Senior Auror by the name of Shacklebolt and an Auror Second Class by the name of Nymphadora Tonks on the case of finding him. She's also asked if /we/ have some way of finding him.”

  Confused, he looked at her and asked, “Haven't these people got a lick of sense? Just send him a bloody owl! How do they think /I/ get in contact with him?”

  Harry heard the auror standing closest behind him suddenly groan in dismay.

  When both teens turned to look at him he was staring back at Harry and shaking his head in exasperation. Without a word he then cast an almost silent Patronus and said to it, “Madam Bones, Potter suggests sending an /owl/ to Black.”

  The Patronus, a small bear, then galloped out through the wall, heading south.

  Harry just snorted in amusement and said, “Really? Is /everyone/ in magical Britain that daft?

  “Won't he have up owl redirection wards?” asked Hermione.

  “Any and all wards, including an owl redirection ward, can only be set up on a place---a fixed position,” he replied. “As Sirius is on the move, he will have no such ward set where he is; unless, of course, he's passing through one at the time.”

  Turning to the auror again, he asked, “You realise that, since you can cast a corporeal messenger Patronus, you could also send him one of those, right?”

  The look of pain on the auror's face was, in Harry's book, ‘priceless'.

  Not waiting for a reply, Harry turned back around, Hermione was only a fraction of a second behind him.

  “That's /daft/,” she muttered.

  That's when Harry caught out of the corner of his eye a second corporeal Patronus gallop out through the wall.

  “They're also forgetting they could use a house elf to take a message to Sirius, as well,” he snarked loudly enough for the auror to hear him.

  “Oh, for Merlin's /sake/!” the auror exclaimed.

  Neither teen bothered to look, they just smiled at each other.

  That had a /third/ messenger Patronus sent.
