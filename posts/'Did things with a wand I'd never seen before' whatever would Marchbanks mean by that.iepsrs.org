** I imagine that he just made everything seem effortless. During the practicals students were given I think 15 minutes to do their transfiguration

I imagine that Dumbledore just walked in and with a flick of his wand, did everything perfectly. Probably nonverbally as well.

He might also have showcased more advance transfiguration like conjuring. Or he might have done multiple transfiguration at once.

Multiple vanishing, multiple inanimate to animate, multiple conjuring, etc. All those would have been extremely impressive and prodigious

*** I'd say he also did things thought impossible during his exams for extra credit, like Harry did for his defense owl. He received an award for a ground-breaking alchemical contribution to an intentional conference. Along with his other awards, she probably did see magic that was never before performed.

*** This is how I like Dumbledore depicted in fanfiction. Just effortlessly doing magic that most adults struggle with in conjunction with other things.

I like when Dumbledore misdirects, as well. He uses magic like a /magician/, not just a wizard, so while he's talking to you, he's doing magic. While his familiar is exploding into a younger self, he's doing magic. While he's fishing for some random object he lost in one of his pockets, he's doing magic. It all seems so seamless because he's lining everything up in the most efficient way to make it seem like he's this savant. Having the Elder Wand probably helps as well.

** I imagine a combination of both - a grasp of difficult, old or unusual magic and at the very least some tweaks on a few spells. Maybe some more efficient ways of doing things, or perhaps simply the speed of transfiguration (Harry spent some time adjusting his transfigurations).

I imagine some of the new spells are run of the mill by Harry's time, others perhaps used by professionals or even outdated. Others, probably only the likes of Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Voldemort can cast.

** I always took at as within the context of the exams. 15 year old Dumbledore walks in and performs transfiguration on the level of a transfiguration master. Marchbanks never saw a student do something like that before. Unless the exams were different in Dumbledores time, he wouldn't really be able to do something different than the other students. After all they are told what magic to perform. It's only because the examiner was curious about Harry being able to de a patronus that he was told to do that. As far as I know there was no freestyle section.

*** True, but I guess there are ways you can still showboat while doing the tasks asked of you.

Say, the exam is to turn an owl into a pair of opera glasses (I think that was Harry's exam task) - you could go for a very fancy, fine, maybe silver pair of glasses, or glasses that also have a telescopic vision charm on them, or some such. They could be richly detailed with filigree or whatever.

I think an imaginative Dumbledore would find a chance to be a show-off regardless of the task set in the exam.

** I always took that to be on the tests. As in she'd never seen someone display that level of skill on the exams before or after Dumbledore. Not sure he could really showcase totally new magic in 15 minutes. Even Harry was promoted to perform the patronus charm.

The real question here is how old is Madam Marchbanks??? It seems like an examiner would need to be reasonably experienced to start with and Dumbledore sat his exams a veeery long time ago.

** I think a bit of both. For example, someone like Snape used peppermint in the Elixir of Euphoria to balance the side effects, a masterstroke that Slughorn found uncommon, so maybe something in that line.

I like to think that he did everything in record time and with precision. Conjuration, modification, and things of those variety. If we're looking at fanon for spellcasting then he could've done it with minimal wand movements as well (there's a fanon idea - which I also subscribe to - that wand movements are meant to be discarded, just like incantation, and this is the reason why adult wizards and witches cast spell with just a flick or a twitch of their wand). He could've also done distinct modification over his Transfiguration or Conjuration like changing an owl to a pair of glasses and adding a specific flowery pattern to the frame (this is all just my sloppy examples of course).

Another example - during his fight vs Voldemort, he enchanted the statues to become animated, resist spell (Voldemort's and Bellatrix's spells did nothing), take Harry as far away as possible, inform the Ministry Officials, all with just one wave of his wand. This is another fanon idea - which I like - that you can cast multiple Transfiguration or Charm spells at once on a body if you have certain control over spellcasting. Imagine casting the Piertotum Locomotor, Unbreakable Spell (it is an actual spell, Hermione uses it on the jar in which Rita Skeeter was captured), giving it some command and so on - casting at least three spells with just one wave. That was more than a century old Dumbledore, so maybe the younger Dumbledore also casted multiple spell (on a smaller scale of course) during his exams.

If he's able to cast multiple spells with no incantation, with minimal movement, and make subtle modifications over extreme subjects like a living being then that could catch people's eyes.

There's also spell creation, he could've created his own verson of Avis or Aguamenti or something similar to that to further show his control over Conjuration or any other branch of Transfiguration and Charm magic.

I know a lot of it ended up being rambling and fanon ideas, but hopefully this helped in giving some imagination to the particular event.
