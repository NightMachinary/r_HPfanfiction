So I've been reading "Of a linear circle" and loved the idea of Harry adopting either children or siblings. I do not care if it's adult Harry but I would always prefer if Harry is the older one. Thank you in advance for your help

  Finding himself in another universe, Harry makes the perfectly logical choice and adopts his younger self, destroys this world's leftover Voldie pieces, and tries his best to avoid happy goblins.

** A subplot in "The Witches of Westfield" is Harry building an orphanage, halfway house, and mini community for people who lost everything due to Voldemort's war. Harry even ends up adopting a girl.

** I love the fanfiction Happily Ever After-- it follows Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione et al. in the years after the war. It's over 260k words and there is an equally lengthy sequel that follows the next-gen characters. In the fanfiction Harry ends up adopting children/starting an orphanage as well.
