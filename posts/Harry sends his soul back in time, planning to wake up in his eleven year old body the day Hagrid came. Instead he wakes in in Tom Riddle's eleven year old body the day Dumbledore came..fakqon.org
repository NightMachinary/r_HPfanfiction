*** I know it exists, I just can't for the life of me remember the title.

It involves Harry deciding that he doesn't want this life, he doesn't want to win as Voldemort, unfortunately he knows he has to be Voldemort otherwise the prosperity that came after the Battle of Hogwarts will never happen as it was due to the Death Eaters being brought together and wiped out that resulted in real change. So he decides that since he knows what Voldemort did, he'll do that, and then get his well deserved rest after allowing young Harry to kill him at the battle.

***** Preserving the timeline in some ways of going back in time, or in certian situations can make sense, look at steins gate for an example of how it can be good in inplementation as a byproduct of a method of time travel. Still I get where youre coming from as I can count on my hand the number of times an author hasnt used that as an excuse instead of using it for making a clever point/situation.

****** Pretty much any story concept can be done well. The problem here is not that the same events told f/ a different perspective make for a bad story (although it /is/ a hard enough concept to pull of successfully) but is that Harry Potter is reincarnated as Tom Marvolo Riddle in particular. If Harry's thought process is as psi567 describes, then that means the moments in canon where Harry triumphs over Tom due to his emotional strength are no longer so---Harry-reincarnated-as-Tom is in essence "throwing" those conflicts in his younger self's favor. One of the worst, if not /the/ worst, things a redux of or sequel to a story can do is retrospectively worsen that story.

**** Wow, that's incredibly obnoxious. Like, the reasoning isn't even functional, because all he has to do is get all the bastards on his side, and then murder them in an isolated location, no becoming a genocidal maniac needed.

Not to mention, would the Hat really place him in slytherin? I don't think so. also, the time line was already disrupted by his mere presence.

Becoming Voldemort is pretty much the worst way he could have solved the problem, honestly.
