Inspired by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fby2g9/pseudoscience_and_mythological_bases/][this]] thread.

There are, I think, three ways of conceptualising a magic system.

#+begin_quote
  *The Unified Natural Universe (Science magic)*

  In this view, magic is a part of the natural universe, a phenomenon like gravity, electromagnetism, etc. It may be an unknown aspect of physics, but fundamentally magic is a part of the same system and is subject to laws which do not contradict current understanding of how the universe works (such as the laws of thermodynamics).

  *The Unified Supernatural Universe (Alternate science magic)*

  In this view, magic is a part of the natural universe, but the natural universe is not what scientists think it is. Rather, current science is completely incorrect in its description of the way the universe works, and the universe in essentially supernatural in nature.

  The success of modern science would be explained in the same way as the success of Newtonian mechanics is explained, post-Einstein: it was an approximation of the actual state of affairs which worked only so long as you restricted your domain of enquiry to those phenomena it worked for.

  Just as Newtonian explanations break down when you get to high velocities, so too would chemistry break down when you encounter magic.

  But crucially, it's not that chemistry is normally right and then is suspended when magic comes into play. That would be the third system, detailed below. Rather, in the unified supernatural universe, the fundamental way all matter works is described by the magical theory of matter, and non-magical chemistry just so happens to generate accurate predictions in some cases.

  *The Dualist Universe (Cheat code magic)*

  In this view, the universe operates on two parallel systems. There is the natural system (the universe as described by physics), and the supernatural system. The natural system is the "default" system on which the universe operates. However, in certain circumstances, the supernatural system can be engaged, which overrules the natural system and suspends its rules in favour of those of the supernatural, for a limited time and space.
#+end_quote

Now, HP magic is definitely not the first system. It's just fundamentally incompatible with the universe as described by science. Not only are basic laws like conservation of energy regularly and casually broken, but at a more profound, conceptual level, the HP magic system is one that operates on different axioms to a physical or naturalist understanding of the world. Love is force of the universe, not an emergent property arising out of human brain chemistry and interactions. Secrets can be interacted with, moved and hidden, rather than simply being information of a certain description. The human idea of "food" forms part of supernatural law.

Simply put: the HP magical universe is not reductionist. What we consider second-order emergent properties in real life are, in the HP universe, as real as any physical object.

So system 1 is out of the running for the nature of HP magic. But the contest between 2 and 3 is a closer thing.

In general, HP magic /appears/ to operate like cheat codes: the universe normally operates according to natural law, and magic only intervenes when actively invoked to suspend/override natural law (but bound by its own rules, i.e. supernatural law).

However, it may be that this is an appearance only. Which brings us to alchemy. Here's the key thesis:

1. Alchemy is apparently true in the HP universe, and

2. Alchemy describes the world in a way which is fundamentally inconsistent with modern chemistry.

(Of course, we don't know much about alchemy within the HP world, but we do know that JKR heavily researched real life alchemy as part of writing the HP books and speaks of alchemy in the same terms as the historical science.)

This would suggest that the HP universe is actually running on the /second/ system, and that the appearance of the world normally running in accordance with natural law is exactly that: an appearance only. Magic would govern everything, even when it is not apparent -- similar to how in real life, quantum weirdness governs everything even though at the macro-level it's not apparent.

Further evidence for this second approach would be the existence of magical flora and fauna, which imply the "natural" world is really the supernatural world, and the appearance of there being a natural world is created simply by the Muggles' ignorance of the magic happening all around them.


** The major problem in determining the type of magic the HP universe is centred around is that magic wasn't really fleshed out in the series. Sure, we saw a bunch of spells. But the limits were not tested, or even overtly described.

As far as I can understand from canon, Alchemy is the only known way to use magic in the production of gold, and a rather underused and obscure plot-device in the form of the Philosopher's Stone.

Is changing a matchstick into a needle permanent? Is changing a rabbit into a stone permanent? Does Serpensortia actually conjure a snake with distinct personality (suggesting that magic can produce life) or does it simply summon it from somewhere?

As far as I can understand, magic in the HP universe seems to be of the third type. For muggles, the normal laws of science hold true. Wizards and witches have the "cheat code" which allows them to circumvent these issues.

Drawing comparison to the Marvel Universe here - In the MCU, up until Thor: The Dark World, we hear a whole lot of "Magic is just science humans don't understand yet" speech, suggesting that this world is centred around the first theory. However, in the later movies, especially Dr. Strange, it is demonstrated the magic is all around them and even within them. But only a few trained in the art can use it to effect the real world, often bending/breaking the restrictions set by science. This is quite similar to the second theory.

In the MCU, as magic was fleshed out a bit more, and rather outlandish things became reality, the writers automatically drifted to the second option, because it was the only plausible way of explaining it.

Magic was explored quite thoroughly in the MCU. However, HP was never about exploring magic. Right from beating boggarts with laughter to driving off dementors with happiness, it was about emotional significance of any event.

Would explain why the main character uses the same fucking spell for six books...

*** Part of the problem is that wizards in Harry Potter don't seem to understand magic very well themselves, and most don't have a big interest in finding out. "Where do vanished objects go?" is treated as a philosophical riddle rather than a legitimate inquiry. To wizards, it ultimately doesn't matter, and it really doesn't matter to the plot either.

In the MCU, you have scientists and doctors being the first ones to come in contact with magic. Rather than simply accept it, they are skeptical and demand to know how and why. Audiences wouldn't believe them just saying "okay, guess it's just magic" and moving on. The magical system isn't really any more fleshed out than in Harry Potter, but we are informed that is something which can be understood. A big point in Doctor Strange is how determined Strange is to learn everything and understand the magical system. /We/ don't learn much but he does.

I think that's really where the difference lies. In order to satisfy the audience's suspension of disbelief, the author must first satisfy the characters standards of evidence. Harry is skeptical of magic until Hagrid demonstrates some simple tricks.

Just gotta say to this - is there even a way to find out, short of Vanishing yourself? I imagine any magic is vanished with the object, so perhaps a tracking charm would be a good idea; however, I cannot accept that nobody tried that before. Most likely, the charm disappeared from existence, just like the object did.

So now what? What do you do? There are no remains to follow, no wake to trace, nothing is left. The object simply disappears as though it was never there in the first place.

Also, it's a pretty ridiculous view of the wizards, in general, and doesn't exactly make much sense in the magic system as described. Wizards make up spells, invent them (no, the incantations aren't predetermined, that's ridiculous). We see this with Snape. Somebody had to invent the Vanisher, do you really think someone made that without knowing how it works? That would be like someone inventing a smart phone without knowing what electricity is. Not to mention, spells aren't just "point and say" or everyone could do every spell in one try without difficulty, and there would be no need for multiple age groups or classes. Spells obviously have some sort of theory behind them, and I imagine this is taught during lessons.

Then there are Vanishing cabinets - the way these work is that they vanish everything inside towards the other cabinet. Fundamentally the same thing, except a cabinet has a target.

Also also, who are you to say that the philosophical-sounding "into non-being, that is to say, everything" /isn't/ scientifically (to magic) accurate? That that isn't the definition of the state vanished objects become?

However, most wizards are dumb, inbred or untalented, or all three. So those cauldrons likely /are/ transfigured, but by people who can do it a thousand times without fail. There are no cauldrons which are hollow, or made of bone, or have hair or tails or claws or life.

Don't have an answer to that. Maybe some misguided sense of elitism, like how people buy beef from argentinia instead of doing so at home? Things like "genuine chinese cauldron here!" might be a status symbol. Perhaps other countries also have optimized methods for working materials, like different stones or metals unique to that region? An english transfigurer may not know how to work, say, volcanic glass, or meteoric iron, or platinum?

That's actually true. Well, maybe they just don't want to sit around transfiguring cauldrons all day for a week, and then testing them. Could also be that cauldrons need to be certified by the ministry or something.

I don't think gamp's law states that it is impossible for you to transfigure something that looks like food, all it says is that that food doesn't nourish you. I seem to remember an anecdote from a text that said something like "If you were stuck in the desert, you would never go hungry, for you could transfigure the sand into the most lavish meals imaginable. Still, you would starve, because you are eating your own magic."

***** And yet canonically Transfiguration is permanent and as such another in-universe explanation must exist as to why the Weasley's are poor. Perhaps Transfiguration cannot confer magical properties to items. Or other explanations - there are more exceptions to Gamp's law after all. If you don't like that it's permanent...change it! It's fanfiction! So long as you have a valid reason that makes sense for your story, go for it!

Other issues I found with your argument (though unrelated to the issue of the permanency of transfiguration): Molly Weasley was not seen using transfigurations to defeat Lestrange. Curse breaking does not involve transfiguration. We know that people are skilled in charms and not transfiguration and vice versa (Augusta). We know a mark of a great wizard is skill in both charms and transfiguration.

Edit: Here's some more evidence. “With a charm you add properties to something. With a transfiguration you

change its nature completely; the molecular structure alters.” (The Herald, 7

December 1998

Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig's tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in London. (GoF Chapter 4) In a lot of fics where Transfiguration is nonpermanent, Human transfiguration ends the quickest because of resistance or whatever. Clearly, not the case here.

In retaliation, so the story has it, a gang of McCliverts surrounded the MacBoon dwellings one night and Transfigured each and every MacBoon into a monstrous five-legged creature. [...] The Quintapeds cannot talk and have strenuously resisted every attempt by the Department for the Regulation and Control of magical Creatures to capture a specimen and try to untransfigure it...

**** Transfiguration appears to be canonically permanent, but we don't really see it as completely firm/confirmed IIRC. There are indications that it could be - but at the same time, a lot of the world-building elements imply the opposite (eg, the Weasleys being poor, when if transfigurations were permanent they'd be able to just transfigure everything they need - their family is magically skilled enough for that to be the case by the start of the series). At the very least, it's clearly not clear enough that transfiguration is permanent if so many people get the opposite idea.

Narratively speaking, I also fall on the side that temporary transfigurations being the default is usually more satisfying and lends itself to better worldbuilding possibilities, but that's personal taste.

***** Are they actually poor, though, or do they lack status?

Like, they live in a massive house, they have enough money for lavish meals, only Arthur works, etc.

What we consistently see them lacking is money to buy specialist items, like wands, tailored clothing, copyrighted books, etc. These things can't be made yourself, but everything else can. You also can't sell things you crudely transfigured yourself when there are superior examples everywhere on the market.

Their look might just be their look. Their style. They don't put much worth on a lavish lifestyle or a massive mansion, preferring instead a more "down to earth" way of life.

****** It's pretty obvious that they're poor from the story.

It seems that what you're asking isn't whether they're poor, but whether their poverty has led to them having less stuff - because yes, they do lack money and all those regular wizarding goods are difficult for them to afford, they use second hand wands, robes, books, etc. It's clearly evident that they're poor in universe.

For how much stuff they have, it's kinda hard to say. They clearly are able to grow or afford enough food for everyone, but everything else it's not exactly clear to me. Eg, their family house strikes me as the sort of house that'd have housed them for generations, and acumulated tons of random stuff (my great grandmother's house was similar - pretty massive, with tons of random stuff just by virtue of having been in the family for generations, despite not being super well off and having tons of kids).

If you want another example, the Gaunts are clearly poverty striken, as are plenty of wizards throughout history.

** The difference between the unified supernatural world premise and the duality premise seems highly arbitrary to me.

Foe the duality premise, the universe contains two systems of existence which interact with each other according to some sort of overall meta-system.

An overall meta system which govers both muggle phenomena as well as wizard magic would imply an inherently supernatural world.

To me it basically boils down to a choice between a materialistic reductionist universe and some sort of inherently metaphysical and magical universe.

The second option is supported by the text and is also more fun.

** I think there is an explanation for love and secrets being forces of their own without making them a fundamental part of the alternative physics.

In a nutshell, these high-level concepts are socially constructed. Love emerged as brain chemistry and interactions of evolved beings, became a concept identified and named by these beings, and only then did it gain its protective abilities, because some of these beings had a (perhaps evolved) ability to affect reality with their will alone and believed in the idea for long enough. (The exact form of the protection might be an effect of the alternative physics, because it is seen as a particularly extreme---convincing---expression of love, or for some reasons.) If intelligent magical beings that had come to dominate Earth had been of a species that reproduced by parthenogenesis, love and sacrificial protection would have worked very differently, if at all.

It also explains why sacrificial protection on 4 Privet Drive was expected by both Dumbledore and Voldemort to expire exactly when Harry turned 17: that's when Harry became an adult in the eyes of the society in which he lived, and it was no longer the duty of his parents to take care of him. If Hogwarts had been 8 years, and the age of majority 18, then it would have expired at 18.

Similarly, the emergent concept of a secret became reified because there were magical beings who had the concept of secrets and mostly agreed on what it was, for a long time.

****** You know what I mean when I say that. Things like equating magic to Zero-point energy, or dark matter, or any sort of real-world physics. stories which do that more often than not start making magic just another part of science and therefore meaningless.

******* That's... again, please go see the wikipedia article for what 'science' is. What you're against is the /science fiction/ approach to magic, not /scientific/ approach to magic. Science is the method for finding out the truth about the world; if the world is essentially magical in nature and contains magical laws and rules, then by using the scientific method to research it you /won't/ suddenly find yourself with the conclusion that it's "all nanobots bro" or anything like that. For all intents and purposes, every magical academic discipline---transfiguration, charms, whatever---already /are/ freaking sciences in all but a name.

That's what I was trying to say previously. Stories with the 'scientific' approach to magic are usually called 'hard fantasy', and more often than not, they don't really contain any bit of science fiction or real life technobabble (other than as conscious nods and references).

******** You're arguing meaningless semantics because you can't accept my opinion. In the process, you're being insulting and degrading toward my intelligence, as well as understanding. I /know/ what science means. I don't need your help, and I'm not cognitively disabled.

The point you're arguing is wordage, which is completely meaningless derailment from the point. What I'm trying to argue is the philosophical approach. It doesn't /fucking matter/ what you call it, what matters is how it's understood - either magic is a part of science, can be understood using science, or it cannot. That's the crux of the thing we're arguing, not which lexemes we use to describe it. Who cares if it's called science, science fiction or hard science or hard fantasy, the meaning is clear, and responding to the wording rather than the content of an argument is really scummy and disingenuous.

What I mean is this: Magic, to remain magical, must not be explainable through mundane means. Magic that can be cast through the LHC isn't magic. Magic that can be broken or nullified using technology is shitty and not magic either. All these things, and the ones I mentioned previously, play into the issue I'm /actually/ talking about - that of magic being mystical. It follows rules, but those rules are based on magic. It is fundamentally incompatible with technology. It is based on symbolism rather than hard reality. All these things are true with JKR's magic system and it pisses me off when authors gut the system by making it fit neatly into scientific understanding, because usually, that means that said science can be used to replicate magic and beat it, which then leads to extensive mugglewank.

Stop moving the fucking goalposts, and stop using fucking fallacies.

**** I mean, I entirely agree that Magic is just whatever an author/story needs, but I (and I imagine many others) find it fun to try to codify magic systems. Personally, it's the after-effect of a decade of running D&D games - the rules and mechanisms of a system are interesting. Plus, it's mildly irritating to see people act quite stupidly and not follow the implied mechanisms of their own system (eg. not stunning Pettigrew and chaining up a man who can grow smaller and escape said chains whenever he wishes) so finding rules can help make that work more appealingly.

EDIT - I misunderstood your point entirely there. You were arguing against what the previous person stated about magic being supposed to be magical and mysterious. My bad.

**** I entirely agree - I can understand that those who like more mystical/less defined magic don't like the current focus/tendency towards harder magic systems, but that doesn't make that way the only correct one. Personal taste varies immensely, so I don't see why we should restrict ourselves to either one.

**** most fantasy stories also have there own magical systems

which has its own rules and limits.

some magical systems you learn about all the rules and limits in other systems you only learn about what the system can do.

Full metal alchemist is a great example of a really well defined power system we know what you can do, we learn its limits, we even learn things that let you break the rules of the system but also make sense about why they let you

*** /Must/ we? No. /Must/ magic be illogical and mythical? No.

Those things come down to personal taste. Yours seems to lie on less explained magic, which can result in excellent stories. At the same time, magic that gets related to and treated as science can be just as interesting - at least to me.

There's no sense in restricting it to one or the other, particularly when the base is a series like HP, where the base material doesn't bother to explore the magical system much (beyond whatever 1-2 spells JKR needed for the particular book) and where the world itself was made to be whimsical and illogical. If an author is writing a fanfic with a more reasonable, grounded world, it'd make great sense to me to have people treating it in universe like a science, for instance.

In terms of Sanderson's Hard and Soft magic systems, the main aspect that's important is the rules and restrictions being known by the reader, and having that inform how you can use magic to solve issues. If using his criteria, I'd classify HP as soft magic if looked at as a series, but amusingly fairly /hard/ in terms of each individual books, particularly the earlier ones. Each spell that's used to solve major issues gets introduced earlier on - eg, Wingardium Leviosa in book 1 gets a decent chunk of screen time in how it works and its limitations /before/ it gets used to defeat a troll. If it hadn't been established that magic could do that, it would feel a lot more cheap for that to happen (and would fall into a more soft system, narratively speaking)

**** Fair enough. To be honest my problem with well defined magic is that it often requires a lot of exposition. I like how in canon that's spread out over all of the books. On the other hand, some fics drop a ton of exposition in a single chapter that reads more like an encyclopedia entry or essay.

I like The Pureblood Pretense series. It has a lot of academic discussions, but they are written in the form of dialogue between the characters and are spread out across the series like in canon. I think the author handled it pretty well.

***** I think it can be introduced fairly slowly - like the Pureblood Pretense does with a lot of its concepts, since you mention it. Throwing everything at the reader all at once would be a bit much, but weaving it in as we go along makes it very palatable.

Of course, either approach needs good writing to make it work - the encyclopedia entry/essay approach would fail equally hard with either one!

***** I mean, defining your magic system just means that you know the rules. It doesn't necessarily mean that you have to tell your readers. You could just show them what your system can do and let them fill in the blanks themselves.

Though, if you don't tell them the rules, readers will try work them out. We're nerds like that. That's how a lot of people come to the realisation that Rowling just made shit up as she went. Wizards can supposedly do things that they don't (eg. not stunning Pettigrew) and can't do things that they do (eg. anything ever attached to the Fidelius, but Bill's explanation of the Burrow/Muriel's situation is full of 'em). The rules and limitations she implies are bent and broken all the bloody time.

*** *Hard and soft magic systems*

The idea of hard magic and soft magic was popularized by Brandon Sanderson for world building and creating magic systems in fictional writing. The terminology of hard and soft originate from hard and soft sciences, hard science fiction, hard fantasy and soft science fiction and both terms are approximate ways of characterising two ends of a spectrum. Hard magic systems follow specific rules, the magic is controlled and explained to the reader in the narrative detailing the mechanics behind the way the magic 'works', and can be used for building interesting worlds that revolve around the magic system. Soft magic systems may not have clearly defined rules or limitations, or provide limited exposition regarding their workings, and are used to create a sense of wonder to the reader.
