Did JK just drop the ball there or what?


** I don't think Rowling dropped the ball; I think it's just Harry's characterization.

Harry, having grown up without much of his own, seems to generally be cautious with his money when it comes to himself. He's generous when it comes to other people though, like sharing his sweets with Ron during their first trip on the Hogwarts Express, or giving away the Triwizard Tournament prize money to the Weasley twins.

Not only that, but he has a great example of what "having too much" looks like in Dudley. Harry would want to resemble his spoilt cousin as little as possible, both in deeds and looks.

Most people wouldn't be this smart about money at that age, or as adults. Compare this to a couple chapters before when the Weasleys get a windfall of Galleons and immediately spend it on a holiday.

Bribing is not really his thing, is it? Plus it falls on the same category that the mercenaries do. It's just not a very good idea to rely on people who are in it for the money when your opponent has you beaten on the monetary aspect.

If we're basing this around the time Dumbledore died, before the ministy fell (which I'm assuming, since showing his face after Voldy took over the ministry would be suicide) then there are no Snatchers to catch, and I'm fairly certain there's already bounties on Death Eaters placed by the Ministry.

Okay, this is a hard thing to debate because you and I clearly have entirely different views of the world. For the sake of argument lets assume there are criminals for hire in the wizarding world, just as there are in our world.

I have no clue how to go about hiring some sort of hitman, or a team of thieves, or anything else that could be considered mercenary-ish. You say that someone in the Order should know how to contact these people or Dumbledore fucked up.

I think your view of the Order is very wrong. They aren't a group of fighters, they are an intelligence gathering organization. A bunch of people from all walks of life sharing knowledge. Dung is a petty criminal, he could fence stolen property, but would he know how to hire killers? Mad-Eye would arrest them if he knew any.

This is also assuming that any contract killers wouldn't be associated with an organization that fosters sadism. I say that if these people do exist they're probably death eaters who got a taste for violence in the '70s then put their skills to use afterword.

Now I'll go ahead and say I don't think they exist at all. The wizarding world is small. Everyone knows everyone. It isn't large enough for this sort of thing to exist.

** "huge amount of money". We don't know how much he actually had. What we see is from Harry's eyes, and he's a poor, impressionable child at the time who never had more than 5 quid in his life up to that point. So, when he sees mounds of gold and silver, it could seem like a massive amount, when it is likely just a few thousand galleons.

Which, to be fair, is still a large amount, but not exactly enough to do anything too significant with. It's enough to get him through school, and maybe rent a flat for a year after, but it's not like it's enough where he'd never have to work ever again, or buy businesses.

Harry had a great time in Diagon Alley after turning 'Aunt Marge' into a Zeppelin. He never holidays in Diagon again. He doesn't even try. He asks his Headmaster if he can stay at school, is told 'no' and schleps off to Durzkaban, sad and passive.

Even if we/you/I write so he can't pull it off, it would be in character for him to try and to not stop trying until he got the result he wanted or an answer to his satisfaction.

He wants nothing more than a family but does nothing to learn about the Potters or the Evans.

Sirius sent him a letter by means of some tropical postal bird, a message from some place safe that isn't Privet Drive, but Harry never decides he's a pasty white English lad in need of a nice hot noonday sun to walk under.

Most go for the cliche of him getting money and 'family magic', but never really talk about the people in his family. You raise a point I often think about when you say he doesn't get to know about either sets of grandparents. I could see where he might not care about say extended family, but as someone who only had a single alive grandparent for any time I actually remember I definitely spent a lot of time later on asking as many questions as I could about my others. I know I'm projecting a bit, but the point still stands like you said. He is supposedly all about family, but apart from a wife and kids he never actually wants to know about the rest of his family. As far as we see in the books he doesn't even really try to get too close to Sirus or Remus.

**** The first rule of a life with the Dursleys was "don't ask questions". This is a kid who's been yelled at or punished his whole life for asking about anything, and I think life with the Dursleys had an affect on him that people aren't accounting for when they get mad at his lack of curiosity or outreach or expectations.

**** The way I see it, the Dursley's specifically focused on punishing any expression of curiosity, desire, and independent action. Harry was punished if he did not passively comply, and especially punished for any questions about his parents: these things are hard to overcome.

He still retained a lot of curiosity and independence/self-starting, and when he first learns about magic that shines through: he gets excited and starts reading his books (see where Hedwig's name came from), and asks some questions of Hagrid (but not really as many as he would have, unDurslied). Then he gets on the train to Hogwarts and meets his first ever friend, and his first ever friend is lazy and complacent about magic and does not value studying and makes fun of people reading to learn outside of narrow parameters. It doesn't matter whether Ron is gently teasing or being aggressive: Harry can't take that from his first ever friend, as seen with how he doesn't stand up to Ron when he is absolutely beastly to Hermione in PoA. And so Harry learns not to be too keen about his magical education either, although he still seems to enjoy holiday homework in the early years.

Harry keeps a lot of thoughts to himself in canon, and doesn't rock the boat unless he really has to (or is channelling Volderage through his poorly-dealt-with grief and depression).

** Well, one explanation would be that he is also a child of psychological abuse and as such may subconsciously hold back on spending his own money on himself while readily offering it to people that care about him. Its a interesting phenomenon that people who are constantly told they'Re worthless eventually believe it and never really let go of that belief once they're adults.

But Harry got out of the Dursleys grasp with almost no scars whatsoever - or at least not enough to have the abuse argument on a solid foundation. He does show some symptoms, like his small circle of friends and his easily broken trust, but its by far not enough for a decade worth of neglect and abuse.

A much better argument would be to look at how poor people who got rich fast, normally react. There are two ways that happen regularly. One, which is the newspaper and "10 dumb lottery winners"-Youtube video material, are those who blow all caution out of the window and want to life the big life they always dreamed about. They normally end up back in poverty, often even worse than before. Harry would be on the other side of this spectrum, the people that react with extreme caution to new wealth. There are millionaires out there who still live in the projects, despite their ability to buy any suburban lil' paradise they'd want. They still drive their old, dented car and still work their shifts, because they have a almost panical fear of loosing what they gained. Harry isn't that extreme, he still buys new robes instead of second hand. However, Harry never tries the upper limits. He's content with his Nimbus. He's content with his old muggle cast-offs, because they're enough. What leaves a bit of a dent in this argument is the fact that he'd readily share his wealth with others.

But then again, Harry isn't atypical for his background, so any explanation will suffice.

** This is answered directly in canon:

#+begin_quote
  Once Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, silver Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, *he had to exercise a lot of self-control not to spend the whole lot at once. He had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hogwarts, and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks,* to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a wizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a nasty-smelling liquid into the other player's face when they lose a point). He was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant he never had to take another Astronomy lesson.

Clearly, PoA Harry isn't very rich at all. Sirius later did leave him some money, but Dumbledore's wording makes it indicate that it wasn't an extraordinary sum either:

Two things - first, there's no tuition at Hogwarts, and second, the 'towering stacks' are from the perspective of a rather poor eleven-year-old.

** It's probably a mixture of childhood conditioning (i.e. the constant put downs make him grateful for just the things he has), the lack of access to the funds he does have (vault keys) and the possible avoidance of him being portrayed as being spoiled by his wealth.

I tend to think that the books have always been primarily aimed at children, so these criticisms usually go by unnoticed. Looking at canon from an adult's perspective it seems so devoid of compassion and sympathy - like Harry not even being given the opportunity to visit his parents' graves during Year 1. Even a passing comment of "I am not ready" would have given the impression that others were thinking of his well-being.

When he has money, you can see he discards it pretty easily, what with giving his Triwizard Tournament prize to the twins and trying to buy a solid gold cauldron before the first year. This is because he's used to not having money and thus doesn't think about it. But when he doesn't have money he doesn't think about it and just continues to not have money, which is why whatever he has in his vault continues to be in his vault.

So Hagrid did provide money for train fare to Diagon Alley. Based on that I'd wager he paid for fare back as well, especially since it said he "helped Harry onto the train" home. Hagrid handed Harry an envelope for his Hogwarts Express ticket, but it doesn't say he gave Harry any additional money. I don't think Hagrid would think of gifting him some money (especially since it's the school's, not his, and that it's not ideal for Harry to be wandering around Diagon/Knockturn Alley alone) and I don't think Harry would accept it anyway.

I don't think Harry had any muggle money anyways, based off of his general life at the Dursleys and the fifty pence gift. I think other gifts he's received from them have been Vernon's socks and nose tissues. They're not exactly handing him cash for his birthday, or celebrating anything with him gift-wise at all. Harry doesn't have muggle money for train fare even if he is walking distance to the train. He /could/ fare evade, but I don't think that's in his nature and think he wouldn't do it on the chance that it could jeopardize his acceptance in Hogwarts.

Petunia and Vernon won't lift a finger for Harry. They barely carted him to King's Cross (and going to Hogwarts would get him out of their hair!) and only did so because it coincided with their interests (Dudley's depiggifying). They're not going to be dropping him at the station for a day's jaunt to pick up freaky, unnatural things.

Within the limits of his knowledge and age, he doesn't have any options to get to Diagon Alley.

I was more thinking: 1) Did Hargid give the exactly right amount for three trips (two in, one out) with no change? 2) Why couldn't Harry trade a golden coin with someone at the station or elsewhere for the money to buy a ticket? From what I can quickly google, the ticket costs either 3.05 or 4.15 pounds for a child, and either 6.10 or 8.30 pounds for an adult. So on his birthday the tickets would cost between 18.3 pounds and 12.2 and 16.6 pounds. No matter what notes Hagird gave him, he would have change. Did Hagrid take the change back? Why? It seems much more in character for Hagrid to insist Harry keep the money. The UK doesn't have one and 2 pound notes, the lowest is 5 pounds. So by my reckoning, Harry should have between 2.80 and 3.40 pounds, possibly just enough to go back in to London.

It got one scene, when it, along with the rest of his tour through Diagon, symbolizes his coming into the magical world. He changes his ill-fitting muggle clothes with fitting wizard robes. He goes from the world that didn't fit him into the one that does.

****** That's why I said ill-fitting, not old clothes. By OotP a pair of jeans from when Dudley was eleven should've fit him quite well, and personally I see no reason to throw away expensive probably designer trousers just because they belonged to Dudley

Wait a minute that might actually be reason to throw them away, they've been /places/

By OotP he also has free range (the playground/park is pretty far from the Dursleys' house), so he probably did buy clothes. Or nicked some of Ron's.

** Harry shows his entire life as not wanting to be a burden, so I imagine he doesn't want to spend more money than he earns. I generally write it so that he's concerned about spending the money in his family vault more than he earns it. He doesn't want to be a burden on his families financial history.

** Okay responsers, I'm going to reply to you in a group.

He lives in /a magic world/. There's all sorts of things he could potentially buy! Even beyond practical things like enchanted defenses against the Dursleys. Books, entertainment, clothes of his own beyond his school uniform robes and Dudley's hand me downs... Potions, magical artifacts, better equipment than the minimum specified by the school. Maybe even a mail order book to get some ideas of what he might want to buy.

I just don't buy that a poor kid finds that he owns a room full of silver and gold, the ability to buy things he had always wanted as a younger kid, and then decides to shrug and leave it all there and keep going around as he is.

*** Technically it's not a room full of silver and gold, for one. Also poor people tend to fall into two extremes when they come into money: go absolute nuts (see Weasleys and trip to Egypt) or hoard their money forever (see Harry).

In addition I'd hesitate to call book one Harry /poor/, which frankly seems like a statement from someone that's never actually known lack. He lives in this weird mix of abundance and penury.

**** I wasn't sure how to phrase it. I always got the impression that the Dursleys were comfortable but Harry saw little of that benefit. Things like his glasses would be free in the UK due to the NHS. He sleeps in a cupboard which is likely in the UK to be much smaller than Americans might imagine, and canonically never gets affection, gifts or celebrations of his birthday or his presence during e.g. Christmas, toys, enough food, or even clothes of his own. A child raised like that alongside a child who is given everything and worshipped... doesn't ever want to redress that imbalance when he comes upon money?

Except he does get part of that benefit. You might consider it a retcon but in Deathly Hallows he reminisces about watching TV and playing on Dudley's computer to his heart's content whenever the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves. He hated going to Mrs Figg's not just because she was, well, boring, but because she was boring-/er/ than what he could be doing otherwise.

Except it's a cupboard that can fit a bed, Harry and Vernon without pressing them all up against each other, so much bigger than fandom likes to act though an inexcusable thing to do to a child bigger than a toddler, and not even to a toddler considering it was a three(?)-bedroom house.

True. However birthday and Christmas gifts are a luxury, and the lack of them isn't exactly what I'd use to measure people as /poor/.

#+begin_quote
  enough food
#+end_quote

True again, for Harry before Hogwarts and Harry in the beginning of CoS. After that he just eats in their faces because Sirius, which was the most amazing thing he ever did to them

#+begin_quote
  or even clothes of his own.
#+end_quote

He has clothes of his own. They just happen to be clothes that don't fit him because they belonged to his obese cousin (and he himself is slight). Not having clothes of your own is desperately patching the same pair of jeans for the second year running because other than a cheap pair of polyester pants for work they're the only bottoms you own, but buying a new pair is a choice that means less food or no medicine for that week. /That/ is lack, not what Harry's been through.

You've been given multiple instances in this thread of Harry wanting to redress that imbalance, including needing to be restrained from buying a solid gold cauldron. (Snape would've /eaten/ him, but of course he couldn't know that). I mean, he literally buys one of every single sweet on the Hogwarts Express just because he can.

Our house has a cupboard under the stairs, and it's roughly the size of the one used in the films. I don't think there's that much variation, there's only so small you can make a set of stairs. It was claustrophobic but my 6'0'' mother can sort of crouch in the doorway or inside the cupboard itself, it's just exceedingly uncomfortable. Which is probably why Uncle Vernon's conversation with Harry was not very long.

You could also fit in a child-size bed in there. You might even be able to fit an adult mattress, it's just that the bottom section of the mattress would probably be touching the ceiling because the roof is so heavily slanted.

And for the record, the Dursleys had four bedrooms. One for Dudley, one for Vernon and Petunia, one for guests, one for Dudley's toys. Let me repeat that. The Dursleys had /two/ extra bedrooms, and chose to put Harry in a cupboard. TWO.

Funnily enough, [[https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/coats.png?w=748&h=654&crop=1][two different people have tried to offer a cupboard under the stairs as a "room" in London.]] Harry Potter comparisons were obviously made, and JKR even [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/645608328580759553][tweeted]] about it.

******* Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure your mother isn't anywhere close to the body size of Vernon. I mean, this is the man that Dudley got his genetics from. I have no idea how Rowling pictured him fitting in there alongside a bed and probably a tiny box or chest of drawers (Harry changes in his room). Did he enter his room in the movie? I forget.

But yeah, I've read fics where Harry can barely move without hitting part of his body on something when he's in the cupboard, or where he's been stunted to the size of an eight year old because he had no room to grow. Strangely enough this is always paired with the most horrific forms of abuse. You'd think I'd have learnt the warning signs by now.

And wow, I forgot about the guest room. Probably mentioned around Marge?
