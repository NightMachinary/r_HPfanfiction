** God. This is why I hate almost all time travel soul bond fics. Like the entire 'Don't Fear the Reaper" Challenge by Reptilia28 thing, etc. Where you get a 17 year old war torn Harry crushing on Hermione. It's just wrong.

I guess if you have two time travelers, I can stomach it, but a lot of the time it's just creepy.

** My favorite Time Travel is linkffn(Timely Errors) - it's a fairly short one, involving Harry getting temporarily sent back to his parent's time period in Hogwarts, but it's quite well written IMO.

Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) is also a time-travel /ish/ story that's enjoyable, if you enjoy the premise. It's a much more brutal world than canon, though. I think it might have what could be considered light Ron bashing, but this Harry is so different (and focused on survival) that I don't consider it anything like actual bashing.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) is a strange one, but I found it enjoyable.

Time travel is always a fun one to read, but usually it's a guilty pleasure type read where I wouldn't be able to legitimately call them /good/ - those 3 are the ones that come to mind that I'd at least tentatively put in that category.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Riddle's undivided attention snapped to him with the swiftness of shattering glass. His turbulent magic receded from where it had besieged the shop.

  "You,” he breathed.

  Coiling in leisurely motions, the eager tendrils of his magic reached for Harry, swathing about his limbs and neck and chest with a liquid, flowing fascination.

  "I've been looking for you,” Riddle continued, tilting his head to the side and sweeping his gaze over Harry. It was an appraisal that felt simultaneously like the raking of iron nails and the tender drapery of silk.

  It was so familiar, and yet... so foreign. In the winding streets of Knockturn Alley, an intricate dance of mutual obsession unravels between twenty-three-year-old Tom Riddle and a time-travelling Harry Potter.

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership.

  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.

** Here, it's short but I decided, "Why not."

*(TW: Depressing/abandonment tones)*

Harry was sliding his socks against the Gryfindor common room floor, which was still cold and fairly quiet. His feet crossed each stone on his toes, and as he reached the girl's dorm stairway, he noticed that he was about to do something stupid. "What if Hermione notices?" he though, his forehead wrinkling, "what if Ron was wrong, what if she /doesn't/ have a-" but before he could finish his thought, the common room door began to sway open. Professor Mcgonagal was peaking into the room, her wand pressed tightly against her palm. Harry shuffled up the stairway and into the dorm room being sure he hushed the patter of his feet. As Harry scanned the room, he noticed a gleaming pendant shining in the moon's showering light beside hermione's books that were perched on a chair.

Harry reached over a few trunks and ducked under a handful of scarves that had been hung out to dry. Harry sprung his hand out and glossed the pendant with his fingers, a trance seemingly washing over him. In a rush, Harry grasped the pendant and ran downstairs, and into the common room. He unfolded his hand, and sitting in his palms, encased in a golden ring, was a time turner. He pinched the top of the silver chain that was holding it, and tied it around his neck. Harry then grabbed the time turner, and spun it a few times, as Ron had said to do, then he stopped spinning, and slumped over, light encasing him, and the rest of the common room.

Harry opened his eyes, and to his surprise, he was in a bedroom. Wallpaper seemingly danced on the walls in a floral patter to that Harry had noticed was blooming of lily flowers. A woman entered the room, and laid a baby into a crib, hushing it as it whimpered. the woman turned to Harry, and he noticed something. Bright green eyes. The woman's eyes widened as she rushed to Harry, her eyes glossing with tears. A gentle voice grasped Harry firmly. "Harry?" asked the woman, who was nearly picking Harry up from the ground, "Y-yes." Harry replied, "This is."

The woman pulled herself from him, "And do you know who I am?" she chocked, "Yes, I do." Harry smiled. The woman cusped Harry's face in her hands, which were shaking. "You've got my eyes." she said as she brushed a few tears away, "And your father's face, and you're so big." the woman wasn't hiding her tears anymore, she was letting them drip onto Harry's sleeve. A man walked into the room, and noticed the woman holding Harry. "Who is this, Lily?" the man asked, "Harry." Lily gasped. The man walked to Harry with a firm smile growing on his face. "Do you-" started the man, "Yes, dad, I know who you are." Harry finished his sentence.

Light leaked into Harry's eyes, and as he hugged tighter, he felt his arms touch one another. He opened his eyes, and he was in the middle of a hallway, and someone had spotted him. Snape paced down the hallway, grabbing Harry on the shoulder. "What's the matter with you?" he snapped, "Why are you wandering?" Harry wiped his eyes, "I saw my parents professor. I saw my mom."

** I'm in the process of writing a time travel fix-it sort of fic. There are three chapters up so far and I'm almost done with the fourth one.

The only possible bashing mentioned in this fic is just a few of Harry's thoughts on the past, and it's mainly toward the Dursleys' and Snape's abuse, and Dumbledore's manipulations. Harry mentions a bit about why he did some things he did (such as not buying to new clothes in the past) that is based on him not wanting Ron to feel bad, so I don't know if that constitutes as bashing.

Harry won't outright hate anyone or anything, he'll just be wary of them or he'll be annoyed at them or whatever. Though, how I'll handle Mrs Weasley taking over Grimmauld Place might be seen as bashing since Harry will be against her throwing all of Sirius's stuff away without his permission.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)
