** Drop your real life and dedicate it to fanfiction. RL is overrated anyway.

** I wish I had this problem! I have the opposite problem of not having anything to read. You'll probably be disappointed and only really want to read 80% of them, not to be a downer! Take it easy though, they're not going anywhere. Nothing wrong with having a list of things you want to read, that's always better than having nothing!

**** You are super over thinking something that should be a relaxing and fun part of your life :) just choose whatever random one, put the titles into a randomiser if you must and accept your fate.

** Pretty much, just have to decide what actually isn't worth the time to read. I remember when I first started reading fanfiction, I had the same problem. I'd read it for 16 hours a day. The well didn't really dry up, I just started getting sick of reading the same repackaged ideas over and over again.

Nowadays I feel lucky to find more than one interesting HP fic to read per month.

*** Hey, me too. It also seems that some stories that I read before are terrible now b/c I have read higher quality fics. What would you say is your favorite fanfic or book in general because I can't find any new and interesting books to read.

** Stick anything that looks interesting on my Kindle in my HPFanFic collection and dip into them oldest first when I get a chance.

** I have sooo many things to read as well; I've got a spreadsheet of them. Plus I always want to reread older stuff and that often takes precedence. I should do the Kindle thing too, actually. I guess I'm pickier about dropping them once I start if there's something I don't like, but I'm sure I'm still weeding out good ones that way.

** 50 stories? Amateur. My To Read list is over 400 fics long. I've been working on it for about 5 years.

That's probably not very encouraging for you, actually.

As for actually dealing with it, I've basically hit a point where I just put them all on my tablet so that they're on hand to read whenever I want. Once you actually start a fic, you're more likely to continue, so even if you start reading for just ten minutes before bed, or waiting for the bus, or on the toilet, then you'll start finding more time to read afterwards because you want to finish it.

On the other hand, if life gets really too busy, you may just have to resign yourself to never getting to read some stories. (This may not necessarily stop you saving them, however; that's how you end up with 5yr old reading lists that are 400 stories long.)

*** How do you organize your read later list? Are you simply using the Follow button or something entirely different (because I use the follow list but it get's mixed up with stuff where I'm waiting for an update).

**** If they're complete, I download and stick 'em all in a folder labelled "To Read"; I follow incomplete ones and then download when the last chapter is posted. I always read on my tablet these days so I don't have to sit at the computer (excepting occasional one-shots shorter than 10k), plus I don't have to worry about the fic being deleted before I get around to actually reading it. Other than that, I have no organisation; I just label each file with author and title. By the time I get around to reading them, I usually don't even know what fandom it's from until I open it up (unless the title has some obvious indicator), let alone what it's about.

** Stop reading the lists of new stories!

I generally beat this problem through a combination of downloading fics to my Kindle (so reading doesn't happen where I look up new stuff) and getting pickier over time.
