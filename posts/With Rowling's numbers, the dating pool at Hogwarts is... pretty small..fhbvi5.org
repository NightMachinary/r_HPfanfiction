Given that in canon Hogwarts is the only wizarding school in Britain, and that also canonically nearly every wizard goes to Hogwarts, with the very low number of students at Hogwarts there's no way that a wizarding society with large businesses/a substantial government/professional sports leagues could exist. Those trivialities are beside the point, however. As fanfiction readers and writers, they're beneath our notice. We are much more interested in the dalliances of barely postpubescent British teenagers. However, sadly, it appears that canon dictates that either a very large portion of Hogwarts's many broom cupboards remain unoccupied, or else incest is rampant. Allow me to demonstrate...

If we assume that there is a relatively large proportion of pureblooded* wizards (4 wizarding grandparents) at Hogwarts (40%), and that the average pureblooded wizard is separated from 80% of other pureblooded wizards by 3 or more generations, then if one wishes to keep bloodlines pure, or so to speak, their dating pool is limited to 18% of their peers, assuming heterosexual relationships. Let's say that the average Hogwarts student is uncomfortable dating more than 2 years outside of their age range, meaning that at most a 7th year student would consider dating a 5th year student. There are 5 boys in Harry's dormitory, which gives us a cohort of 40 students in his year. Let us assume that birth rates were especially low in that year because of Voldemort's reign of terror, and that the typical Hogwarts cohort numbers a very generous 90 students. This would make the dating pool for our pureblooded 7th year scion 3 cohorts of 90 students each. If we take 18 percent of that number, we're left with 49 possible dating partners. If our pureblooded scion is popular and good looking, then this is nothing to worry about, they'll have their chances. If not, however, then the dating scene is very, very grim. This is compounded by the fact that in a school so small, EVERYONE. KNOWS. EVERYONE. There's no avoiding someone and their friends after a nasty breakup, especially if you're in the same house. Word would also travel incredibly fast, magnifying whatever teenage awkwardness already exists.

- How do you categorize someone with 1 or 3 wizarding grandparents? I'd assume that this scenario would be far more common than the Pureblood, half-blood, and Muggleborn categories.

#+end_quote

99% sure they're counted as "half-bloods." 2 Muggle parents = Muggleborn, Wizards all the way back to your grandparents = Pure Blood, anything in between = Half Blood. JKR, and by extension, wizards, are bad at math. So it can't be too complicated.

** Well according to Rowling, a vast majority of the population of the Wizarding World is Half Blood (which make sense considering the requirements for the other groups). Also, the potential dating pool you mention probably only works for Hogwarts student, after graduating, witches and wizards have more prospects :

- Younger/ Older students (a 2 years difference is big when you are 17 and in 7th year, but at 25 and with a career, this difference is ridiculous and someone 20 or 30 would become a potential dating partner.
- Home raised witches and wizards, as well as the one from other school, a bit like the Fleur case. When you add the "traditional" world trip after graduation (though it seem to have fallen out of use by Harry's time, or maybe it's just a result of the wars), a lot of wizards may have returned home with someone.
- Muggles, with cases like Seamus or Snape.

Also, for the Blood Purist, I always though that they practiced arranged marriages. Not the "your parent signed this contract so you have to marry" arrangement, but more like "here's a little gathering between 'acceptable' people, so let's just hope the youngs ones find someone they fancy there", well that and "How dare you bring this trash here, shame on you, shame on your blood, shame on your family".

That's the point most writer miss with their "marriage contracts" : if the society is not kind of feudal, starting young (raising children with "racist" ideas), reinforcing it slowly through the teenage years (little comments here and there), driving a few wedges (even Arthur is barely able to understand the most basic concepts of non-magical society) then just organizing these little gatherings and using negative reinforcement is enough in most cases to ensure your children will hook up with someone acceptable. Hell, even in our societies where all of this is not really in use anymore (well, not as openly as, say, during the Victorian Era), people mostly end up marrying someone from the same social class / background.\\
James Potter parents probably did not care; SIrius's were really dumb and did not adapt their methods to his temper; only Andromeda (among the characters we hear about) is really a failure in such a system (although her parents may have been as inept at this game as Sirius's).

*** Don't get me wrong, dating is still very feasible; it's just a completely different experience I feel. People still get married, have kids, and build families in small towns. It's just that true anonymity when dating within the wizarding world is almost impossible given its size. The other concerns I mentioned briefly, however, are much harder to explain away- the numbers just don't add up, but realism isn't why I'm reading Harry Potter so I'm generally pretty forgiving. A town of 11 thousand would be hard pressed to support a mid flight football team in the UK. The idea of a professional Quidditch league (Wood plays as a reserve for puddlemere united) when the entirety of Britain's wizarding population is 11 thousand, probably less, is just absurd.

*** One of the things I'm not very fond of in canon. You have this grand, possibly fate-of-the-world defining conflict, and the number of people who are actually involved are just the equivalent of a small town. It's frustrating that Hogwarts is so big, that the Ministry feels so large scale, and all it amounts to feels like nothing. It's why I like most stories that add new schools, more shopping districts, more students, just an overall sense of largeness lacking in canon.

**** The whole wizarding world always made more sense if you just kinda ignore how small scale it actually is. That there are very few actual magical places, that hogwarts has much fewer students than it seems like, and that there aren't even very many magical people AT ALL in the world, and especially just in Britain. If Harry's year only had about 40 students, and each year has roughly the same amount, that's not even 300 total students at Hogwarts at any time. Just the weasleys had 7 of them, so that would mean there would only be about 100-200 magical families in all of Britain, so probably about 1000 wizards total.

*** The thing is, Rowling's canon doesn't even allow for that. Assuming wizards live to about 120, my VERY generous estimate of 90 Hogwarts enrollments a year, which we can increase by perhaps 5 percent to account for students who don't attend Hogwarts, nets a population of around 11 thousand for all of wizarding Britain. This is tiny, even for a town, although it is too large to be called a village. There are individual residential blocks in cities like New York with that many people. My headcanon is that Hogwarts is a school for the absolute elite, which would explain some of the media attention the exploits of schoolchildren generate, as well as the very high concentration of notable purebloods in canon.

I'd suspect there were a bunch of terms formerly used, just like how historical slave-owing societies invented all kinds of words to describe different multiracial people. All those terms have fallen out of general use to be replaced by the generic "half-blood" because the overwhelming majority don't care. Although the blood-purity fanatics still use them because they do.

My version of the Ministry of Magic under Thickness used terminology such as /mixed blood of the first degree/, this was adapted from Nazi terminology as a way of showing how fucked-up those people were.

For reference, my secondary school had 600 students, which approximately matches your 90 students/year scenario, and that's a pretty standard school size in the UK. Some are bigger (say, up to 1000 students) and some are smaller.

Realistically, a given student probably has like 3-4 potential partners they are actively interested in dating.

Also there are often other schools in the area from which you can choose from, and once you go to university or work you open up an entirely new pool of many potential dates - and with wizard you're pretty much stuck to those 20 people, even more so when you're a pureblood (although some can marry half bloods so I guess they're a bit luckier).

** Only a couple of points to pick out from what you wrote.

You say that if you're not popular and good looking, you don't stand a chance. Actually, it often goes the other way. When there are clearly limited options, people reduce their expectations and standards.

And then you've only calculated on people at Hogwarts. Maybe some folk meet their one true love there, but most probably only date a bit then get serious after Hogwarts. At that point your dating pool increases substantially. If folk don't tend to look to get married until their 20s, which isn't an unreasonable assumption given the longer life spans, and every year you age you're willing to increase your acceptable age range a bit...then yeah, you'll have hugely more options.

So in 7th year you might have 49 possible dating partners, as an average. But 2 years later, maybe at 19 you're willing to date anyone from immediately post Hogwarts up to...23 or 24?

Certainly with limited numbers like these, and with extended life spans, I wouldn't be surprised if it was considered more acceptable to be with someone with a fairly substantial age difference. Realistically once you've left Hogwarts thats you done, there's no university etc, you're getting a job and getting set up for life. So you're in the same "stage of life" from 18 onwards.

** Definition of pureblood is quite contentious issue. I always believed that a pureblood wizard is the same thing as a pure-bred horse (or thoroughbred): the wizard is pure-blood only if both his parents were pure-bloods and so on. Anybody else (who is not a Muggle or Muggleborn) is a half-blood. Such pureblood being impossible ideal, there is some number of generations which has to be kept pure to achieve the status. So, yes, it may come very close to that definition (in the opposite direction) of the Nuremberg laws: “I am not a Jew, because none of my great-grandparents were Jews.”

People who have never heard about thoroughbreds tend to go for a way more simple definition of “a pureblood is anybody whose both parents are magical.” Therefore, half-blood has to have Muggle parent. I don't think it is what JKR had on her mind.

** If the average birth rate in Wizard Britain is 90 babies per year, and their wartime baby bust was 40 babies per year, that would be a 56% drop in the baby rate in a bust year. That is a massive drop, and we never hear anyone commenting on how egregiously small this Hogwarts year is compared to others. In the American Civil War, the birth rate drop was closer to 20%, and in the civil war in Lebanon, there was no noticeable fertility drop at all.

If we're being generous and saying that Harry's year has 40 students in it even though we only hear about 32 students in Harry's year, and if we're being extra generous and saying that Wizard Britain had a baby bust like Civil War America did rather than a steady fertility rate like Lebanon, then 40 wizard children is about 80% of the average wizard birthrate. That means that the average birth rate in Wizard Britain would be 50 babies per year.

Ballparking wizard death rate at average as 100 (since we do see wizards living very long naturally, but most of the wizards we meet die quite young), that would mean there were about 5000 wizards in Britain. Again, this is if we're being very generous with numbers. So the dating pool is even worse than you think.

Word would also travel incredibly fast, magnifying whatever teenage awkwardness already exists.

as someone who went to a school about the size of hogwarts (in fact a little smaller...)

i can tell this is pretty accurate...

** It always bugs me in the fics where Slytherin Prince Malfoy/playboy Blaise/womanizer Sirius are mentioned to have slept with half the school. It always sounds so unbelievable. Like, assuming it's not “everyone is gay” world, some girls would just be in ‘no touch' zone (I doubt Sirius would have slept with Lily for example, or Malfoy with Ginny, Hermione or other muggleborns). Then, some would be to closely related (in canon two only families obsessed with blood purity so much they marry their first cousins are Gaunts and Blacks. I figured other will have a little more sense). Then the girls who are in relationship would be out too. Finally, there would be just those who don't feel like having an one night stand in a cupboard. It leaves just a handful of people, really. Yet, some authors make it sound like Malfoy/Zabini/Black are hooking up with a new girl every other week.

** Headcannon: there are a few boys dorms, Ron Harry Neville dean and Seamus are in one of them, and there are others. There are way more people at the school than there are in actual cannon. “Defense with slytherin” for their year would be like twelve people and any newt level class would be about four, not worth teaching by Rowling's numbers.

** 49 possible dating partners isn't that bad if you aren't swiping on Tinder, and then you have the world outside Hogwarts - there is a reason there are several hidden passages outside the castle.

OTOH, you may have figured out why love potions and polyjuice were invented
