:END:
I need mind bleach. This request comes when I have 1) read stories where the antagonists/villains get away with their crimes 2) read about how the Stanford rapist swimmer got released after 3 months and need to read something where everything comes around.

Preferably in which justice and/or vengeance is attained through violent means. Characters getting what they absolutely deserve. Killers, torturers, traitors, rapists, bigots, etc all receiving suitable punishment, anything.


** A good one shot linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6508764/1/The-Trial-of-Dolores-Jane-Umbridge]])

I like this one because of its simplicity. It happens right after the trial in 5th linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3639659/1/A-Bad-Week-at-the-Wizengamot]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7120596/1/Hijacking-the-Kangaroo-Court]]) it's just what the time entails

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6153844/1/Fine-Then]]) another post trial fic. It's not the happiest ending, but it's not bad per say.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4081448/1/Guy-Fawkes-Day]]) this is a fairly unhinged Harry

One that just finished except for the multi part epilogue. The Queen gets involved. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11500936/1/Long-Live-The-Queen]])

I can't tell you much without giving a lot of ways but this one is basically Lucius Malfoy narrating about how things were after they had won.

The last and my absolute favorite I can't remember the name of. It has Malfoy Sr. Narrating the story about how they won and Harry and all the non purebloods agreed to leave, but it wasn't really the outcome they wanted. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully]])
