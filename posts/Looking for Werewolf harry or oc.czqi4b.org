I'm looking for a good werewolf harry or a story that has a werewolf oc added into the main group but doesn't replace harry as the boy who lived and is just a normal werewolf oc

Edit: Please no Voldemort/Harry stories, that pairing just instantly makes me avoid the story

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

***** Ok, the pairing is just pretty disturbing when you take into account the age difference of both characters

****** Yeah I know. Personally I kinda like the pairing though. Mostly in time travel fics and when Harry is Dark or the Master of Death. I think I know another werewolf Harry story but I think he is paired with Fenrir Greyback so this is probably also not your thing. I could see if I find it though if you want.

******** Yeah. These fics are really rare. I really love werewolf fics. It's already too hard to find good werewolf fics about Remus.

  While Harry had been content with his second chance, that didn't keep him from thinking what he could have done different, how many people could have survived if he hadn't been set on the very specific path he'd walked. Third time is the charm, though, right?
