So, I have been reading fan fiction for quite a while now. I rarely veer from Harry Potter. I have read everything I can find on Fanfiction.net regarding long dramione fics, and quite a lot of severmione. But as I have found, there isn't much Remus/Hermione/Sirius. I've found Lucius/Severus/Hermione which was a fun read, but I'd REALLY love some Remus/Hermione/Sirius. Preferably complete, smutty, and LONG. I read pretty fast so I tear through books/fanfics very quickly so I want something that's going to take a while to finish. Your recommendations would be GREATLY appreciated.


** Well, since you said you read a lot on Fanfiction.net, and you want some smuttier stuff, it'd be best to look on Archive of Our Own, most likely.

Here's a [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Btitle%5D=&work_search%5Bcreator%5D=&work_search%5Brevised_at%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=1&work_search%5Bsingle_chapter%5D=0&work_search%5Bword_count%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=1&work_search%5Bfandom_names%5D=Harry+Potter+-+J.+K.+Rowling&work_search%5Brating_ids%5D=&work_search%5Bcharacter_names%5D=&work_search%5Brelationship_names%5D=Sirius+Black%2FHermione+Granger%2FRemus+Lupin&work_search%5Bfreeform_names%5D=&work_search%5Bhits%5D=&work_search%5Bkudos_count%5D=&work_search%5Bcomments_count%5D=&work_search%5Bbookmarks_count%5D=&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=&work_search%5Bsort_direction%5D=&commit=Search][link.]] I did a basic search of complete "Harry Potter" fanfic, with your R/H/S pairing.

You could order it by word count and see what's there of the 30 stories I got with those parameters. But it's a very particular threesome, so I imagine the pool is very small. But you can always adjust the pairing on this search and explore AO3.

*** What exactly are the rules on smutty bits on FFN? I don't read there and I post my own stuff on AO3, but some of the recs I'm seeing here are making me wonder.

**** Well, here is their [[https://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/][guideline page]].

But basically they allow M-rated stories, not MA stories. M-rated are stories that mature but okay for someone 16 and older to read. So basically this results in non-descriptive or gloss-over smut on fanfiction.net.

MA stories are things you can find more on AO3, which are stories that are explicit and intended for an over 18 audience.

However, very occasionally you'll find a fanfiction.net that is more MA than M. Mainly because the author has managed to dodge a warning and takedown. In fact, several stories get moved by authors to AO3, because of warning/takedowns.

***** Yeah, that's what I thought when I checked out FFN when I started posting again. Most of my stuff is explicit and I'm not interested in sanitizing things for a less mature audience. Thanks for your excellent response.

****** Not a problem. Sounds like AO3 is definitely your place then.
