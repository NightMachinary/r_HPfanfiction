How do you imagine the school was founded? And by whom? How does it manages having different culturural and linguistic communities. What are different classes that are taught there compared to Hogwarts? How do students go to the school and comeback before and after each term? How does the class and dormitory division work? Does your headcanon include different countries inside the school's ‘jurisdiction' than those on Pottermore?

I personally think Beauxbâtons was founded during the Reconquista by both noble Christian wizards from France and liberated Iberia and Charlemagne who is renowned in France for ‘inventing' school in his empire or at least making it mandatory. The initial student body would have been French-speaking children and witches and wizards from Christian families and the latter category would expand until it nearly matched in sizes the French in 1492. I think the student body would be separated by languages and the school would offer mandatory languages classes: French and Latin for the Iberians, Latin and Castilian or Catalan or Portuguese (or maybe Basque?). I also think the Italians attend Beauxbâtons instead of the Dutch and Flanders(?). So it's already settled that the school can is used to have a diverse student body. The thing is, Italians (among others, but they were the majority) were attending the school in Rome which was a last vestige from the Roman Empire. But this school had gotten more and more Christian until it had a direct link of contact with the Holy See. But then the Inquisition appeared and the Witch Hunts started. No real mages really got killed except for some rare Muggle-born children, but it was the concept of it that really made the relations between the Italians and the Christendom turn sour. This coupled with the Kingdom of Naples being integrated into the Kingdom of Aragon made more and more Italians attend Beauxbâtons, which was now independent from any government like Hogwarts, until the Roman Catholic Institute of Sorcery became the smallest school of magic in the world. The fact Beauxbâtons enlarged its student body and faculty regularly through history would explain why the palace has a Baroque architecture instead of an early Romanesque one as it kept expanding and getting changed to match with the nobility and royalty. Today, students from Malta, Italy, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Andorra, Monaco, and Wallonia attends the famous European school of magic.


** Nic Flamel has been headmaster on-and-off several times over the centuries, and is the school's primary benefactor.

*** Isn't it canon that he's the school's primary benefactor, though? He and Perenelle have a statue dedicated to them in the school, but that may be because they are the most famous alumni.

** I think that students study for at least eight years at Beauxbaton since Fleur mentions that they take their OWLS after six years of education and I doubt they are expected to take NEWTS just a year after that.

*** I believe it is bow-batons. Bow in this case the kind that you shoot an arrow from. Don't quote me on this but I think I have it right

**** That's pretty close - to correct it slightly, instead of 'bow', I'd say 'bo(w)' - the 'w' sound at the end is a bit different from the French, so trying to remove while still keeping the previous sounds would be a bit closer to the 'real' pronunciation.

Baton is a difficult one to put into english pronunciation - but the easiest way to improve it would be to focus on the emphasis. In English, or at least in the US, baton is pronounced more like bat-ON, which would be markedly different from the french. I can't think of any english word that has the french '-on' sound in it, but you can get closer by putting the emphasis forward - so BAT-on, and trying to minimize the 'n' sound at the end. The 's' at the end would be silent as well, and probably best to remove to not confuse english speakers ;)

I think the link from tctAkiro has a pretty decent pronunciation that would /hopefully/ make the tweaks I wrote make a bit more sense.

***** Pottermore has it as Bo-batton and I'm trying to place a bit of shoddy school French on it. I'll check the link you mention because I'm dubious about the quality of JKR's French.

****** It's definitely difficult to write out sounds across languages sometimes - the '-on' sound in French is just not really one that english uses, just like 'th-' is really tough for French speakers to get. I think the 'Bo-batton' pronunciation is the one used in the movies, so that's probably why it's listed there... even if it wouldn't be how a french speaker would exactly pronounce it.

******* Surprisingly, it seems I was right about the -on, but I forgot how the circumflex altered the 'â'.

**** I don't agree - 'Bou' sounds like 'Boue' to me, which is completely different in pronunciation from 'Beau'. 'Baton' is also a markedly different pronunciation from 'Batou'

** Hmm - that's an interesting way to make it work along canon lines, but I'm not sure how much Charlemagne would make sense for the Pyrenees. I'd expect his magical school to be on the Rhine - in the center of the Frankish Empire (like Aix la Chapelle/Aachen) instead of on the periphery.

Anyways, I have 3 general thoughts bouncing around in my head for the French magical school. The first would be to tie it in more with Brittany/the Arthurian legends, and general northern/Breton legends. So having it be located more in Brittany (probably Broceliande) would be fitting there, founded by Merlin or Viviane - Merlin is very much a French figure in addition to British, I'd say, so it'd be a fitting connection.

The second one would be having it located in the Loire valley - this is where I most commonly picture the large, fancy, luxurious castle + estate that I think Beauxbatons is supposed to be, and is at least somewhat central in France - making it much easier to get to.

The final is a more major shift, and that would be to ditch the Beauxbatons name in favor of 'l'Academie de Magie' and have it be in magical Paris, with a much more centralized/modern french magical state - it could be nicknamed Beauxbatons, like the Sorbonne is nicknamed instead of 'University Paris 1'. This is the one that I find myself most drawn to personally, with how I imagine french magical society to be - basically, the government rolling in and taking over the existing magical school(s) and controlling the education more directly.

Student body wise, in any of these I'd 100% ignore Pottermore, and do it only for the Francophone countries - with the exception of a handful of students who'd have learned french and applied - but there would be magical schools in Italy for sure in my view (Rome, Milan, and Venice are all candidates there), Spain, and Portugal - even if not as renowned as Beauxbatons/Hogwarts/Durmstrang, I just don't see having one school for half of Europe making any sense to me.
