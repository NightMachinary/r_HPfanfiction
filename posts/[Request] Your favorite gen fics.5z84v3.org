I'm looking for something new to read and thought I'd try some gen fics for a change. My favorite right now is linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) but your recommendation doesn't need to be Harry-centric, I'm open to anything with a good plot and nice writing.

Thanks in advance!


** Linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the thorn circle)

Linkao3(island of fire by esama)

Linkffn(fantastic elves and where to find them)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the forest of valbone)

All complete gen fics.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

**** I thought gen fic meant that it doesn't focus on pairings/romance, not that it doesn't have them mentioned at all? I do believe it has Harry sleeping with Tonks at some point, but I don't recall the story focusing on any relationship although it has been a while since I have read it so maybe I'm totally wrong.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
