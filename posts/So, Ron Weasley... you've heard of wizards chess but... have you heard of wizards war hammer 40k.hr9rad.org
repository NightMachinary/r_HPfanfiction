So wizards chess has alive pieces for fucking chess, and some geeky muggleborn is like " lightbulb" and enchanted the Tao or the elves army or the space marines.

Just a fun thought of the shenanigans that would cause.


** Checking for anachronism... 40k came out in '87, so it's all good!

*** Orks revolt, declare a WAGGGH! on the player, end up in a pitched battle against expensive miniatures. This is why we have the office of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts, because some people ruin good fun for everyone.

***** Tiny figures screaming blood for the blood god while completely ignoring the player orders and trying to kill him (as any other living being inside the castle).

Tiny figures trying to spread grandpa gifts, probably leaving the table to go to the kitchen or the infirmary.

Tiny figures going to the library cause knowledge.

And I don't want to know where they will find the last tiny figures.

** They'd use them to kill people like in Stephen King's 'Battleground', where a guy got assassinated by an army of toy Vietnam war soldiers.

Just imagine Dumbledore's office getting swarmed by the little soldiers enchanted by Draco in an attempt to murder the old man.
