*** Man he probably knows too, if the American magical government is at all similar. They have to have Unbreakable Vowed him to not speak of it to anyone else for him to have actually shut up about it

** Considering Hermione is muggle-born she knows how to act much like a muggle and she might have an even harder time convincing him that it wasnt a practical joke from his opposition. Might probably take a few visits before he even takes her seriously.

** Not well, she is reminded of why Witches and Wizards went into hiding to begin with... Assuming she agrees for this meeting to begin with.

*** She doesn't really have a choice, does she? It's part of the Minster for Magic's duties to inform new muggle Ministers of the Wizarding government, and probably keep them up to date per the chapter "The Other Minister" of Half Blood Prince (I think).

***** I'm not sure a puppet Minister under the control of a terrorist organization seeking the destruction, or at the very least enslavement of the Muggles should be taken of an example of how to interact with the Muggle government.
