Whether it's because Voldemort doesn't exist or didn't kill his parents or its family that isn't by blood... Similar to the 'dangerverse' series, I really enjoyed that.

Thanks!

The first one is a female Harry, but it's a really, *really* good fic. The second one isn't exactly a happy family, but it's still a very popular fic. The third one is a bit long-winded and it takes a while before Harry even appears. And it seems to abandoned. Not sure why I recommended it, but oh well. The next one he creates a family as the fic goes on, but it's a harem if it bothers you. It's the only decent one I've read, anyway. And the last one is a fun one shot from the same author about +Harry+ Hedwig creating a family.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Updated Sporadically---Not Abandoned*

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?
