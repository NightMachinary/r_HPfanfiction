So I'm not 100% sure this fits in this subreddit, but it is for a character in a fanfiction I'm writing and I don't know a better one for now.

Anyway, so in a fanfiction I'm writing, linkffn(9400982) , two of the characters (Malcolm and Morgan) are twins. They've been super close for a long time in part because they are orphaned werewolves in the Marauder Era. Recently, when Morgan got his first girlfriend they've started getting along less. Part of the reason for their tension, though they're still close brothers, is because they've always been the same and now they're not. Malcolm is getting frustrated because his twin isn't a calmer version of himself anymore, and he's confused because he has no desire for girls. Up to this point I am sure everyone just assumes that it is because he's immature, but they are actually both kind of mature for their age and at 15 they're solidly in dating territory. I've personally always known that Malcolm is gay, it's something I knew before I even had names for either of them. The reason it hasn't come up is simply that his life hasn't really gotten there yet. He's been busy on the run, neither he nor Morgan have had the chance to go forth and feel the puberty.

Now, however, the guy who will be his first boyfriend has entered the picture. They've been friends for a while now and usually about this time in the plot is when I start to introduce the readers to romance. Some characters have it instantly, but others I try to do more gradually. Their relationship is going to be so solid because they were friends first, they're gonna be the 'annoy everyone because they never officially title it' couple. (Something my other favorite natural couple did as well.) The only problem is that while Mark (the upcoming boyfriend) has this figured out (as much as any 15 year old) and all of that, Malcolm doesn't. Honestly, in his life, he doesn't even know what 'gay' is. I know that adds confusion, but I've never been in this situation. Add to the point that I don't have Malcolm and Mark in this writing as the 'token gay guys'. Malcolm and Morgan play an important part in their 'Pack' and Mark is important to the main character moving on past her past, involving his older brother.

TLDR: How can I make sure that I preserve my characters without turning them into 'tokens' when I 'out' them as gay? How can I get a sense of realism in a situation that I can't really relate to? Additionally, how can I avoid being a dick to the LGBT community through these characters?

((Also if this is in the wrong subreddit, sorry! Where should it be?))


** I think you've got the right idea in asking us, though it may make more sense to ask the question in an LGBT subreddit- perhaps one on representation in media, if it exists.

Of any 'tokenism' concerns, I would encourage you to treat the characters as not gay or straight or any category, but instead focus on them as the sum of their experiences and the forces in their lives. These guys are people first. I would argue that they're werewolves second, wizards third and of all other matters, inexperienced. It then becomes a question of 'This is what this character feels in this circumstance- how would I expect them to handle that?' A strong-willed, expressive person might be showy about their feelings. Someone still bouncing through the traumas of becoming part-creature might want to sideline anything that further confuses their limited coping skills. If in the end this just distracts from the main plot or isn't very interesting to write about, either change it to be more difficult or dump the concept as unimportant.

tl;dr: they aren't 'gay'. They're people. Things happen and they react to it.

*** Thanks for your reply! It's because they just haven't been in a romantic spotlight that it hasn't come up yet, which is why I worry that readers may take it as 'tokenism'. I think I'm going to use some flashbacks for Mark, it would be a good way to show his relationship with Alpha when it was good so it would serve as a more... anecdotal announcement which is what I'd prefer since they aren't 'token' characters.

** Honestly, if you're worrying about this I doubt you'll be a dick to the LGBT community and will try to do their characters and story justice. :)

I'd recommend reading through LGBT blogs / tumblrs about writing LGBT characters and becoming aware of stereotypes and whatnot so you know what would be offensive to the community. Read stories with LGBT characters to see how people handle them (both in good ways and bad).

I'm always very careful about my characters and make sure they have storylines outside of their sexuality, as well as a defined personality. They should be well-rounded characters where their sexuality is just one part of who they are. If their only defining trait is being gay, than that's a HUGE problem.

As for getting a sense of realism to a situation you can't relate to... that's part of writing... you're not going to relate to all the situations you put your characters in.

True, I guess I'm trying to figure out how to stretch those writing muscles! It doesn't help that I'm so worried about offending people or writing something just wrong. I've been writing the same thing for so long... Ah well, this'll be a good venture!

** Oh My Gosh! I'm an LGBT person! Finally my time to shine!

So I've read through your post twice and the prognosis is... difficult.

Realising you're LGBT is hard, hard to wrap your mind around how you're different from everyone else and hard to come to terms with being what you are. To that end I have only two major pieces of advice to offer.

For the self discovery bit where Malcolm realises he's gay you've set yourself up perfectly for "Holy cow! You can actually do that!" moment, where just being around a person who is out and comfortable in their own skin makes you realise that you could do that (It's how I got my best friend out of the closet). You've inadvertently set yourself up in the best possible way, congratulation on that.

The second bit, coming to terms with it is harder, much much much harder and it's not helped along by the fact that you're (apparently) straight. You're going to have to decide how much homophobia your character has internalized and how difficult it is to get past it. This is the bit where many authors screw up and is the reason why I don't read fics that center around the topic of self discovery (or at least the ones that take place during hogwarts years). Malcolm is already an outcast or (if you've been liberal with cannon) feels like an 'other' because he's a werewolf and you're adding being gay on top of that. For societal discrimination, I highly recommend you do either tons of research (for example being gay in muggle scotland was illegal until 1980) or minimalise it to match today's standards of treatment for LGB individuals. Tread lightly here because this is the part where your being (apparently) straight will make things difficult.

If all the minority characters actually contribute something to the story and are more than just 'that <minority> guy' tokenism isn't something you're going to have to worry about.

I think that covers your questions, let me know if you have anymore or you need me to clarify anything.

*** I'm LGBT too, I thought I'd chime in. Before I realised I was gay, I'd wondered about it for a while. But since I'd never been in love or interested in anybody, boy or girl, I just put it aside as one of the 'guess I'll find that out later' things you have in life.

Then I met this girl, and we became friends. After a while I realized that my feelings for her were more than just friendly. So my realization went like this: 'wow, so I guess this is what liking someone in /that/ way feels like. Oh wait, this isn't a boy... Well, I guess that answers my question about being gay as well.' (Just to be clear, by that time I found it very hard to imagine ever feeling that way about a guy, and I still do.)

It took a bit of time to get used to the idea, and coming out was very stressful even though I already knew no-one would make a problem out of it (yaay for an LGBT-friendly country and open-minded friends). I felt like I had to come out, because I was uncomfortable around people assuming I was straight. After that, it was pretty much a non-issue.

So, if he doesn't know what 'gay' is, you can just make him fall in love first, exactly like you'd do with a straight character. You can choose for a lot of internal struggle, but like [[/u/toni_toni]] said, that's going to be hard to write as a straight person. I'd have a hard time writing it, and I'm gay. So you can also choose for making it not that big of a deal. Now I haven't read your fic, so I'm going out on a limb here, but if they haven't had much contact with society, they might not know about homophobia. They're werewolves, they know what being different is like. Since there aren't any openly gay people in canon (I know J.K. Rowling outed Dumbledore, but since it isn't mentioned in canon we don't really know how the wizarding world reacts to homosexuality), you can choose whether or not homophobia is a thing.

The slash fics I've read can be roughly split in two groups: those with a lot of homophobia, internal struggle, etc (pure bloods being all about reproduction and heirs, thus homosexuality being frowned upon), and the stories where it's just normal. Of course there's a grey area, but for me both these options feel realistic. So it's something to think about, which route you want to take.

If you go for internal struggle and homophobia, I recommend reading blogs, watching videos, etc etc by people who are part of the LGBT-community. Visit [[/r/ainbow]] or another LGBT-sub to read a lot of different views in a short amount of time. And last but not least, a resource you might not come up with on your own: the nanowrimo-forums. There's a thread in the Young Adult-Genre lounge about LGBT-characters, and I think you can find a lot of different places where it's mentioned. Be careful not to go down the rabbit hole though, there are a lot of fun things there that could consume your day/week/life. But the Adoption Society and Appellation Station are great if you need a bit of inspiration, regardless of your genre/topic/whatever. Good luck! (oh, warning, I think the forums there are wiped once a year but I don't know when. September probably.)

**** Thanks for the places to look, and you're right about the options on what the wizarding society thinks. I'd forgotten about Dumbledore simply because his sexuality doesn't come up much, but considering that I can only imagine he'd make/desire to make Hogwarts a welcoming place for all sexualities.

*** Thanks so much! You're right about him already feeling an outcast, he's kinda an obnoxious guy (ie- James P, Fred W, George W, type) but instead of just being that way it's been more of a coping mechanism, and a way to entertain oneself when your only company is your brother. I'll need to decide how the wizarding community feels about LGBT individuals. On one hand I want it to be a beautiful thing, and the significantly lower rate of sexism simply because magic isn't inherent to any gender (though there are still gender roles, to a point) connects to a less homophobic community. However, it is also set in the Marauder Era which was a LONG time ago. This is going to require some more in depth research.... Thanks for your help, I'm happy that I set it up right!

**** Remember that homophobia doesn't always come in the aggressive physically harmful variety. The homophobia could be as simple as having to deal with other kids saying 'that's gay' when talking about things they don't like, or having to deal with people expecting you to live up to stereotypes (watch an episode of will and grace to see what I mean.). Something like this would allow you to create a wizarding world that's okay with LGBT people but also has some issues and misconceptions ingrained into the culture.

***** That's a good point, and especially since so many of the main characters even just don't know what 'gay' is, the idea hasn't occurred to them. With that being standard, I'm sure there will be some misconceptions that can be hurtful, especially to someone who is gay and hasn't really figured themselves out yet. [[/u/mossenmeisje]] specifically mentioned that many fics take the perspective of pureblood families being against it, if only because of reproduction. I think that is a good point, and an easy way to have a society that supports, but a bad guy/popular crowd/government that doesn't. It'll also polarize the good and bad a little more, separating them on an additional personal level.

** One thing is be sure to consider is how the Wizarding community would react, and start from there. Does your story suggest that homophobia would be an issue? Or would it be minimal and perhaps non-existent, similar to how racism based on skin color is, as far as we know? I think that might be a good starting point. Sure, you may have the odd character that's wildly against homosexuality, but I think if you decide how the community as a whole should react, you'll have a better idea of where each character should go. Hope this helps!

*** You're very right, [[/u/mossenmeisje]] pointed out that Dumbledore was gay, and I think that that'll have an impact on how this plays out. It's not something that the character (Malcolm) has ever had to think about, but in my story I've implied that while Britain has it's wizarding prejudices, and a little bit of sexism (it's old school, and I've always felt that there were less women, but that may just be the Weasleys!) America in the story has things like racism and (assumed) homophobia. I think this story is going to be less homophobic, if only to enhance that the sexuality of any of the characters isn't the point, their relationships with each other are a big point though. I'll have to balance that out.

Thanks a lot!
