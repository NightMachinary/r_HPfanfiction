I have an idea for a story that involves extracted memories. If a witch or wizard extracts a memory for viewing in a Pensieve, does the person that extracted it no longer remember it? Is it like making a copy? Is there an element of sacrifice in extracting a memory in that the person extracting it will forget the memory? Can the extracted memory be recovered from the Pensieve and restored? This is one of the things that canon is annoyingly unclear on.


** The mechanic is up to you but Snape removes memories so harry won't see them during his training. I personally believe you can copy or remove with copied memories muted in your mind and in the pensieve while an extracted memory is crisp and clear and as you view it, you can remember what you removed but now have more sensory information than before due to being able to see more at leisure

**** Along with that, I doubt when he gave Harry his memories at the time of his death he was simultaneously erasing them from his mind.

Also a related question: can memories be recursive? Can you show someone your memory of viewing something in a pensieve? Harry probably doesn't have the memory of Bob Odgen that Dumbledore showed him, but could he show someone else his memory of watching said memory?

***** I hadn't thought about it when Snape was dying simply because he was dying and retaining the memories wouldn't really matter. I keep thinking of when DD first shows Harry the device and introduces the concept, but I am thinking that it doesn't seem to make sense that extracting the memory completely vacates it from the mind.

Regarding the memory of experiencing the memory---that's a really good question. I don't see why Harry couldn't share the memory of the first time he experienced the Penseive. It was a thing that happened and if he could tell someone about it, it stands to reason that he could share the memory of it and what he observed.

****** I think I recall a fanfiction where that memory recursion technique was used. I definitely couldn't tell you the name, but I'll mention what I recall of the use, since it seems plausible to me.

There was someone (a woman I think?) who was involved in the legal system, or magical history, or esoteric spells, I'm not sure. The people she learned from kept a long line of memories that they learned from, and so on and so on all the way back to BC times. The way it worked was this: When the first master wanted to pass on their teachings, they would recite it orally to their apprentice. Said apprentice would be much younger than the master, perhaps 100 years or so. Thus, language would have evolved much in that time, such that the apprentice was able to translate from the master's speech into the dialect of the apprentice's time. They would perhaps write it down as well, in the language of the time. When the apprentice, now the second master, wanted to pass on the knowledge, they would put the memory of listening to the first master into a pensieve, and enter with their apprentice. Thus the second master would listen to the memory of the first master speaking, and translate for their apprentice. Then that apprentice (the third master) would enter their own memory of entering the memory of the second master's memory of the first master's recital with their apprentice (the soon-to-be-fourth master). And so on and so forth, ad infinitum. Say you're the 40th apprentice in the line, or even just a main character that wants the info, you could go into the current master's memory of that transcription of a transcription of a... and you would have the present master translate for you, from their masters' words. Further, you can view the evolution of language over 4000 years, by starting at the start of the line of masters and moving through time, walking down the line.

******* I think you (or possible just the writer of that fanfic) might like to read about the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_chant][Vedic Chant]], the learning of which includes a number of exercises to make sure the /exact/ sounds are passed down, and have been for 2000 years, not just word-for-word, but accent, tone, everything.

Not because that's how that fanfic works, but because the ideas resonate with one another. Or perhaps Vedic Chanting was the inspiration for the fic.

Anyway, now I want to play with this idea too.

******** *Vedic chant*

The oral tradition of the Vedas (Åšrauta) consists of several pathas, "recitations" or ways of chanting the Vedic mantras. Such traditions of Vedic chant are often considered the oldest unbroken oral tradition in existence, the fixation of the Vedic texts (samhitas) as preserved dating to roughly the time of Homer (early Iron Age).

UNESCO proclaimed the tradition of Vedic chant a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on November 7, 2003. Wayne Howard noted in the preface of his book, Veda Recitation in Varanasi, "The four Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharva) are not 'books' in the usual sense, though within the past hundred years each veda has appeared in several printed editions.

***** I read a fic awhile ago that had this concept in it.

It had information from a thousand plus years ago, and every few generations it was someone's responsibility to translate what came before them into a current dialect so in essence the main character was getting information that was retranslated many times, was kind a cool mental picture where the intro was HP standing in a memory with dozens of his ancestors, learning what his father, grandfather, great grandfather, learned in the same way as they did. Was kind of a cool way for him to feel connected.

***** A Brother is Born for Adversity uses this. It's a small detail but I loved the idea. I don't want to spoil anything, but one character has a memory removed by Dumbledore that causes the character to be unable to grieve properly. Another character views this memory in the pensieve and passes it on to them via legilimency.

***** See, that's what I keep coming up against. From that, one can infer that there's a removal aspect, but does that happen all of the time? Are there different versions of the extraction spell? What about when Slughorn finally gave Harry the correct Horcrux memory? And then there's the whole aspect of the fake memory he gave him first.

****** Exactly! I've thought about this too. It's really not covered in canon, and my headcanon is that you get an overview of circumstances surrounding the memory, but the actual memory is fuzzy and indistinct. So Snape's Worst Memory would become 'the Marauders were mean to me and I shouted at Lily' with no details. Or even 'someone was mean to me and I shouted at someone I knew'.

******* JKR has said that someone viewing or experiencing the memory experiences it true as if it were happening and that the memory will contain details the person wouldn't clearly remember if they were just thinking of it in their head. Like, what sort of hairstyle someone in the background had, for example. But as for what happens in your head once the memory is in the Penseive, I guess I'll have to make it up!

****** Sure, but another explanation could be memory recursion, as I've said elsewhere. Snape might've removed the memories and then watched them back, to effectively "copy" them. Of course memories themselves have an emotional aspect that I doubt is easy to capture upon display in a pensieve, so perhaps the emotion is left behind, and only the raw information data, if you will, is extracted. So there's a gap in your memories where you remember feeling extremely embarassed, but you can't recall why. I think memory in general is far too nuanced to really capture within a pensieve, or to really even describe as a set of hard limitations.

I haven't actually read your head-canon yet, so I'm not sure what (if anything) you think about /Obliviate/, but imo there's just as much nuance there. Perhaps Hermione was unable to really erase the emotions her parents had over the course of their lives, merely the concrete information within their memories, so she had to fabricate similar circumstances to explain and fit said emotions.

** Another question: what fills in the gaps in a Pensieve's memories (e.g. Places the subject isnt looking at)?

I've read 2 different fics with completely different explanations and I liked both of them. One had the subject's brain fill in the gaps with what it expected like human brains do in real life. The second had magic "film" what really happened and have the pensieve basically produce an exact replica.

The first appeals to me because it is more in line with how actual human memory works, but thr second lets Your character use a Pensieve in things like spy missions and police investigations as a cool tool.
