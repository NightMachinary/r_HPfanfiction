** The Elder Pen: A writing utensil so powerful that it never needs to be refilled and therefor enables its user to continue filling out tax forms indefinitely.

The Rebate Stone: A tool to humiliate the tax man even further by taking back the money stolen from the user.

The Cloak of Loopholes: A torn piece of the taxman's own cloak that enables the wearer to utilize loopholes in the tax code and hide themselves from the tax man.

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

  Unexpected time travel can provide endless hours of entertainment...if you do it right. Under any other circumstances Harry would have done everything in his power to set things right the Gryffindor way. Too bad he's learned a lot since that final battle. Meet the biggest prankster in the Ministry's dreaded Audit department, and with one heck of a grudge to grind!
