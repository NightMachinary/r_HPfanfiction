*** In many ways the wizards have already won without the Muggles ever realising there was a fight, given the way they interfere in the highest levels of Muggle government with impunity.

  â€œWe shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead."

What's really interesting about this is that the British Ministry arranged for a foreign President to forget a call, which also implies a high level of cooperation between magical governments -- far more than Muggle governments.

Sometimes I feel that thinking of the magical community as a collection of magical nation-states is misleading. In many ways they're more like an Illuminati-style international conspiracy with regional chapters.

**** That's true enough for the 90's. The thing with muggles today is that they have computers everywhere, whereas most wizards barely even know what a computer /is/. The more muggle technology advances, the more things will be automated, and even hiding things with magic will cause anomalies that won't be simply dismissed as bugs.

I don't think the muggles could completely defeat the wizards on their own. Wizards are too good at hiding. But muggles could certainly cripple wizard society and make it near impossible to assemble in large groups to organize any resistance. At that point, muggles could be more effective at finding and recruiting muggle-born children than wizards are, and they eventually win by attrition.

On the other side, I think wizards would have an even harder time beating muggles if they started it, given the sheer numbers difference, even if magic was a large advantage over muggle weapons and technology.

Want to kill some muggles? Imperius other muggles to do the job for you?

Or they just use potions to destroy the water supply?

***** You're assuming that secrecy magic wouldn't affect computers just as much as it affects Muggles. I don't see any reason why it wouldn't. Stuff like the enchantments on Hogwarts keeping it hidden aren't some kind of mind magic - it's not magic cast on the minds of specific Muggles who approach the castle. Rather it's magic affecting the relationship the castle has with the outside world. For example, Hogwarts castle has no location. A computer will be just as unable to plot its location as a Muggle mind would be. Similarly, there's no reason why the spells on the Leaky Cauldron keeping it from being noticed wouldn't work on cameras.

**** Yeah, I always figured that even if magic was live-streamed to the internet, the magic being unethical in nature, that an actual war would never really start. Isolated hate crimes, sure, but never a true war. Wizards can just waltz into the Prime Minister's office whenever they want, and as you said, do whatever they want with even other presidents.

I wonder if there's any fanfics that use that as a start-off point? Messing with a phone call like that kind of exceeds the parameters of enforcing the Statute of Secrecy.\\
I've seen a few one-shots that run with it, but not a full length muggle-focused fic...

*** It's not cut and dry for either side, honestly. Muggles have technology that may as well be magic and destructive capabilities beyond what's shown wizards are capable of, and would be able to take out unsuspecting wizards with things like snipers and drone strikes. They also outnumber magicals by like 100:1. However, wizards would be able to infiltrate and corrupt with seeming impunity, and would be able to theoretically take out muggle leadership simultaneously with relative ease. But then there's also the question of the magical knowledge of muggles required for such a thing, and the inevitable magical resistance to trying to exterminate muggles which would serve to further complicate things. /Also/, it would be difficult for muggles to unleash the most powerful of their arsenal, such as nukes, against magicals as their major centers of commerce and government are integrated into major population centers.

All in all, it would be a shitshow.

**** I think you're underestimating one of the key wizarding abilities, which is that of not being found in the first place. You can't snipe someone if you have no idea where they are.

I imagine a Muggles vs wizards war which the wizards did not wish to fight would go like this: Muggles spend years trying to find a single wizard, fail, give up. It later turns out that the Prime Minister's pet cat was an Auror.

** Wizards would win.

Step one. Apparate somewhere, muggle heavy. Steo two. Unleash a basilisk, a Nundu or better a Fiendfyre. Step three. Enjoy.

Muggle can't counter attack with Nuclear bomb, because if they do it will result in heavy casualties for the muggle side as well.

Sooo... If you want a great fic with wizards vs muggle where wizards win, you are probably going to enjoy Rise of the Wizards. Can't link it because I'm on phone but its really great!

*** While there are plenty of ways to use magic to kill people, I think you need to consider what the wizards' victory conditions are. They have an established preference to simply be left alone by Muggles, so presumably a wizarding victory is not "kill all Muggles" but rather "return to status quo".

With that in mind, the key magic is not how to kill lots of people, but rather how to make all the Muggles forget that wizards exist.

**** I think the Fiendfyre argument arose when people started thinking about end-game scenarios. What if the goal eventually switches to "exterminate"? Then even one half-decent wizard left could be the muggle's downfall with those Fiendfyre strikes.

But you're correct. There is no need for the wizards to destroy muggles.

*** A basilisk in an urban area would be /terrifying/. It's one of those things that seems too powerful to not break the setting. It destroys cameras and kills or disables anyone who gets close enough to identify it and report back. How many people would die before the authorities even figured out what was going on? I think it would be plausible (though not certain) that a well-placed RPG would kill it, but how many people would die before anyone could get close enough to do it?

(A lot of wizards live and work in isolated areas like Hogwarts/Hogsmeade or any professional Quidditch team. If the muggles could /find/ them, they could nuke them if they had to, but I doubt they would just because of the nuclear taboo.)

**** Hogsmead is famous for being the only village populated entirely by wizards. If at the beginning of the war, they all move out to other places, it would solve the nuclear problem. I mean, I don't think that any country is going to nuke his own people because of a few wizards in it.

**** My headcanon for mandrakes is that their kill range is actually very short--only a few feet. You can hear it and only get knocked out or a bad headache at longer range. This is based on the actual mythology, where uprooting a mandrake kills /only/ the person who uprooted it, and on they way they were used in the Battle of Hogwarts, tossing them over the wall without any thought to friendly fire.

** Rise of the Wizards linkffn(Rise of the Wizards): curb stomp the muggle world

Abraxas linkffn(Abraxas): arguably the best initial muggle maneuver to finish off the wizards, but the magical world gets its shit together and starts tearing them a new one.

I can't remember if there was a war, but..linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation): muggle technology advanced so far that the magical world could no longer be successfully concealed, at least without completely separating their societies altogether.
