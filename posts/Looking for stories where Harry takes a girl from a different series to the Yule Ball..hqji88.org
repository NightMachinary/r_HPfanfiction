So Harry takes a girl from any book, cartoon, anime, TV show, movie, comic or game. If not a girl from another series I'll also take it being a muggle girl or random witch he knows.

Also bonus points if nobody knows he has been dating the girl or that he has invited them.

​

Thanks for your help.


** I giggled thinking of him going with Bella from Twilight. Why not make it even more awkward than it was?

Harry: Uh...hi

Bella:....hi (sighs)

Harry: ....punch?

Bella: Your breath doesn't smell sweet.

** Try Super Date by megamatt09 (explicit)

linkffa(1135)

Megamatt09 has 3 stories that I have read that had Harry go to the Yule Ball with Kara (Supergirl). They are Super Date above, Rebellion, and his first story in the Ascension series.

  People Think that Harry Potter Doesn't Have a Date for the Yule Ball. They're Wrong.
