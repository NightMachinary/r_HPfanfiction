Chapter 2: Robes, books, cauldron, and wand are some of my favorite wizarding things.

It was not like Teddy had not seen magic before. Andromeda was an accomplished witch and she used magic in their day to day life for most things. Not to mention that when guests came, they were wizards and witches as well. Teacups and pots floated through the air at the Tonks' home, and a broom would follow trails of crumbs and other things that fell to the floor. She even grew a few plants that moved and made noises, variations of muggle plants that were far more magical.

What amazed Teddy about Diagon Alley was the sheer scope and scale of magic here. At home, magic was a comfortable air that wrapped around the house, like a warm shawl that warded away the evening chill. The magic in Diagon Alley felt alive --- it made the air shiver with potential. Combined with all the people shopping and the loud noises they brought, the Alley felt like a city unto itself.

He felt like he could never be bored here. Hand in hand with his grandmother, he followed her closely but his head and eyes were never still. A flash of color showed robes dancing without a body within them at /Madame Malkin's Robes for All Occasions./ Hoots and fluttering wings could be heard from /Eeylops Owl Emporium/, the windows dark from long black curtains hiding the occupants within. Passing the apothecary's brought wonderful and terrible scents, smells that made Teddy cough.

“Alright, dear?” Andromeda asked. The smile stayed on her face, enjoying the wonder she saw on Teddy's. “You look like me when I first visited the Alley, and the same with your mother when she was your age.” A tiny flash marred the smile for a moment before it regrew. “I have been here more times than I can count and I still feel the excitement.” She sighed contentedly. “It is a wonderful place.”

Teddy nodded happily, his attention everywhere as he drank in the sights. He never knew how much he did not know, and here with the cornucopia of magic before him, he hungered for more. Too soon he felt his grandmother stop and a new building caught his attention.

Immense marble pillars towered over the pair and he saw intricately carved words in archaic script. “Gringotts Bank,” he read as he followed Andromeda up the polished steps. Heavy bronze doors, weathered by time but untouched by patina, swung open slowly to admit the two. The interior was as ornate and polished as the outside. Counters ran the length of the long hall; wizards and witches stood and spoke to goblins standing behind them. Flickering lamplight caught shiny metal coins and brilliantly colored jewels.

The two waited in line until a goblin beckoned with long fingers. “Why, Madame Tonks,” the goblin spoke with a high reedy voice. “It is a pleasure to see you again. A fine day for you to grace Gringotts.”

“Thank you, Garnuk,” Andromeda replied. Her smile that she reserved for Teddy had gone, replaced by her cool demeanor. “I trust you have been well?”

“Well as a goblin can be. Gringotts is busy, coins are clinking, and things are stable as they should be.” Garnuk looked down at Teddy and while the goblin did not return the boy's wave, lips peeled back in a sharp-toothed smile before he turned his attention back to the witch. “How may I help you today?”

“I wish to visit my vault. We have many goods to acquire this day.”

“Of course. Your key please.”

Teddy reached into his pocket, fishing for the tiny precious golden key left to him by his parents. Andromeda's look stopped him in his tracks. “What are you doing?” she asked with narrowed eyes.

“Getting my key,” Teddy said confusedly. “Mister Garnuk asked for it.”

With a shake of her head, Andromeda slid her small golden key to the goblin. “He asked for mine. Did you not hear when I said we would be visiting my vault?”

“But...I thought we would be using the money left by...”

Andromeda sank to her knees, pulling the boy into her arms. Teddy was startled --- usually, his grandmother did not show overt signs of affection in public, but he soon returned the embrace hungrily. “Silly boy,” she murmured with warmth. “That money is yours and is for your future. Do you presume to prevent a grandmother from doting on her beloved grandson?”

His cheeks went red from love and embarrassment. “No, but you've done so much and..”

Her lips touched his forehead. “Do not worry. My coffers are more than ample to take care of you as well as me without concern.” She rose again and her hand squeezed his. “Save your gold, child. One day you will have need of it. And if ever I need your aid, as unlikely as it is, then I will ask.”

Relieved, Teddy let his key stay safe in his pocket. His smile returned and he followed after his grandmother and Garnuk. He thoroughly enjoyed the cart ride through the tunnels to the vaults, though his grandmother did not share his glee. “What's happened there?” Teddy asked as the cart sped along, pointing at intricate scaffolding. A network of pipes, wood, and stone shored up a honeycomb of tunnels leading to the surface.

“Ah, that is some repair work,” Garnuk remarked with a face split by admiration and irritation. "Substantial damage caused by the one of the only successful robberies the bank had ever suffered. Granted, it was shown to have been necessary for the greater good after the fact. However, it was a black mark against the reputation of the bank.”

Despite his best efforts, Garnuk would say nothing more to Teddy. Andromeda had only shaken her head when Teddy asked her, telling him he would hear about it from someone else another time. Mind reeling, he sat back and enjoyed the rest of the cart ride. Eventually, the pair emerged from the dark bank, blinking in the sunlight. “Well, with our funds secured, what shall we get next, dear?” Andromeda asked.

The boy fished the parchment list out of his back pocket. He had read the letter and the list over and over since receiving it, enough to memorize the words by heart. Yet he relished the feel of the parchment under his fingers, almost as if it would not be real if he was not touching it. The gold crest on the top of the list still sent shivers up and down his spine --- it was pure excitement playing on his bones. “Robes and other clothes, a cauldron, books, general potion ingredients, a telescope, scales, and a wand.” He looked up and down the Alley. “Maybe we start with the robes?”

As they continued their shopping trip, Andromeda's enthusiasm grew stronger. To the unfamiliar, she maintained her cool reserve, speaking calmly but seemingly detached. But to Teddy's eye, she was bursting at the seams. Her eyes sparkled as she examined the racks of robes, holding them up to Teddy or having him try them on. She tried to enhance the quality of the fabric, politely arguing with Madame Malkin before finally accepting that the school robes were of a certain material out of recommendations. To mollify her standards, she bought protective gloves of tough but fashionable dragon hide and a long warm scarf that Teddy insisted on wearing outside, despite the heat.

Although assaulted by the terrible smells, Teddy still enjoyed exploring the apothecary. He poked at barrels filled with newt tails, desiccated tarantulas, and examined a wall full of jars that held all sorts of materials.

Andromeda spent her time critically examining the quality of Teddy's potion ingredients. She then haggled with the shop keeper over the prices of other things, buying her own potion ingredients. Their words became more and more spirited and when Madame Tonks and Teddy left, both Andromeda and the shopkeep looked equal parts irritated and triumphant, sure that they won overall.

/Flourish and Blotts/ was a treasure trove to Teddy. He loved to read, and here were books of all sorts, on subjects he never even imagined. He took his time wandering the shelves, nearly drooling at titles such as /Cursory Curses/, /Through the Motions with Potions, Perusing the Pyramids as a Curse-Breaker/, and others too numerous to count.

Andromeda, after finding some books for herself, had to drag Teddy away. “You really should stay away from these sorts of books,” she sniffed as she set aside /Hilarious Hexes with Amusing (A)effects/. “They are unbecoming. I expect you to learn how to defend yourself from them and to not use them superfluously.” She sighed at his insincere nod. “You will learn as you get older I suppose,” she said as she paid for their books. “Now come along, Edward, we still need to purchase a few more things and I daresay there may be a surprise yet to come.”

“A surprise?!” Teddy exclaimed. “What is it?” His grandmother pursed her lips, the expression she made when she was teasing Teddy and keeping a secret. Her lips remained sealed as they bought his cauldron and telescope, only shaking her head at his repeated questions.

“Really, dear, you are quite relentless when you wish to be.” Her voice was filled with mock suffering while she arranged the bundles in Teddy's brand-new trunk. She flicked her wand back and forth, watching the paper-wrapped bundles settling themselves neatly inside the trunk. She would then wave her wand, watching how the trunk rose into the air and if it wobbled, she would gesture it back to earth before making the parcels move about again. “I should keep my words to myself and keep you in the dark.”

“Awww, you like it when I pester you,” Teddy stated and giggled at her feigned irritation. “Or else you really wouldn't tell me some surprises. Every time you tell me there is a secret or a surprise and I don't bother you about it you look disappointed.”

“Do I really? You must be mistaken.” She nodded with satisfaction at the well-packed trunk and closed the lid with a click. “It certainly passes the time when you act like this, I will admit.”

“Speaking of the time, sorry I'm late!” The voice was warm and kind, a bit out of breath. It came from behind Teddy and a hand fell onto his shoulder. “I just got back to London and had to drop by the office first. Came here as soon as I could. I'm not too late, am I?”

Teddy felt his smile stretch from ear to ear and he looked up. A man with green eyes under messy black hair grinned back down at him, a faded, lightning-shaped scar just visible on his forehead. “How's it going, Teddy?”
