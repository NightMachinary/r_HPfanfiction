  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

** Saved this one to comment on later and then totally forgot. I hope you're still looking for one-shots!

One-shots

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13502309/1/Molly-Weasley-and-the-Second-Cousin][Molly Weasley and the Second Cousin]] is the true story of her Squib accountant cousin.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/839169][The Uncle]] is a little similar in that a character is part of the Muggle underworld.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7432218/olivieblake][OlivieBlake]] has two series of one-shots, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12337045/1/Draught-of-Living-Death][Draught of Living Death]] for the darker side and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11995576/1/Amortentia][Amortentia]] for light fluff. I loved the Draught of Living Death, but I never truly grew out of my emo goth stage in high school. *shruggies*
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium][Memorium]] isn't the best written, tbh, but I really appreciated the concept. It's basically examining how the wizards relying on memory altering to hide their world affects the Muggles in their path.
- In a similar vein (i.e., not the best written, but an interesting concept), I present to you [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13204936/1/Hermione-Granger-and-The-Obliviated-Parents][Hermione Granger and The Obliviated Parents]]. It's a oneshot from Hermione's parents' perspective twenty years after the war looking back on how Hermione's obliviation affected their relationship.
- In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4180686/1/Across-the-Universe][Across the Universe]], Harry ends up in a different universe where he's not the BWL. It's not the main focus of the story, though. The story is more about broken people healing.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero][A Hero]] is from Dudley's POV. It won the Quibbler Awards (not sure what that is, but included in case it's relevant). In this, Dudley reads a story with an abusive family and, through it, is able to realize that his own family was abusive to Harry. Vernon and Petunia do not take this realization well.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3052359/1/To-Live-Nobly][To Live Nobly]] is an AU in which the Dark Lord wins. Our protagonist is sleepwalking through life. A chance meeting with a familiar face wakes him up...
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1712551/1/Folly][Folly]] is an ancient one-shot from 2004 when I was super active in the fandom ('tis true, I am a relic of The Old Days before anyone had even heard of horcruxes). It's Snape's POV on Harry post OotP. Maybe a little emo, but we must respect the old traditions.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1089507/1/Je-Te-Plumerais][Je Te Plumerais]] was written in 2002. (A moment of silence for bygone times. This fic was published a mere two weeks after the release of the Chamber of Secrets film.) Harry and a Death Eater are caged together. At least one of them goes a bit mad. There are two more one-shots written in this universe.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896][Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails]] is perhaps the most unique fic I've read in the fandom. The writing style and concept are just totally different than anything else I've read. You'll note that I'm not giving up any information; it's best to go into this one blind.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/640449][Here's The Pencil, Make It Work]] is a lovely little fluffy piece by an author who excels at writing lovely little fluffy pieces. In this one, Harry meets Malfoy working at a coffee shop in muggle London.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2304488][Draco Malfoy: Toilet Supremo]] is a gem. In this amusing fic, Harry must buy a toilet. Who comes to the appointment but Malfoy, Lord of Toilets. (this came from a prompt)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16435904][yer a wizard, dudley]] is a weirdly touching oneshot that asks, "What if Dudley was a wizard, too?" Dudley's still a little shit in this world. Fortunately, he gets spotted by 7th year Tonks.

#+begin_quote
  Nymphadora Tonks kept an eye out at Hogwarts for Muggleborns, because her father Ted was one. Tonks also kept an eye out for anxious spoiled brats, because, according to Andromeda, her mother had been one, once.
#+end_quote

- By the same author in the same "what if series" comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7900501][the girl who lived (again)]]. In this case (again) refers to the fact that the author had previously put out a girl who lived in this same what if line. Anyway, here's the first few sentences that should summarize it: "When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy."
- same author in what if series comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836][the heir of something or other]] wherein Harry doesn't request to be placed in Gryffindor and goes into Slytherin. Harry does not immediately fall in with everyone else. Snape still hates him.
- same author, same what if series comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3073562][the family evans]]: what if Petunia really and truly took in Harry. "

#+begin_quote
  Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).

  Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.
#+end_quote

Honestly, I recommend just reading the whole series

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/359705][Draco Malfoy, It's Your Lucky Day]] is an 8th year Hogwarts fic. It's by Faith Wood. If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, she has three of the top ten stories. Draco comes to with an injured, unconscious Harry Potter in the middle of the Forbidden Forest and without any memory of how he got there.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17123729][Around You Moves]] is the sweetest little ficlet. I super love dense gay characters. It was inspired by a Reddit post on AITA. OP was roommates with a gay friend and got super mad when his roommate brought home guys. Finally in the comments someone was like, "Sounds like you're jealous" and OP realized that a.) he was gay and b.) he had a massive crush on the roommate.
- I didn't realize that Draco working through his trauma while living with Muggles was a subgenre, but I am 100% here for it. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20946260][Faint Indirections]], Harry and Draco unexpectedly meet in Boston. Harry is working in a University Library where Draco is studying.
- If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the number one result. I quite resisted reading it for a while. I thought the summary sounded unbearably dumb. But then I caved. And so did mah heart. Check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/234222][Then Comes a Mist and a Weeping Rain]] for an 8th year fluffy oneshot by a very popular and prolific author.

#+begin_quote
  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."

  Harry did not know this and would not know this until Mrs. Granger mentioned it casually over a Christmas dinner years and years later-- but she and Mr. Granger reported the Dursleys for child abuse and neglect, over and over.The reports got lost-- minds scrubbed down, papers vanished-- but they kept calling in reports. They considered kidnapping. They couldn't imagine why the wizarding world might want to keep their chosen one somewhere so toxic, why they might want to keep this underfed child and his messy hair with those people."My mother left me a blood protection spell," said Harry, whose scar had not ached in years. He poked at his mashed potatoes under the focused attention of Mrs. Granger's stern little forehead wrinkle. "I had to live with family, blood family.""Then they should have made them treat you right," Mrs. Granger said, as though it was that simple.Mr. Granger gave Harry another helping of peas.
