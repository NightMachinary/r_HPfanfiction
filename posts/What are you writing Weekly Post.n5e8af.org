** I finished Chapter 150 of my fic and it feels like a good accomplishment, especially with Chapters 151 - 153 almost ready to post. The best parts to write have been the dragons, Auror chases/duels, and exploring the liberties I am taking with space manipulation magic. The hardest parts have been trying to walk the line between bashing Dumbledore and giving him enough backstory and reason for his canon decisions. I wanted to flesh out his character and show that he was traumatized from the first war and go through his failures, and damn if that is not hard to do. He is complex, been through some shit, and I wanted to show that. It's made for a darker take, which is fine. It's a thriller for sure.

#+begin_quote
  Charlie Weasley's classmate Aaron disappeared in 1991; vanishing while the magical world was locked in turmoil. Aaron is presumed dead - or worse - until 1994, when he arrives at The Burrow through a blood-soaked tear in space. His sudden return - and a series of terrorist attacks that have the signatures of the Death Eaters all over them - has gotten Alastor Moody's attention, and he has some questions for his former prot√©g√©.But, what happened to Aaron isn't straightforward. Ten years earlier, a dragon-obsessed redhead, a hand magic prodigy, a jokester metamorphmagus, and a kid who can't even use magic - or so he thinks - arrive at Hogwarts as a controversial act threatens muggle-born autonomy. Within months of its conception, muggle-borns across the UK are being found dead. The class of 1984 soon find themselves involved in a series of interconnected events that lead to the killers, Aaron's disappearance, and the Second Wizarding War.

A time travel fic where Sirius goes back to his 5th year after he falls through the veil. I couldn't believe how few marauder era time travel fics actually had a marauder be the time traveler! So I wrote one myself.

  Sirius Black wakes up, and he is surrounded by imposters. There's James Potter, except James is dead because of him and he'll never be back. There's Peter Pettigrew, except Peter is a traitor and not his young friend. There's Remus Lupin, except Remus is miserable and has been alone for 12 years, not this happy boy seemingly in love with him.But if this is all he'll ever have, if he can live in this dream and enjoy the best years of his life again, Sirius is more than happy to pretend. Once he stops panicking, at least.(A time travel fic, where Sirius finds himself in fifth year after he falls through the veil)

‚ÄúHere, let me see that.‚Äù Thomas Day snatched a piece of paper out of Louis Nolan's hands before kicking him in the rear end.

On the paper was a clear and concise message that even the most beef-witted person could understand. Thomas crumpled it up, took out a clean sheet of paper, and wrote a vague, unclear order upon it.

** I am currently planning the 6th chapter of my first official fanfic of my career " /Carly Potter and The Serpent's Spy/ ". The time setting would be from PS-GoF. The short description:

/‚ùùTrust no one, not even our closest friends‚ùû/

/It all started when Carly, twin sister of the famous Harry Potter, received a letter from a gigantic man stating that she and her brother will attend a magic school for witches and wizards called Hogwarts, their parents apparently attended this school. As Carly adjusted in the magical school, she became a magical prodigy. In her very first year, things have gone unusual, even for wizarding standards. An unknown student slipped up and spilled information about 'getting to know the Potters more' and that unknown student called themselves 'The Serpent's Spy'. Carly teams up with her new trustworthy friends, Ophelia and Victoria, to catch this spy to protect Harry, no matter what it takes, like getting killed, or worse, expelled./

/But was Harry really the target victim?/

The first chapter is already out on my [[https://www.wattpad.com/user/moonyxme][Wattpad]] and fanfiction. net account. I am most active and communicative at Wattpad though. This is also the first book of the /Carly Potter duology!/ I am accepting and encouraging constructive criticism since I'm a new ff writer, you can dm me on Wattpad or my Insta, my username on both platforms is "moonyxme"

Note: my goal is updating every other Saturday and Sunday (not sure about that, I am lazy)

Thank you for your time!

** I finished year four of my female Harry, Guardian Snape series. 239,855 words and it's a huge relief that the first draft is done. I sent it off to my beta and now I'm not going to think about it for a few weeks (well, I'm going to try not to think about it for a few weeks).

I started outlining year five, somehow in the last four months I'd forgotten how much I hate outlining, it's definitely the worst part of the writing process for me (but oh so necessary if I actually want to finish anything and have appropriate foreshadowing).

Year three is currently being posted and I'm excited what people will think with what I do with it. The Sirius escaped from Azkaban is more of a subplot, with the Dementors and female Harry's past taking on more of the main plot. We also spend some time with Remus and a little more time with Draco.

Here's a link to year one (also on ffn if you prefer to read there):

*** Whats your outlining process like? I'm trying to find a better way to get more organized and actually make some progress with a fic I want to write.

Curious how other fic writers do it.

**** First I write down a short description of every scene I've imagined for the fic. Who, where, what, when, and maybe why or the goal of the scene (For example ‚ÄúHarry and Ron talk about the quidditch team try-outs in the Gryffindor common room in September. Ron is nervous about making the team but Harry reassures him. Friendship moment, with humor from minor characters‚Äù). I include any notes that are important to me that I might forget later, and sometimes include dialogue that I've imagined if I particularly like it.

After I have a list of scenes I start organizing them in chronological order (if your story is not chronological you'd want to change this). From there I'm able to see what is missing and start collecting scenes into chapters and imagining scenes to fill in the gaps.

For me this whole process for a fic about this size takes 1-2 weeks.

Then I start writing from the beginning. As I write I amend my outline - changing scenes that no longer make sense, adding scenes when an unexpected subplot happens, deleting scenes if there isn't a real reason for them. Sometimes when I sit down to write, the scene goes somewhere else and I have to evaluate if I'm keeping what I wrote, if I'm adding to it, or if something needs to change. I think the main goal here is not to feel shackled to your outline. Things develop organically in your story that you can't anticipate while outline. Take the time to occasionally assess where you're heading and what might need to change.

When I finish writing a scene I read the description for my next scene in the outline, that way I can be working on it in the back of my mind before I sit down to write again.

I hope any of this is helpful!

***** This is a great description. I actually do it the same exact way and have been wondering what others do.

My only difference is i have random notes on my phone for when i get a sudden idea. It's good until i can sit back down at my laptop.

***** I do something extremely similar. I also have a "World building" part. Things that effect the world but not the plot go there, normally with notations that I picked up from the Author Jonathon Stroud's outlining style. For example, if I am using a new spell, I have a notation that leads to the background, how it interacts etc. Im constantly building the world, and makes it so that I don't have to sort through hundreds of files.

These are normally passing fancy things like at this point in china this is occuring ya know? It allows me to have a world, but it is dreadfully slow for writing.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** Today I published the first of two chapters of the sequel to my first Harry Potter short story [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27401833][A Grim Tale of Brothers, Pumpkins and Giants]] linkao3(27401833)

Being part Austrian and having lived much of my life in Vienna, I've often daydreamed about what the magical world would be like there. And importantly, how our history, and ALL the good and bad that could entail and imply, could be transposed into the Harry Potter-verse. My hope is to create a series where the experiences and stories/legends I've gathered across my plentiful travel to sometimes quite unusual countries are transferred to Sirius-as-Padfoot going on adventures with his friends and loved ones.

Anyway, Harry, Sirius and Remus go to Vienna for reasons. Here, abroad together for the first time, they explore magical VIenna, laugh at funny words, go to a theme park, and meet enigmatic figures. Read on in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/31214912/chapters/77151347][A Grim Tale of Grandmas, Schnitzels, and Ghosts]] as Harry feels the love of his mother, the pride of his father and unexpected family linkao3(31214912) linkffn(13739888).

  Set a few weeks after Sirius' adventure with Dumbledore and, more importantly, his newly awakened grim consciousness. It is decided that Harry should travel to Vienna with Remus and his godfather to seek the advice of an old and wise wizard. Harry is delighted at the fun-filled holiday with his newly acquired leftover Marauders, but it soon emerges the Austrians could use the help of a grim with some of their own wounds almost sixty years in the making. Is there a difference between muggle and magical ghosts or souls? What does it mean when wayward souls cannot move on and escape death for too long? Can we speak to those who have passed on, or are they too busy experiencing the next great adventure? Is having a family the same thing as having relatives, and can we choose? Why are wizards incapable of understanding the basic concept of two pedals and a steering wheel? What is it like to be on holiday when you're Harry Potter?
