Looking for the best works featuring Dumbledore (as a main character or just there as a matter of canon). Can be portrayed in any fashion. Is he a heartless, cruel manipulator, or just plain off his rocker? Maybe he's a hopeless romantic, or maybe he's there to kick ass and suck lemon drops (and he's all out of those)! Grief stricken old man, or hardy veteran soldier? Mentor to the downtrodden, or a pureblood supremacist.

I feel as though all I read are "evil" Dumbledore stories, so I'm hoping to read some interesting (or funny/cracky) interepretations of the character. AU's/OOC welcome!


** Perhaps one of my favorite Dumbledore's is in linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond) (which, incidentally, is basically the only good soul bond fic ever). In this, he basically is the embodiment of the whimsy present in the early Harry Potter books, which is eventually shown to be [[/spoiler][Dumbledore's way of coping with PTSD from the Grindelwald Conflict™ and the Voldemort Insurgency™]].

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

** Really good, canon-like Dumbledore can be find in Weasley Girl. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815956][The Leapling (prologue to the series)]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739][Weasley Girl]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9932798][Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic with Ron's gender (we have Ronnie here) being the point of divergence. Stays very close to canon in terms of characters, settings and initial plot, but manages to spin in interesting and original direction. Ongoing, rare updates.

Taure recommended The One He Feared but I really liked Dumbledore in his other fic.

[[http://tinyurl.com/jkc2qeu][Alexandra Potter]] - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in heavily magical Hogwarts. It focus on school life and author's variation on magic system. The first year complete, but theoretically there is a new version planned.

** Dumbledore as the MC is rather rare, but there are enough fics to portray him in a positive light. For example, he was still a highly manipulative and ruthless politician in *The Dark Lord Never Died*, linkffn(11773877), but he was at least successful in his manipulations and put them to good use.

In [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], Dumbledore was another brilliant, manipulative, and ruthless strategist, but despised by many Ministry bureaucrats and marginalized due to his sexual orientation (remember [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing][Alan Turin]]). He dumped Harry at the Dursleys so Harry would not enjoy a comfortable childhood and could become a far more ruthless adult. He groomed the Boy-Who-Lived myth so that Harry could get away with lots of things in the future. He also setup Hermione and Euterpe Spinks (an OC with excellent abilities and connections) to be in Harry's House. He also personally blew up several Riddle bases and killed many Death Eaters through his setups.

In *Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650), Dumbledore went a long with Harry's plan right from the start and got tough on the bad guys if need be.

I also like the Dumbledore in *Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince*, linkffn(5677867), even though this is a canon compliant fic and I despise canon Dumbledore. Some of his conversations with Ginny were done very well, and he made lots of sense there.
