** Because canonically his actions do not indicate that he is in control of his emotions.

Just take a look on the reaction that Snape has when Harry reaches Hogwarts in HBP. Or better yet when Harry uses Protego against Snapes during their lessons and watches that memory or the moment Harry calls Snape a coward.

You can argue that these were extreme situations but it's not like Snape was much better in day to day interactions.

Some of the other characters we know about who know Occlumency like Dumbledore and Slughorn are levelheaded and calm to an extreme. Even when Slughorn learned after Harry's first attempt to get the memory what Dumbledore had put Harry up to, Slughorn was downright pleasant to him even though Harry was trying to suss out his greatest secret and mistake even during the attempts.

Compairing Slughorn's and Snape's behaviour side by side leaves a lot to be desired from Snape.

*** Snape used Occlumency to drive himself to delusion; people are generally good at lying to themselves about things they don't want to accept and I think the danger of Occlumency is that you'd start believing in your own lies.

I'll just quote from the /Prisoner of Azkaban/ here. Snape is just the very opposite of emotional control.

  “Professor Snape --- it --- it wouldn't hurt to hear what they've got to say, w --- would it?”

  “Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,” Snape spat. “You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, hold your tongue.”

  “But if --- if there was a mistake ---”

  “KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!” Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite deranged. “DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!” A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black's face. Hermione fell silent.

And then the delusions...

  But there was a mad glint in Snape's eyes that Harry had never seen before. He seemed beyond reason.

  “Come on, all of you,” he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. “I'll drag the werewolf. Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too ---”

  Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door. “Get out of the way, Potter, you're in enough trouble already,” snarled Snape. “If I hadn't been here to save your skin ---”

  “Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,” Harry said. “I've been alone with him loads of times, having defense lessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn't he just finish me off then?”

  “Don't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works,” hissed Snape. “Get out of the way, Potter.”

  “YOU'RE PATHETIC!” Harry yelled. “JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WON'T EVEN LISTEN ---”

  “SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!” Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever. “Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been well served if he'd killed you! You'd have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black --- now get out of the way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!”

**** Thank you for posting this.

Snape was madder than Bellatrix in these scenes. I cannot fathom how Harry was unable to learn Occlumeny if emotional control is one of the requirements. The other requirement was willpower which arguably Harry has the most of in the entire series. He never acted this deranged even in fifth year in which Harry was angry but never unhinged. The only time in both the movies and books in which Harry ever looked or sounded deranged was in PoA movie just before he blew up Marge. There was a moment in which the look on his face screamed unhinged axe murderer.

I decided not to refer to any scenes before OotP because then the doylist perspective excuse could be made that Occlumency did not exist yet.

Once again thank you for posting this.

  “OUT WITH IT, POTTER!” he bellowed. “WHAT DID YOU DO?”

  “Professor Snape!” shrieked Madam Pomfrey. “Control your­self!”

  “See here, Snape, be reasonable,” said Fudge. “This door's been locked, we just saw ---”

  “THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!” Snape howled, pointing at Harry and Hermione. His face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.

  “Calm down, man!” Fudge barked. “You're talking nonsense!”

  “YOU DON'T KNOW POTTER!” shrieked Snape. “HE DID IT, I KNOW HE DID IT ---”

****** And to think Fudge believed him when Snape said Black confounded the children. After that display I would be having some serious doubts about anything that he said and reconsider believing him about the confounding.

******* Yes, but Snape's accusations about Harry set the tone for the next two books and set the foundation of Skeeter's and later, the Ministry's slander of Harry and Dumbledore.

** Probably because Rowling didn't do the best job of /portraying/ Snape as being in control of his emotions. His reaction to Harry calling him a coward is one of the best examples of this. Dumbledore, on the other hand, is the epitome of what an Occlumens should be. That's another point as to why Snape was a poor choice of teacher for Harry, even without the complications arising from the fact Snape loathed Harry for looking like James Potter but with Lily Evans' eyes, a constant reminder of which man she chose. Snape didn't even have control over his own emotions, taking points for petty reasons being one of the subtler hints at this. He could hardly teach someone to do so.

** This is where book!Snape and movie!Snape have the most difference, I believe - Alan Rickman (RIP) was one of the best things to happen to Snape's characterisation, because he added a humanising aspect to the character that was sorely lacking in the books due to author bias (not just against Slytherins, but because Rowling based him off of a teacher she didn't like)

To further confuse matters, she then gave him a horrible childhood, had him "redeem" himself with horrible excuses, and generally treated his character as a petty, petulant child despite being a double-spy, a Potions Master, an Occlumens, a Legilimens, and "one of the bravest men Harry knew" - which would be difficult if still acted like a child.

That's why I take a different look at canon events when it comes to those generally shown in a bad light - because Rowling's books are so OBVIOUSLY black and white due to her target audience.

Snape, the Malfoys, the Marauders, Harry, Hermione, Ron, hell even Voldemort - if a writer is competent enough, they can turn those paragons of good and evil into actual characters, with varied moral centers that don't paint them in a singular harsh light leaving no wiggle room of any kind so that their characterisation is always predictable, and therefore boring. Some can twist the characaters head-on and have them in opposite viewpoints from their characters and still make it believable.

That's the best part about fanfic - to take what the author did and challenge yourself to create something different using the source material as a jumping off point.

TL;DR - 1) Rowling wrote Snape as a one-dimensional man-baby, then pulled the backstory out of her ass for later "complexity" which confused people and caused the rift OR 2) Rowling is incapaple of keeping story threads even vaguely consistent if there's no plot relevance to Harry and some fanfic writers can do it much better

*** I think that the reason is No. 2. Just look at her magic system. In OotP the whole point of DA was so that people can learn and practice spells so that they can perform them during the exam and defend themselves. Then she pulled that stunt in HBP with sceptumseptra. I mean seriously Harry does not know it's wand movement or the correct pronunciation of it's incantation has never even tried to cast it before and suddenly going against everything previously established successfully casts it so that he can almost kill Draco and generate sympathy for him. Draco was already half way through the incantation of Crucio and Harry somehow manages to finish this long incantation before Draco could say the 2 syllables left. Sometimes I wonder if the 'power he knows not' is super speed speech.
