Hey All,

I'm looking to find fics involving the boundary between the wizard and muggle worlds. Does a muggle rescue a wizard, or vice versa? How do muggles react to the wars, if they know anything about them. Do any get swept up into magic without realizing it?

Long reads are preferred, though I'm open to oneshots if they're particularly good. I love romance, though I know muggle OCs seem kind of rare in that regard. I'd prefer heartwarming rather than tragic, if I had to characterize the tone I'm looking for. I've read some work by Northumbrian, which was delightful, though would have preferred the Statute of Secrecy to bend a bit more.

Any recommendations would be appreciated. :)

** I have [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/muggles-centred-harry-potter-fanfiction-stories.html][a list on my blog]], but specifically I would point out “Escape” by SingularOddities linkffn(11916243) and even more its pre-/sequel “Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley” linkffn(12373273).

  Tumblr Prompt from accio shitpost: "i wanna see a muggle who goes stealth among wizards purely by having a ridiculous aesthetic" A muggle moves to Ottery St Catchpole a few months after the Battle of Hogwarts, and there's a slight misunderstanding.
