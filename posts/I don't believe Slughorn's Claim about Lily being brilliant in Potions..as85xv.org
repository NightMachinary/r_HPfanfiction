I honestly believe that Lily was just showcasing Severus's talent. Early on in the Series when Harry goes to Ollivander to buy a wand, Ollivander claims that his mother's wand is good for Charms while his fathers for Transfiguration. I basically think that is where there aptitude lies in. I personally believe Rowling inserts too many secret messages, stuff which people when they read again, they can find new stuff to think about.

Her entire passage about Slughorn praising Lily was just to portray a secret message that Snape was helping Lily in Potions. Remember while we have seen instances of Snape 's creativity, we have never seen one of Lily. She is supposedly smart but there is a difference between being a genius and smartness.


** People can be good at multiple things. I don't believe there's ever a wand mentioned at being useful for potions so it's a bit of a weak basis for your argument to be honest. Slughorn has all around praise for her talents in potions and there's nothing that really detracts from that.

We don't know if she was on the level of Snape in Potions but as a student she is described as one of the brightest Slughorn ever taught.

*** Slughorn basically speaks praise about her creativity and skill in Potions and how he has inherited his mother's aptitude for Potions. This after Harry demonstrates with Snape's knowledge of Potions. There are a number of instances where Rowling uses irony and what is more ironic then mother and son getting praise for the work of another guy.

**** It's possible of course. But Lilly was seen as an all around brilliant student. I don't see a lot of indication that Lilly's skill is a product of Snapes skill. They also parted ways in fifth year meaning her Owls and Newts were without his help.

** Firstly, Potions is not a wand subject - just because Lily's wand was good for charms does not mean that she was good only in Charms. Harry's wand isn't good at anything in particular, but he's very, very good with Charms. Therefore, the fact that her wand is good with Charms has nothing to do with anything.

Being good at Charms isn't mutually exclusive with being good in Potions or anything else. That's just absurd.

Lily wised up to Snape at the end of their fifth year, and Slughorn taught them both for the next two years, where she relied on her own skill. He wouldn't be full of praise for her if her talent with Potions somehow mysteriously dropped to a "smart but not genius level" after being at "genius level" for the previous five years. He wouldn't say that she was one of the brightest witches he'd ever taught if that was the case.

Lily's also not getting the highest grade possible in her exams with Snape's help either. She does that on her own.

Lily may have studied together with Snape, and he may have helped her initially - but that opens up the possibility that they found out the modifications to the brewing methods together, which means that the intellectual ownership of those modifications is shared between the two of them.

** You're free to have whatever headcanon you want, but this one doesn't seem supported by anything in canon. I mean, I believe Sirius was a fan of the muggle band Queen, but I don't go around arguing that this is canon.

** Yeah but we don't really see any wand getting used for charms other than what, to vanish the contents of a failure. I'd say it's more likely that it's just not a wanded discipline.

Sure, Lily coulda been piggy backing on Snape's efforts- probably was to a degree- the man made a lot of improvements to potions, but she likely had to at least be competent enough to follow them on tests where she was working alone.

Edit: As to her creativity, we never really get an explanation for Harry's survival beyond Lily's sacrifice- and the lightning bolt /does/ look like a 'real' rune called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sowil%C5%8D][Sowil]], "Sun is the light of the world; I bow to the divine decree." seems like something right up Rowlings alley.

*** I am not saying that she is not competent enough. But there is a big big difference between discovering some modifications to potions and being competent enough to follow instructions. I believe she was fairly smart , probably someone who can top the school. Snape is the sort of guy who wins Nobel prizes and shit.

**** Yes, but a wand is still not involved in potion making, so whatever Ollivander says has no influence on potion making. I mean, Harry is good at Quidditch and that isn't part of his wand either.

** Or Lily could just be talented at Potions. Just because her wand was good for Charms does not mean that Lily could only ever be good at Charms. People have different talents.

Problem with Lily is that we don't really see her at all. Harry doesn't really seem to be very interested in learning about her... it's JAMES he's interested in learning about, so we get a lot more info on James.

** Or it was Snape that writes down the things he saw her do...

You know for a genius in potions he never created a new or original potion. He didn't even seem to like the subject he teaches considering that the first thing we learn about him was that every student knew he wanted to teach another subject.

The book was a NEWT potion book (6th and 7th year), now we see the spell levicorpus that is credited to him, already used in the year by James and we learn that it was a very popular spell at that time... So a possible example of him recreating something he saw

Other than that we see Snape claiming other people achievements as his own when in the third year he claimed to have protected the trio from the demeanors and werewolf Remus, when he was unconscious at that time and was protected by Harry and Sirius respectively, but he acted like it was his right to earn a metal for it.

when did Lily ever give any indication that she would claim something as hers that isn't? She would give praise to Snape if it was his to earn. After their friendship, she was still great at potions and she probably wasn't paying him much attention or mind anymore after that fact, with him we know that he was still a bit obsessed with her and he could have easily noticed when she does something other than the descriptions and copied it.

I don't really think that Snape is a copycat in potions, but I think it is as stupid to claim Lily was. That is why I made this list to show that we have more character points for the other way round

** You can think what you want, but for a muggleborn girl to get high praise from Slughorn and become Head Girl, she had to be talented. And she had her big fight with Snape in her 5th year so she went through 6th year and presumably NEWTs without working with him.
