#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** The Arithmancer series by WhiteSquirrel!! The fic is long, complete, has two sequels, and writes really well done character development. Highly Recommend

The Changeling Series by Annarb is similarly as good, focusing on Ginny instead and also has sequels. Again, super good character development and plot.

There are 4 completed books, book 5 is 3 chapters from being finished (don't worry, the author will definitely finish it since he gives constant updates). He plans for it to be a 7 book series, but it might end up only being 6 books.

** I'd vote for The Boys of Crowhill, which is one of my absolute favourites. It originally looks like a point-of-divergence AU, where the Dursleys dumped Harry in an orphanage, but there's actually a lot more going on behind the scenes. Great characterization, and Harry actually feels like an eleven-year-old--an exceptional eleven-year-old in many ways, but still. I don't think there's any bashing of anyone that I've been able to think of. I'm arguably cheating a little here; the first book, second, and third books are complete but the series--currently at just under 620K words--is still ongoing.

Another favourite is The Problem Of Potions series, by Wyste. It's also very well-constructed, no bashing, etc. I don't think the prose is as good, and--it's not necessarily that it's less well-constructed, but it's definitely doing something less complicated. But seriously: it's amazing, a very good fic.

I also love Being Harry Potter, by Kirinin--this isn't strictly speaking my favourite but it's very good and very much itself and I think it's underrated. It's got a much smaller scope than the other two, but it's still amazing.

...that said if you're looking for /long/--well--I don't agree with their take on Harry, I think they take Harry's perception of himself as averagely talented as accurate despite counterindications in the text, but... it's one of the best things I've ever read,and definitely one of my favourites. It's a longform HP roleplay, with the premise that Voldemort misheard the prophecy and so raised Harry as his own son, taking over Wizarding England. God, it's so good. And so long. How long? Well--it took me over a month to read one summer when I was doing very little else, and I routinely read 100-200K fics in an evening, so. I don't have a word count, but: /long/. Come, read it, and get obsessed with Sally-Anne Perks and Pansy, Aurora Sinistra, Rabastan Lestrange and freaking Antonin Dolohov, not to mention Justin Finch-Fletchley. As well as the main characters of the universe--god, I love this fic's Ron, not to mention its take on Snape and--well, almost everyone, really--but with many of the minor characters, these are now fixed in my brain forevermore as The Way They Are. It's big and complicated and doesn't give you a simple ending and it's amazing <3

  Draco Malfoy awakens in Gryffindor Tower at the start of his sixth year with no memory of how he arrived.Can Draco use Harry's lingering impressions of the world to guide him? Can he navigate the politics of being the Boy Who Lived? And how long before he tips off Ron or Hermione?A bodyswap subversion and bromance, this story features a Ron Weasley convinced they are mates, a Hermione keen on the Dark Arts, a surprisingly friendly Blaise Zabini, and a Luna Lovegood who's just mad enough to find this all perfectly ordinary.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

**** Harry Crow managed to build tension better than many professionally-written works I've read by renowned authors. I very nearly wanted to cheer out loud at the conclusion of the Chamber of Secrets fight, despite it being patently obvious that the good guys were going to win. Getting me invested in a story to that degree is no small feat.

Many more characters showed actual depth, development, and growth than did in canon (though let's face it, in canon only Neville and to a far lesser degree Draco changed at all over seven books).

I also very much liked that nobody in that story acted OOC, with every decision/action (including the mistakes) making sense for that character in that situation with that information.

Those latter two points are especially appreciated by those of us that focus on character. That Rowling treated her characters as ambulatory plot devices rather than actual people was one of my biggest complaints about the canon. Characters' actions were decided by plot necessity rather than by their personality and circumstances.
