Hello all, whenever I'm bored of the fics I'm finding, I reach out to the this lovely subreddit and ask for fics pertaining to some random topic and y'all usually deliver. Today's topic: substance abuse. There are lots of abusable things in the HP universe, from cheering charms to calming draughts to liquid luck, but the only fic I've seen that even touches on it is linkffn(stages of hope). I'd love anything in this vein at all whether it's felix (like in stages of hope) or good old fashioned muggle heroin.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

Second, is one I don't remember. But in it, Draco becomes addicted to I think it was heroin? Fenrir Greyback was his dealer, and ends up turning Draco into a werewolf. That's all I remember of it, so good luck finding it.

** I have absolutely no clue as to why, but must Druggie!Harry fics are slash. Since that's not really my cup of tea, I can't offer you much.

Only one I have is linkffn(Too Young To Die). Harry starts taking some illegal potions, winds up playing a quidditch game while high as a kite...or broomstick, in this case.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
