so ive just finished reading The Pureblood Pretense (the whole Rigel Black series up till the jan update) - and im just absolutely loving the whole concept of harry growing up with james and lily - and is a little potions genius and like to him/her, snape is like an idol/mentor in the sense that he's really really good at potions?

i know it's probs gonna be hard to find another fic having all of the above (aha unless it's like a fanfic of the fanfic) but id be super happy with like even a point or two/anything you'd like to recommend

like the idea of harry gushing about snapes potions skills while like the marauders are just shoook but at the same time that's their darling harry you get what i mean

thanks!


** Probably not what you're looking for, but I know of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13391681/1/The-Heir-of-the-House-of-Black][The Heir of the House of Black]] which is a time-travel/reincarnation fic ala "Time to put your Galleons where your mouth is".

In that fic Harry/Turais is mentored by Slughorn instead of Snape and even works together with Damocles Belby on the Wolfsbane potion.

** You may have come across this already, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335][The Problem of Potions]] is great fun. Harry's not a potions genius in this, he's just completely enamored of potions, and Snape is a very reluctant mentor.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
