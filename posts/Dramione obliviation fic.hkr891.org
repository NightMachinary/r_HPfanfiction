I'm looking for a slow burn Dramione story that I read a while ago. Hermione works for the ministry checking up on former death eaters who have been obliviated. Draco's name given to him was something like “Drake O. Malloy”. She checks up on him. He resists the memory charm and begins remembering everything slowly. I remember Dean have a curse that reset his memory every year and when Draco remembers who he is, he helps cure it.
