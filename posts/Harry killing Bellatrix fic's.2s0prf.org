I've been searching for any fic's where Harry kills Bellatrix at the end of 5th year (In the ministry of magic). If you have any rec's please feel free to leave them because I haven't found any that are worth reading. I prefer no slash but anything else it fine.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6763981/1/The-Dark-Lord-s-Equal][The Dark Lord's Equal]] by Lens of Sanity is one that comes to mind. How "worth reading" is a matter of personal taste (the author riffs off ideas from several other authors, to which several readers seem to take objection), but might be enjoyable.
