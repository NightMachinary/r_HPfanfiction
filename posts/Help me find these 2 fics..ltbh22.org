:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi ya'll, I hope ya'll are staying safe with everything going on in the world right now. 1. The first fic I am looking for I think is called Lily's Son or Lily's eyes I can't remember. Harry is a baby in this fic and after some months of being at the Dursleys Snape rescues him and raises him as his own. 2. The second fic I am Iooking for is a severus mentor's Harry fic and Snape has a familiar that is a raven who can talk, but I can't remember its name Any help would be appreciated Happy reading, toodles :)


** The talking raven familiar is named Skullduggery, and is in the Common Interests series (Common Interests, Raven's Choice, and the unfinished Common Ground) by snapegirlkmf. First story linkffn(6389455).
