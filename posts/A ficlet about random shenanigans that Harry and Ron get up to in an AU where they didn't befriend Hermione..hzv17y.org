Raiding Filch's office to steal things that he has confiscated.

Something to do with bullshitting their way to being top of the class in divination.

Somehow tricking Fleur into asking Ron to the Yule Ball and Harry reading an etiquette book as part of an attempt to get Daphne to go with him.

I think the title had "the boys" in it.

  A collection of related one-shots spanning Hogwarts, where Hermione never has her Halloween epiphany and so the trio never forms, leaving Harry & Ron to bro their way through Hogwarts, forced to learn for themselves what they need to know.
