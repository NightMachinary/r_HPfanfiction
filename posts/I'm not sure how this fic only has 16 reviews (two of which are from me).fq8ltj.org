Here is a link to the fic on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/r/12475407/]]

It's seriously good. It's an AU where Dumbledore dies and Tom Riddle gets hired at Hogwarts to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts (or maybe just Dark Arts depending on who you ask). Most of the author's stories heavily feature Tom Riddle, and I feel like this is one of the most canon compliant Tom Riddle's I've ever read. The main character is an OC. She is a Slytherin with a heavy dose of magical power. And she is flawed af.

I found this story to be extremely compelling. The characters were all so textured and the plot was perfectly executed. I was on the edge of my seat reading this thing! The fact that so few people have read/reviewed this fic makes me wonder if my taste is really different from the majority, or if this is just one of those fics that somehow didn't get discovered (and if that's the case, I'm promoting it here to try and remedy that).

If you start the fic and find that it's not your cup of tea, care to share why? I'm just curious! Too dark? Don't like Tom Riddle stories? Don't like OC's as the main protagonist? (I usually don't either, but this one is excellent).

Happy Social Distancing!

Edit: I just realized I should mention the fic definitely earns its M rating. So that might be a turnoff for some people as well. Whoops!


** Unfortunately, some stories just go unnoticed by the fandom. And what's really unfortunate is that sometimes, really good stories go unnoticed by the fandom. Meanwhile, shitty stories (badly written, characters that act illogically, trope-filled, etc.) are the ones that have the most favorites, follows, reviews, and recommendations. Also, I've noticed that smutty romances are among the most popular. Yet, just because a story is popular doesn't mean it's good. For me, I'm just not interested in Tom Riddle all that much. Also, you said the main character is an OC which is a major negative in my book. I typically don't like OCs, and have yet to come across an OC in FanFiction that I've liked. But, that's just my own preference on the matter.

*** It does really depress me when the good stories go unnoticed in favor of those illogical ones. I'm open to OC's for sure, simply because I've read so many good ones now. But I tend to prefer the tried and true characters. For instance, I could never get into that Alexandra Quick series (and I really wanted to). I think it just depends on how well the author actually GIVES the OC character. Like if they can make me care about that OC, I will.

**** Dude, if you can't enjoy Alexandra Quick, then I don't think I should follow your recommendation! That series is easily on par with the original. The key to good young adult fiction, in my opinion, is concentric circles of a mystery. Character studies are boring to me.

*** I think 2 is the main reason. Though not necessarily because people despise them but because people often search fics by pairing so OC-centric fics don't show up. (Especially on ffn)

Also a lot of OCs are self inserts and/or Mary Sues.

That said, I'll definitely check it out at some point! I like fics about Tom Riddle pre-insanity and with such a glowing review I'm willing to try the OC

** That's actually one of my favorite fics, though I found it [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9559742/][on Ao3]] rather than FFN. I also enjoyed the author's other longform fic set in the same time period: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11707455/chapters/26365128][The Outliers]]

I think one reason that "Recipe for Disaster" hasn't gained much attention is that the majority of readers are wary of OC fics. Many assume that the female OC will turn out to be a 'Mary Sue' or self insert for self-indulgent romantic plotlines.

However, what I love about this fic is that it's not a stereotypical 'OC turns bad-boy good through the power of love' story, or 'OC gains Darke Powers and impresses everyone who beholds her' fic. Instead, it's a believable progression of how prejudice and bitterness can ruin a person's life as well as lives of the people around them. In fact, I think this fic would probably appeal to many of the people who enjoyed [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19381933/chapters/46118053][Black Ink, Red Rose]] (which has gotten popular on this sub recently). Both fics explore similar dark themes without whitewashing the racist extremism of the Death Eater movement.

*** If it's similar to Black Ink, Red Rose, I'm giving it a HARD pass. Depressing fics aren't why I, personally, read fanfic. Horror being inflicted on characters I like (or grow to like) without positivity or the characters 'deserving' it (as in horror movies) sickens me. It makes me unhappy.

**** That's understandable.

I suppose my tastes may tend towards the opposite: I enjoy reading stories that evoke strong emotions, even if those emotions are on the negative side of the spectrum. I also prefer that the universe in the fic be like reality in that bad things can and do happen to good people. As the saying goes, "the sun shines also on the wicked."

I will say that unrelenting downer stories tend to irk me, not because they are depressing, but because there's no rising and falling action to balance the plot. An engaging story needs good moments and bad moments to provide perspective and thus make each climax (positive or negative) more emotionally intense. So, for example, I enjoyed the early parts of "Black Ink, Red Rose" because Ginny lived through some dark moments but she still had hope and times of happiness with friends to sustain her in-between. However, past the midpoint the story metaphorically fell off a cliff, after which Ginny no longer had any positive moments at all. The fic became less and less engaging for me with each chapter that passed in which Ginny's experiences unrelentingly trended downward.

To me, "Recipe for Disaster" doesn't fall into the 'unrelenting downer' category, but everyone has different tastes; mileage may vary.

** I don't know if I ever came across it (I do browse [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] for stories with 100k+ words occasionally), but if I did I most likely skipped right past. Here's why:

1. I don't like the summary. Dumbledore dies, and Tom Riddle became the DADA teacher. While descriptive, this tells me very little about what kind of story I'm heading into - what is it that drives the plot. I want to know the starting point, sure, but also the direction it will take from there. "Downhill" doesn't really count unless it's a comedy. It doesn't even mention the MC is an OC, not Tom.
2. I dislike anti-hero or villain leads (if that's not the case for Recipe for Disaster, that ties right back into the point about the summary).

I think some of that is the fault of FFN's tagging system and character limmit in descriptions. The description and tags on Ao3 do a better job showing what the fic is about.

As for the MC not being Tom, that's not really true. The fic has chapters that follow each of their perspectives, so they are both equally prominent as main characters.

Because there are hundreds of thousands of stories? and no editors promoting them or professional critics reviewing them or famous writers recommending them?

That is the problem with self publishing, specially when you cannot legally cash in on it.

Thanks for the recommendation, I love a good, sane Voldi fic. The smarter and more cynical the better.

** For me, personally, I just don't really gravitate towards fics with OC's as the main character, and also I don't really read Tom Riddle centric stories unless they revolve around both him and his relationship with Harry (be it the usual or different). To be fair I have read OC stories, but usually only under very specific circumstances, and this story doesn't hit those for me. It's also unfortunate that if you see an OC story where they're the main and it also focuses around the bad guy, a lot of people are gonna automatically think it's a story where the author is trying to find a way to redeem the bad guy through the power of love and that's just an annoying trope overall, though I understand this fic isn't like that. Plus, the HP fandom is probably one of the most saturated fandoms when it comes to fics.

Plenty of good fics are gonna slide under the radar with hardly any recognition, and even worse ones end up with legions of followers, some who only read and agree that fic is good because so many others think so like a hive mind. It's always gonna be a toss-up in a fandom as large as this one if a fic that is worth it will get the recognition it deserves. I know I've read plenty of fics that deserved more attention than they've gotten, which is why I try not to make decisions on what fics I'll read based on reader count/reviews/kudos/favorites/ etc. especially since fic elitists annoy me.

Maybe you could do fic spotlight posts like some other people do to promote other fics like this one and try to get them more recognition? It couldn't hurt.

I think a lot of people only read fics with their favorite ships and Mary Sues made them avoid OCs altogether so that might explains the fewer reviews.
