Can someone please send me an invite to Archive of Our Own? I was surprised to see it requires an invitation to join, but there you go.


** Small PSA: Normally the invite queue would be faster [I got mine within 4 hours when I joined] but lately they are cleaning up the spam and stuff so the usual queue has been cut off. Invites from members still work tho.

** Sent. I've still got one left in my current batch, if anyone else wants one.

*edit found I had a few extra. Gave those out. Asking for more from AO3 admins, but that's a manual process. I'm empty for now.

** The invite thing is a large part of why I don't use AO3. (That, and my place of work treats it like a porn site with respect to its internet content filters.)

**** Not just porn, fucked up porn. I used to frequent AO3, but then I stumbled across some one shot about the Marauders being some kind of pedo cult that keeps a very underage Harry as a sex slave, pimping him out to Snape, Dumbledore and Arthur Weasley (Arthur's thing being to pretend that Harry is Bill). .. I haven't been back since. There's a darkness in the soul of mankind, that's for sure, and AO3 is ripe with it.

I don't normally judge artistic expression or preferences, but Jesus, man...

Hahaha, I accidentally read this as a comment on you mental state, which somehow made it even funnier.

** Recent related conversation :

"AO3? Why would anyone want to post there... or even read there? Talk about a wretched hive of scum and villainy..."

"Well, it's another venue for my stuff with no restrictions on content, and I like that the filter system allows me to skip finding anything by an author I don't like."
