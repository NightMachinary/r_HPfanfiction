If you could wave a magic wand (see what I did there?) and cause one (and ONLY one) abandoned story to suddenly be complete, which one would you choose?

Put another way, what's the one story that it just kills you was never finished? The one story that you've read more than once even though it ends without resolution? The one story you've almost been tempted to try to finish yourself (with the author's permission, of course)?

For me it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2869936/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hero-s-Path][Harry Potter and the Hero's Path]]. What about you?

** I don't know if its abandoned... but Temporal Beacon opens with a little blurb about never really being done because they can keep trying to make things go better... I think I'd want to know just how many billions of words I could make appear by picking that one.

Plus I was enjoying it until it suddenly suffered a "theres no more yet" error.

*** I imagine by chapter 473 the pair would be going back to the Big Bang to design their own universe from scratch, and by chapter 512 they'd ascend to higher plane of existence thus making the rest of the (infinitely unfolding) story incomprehensible to us.

p.s. When I reached the story's current end it felt like it stopped because it had outgrown its current author---like /willyolioleo/ had no idea what should be a realistic behaviour for an Unspeakable agent, as an example.

Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.

Harry Potter - Rated: T - English - Adventure/Supernatural - Chapters: 15 - Words: 103,911 - Reviews: 888 - Favs: 1,942 - Follows: 2,136 - Updated: Feb 18, 2012 - Published: Sep 28, 2008 - Harry P.

Good characters, interesting expansion of the world and magic as yet unseen, with a quite visual narrative style. I'd love to see it continued and eventually brought to a conclusion, but I never got the sense that the author was working towards a specific ending.

** Can't decide between the abandoned stories I read and liked despite knowing better, but there is a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2814526/1/All-Through-the-Night][time travel]] story that cries for a sequel and never got one.

If that doesn't count.. hmmm [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1898314/1/Angel-of-Light-I][Angel of Light I]] (It's german, from the time when I hadn't switched over to reading english fanfictions :D - Harry wakes up in a parallel world, where Sirius and Severus are together and adopted him, the Malfoys are his godparents, he is best friends with Draco, Hermione and Ron and together with Draco. He's also the heir of Gryffindor and Slytherin, and Voldemort is already dead. And the "him" from that world is in an "inbetween" world and he can talk to him. It was really great how Harry got the chance for a normal life and adapts to the different persons that look the same as in this world, which leads to a lot of hilarious scenes etc, and damn it, the title is Angel of Light I (ONE. Like in, more parts planned. And the author never even finished the first part)) So yeah, probably that - if I can include "parts 2 to x" into the "is suddenly finished".

It's the last unfinished fic I ever read and that was YEARS ago. I was so saddened by it not being finished that I now won't read an abandoned fic or start a WIP even if it's regularly updated. Nearly 10 years on and I still want to know where she was going with this story.

**** As much as I understand and sympathize with this point of view, as someone who recently started writing a long-form piece, it's kind of a bummer, since it seems like many people are on the same page as you.

A big part of the enjoyment of writing for me is feedback, response, audience participation, stuff like that. Kind of a Catch-22 - if zero people paid attention to what I was writing, I'd be much more likely to abandon it.

Severus Snape and Luna Lovegood are two of my favorite characters... and so rarely interact in fan fiction (that isn't badly written).

Despite the fact that by chapter 10 it's basically an original work.

EDIT: changed my mind, i's rather read the rip-off [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8491588/1/Snow-Point][Snow Point]]. It's got roughly the same idea but with a more streamlined story, Hermione goes too (the year after iirc) and Harry stays Harry Potter.

We barely see most of it, so maybe that's cheating, but what is seen is a very enthralling transformation of the magical world in a very interesting and believable way. And the googledoc he gave out (which I won't link because it's posted semi-privately, but you can find it near the end of the DLP WBA thread) reveals a really awesome plot, even if the first year or so wouldn't have worked out as well.

I get why he stopped, but I'd love to read the whole thing.

** I have no doubt the fics I want finished are going to be posted by other people, so I'mma let them handle those.

Instead I'm going to go for one I don't think is going to get much attention.

[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600021832][Mad Snorkacks and Englishmen]].

I was so invested in this fic as I read along. I first found it on Quidditch pitch, and then found that there was an additional 12 chapters on AFF. While normally I'm not that into smut in my fanfiction, I actually got very emotionally invested in this fic. Salon really knows how to write, even if her sex scenes can squick me out a bit. At a certain pointed later in the series, I was actually crying.

I've never been tempted to finish anyone's work by myself, because I'm a mediocre writer at best. That said, if I could commission Salon and pay her $1000 to finish this fic, I probably would.

Also, because I don't play by the rules, I'm going to list a second fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6325846/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Heartlands-of-Time][Harry Potter & The Heartlands Of Time]]

I think this one really doesn't need much comment. That said however, the author has plenty of his own original fiction published and it's all /really really good/. [[http://joeducie.net/the-reminiscent-exile/][The Reminiscent Exile]] actually reads quite a bit like a spiritual successor to Wastelands & Heartlands. Can't say how happy he'd be to find the books linked next to some smut from AFF, but he's associated DLP in the credits, can't be that bad!
