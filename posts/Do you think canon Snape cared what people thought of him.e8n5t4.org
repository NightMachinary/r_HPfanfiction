Part of me thinks as a young boy he did but then when he grew up and grew out of that whole deatheater mindset he didn't really care anymore how he was perceived....

I'm writing a story where he survived the attack and I wonder if he would care what the wizarding world would think of him.


** If he did, he did not let it affect him. Double spying means being universally distrusted. It is even possible that he enjoyed being disliked, because severely traumatized people have weird comfort zones.

** My headcanon for Snape's mindset is that he was so filled with self-loathing after Lily's death that he wanted everyone else to hate him as much as he hated himself.

*** my headcannnon for harry after the war is that he decided to make sure everyone knew snape was a proper griffindor hero because he knew it'd piss him off the most.

** After 1981? Subconsciously, probably, but I imagine he'd deny this to his dying day. Before, especially during Marauder-era? Yes, definitely. This is, after all, why he joined the Death Eaters in first place. He wanted power over those who, in his mind, had wronged him, and respect.

** Just by being a professor he would /have/ to care how his students perceived him (what they thought of him), because a class of school-age children can easily turn into a zoo if the teacher-figure fails to make them fear or respect them.

He cared about Harry finding out about his school past and memories enough to become enraged, cancel the occlumency lessons despite Dumbledore's orders, and, arguably, cause for Harry to keep having a backdoor inside his head that was used by VD on multiple occasions and even lead to an ally's death.

The "person x doesn't care what others think of them" is a silly notion to me in general, to be honest. Unless that person is a hermit living in complete isolation, no matter how they'd like to see themselves, they obviously care about opinions of others about them. Because opinions dictate treatment and determine available developments in social interactions.

He heavily penalised house points for even a perceived disrespect from students. He wanted Draco to see him as enough of an authority figure to follow his directions and heed his advice. He wanted Narcissa and Bella to trust him and see him as competent enough to be included in their little family meeting, etc, etc.

*** There is a difference between caring how people perceive you for purely practical reasons, which is what most of your examples are of, and caring about it for emotional reasons -- i.e. preferring people to respect you/be kind to you/etc. Snape definitely always cared in the former case, but his behaviour sometimes suggest that he didn't care /emotionally/ how people thought about him, which I figured is what OP asked for.

**** Maybe you're right, but I think it'd be hard for a human to distinguish one from the other and not conflate the two. And Snape's reactions to a bunch of scenarios demonstrate him as someone who can't use his supposed Occlumency mastery to do that well either.

His reaction to memory leak, his final dialogue with Harry before his death, his interactions with Draco, Narcissa, and Bella: I think at least these three count towards both types you've described.

Oh, and he goes out of his way to make people aware of Lupin's nature in 3rd year as well. Which implies Lupin's another person whose opinion and state of mind he's interested in. Otherwise he would've just been /indifferent,/ and at most gone through the motions of making wolfsbane for Lupin because Dumbledore told him to.

** Yes. See PoA: he desperately wanted that Order of Merlin. Snape craves recognition.

He also wouldn't have been nearly as bitter as he was if he was a happy-go-lucky spirit who didn't care about how he was perceived.

** At the end of his life he gave Harry not only memories needed to explain his task but also to explain and justify his own choices. I think he did want to be understood on some level.

** As a child, he definitely did. It is right there in the conflicting choice he was faced with. It is right there in every humiliation and his isolation. He cared. It is why his anger and pain turned to bitterness,resentment and hate. He hated himself for not knowing or being able to deal with it and he hated others for putting him in that position.

As an adult, he take ownership of his own guilt when he pledges himself to protecting Harry. He accepts that he has to face whatever comes in order to keep Harry alive and see Voldemort dead. I think perhaps the only person whose opinion he really cares about is Dumbledore's.
