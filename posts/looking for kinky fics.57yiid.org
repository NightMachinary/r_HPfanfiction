What are the kinkiest fics you've read? It can be anything, except bodily functions. It can be the sole focus of the fic or just part of a bigger fic.


** Here's one for mind control as a kink. Only just started though.

#+begin_quote
  Set in the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter has an unusual awakening after the demonstration of Unforgivable Curses in that fateful Defense Against the Dark Arts class. How different is a Harry Potter with one deviant obsession, a twisted kink? Perhaps not at all, or perhaps incredibly so in the most meaningful of ways. Multiple pairings all centered around Harry, more of a web really.

#+begin_quote
  Petunia and Vernon Dursley never married and they never had Dudley. Petunia has always wanted a child, a girl specifically, so when she finds Hailey Potter on her doorstep, she's ecstatic.Petunia has never been pretty like her sister Lily and she has always found it difficult to have men interested in her. All the guys she had dated had left her when they had realized that she wouldn't have sex with them before being married. Because of this experience, Petunia has convinced herself that the only way to gain men's interest is to always be willing and eager to have sex with them. Petunia teaches this to Hailey because she doesn't want 'her little girl' to become a spinster like her.Hailey - following Petunia's advice - loses her virginity at 13. She soon becomes addicted to sex, willing to spread her legs for anyone who has a cock and that can give her an orgasm.When the Hogwarts letter arrives, Hailey is thrown into a very strange world where everybody there knows her name and has very set ideas on how she should be and how she should behave. They expect her to be the hero but all she has ever known is how to be a slut.

#+begin_quote
  After Vernon dies from a heart-attack when Harry is four, his Aunt Petunia reveals the truth; Vernon had been abusive since Harry first stayed with them, and had groomed his son into a mini-me; another abusive male -- as a result, Petunia drops him off at Vernon's sister as soon as the divorce papers are filed. She tells Harry about the magical world, before they move to the Lake District, buying a house with the Potter Family Funds, and begin a life that slowly devolves -- or evolves, depending on who you ask -- into little more than sexual acts and debauchery. Slow updates! Just to be sure: I do not condone any of the acts in this fic in real life. I do condone incest, actually, because to me it's the same as gay and lesbian relationships; if you genuinely love your brother/sister/mother/father/daughter/son/etc. in a more-than-familial way, and they do the same, go for it. Just don't make babies, because they'll be genetically defect.

*** [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1461][*/Not a normal Family/*]] by [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewuser.php?uid=10648][/Baron of Shadows/]]

#+begin_quote
  Lily goes out shopping with her friends on the night of destiny. When James can't escape with Harry, he sacrifices himself and Harry is saved. Lily, who didn't want to have reminders of her husband everywhere, takes Harry and raises him in Potter Manor with the house-elves. However, because Harry looked exactly like James save for his green eyes, she begins to have thoughts about him, and only when she catches herself masturbating while breastfeeding does she figure out that she's attracted to her own son; and thus, their life slowly devolves -- or evolves, depending on who you ask -- into little more than sexual acts and debauchery. Slow updates! Just to be sure: I do not condone any of the acts in this fic in real life. I do condone incest, actually, because to me it's the same as gay and lesbian relationships; if you genuinely love your brother/sister/mother/father/daughter/son/etc. in a more-than-familial way, and they do the same, go for it. Just don't make babies, because they'll be genetically defect.

  Harry's had enough. Enough of the lies, the manipulations, and the backstabbing. Now, he wanted to live for himself. Taking his Ex-girlfriend as his slave, and geting a very attaractive nine year old wife, Harry begins to form his army against those who would stand against him. An army of loyal slaves to carry out whatever orders he gives.
