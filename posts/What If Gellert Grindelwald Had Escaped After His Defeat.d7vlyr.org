Hey all, looking for some feedback on my first true attempt at writing a fic.

Looking for feedback on my writing mostly and on the story itself. Sorry for grammar errors didn't know my OpenOffice wasn't working write, am fixing first chapter now.

Summary is “In 1945 Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald have their famous duel to end the war. but what if Gellert got away? what if after suffering defeat he went into hiding? what would change when Voldemort rises to power and makes an enemy of the previous Dark Lord? How would a child of destiny's life be changed? rewritten history, Grey!Harry eventually Powerful!Harry rated for safety”

Story will be following Harry, Tracey, and Daphne as my version of the “golden trio” as well as exploring my versions of Grindelwald, Dumbledore, and Voldemort.

Hoping to make something unique but believable our if the characters.

Thanks for your guys time.

** Hey, thats kinda interesting. I´m writing a fanfiction myself with Grindelwald operating in the background and Harry and Tracey Davis being the main characters. I think I´m giving your story a try .

** Just read the first chapter and it's amazing. The only problem I have with it is punctuation errors. You miss commas occasionally as well as a few other mistakes, but those can be remedied. If you would like a beta, I'm always avaliable! But good story so far.
