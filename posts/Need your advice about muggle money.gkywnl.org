What do you think could be an appropriate amount of money sent to Dursleys each year for taking care of Harry? I want to emphasize that it's not only enough but actually quite a lot. I'm not from the UK so it's hard to estimate considering that it was around 1980-90s as well. Or do you think that maybe it would be better to leave out such details from the fanfic and just describe it as a big sum of money or something?

** For every child a family has, they get a certain amount of money annually from the government. The amount decreases with each child you have, for example, your first born is ~£20 a week and your second child will be less (somewhere near ~£15).

I'm not sure of what those prices would have been like in the 80s/90s but it was probably a few pounds lower.

For the sake of your fic, I wouldn't really worry about adding this much detail, just detail it as a sum of money.

*** These are not foster care payments, so they are not expected to cover full expenses of care for a child. See above for my numbers.

** I don't believe the Dursleys would have got anything, unless an equivalent for child tax credits was around back then.

Given that he was placed as an orphan, to family members who took him in as part of blood protection wards, I don't believe they would have paid anything. People would have seen bringing up Harry as a great honour, so it wouldn't have attracted a big sum and kinship care warrants even less.

My guess is that if they did get anything, it would be less than the amount that it would took to ordinarily raise a child.

** Given that Harry gets nothing new and not a lot of food (he is malnutrition in book 1), nevermind treats (remember the ice thing in the zoo?), I'd be surprised if the Dursleys spent even 50 quid on him per month.

*** Even 50 sounds like too much. With bare minimum feeding (and barely that), handmedown clothes, and no entertainment costs? I'd say 200 quid a year.

** I found somewhere that the foster care payments in UK were in 1990s somewhere between £125 in rural England to £219 a week in London.

*** We have a few different terms for him here. Foster care refers to children placed in the care of someone who is not related to them, so the Dursleys wouldn't have been eligible.

The Dursleys would have been kinship carers, but Harry wasn't placed with them by a muggle court order and placement assessment. So they wouldn't have been eligible for kinship support either (and back in the day I'm fairly sure kinship carers got very little compared to foster carers,

In any case, a baby as young as Harry would ordinarily be put up for adoption, so they wouldn't have kept him on foster rates within his family. We know that Harry wasn't available for kinship care funding because social services did not have partial legal responsibility and were not actively involved. Even if they had been kinship foster carers (that is, placed through the state), they would have been very much pushed into an alternative type of guardianship where funding was discretionary.

There is no requirement under the law for the state to be notified if a child moves in with a close relative. This is almost certainly what happened in Harry's case. Dumbledore dropped him off with a letter, but 'large payments' in my opinion would undermine 'welcoming him into their home' for the blood wards.

It is very likely that the Dursleys only got the amount of money described by a previous poster, the same as they would have got for Dudley and which would not have covered all of Harry's needs.

**** I agree, it is more complicated, but I thought that the foster care payments would be a good estimate of costs of raising up a child without regards whether Dursleys were actually eligible to get them or not.

*** That would assume that the Dursleys actually would buy Harry new clothes occasionally, or give him sufficient food, or the occasional free-time expense. I'd say 50/month is a generous estimation based on how they act in book 1.

** Someone did a bunch of research on what the Dursleys could have gotten from the Government for Harry.

[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/66h2bvcjrm4c3rp/harry%27schildbenefits%20%28ceindrych%29.pdf?dl=0]]

The website doesn't exist anymore, and I had to use the wayback machine. Here's the save as a PDF of that page.

When Harry first joined Hogwarts, it was something like 940 pounds a year? And judging from the evidence in the books, what money they did spend on Harry wasn't even close to that, so that money was mostly profit for the Dursleys.

Just call it Guardian Allowance and Child Benefits.

Now... You could also have Dumbledore giving them a childcare stipend from Harry's vault. 150-200 pounds a month for food and clothing is a reasonable amount. But they usually require receipts and documentation, and can get audited. This can get nasty, at least in the US. In the 90's this family on the same street as me temporarily fostered a kid who was in this situation.

And please, if the Goblins "discover" this, please make it believable. Like they question the fact that Harry /can't/ be the Boy who lived, as the Boy who lived's relatives get ~30-40 Galleons /a month/ for childcare costs, and Harry is way too scrawny for that. Then the "They got money!? They said I was a burden!!1one"

*** Thank you, this is very helpful.

I do actually have in mind that Dumbldore took money from Harry's vault for his care. Harry then finds the money at the Dursleys and later comparing by the sum withdrawn from his vault realizes it was his money all along. Maybe the fact there was an extra documentation needed was why the Dursleys couldn't even spend it all along, which was the issue unknown to Dumbldore.

**** It would probably be better if he found a shoebox with a ledger/notebook and envelopes full of receipts, where everything matches his bank records.

Then he can argue/disprove and show evidence "They couldn't have bought me clothes, this is a receipt for the big and tall kids store" "why would I need a uniform for Smeltings, when I'm going to Hogwarts?"

Dumbledore can get summoned for a Dursley smackdown.

On a side note...

I can see McGonagall "punishing" Dumbledore by making him live with Harry for the two weeks or w/e a year Harry needs to stay there to recharge the blood wards.
