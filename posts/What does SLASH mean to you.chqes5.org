So I've been wondering for a while now if when people on here (as they almost unfailingly do) say 'No Slash' - do they mean that they don't want any kind of LGBT+ fanfics recommended, or is slash something in of itself? I've seen slash described as poorly written, untrue to life, etc. but in my experience, fics with LGB pairings are no more likely to be of poor quality than those without. So is slash not synonymous with 'main pairing is gay/lesbian' or is it that people don't want to be recommended those pairings for another reason?

I've read enough good 'slash' to not accept the whole 'slash fics are just bad' when I've read hot trash straight fics and excellent lgbt ones in roughly equal measure.

​

Also I feel like the perception makes it difficult to write lgbt fics. I'm bisexual, and I write a lot of fics across different accounts, but I'm always hesitant to write lgbt pairings because I know a huge amount of my potential audience either won't read it because 'it's gay' or will read it expecting it to fulfil the tropes ascribed to slash fics.

From what I've seen on this sub, there's a large variation in what people mean when they request no slash. Some mean they don't want any non-canon slash, some just don't want an m/m slash pairing for the main character, and some are only ok with slash pairing if its between 'safe' couples (i.e. no male Death Eaters).

Survey numbers have shown that a large percentage of the fanfiction community enjoys reading slash, especially on Ao3. (A [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16988592/chapters/39933321][2013 survey]] showed that 89.7% of Ao3 users who responded enjoy reading slash.) Even on this sub (which is generally perceived as anti-slash) [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c6p4xj/hp_fanfiction_subreddit_survey_2019/][Taure's recent survey]] showed that there's a 50/50 split between people who do and don't read (edit: m/m) slash.

Taure's surveys show that this sub has different demographics than the broader communities of FFN and Ao3, so you shouldn't get discouraged by what you observe here. You'll find plenty of fans on Ao3 and FFN regardless.

** To me, "slash" is simply a fic with an M/M pairing. There's a little grey area around background characters that don't impact the plot and just exist as fluff and window dressing (e.g. Dean/Seamus), but that's the gist of it IMO.

I think the reputation of slash as being generically bad comes from (mostly female?) authors who use it as a vehicle for writing wish-fulfillment porn without regard for what makes sense in terms of both characterization and biology.

** I think its because fanfiction is predominantly written by females who have a reputation of writing very fantasy slash where one of the boys takes on feminine qualities and just really doesn't feel realistic to most bisexual/gay males.

A reason I avoid slash is because I don't like fics focusing on romance in general and more often than not if someone went to the trouble of introducing a non-canon, non-common pairing then they probably will focus on romance.

*** I agree. The main problem with slash for me, or at least what I consider slash, is the feminization of one party in the relationship, by which I mean that they don't behave like men but like simpering girls. My other problem with slash, is the astounding impropability of the sex. The sex between two men in the vast majority of slash, is exactly the same as between a man and a woman (slick channels, instant pleasure, etc. etc.), which is of course ridiculous and so silly it's sometimes even revolting (btw, this is why the a/b/o thing was even invented in my opinion).

​

My last problem with slash is that they focus too much on the relationship and not enough on the plot. Even if there is a plot, it's usually just a device to propel the romance forward. It usually has the passive men to get all emotional and proclaim his devotion to the active party, because rape is the new dead parents... (see my first issue with slash for further evidence).

Overall, I dislike slash because it's lazy writing and totally not for me. But I can understand if someone, usually a girl or a woman likes it.

When I say 'no slash'- though I actually try not to do this- I'm just not wanting to read Harry/M I don't mind side pairings being slash at all, though.

** Slash is an interesting term in the fact that (at least in my experience) it's rarely written by or for lgbt people. From my many years of reading fanfics, lgbt people writing characters as lgbt will often not use the tag, instead using something like "bisexual character", "trans character", or just put "character x/character y". Essentially, lgbt people are more likely to classify a non heterosexual relationship as just a relationship, where as straight people are more likely to feel the need to make sure everyone knows that they think lgb relationships need a different classification. A loooot of stuff an author labels "slash" turns out to be degrading or fetishistic. It's like the term yaoi, it's really common to see straight women who would act homophobic in real life( especially towards lesbians), turn around are write their m/m fantasies online. There are of course exceptions. Some lgbt fans like the term, although I've only really seen it used by us positively in the Star Trek community. Possibly bc of Spirk and how large and old the star trek lgbt community is? At the same time, I won't interact with threads asking for no slash, because it's not uncommon for someone saying "no slash" actually mean they want no lgbt people in a fic.

** Slash means to me that the main character or at least one of the main characters is in a homosexual relationship.

I don't mind slash. The sex scenes do nothing for me, but neither do heterosexual ones to be honest. A well-written story will also put emphasis on what's going on on an emotional level, and there it doesn't matter if it's a straight, gay or lesbian relationship.

I don't get people who say that they can't empathize with a gay main character. I mean, being attracted to men is waaay less out there than doing magic and battling dark lords.

** My problem is not slash - esama writes primarily slash and I love their work. My issue is how some writers end up limiting their work due to slash. This usually happens in three ways:

1. Every character is LGBT - there are no straight/vanilla characters to be found. The whole story ends up being an exploration of what if no one was straight and I start obsessing about how the human population survived before IVF was possible. Mpreg sounds so uncomfortable and awkward that it doesn't serve as a possible solution to me.
2. A character that I have firmly categorized as straight is portrayed as LGBT. Someone like Hermione or Ron from the Harry Potter series. I have read and enjoyed stories where Harry is LGBT, but not the other two.
3. Being LGBT dictates the plot. My favourite part of esama's works is how the characters just happen to be LGBT - that aspect of them is just something the reader figures out along the way. The decisions they make are due to their whole personality/characteristic, not simply because they're LGBT. There are stories where coming out or finding acceptance is the plot, which is a great topic to explore, but those stories don't interest me.

Also, within the fan fiction community, their is a huge amount of LGBT work. I can easily find slash on my own, but finding no slash is harder, especially if you don't want harems, rape, etc.

This is the one that makes me wary of the subject tbh. I don't care who the characters want to bang, as long as they have more personality than "I'm queeeeeeer!" Characters should not be defined by their sexuality, and I hard pass any fic that tries to make the character's sexual orientation their defining trait.

One dimensional characters are bad, yo, and it makes me leary of reading the genre.

** My perception of slash (and not necessarily what it "is") has always been really romance-driven stories that feature two males. On AO3 I've seen a higher quality of LGBT writing when there are tags like, "Gay Harry," or something like that, lmao.

People who tag / write slash seem to be on the younger and less experienced side, whereas fics that either don't mention orientation or label it differently tend to be a little more mature and accurate.

Sidenote, if you're looking for some LGBT fanfic, Saving Connor is baller as fuck.

** Slash is a romance fic with two men. It's usually even worse than normal romance, on account of pretty much just being the fantasy of the (generally female) writer.

Generally it's only the main characters that count because background characters don't get enough focus to be an issue (and are usually just a relationship rather than someone's pervy fantasy)

Doesn't help that half the slash pairings seem to involve death eaters or their (just as bigoted and eager to get the genocide going) children.

** The naming of slash is funny to me because I imagine a saber fight with penises but that's because I'm immature.

I don't care about it because it seems mainly written by gushing 14-yo girls or LGBT peoples wanting representation, and that's not a problem but I've had enough experience with that in mainstream media to know that it's generally no pledge for quality. Reading fanfiction is really like searching for a needle in a haystack except that the needle is a barely decent piece of fiction and the haystack is a very large pile of badly written shit, so it's not time-efficient to search for that in the parts that are more likely to be badly written, and that goes not only for slash but for lots of other categories of fanfictions as well.

But I don't have a problem with slash per se, if a slash fic was recognized as an absolute masterpiece of course I would read it, it's not a turn off. That goes for anything lgbtqqip2saa+ related. On an unrelated note, I showed my fic to someone who immediately thought it was slash because the story was overwhelmingly focused on two main male characters who spend almost all their time together, so maybe I'm crypto-gay.

** I'm gonna be honest I had no idea that people think slash is looked down upon. Slash just means the story is based around a gay relationship, and when people ask for no slash, it just means that slash isn't something that floats their boat, which is totally valid. And, I'm sure, there are some people who are also homophobic and any mention of gay stuff makes them uncomfortable or angry, but I'm going to assume the people who ask for no slash are generally in the former group and not the latter.

Anyone who thinks slash is generally bad, have you tried searching AO3 and sorting by kudos? Any fic about anything that you just randomly stumble on has an 80% chance of being bad since fics don't have to be vetted by anyone. I think it's a little unfair to proclaim that slash fics are bad without taking into account the fact that there are always good writers and bad writers. And for the people commenting that it's generally "by females" and "for females"-- people realize that women make up 51% of the population, right? And to the extent that people think it's "wish fulfillment", isn't that kind of the point of fiction and romance? We read because we want to experience something outside of our own lives, something that will make us feel something about fictional people. Fan fic fulfills emotional needs, and some people's emotional needs involve gays rather than straights.

OP, if you write any Drarry or Wolfstar, I WILL read it!

I don't think slash is bad and will occasionally read it but I do not recommend sorting by kudos on AO3. I have tried that a few times and the types of fics on there are anything but good. Maybe I clicked on the wrong ones, but all ranged from horribly bad, to meh to crack that made no sense to fetish type stuff. Some may be alright if you are already into the pairing and don't mind characters acting OOC but most are just not good introductions for anyone not into slash.

Take the HP fic with the most kudos on AO3 for example. You would think it should be amazing since it's the most popular HP fic on AO3 but it's just not. I only read the beginning but the entire thing just seems like a bad set up to get Harry and Draco together. Harry kisses Draco and there are no decent reasons given as to why they even care for one another in the first place. Other Drarry fics that I have started have been similar in my experience. I still haven't found one fic I cared about with that pairing or that I thought did the relationship well.

And if thats not an option, then try a handful of recs from people online or friends.

Barring that, try looking for tropes you already like. If you generally like Soulmates AU, and you wanna try some M/M for the first time, maybe try to find a M/M fic thats Soulmates AU. Things like that.

I don't hate slash, but as a straight male I don't read it. I tried in the past, with multiple stories, and they're usually poorly written crap full of mpreg, rape where Harry just takes it because the person writing is a 13 y/o girl, and making every male a vela that all of a sudden is bonded to Harry in year 6 (forgetting they were enemies the rest of the time).

5263 of those M/M fics are tagged with a non-con warning or mention "non-con" in the fic description. (5.1%)

** There are, as others have noted, a great many definitions for 'slash.'

Some say it's just m/m. Others say f/f works, too. Some say it's specifically noncanon, others say if there's a canon or semicanon gay relationship, it's still slash. Some say it's slash if there's even a gay romance featured, others say it's only if it's a focus, and other still that it's only slash if it's outright pornographic.

The reason 'no slash' is often requested is because readers get uncomfortable about sexuality in some contexts. The reason slash is actively looked down on in fanfic communities is that, as many have noted, a lot of fanfiction is written by young girls with no experience in a relationship at all, let alone a gay male one. They tend to write not only unrealistic m/m romance and (where applicable) sex, but they write unrealistic m/f romance/sex and then simply call the receiving partner male. It's creepy and weird to read what may well be a very young girl's fantasies, published to the world.

If you can write well, you'll have an audience. You might not get recommended /here/ very often if it's slash, but this is an atypical community, demographic-wise.

*** While some slash is written by young girls, many het fics is written by young boys. How's reading their fantasies are less creepy then? For me, nothing is creepier than your usual harem. They completely dehumanise female character. Even the worst A/B/O slash doesn't do that.

Realistic m/f sex from a female perspective written by men in fandom is like a unicorn. I'm sure it exist, but I've never seen it. Many try, though, usually with laughable results. So many times I've read fics that fell like the author has never even talked to a girl, let alone seen a vagina. Realistic romance and female characters in general written by men is a little easier to find, but not by much. Not that it stops people from reading and praising fics with unrealistic het romance/sex. And it shouldn't, because it's fanfiction. But then slash shouldn't be held to different standards.

I don't enjoy reading harem fics either, but I have to disagree with you about A/B/O being any better. In the most extreme A/B/O fics I've seen the characters are reduced to their animalistic urges with their personalities practically nonexistent. That's as dehumanizing as it gets.

Possibly because in most cases authors don't indicate their gender in their profile? Claiming that men can't write a realistic female sexual perspective is just as much an unfounded assumption as claiming that women are incapable of writing realistic m/m sex.

***** I'm not going to defend A/B/O, it's not my genre any more than harems are. I brought it up as the most notorious and OOC slash trope that gets lots of hate. But even with all the animalistic bullshit, characters there still somehow manage to have more agency than women in harems.

It's usually very easy to tell the author's gender in explicit scenes in fics, especially badly written. Men in general are more than capable of writing realistic female sexual perspective, yes. Male authors writing HP fanfiction? I'll believe it when I see it.

Once again, I don't even need het fanfiction, written by men or women, to be realistic. I just want people to stop looking down on slash as "not realistic", as if m/f is any better.

**** I was going to respond, but [[/u/chiruochiba][u/chiruochiba]] took the words out of my mouth. I'll note that slash as a whole is tainted with the same 'young female author' brush, whereas there isn't really the same genre that's seen as 'young male author' bait, with harems as probably the closest.

I'll say that I'm a bi dude, and I find A/B/O to be a horribly insulting caricature of what a gay relationship is like. It's like a gay minstrel show.

Depends what circles you run in. Inside slash fandom, there are places where older writers are doing their thing exactly as they have been for the last 20 years. There's not a lot of talk or even interest in slash's "tainted" reputation.

I don't think anyone would ever claim A/B/O is meant to represent any version of a gay relationship. It's about kink. It's not about reality at all. The same is true of A/B/O het fics. If I thought it was meant to be taken seriously as a description of m/f relationships, I'd be squicked and probably pissed off. As it is, I've read one omegaverse slash fic I enjoyed in a fandom I wasn't very invested in; it was iddy porn that kept an eye on characterization, written by one of my favorite authors. I tried others that failed to hold my attention, and I backbuttoned out of the Kylo/Rey fic someone else recced to me. It wasn't a bad fic; A/B/O just isn't my thing (and neither is Star Wars). In no way were any of them meant to be held to realistic standards.

** No slash for me covers harry developing a crush for the male body. First of all because the majority would be h/v or h/d which are borderline disgusting. Secondly because as a straight person I can't relate to a gay protagonist, so I can't enjoy a story. If its a supporting character I couldn't care less. And let's be honest with ourselves here, the majority of slash is trash, also the majority of non-slash is trash. Newsflash people, you are reading fan fiction the majority WILL BE trash.

** For me, slash implies that the main pairing is m/m. It's not what I'm into, personally, but it's not something that immediately disqualifies a fic if the rest of the pieces I need are there (proper grammar, good plot ^{in that order}, etc).

** To me, it means the main character(Harry, I don't read non harry-centric fics) has no pairings with boys or men. I don't care if someone else does. Seeing as I don't read fem-harry either, he'll always be paired with a female, or nobody, in the fics I read.

So is it m/m or f/f instead of slash for same sex relationships?

** I am someone who usually don't read Slash (I may sometimes read one if it's really good, but most of the time I ignore these fics). And I don't Slash for the following reasons :

1. Most slash are trash : I know that 95% of all the fics (if not 95% of everything) is trash, but I find the bad Trash especially annoying. The same way I hate harem fic because seeing Harry pledge his eternal love for a girl before fucking another 2 chapter later annoy me, seeing Harry somehow fall in love with Voldemort in 3 Chapters is extremely high ranked in my pet peeves.
2. The couples : I may be wrong (especially since I didn't read trash in a long time), but from what I remember, a big majority of slash fic have "discutable pairings". Harry/ Draco can already cause problems since Draco is basically a young Nazi, (though he can be redemned I guess), but when I becomes a Harry/ Lucius or any other Death Eater . . . As for the other popular couple it's either Harry/ Voldemort, Harry/ Snape or Hermione/ Bellatrix (to have some girls too). All of these pairing are extremely creepy for a lot of other reasons than "it's a gay couple".
3. The Message : So, I'm someone who likes some comic book characters, but dislike comic books because I don't like it when a author try to push a moral onto me with the subtility of a sledgehammer, it's the same with fanfics. I don't care if the character of the story is gay, if it's just the Mc falling in love with a dude for any reason, it's ok. But if the fic takes 2 chapter to have him make his coming out, than 5 more to explain how hard it is for him to be gay and how people are intolerant, then I feel like the author try to use (probably badly) this media to push his ideology, so I'll just forget this fic.

​

So in the end, I feel like while the "homosexual" aspect of Slash may be a little part of the problem, the main reason why it's disliked is because it became one of this well etablished trop which are now completely cliche (in the same line that Indi Harry and/or Lord Harry). If it was just because it's gay, a simple gender bender (Fem Voldemort and/or Fem Harry for example) would resolve the problem, but I'm pretty sure most Slash would still be annoying even with genders changed.

** A lot of slash fics end up being pure smut, and while I'm happy to read hetero smut, m/m smut doesn't do it for me. That being said, I'm perfectly fine reading a fic with LGBT main characters if the fic isn't explicit

** If a story author mentions that there is a pairing at the start, or that the MC is gay, then it's likely they will sacrifice a good portion of the fic for exploring that avenue.

On a more personal level, i usually find most romance or smut cringy at the best of times, and having a homosexual element in there only makes it disgusting for me - i want to immerse myself in the story, so i'd rather not have my mind's eye show me gay porn.

** Some view slash as a turnoff, something that they view as something that ruins the fic. It's sometjing, asmall little detail that barely matters, yet it's like seeing that small little crack on your screen, you it just irks you. For some, they view it as something that completely ruins a concept for something. For some, it's the pairing [Snake!Harry potter x Lord Voldermort] that seems unrealistic, sometimes, it's the way it's put, like the person spontaneously becomes gay, or perhaps it's simply a dislike of slash as a whole. For me, I don't mind slash, I'll read it on occasion, I just don't actively search for it. It also depends on the person. If it's someone like Harry, yeah sure that's fine. but with someone like Voldermort, it seems so out of character for him to do such a thing. He is the epitome of, "You must be Pure in blood to be alive" and is such a person to kill something that is not normal, that it seems so absurd for him to do such a thing.

** Slash means the main relationship is same gender as the partner.

I still read more slash than vanilla. I was offended about male and female sex was written where the sex is just pop and go. Slash fic has the potential of slower and prep needed.

Although I agree that harry potter magic tends to allow the skipping of normal safety and prep work.

I do dislike harry and Ginny together. I appreicate that harry did date cho. But ginny seems an easy route to take. Easy to pressure a family starved harry into a marriage because he really wanted something parental from arthur and Molly
