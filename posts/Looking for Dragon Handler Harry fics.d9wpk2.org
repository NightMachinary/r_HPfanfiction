I recently read the Muggle Rasied Champion and Its Sequel (which is incomplete fyi) and it was a really intresting concept and wanted to ask if there are any other fics like it.

NO SLASH PLEASE!

  Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds.

***** There were some, can't remember them off the top of my head, but it's not that rare, but there's one issue, Harry never follows on it. It's just a useless conversation that shows how special he is, nothing more.
