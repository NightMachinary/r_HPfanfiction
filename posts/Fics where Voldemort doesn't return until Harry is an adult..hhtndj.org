Maybe Harry is in his late 20's and has been an Auror for several years, or he's been recently promoted to Head of the Aurors. A few Aurors turn up dead, Harry goes to investigate personally. One thing leads to another, it's him and the Aurors vs Voldemort & Death Eaters. Seems like it could be interesting with all the options and potential magical skills that being an adult allows. Makes for a more believable conflict between the two of them, even though Harry would still be the underdog.

Anyway, the only hard requirement I'm looking for is Harry being graduated from Hogwarts by the time Voldemort starts making any moves. Preferably a handful of years out of Hogwarts or more.

Can anybody recommend good fics for this?


** Such fics are indeed too rare, and they actually avoid all kinds of nasty issues like:

- Ridiculous overpowered teenagers
- Ridiculous skill progression
- Ridiculous child politicians
- Dumbledore sacrificing children\\
- Child soldiers or children forced to become killers
- Minors in sexual relationships or 'true love' under 16

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), Voldemort returns in 2005, and most story takes place after 2008. It reaches 2024, but remains unfinished in its last story arc. But this fic is a rather extreme AU and things are quite different here.

In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), Harry and co face off Voldemort in 1999, with a powerful and competent Dumbledore leading them. It's still not exactly what you are looking for, and it's another extreme AU.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** "Beyond the curtain" by Bobika, linkffn(13047893) is one of my favorite adult Harry vs Voldemort stories. It's a little different from the usual in that it imagines a world where Voldemort won the battle of Hogwarts, and it builds up a completely different but believable world. It's still a WIP though.

  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts. Eighteen years ago, Harry Potter disappeared, presumed dead. He only now resurfaces to guide the remaining resistance through the Magical Curtain that separates the rest of the world from Voldemort's Empire, where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free. No prominent pairings. 5* from DLP.

** "Harry potter and the power of the past" by Lord umbrex. This may be what you're looking for, it features an 21 year old Harry and it's complete.
