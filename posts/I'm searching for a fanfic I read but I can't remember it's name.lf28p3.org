:END:
Hi! I'm searching for a fanfic in which Hermione is fighting in the war and when she wakes up, she finds out that she is stuck in the body of Lily Potter. I remember Regulus coming and explaining the situation to Hermione... She acts as the loving wife she thinks Lily was but she doesn't know that James and Lily don't love each other. I lost this story, if someone knows the one I'm taking about, please share the link! I read it on ffn. And if anyone has read any other fic with a similar plot then please share that too.
