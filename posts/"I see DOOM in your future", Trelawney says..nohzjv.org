Harry /convinces/ Dudley to let him play the new game.


** Harry, inspired by the Doomslayer slaughters death eaters with his bare hands.

Lucius Malfoy looked at the carnage around him, at the piles of mangled corpses of his alllies. In the middle of this bloodbath stood Potter, drenched in blood from head to toe with a maniacal grinn on his face.

He felt himself pissing his robes when the... thing made eye contact with him. He would have run away if he still had legs but in his broken state he could only crawl a few inches. All too soon he felt someone pull him up from his hair. "N-no! Please..." he began to sob only for the monster to laugh as Potter dug his thumbs into his eyes. "Rip and Tear" it responded.

Quite night air filled with horrifying screams of agony until after what felt liker hours, a disgusting cracking noise ended it. Harry looked at the pieces of flesh and bone in his hands, disfigured remnants of what used to be Lucius Malfoys head. "Thats for Hedwig you inbred Motherfuckers" he wispered.

** I always envisioned a Harry with access to a computer, designing a Hogwarts.wad Doom level with the original shareware. I'm 4 days younger than the literary Harry, and Doom was one of the coolest things of the day in the early 90's. I don't know about the UK, however.

Why did you put "convinces" in italic? It implies Harry uses the Imperius Curse on him... :-D

*** Not necessarily the Imperius, but asking nicely probably wouldn't do the trick. There's plenty of other options if you're a bit creative..

** We seriously need a fic with the Doom Guy being transported to HP universe and raiding Azkaban to kill all Dementors, being the closet things to demons in existence in that world.

Then if he crosses with Voldy... That would be fun too
