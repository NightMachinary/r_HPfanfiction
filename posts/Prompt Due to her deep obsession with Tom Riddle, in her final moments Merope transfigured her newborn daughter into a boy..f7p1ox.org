It will be quite an interesting story if Merope's transfiguration is undone sometime in Tom Riddle's Hogwarts years.


** I don't mean to be offensive with the following question at all, but I'm genuinely curious -- what is it about this premise that appeals to you?

*** I've read a few fem.Voldemort fics and I supposed that Merope was insane enough to use magic to make her daughter resemble Tom Riddle Sr (After all she did Imperius and/or potion him). In linkao3(932445) , Merope was in denial that she gave birth to a daughter and when the midwife points out that she has a daughter, she still persisted in naming her daughter Tom Marvolo Riddle.

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.

** Gah! I think that would send Tom Riddle over the edge when he found out... not only was his mother such a weak witch that she wasn't able to survive childbirth to raise him, but she used her last bit of power to change her daughter into something she wasn't. Sorry. Pronouns are confusing in this context.
