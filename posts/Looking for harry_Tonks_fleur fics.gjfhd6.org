** I have 2 sadly neither are finished but I know one is still being worked on just slow updates

The Horcrux Hunt is really good. Still being updated hut slowly [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12110842/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Horcrux-Hunt]]

The best man's job is good be highly AU and a little smutty. Hasn't been updated in awhile so probably abandoned.

*** I like both. And The Horcrux Hunt has one of my favorite set pieces. Voldemort plans to kill all non-Slytherins on the Hogwarts Express on it's way back to school. Harry and the gang get wind of the plan and trap Slytherins in the last car before decoupling it. Then Harry uses the Elder Wand to turn the entire train into a portkey, evacuating 3/4's of the school.

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

** linkffn(11000408) Odd quasi RIFTS/HP crossover. One of the more unorthodox Delacour portrayals, but it still felt largely in character. No Updates in five years.

  Harry Potter had disappeared from Privet Drive before Petunia had ever woken in the morning. Now thirteen years later his name came out of the Goblet of Fire. What will the Wizarding World think of a Harry Potter raised by a civilization thought lost to tragedy
