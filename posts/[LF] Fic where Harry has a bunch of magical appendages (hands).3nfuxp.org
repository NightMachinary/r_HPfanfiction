I have been trying to find this fic that I read a while back where the power that Voldemort knows not or whatever is that Harry can shape his magic into like multiple appendages outside of his body and do all sorts of cool stuff with it, I thought it was actually pretty good at the time that I read it and I've been looking for hours and I just can't find it. If you can tell me which one this was I'd really appreciate it. :)

*** I found the Harry in this story to be even more of a sanctimonious and self-sacrificing punk than the canon one.

And the canon one basically walked to his own death based on a vaguely possible plan contrived by someone who saw him raised expressly for the purpose of dying.
