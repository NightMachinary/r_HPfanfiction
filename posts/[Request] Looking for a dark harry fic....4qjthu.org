If I remember right, it was on ff.net.

Harry was pretty evil (maybe dating Voldemort?) and I remember the Weasley twins had this prank that made your nicknames appear over your head. They were using it on Ron and then I think Ron was like, 'how would you like it?' and he used it on Harry and his Secret Evil Identity was revealed. Anyone know which one I'm talking about? Any help would be appreciated!

*Maybe Harry had to break a window in the great hall to escape? I might be mixing my fics here.


** Omg I read this recently and now I cannot remember the name. Now I'm angry because I actually enjoyed this fic and was hunting for a reread.

I can remember so much more about it now, I'll hunt through FF.net for you.

Edit: I spent a lot of time last night and early this morning looking for it. I know that [[/spoiler][Harry was given the nickname by Voldemort]] but that's all key things I can remember from it. I also know that Harry was in Gryffindor still and that helps lower the list a little bit. I cannot remember what the nickname he got was nor the year that the story was set in and it's annoying me.

The issue is that I don't know whether I read the fic on my phone or PC, so I have to sift through both.

*** Yeah, I remember him still being in Gryffindor, and I think I also remember him either having a part in the death of Mr. Weasley? He was still friends with Hermione and Ron, but it was just for show, I think. I can't even remember if this story was complete or not :(

** I don't know whether I'd be interested in reading this fic, but I love the idea of Dark!Evil!Harry's cover being blown not by Dumbledore's spies, not by Hermione's research, and not in a suitably dramatic reveal, but by a Weasley prank.

*** That actually sounds brilliant. Like everyone's having a laugh at this rank and then slowly everyone goes silent as they see Harry's nickname. Harry himself is just like well fuck, time for me to go.

** Found it! I looked right at it and even skimmed a couple of the chapters, guess I didn't look at the right ones lol.
