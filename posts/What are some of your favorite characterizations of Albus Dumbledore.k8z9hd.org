  Ousted from Hogwarts by a gang of corrupt, incompetent officials, Albus comes to the understanding that Voldemort is not his only enemy. Now, fighting on two fronts against the Ministry and Voldemort, he finds himself in dire need of an ally. One who, like him, is a wizard of uncommon power and skill. Canon Departure from OotP. Gen.

** Harry is forcefully and accidentally sent back in time to the 40s the very second after he kills Voldemort. The wizards around him start attacking. Panicked, he fights back and defeats everyone around him. One of them just happened to be Grindlewald.

There's no bashing, per say. Dumbledore is just rightfully suspicious and torn about the man he loved being imprisoned by a stranger, while still kind of relieved that it wasn't him. There's also a scene where Harry kills the basilisk and Dumbledore is absolutely furious that Harry didn't come for help.

Also, it's worth reading chapter five for the basilisk encounter alone:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Tom Riddle stopped dead and stared at him.

    Harry stared back, all at once entirely too aware of the fact that he was painted with blood, the Sorting Hat on his head had yet to stop laughing and had now progressed to outright cackling, there was a particularly traumatised chicken under one arm, a bloodied sword in the other, and a snake around his shoulders. In total. He looked ridiculous, nightmareish, and definitely up to no good.

    Harry stared at him, thinking quickly, and Riddle stared back, unable to think of anything, his mouth open and his eyes practically popping out of his skull.

    “No one will ever believe you,” the former Gryffindor found himself blurting out before he did the most ridiculous thing he could think of, something that only Fred and George would have done, and transfigured his shoes into rollerskates to make a quick get away, shooting around the corner to the kitchens with the hat positively howling with laughter on his bloodsoaked head.

  It started with a wretched scream from a Death Eater, a burst of accidental magic so powerful it flung away the people holding him down.It started with an unknown spell and a potion bottle and a desperate cutting curse from an unknown wizard trying to save him, it started with a blood sacrifice and a gargled mispronounced spell from an accidentally half-decapitated head, and a broken bottle exploding at his feet.And the world heaved around them.Harry Potter vanished in the plume of burning potion fumes, a burst of golden smoke that engulfed him so suddenly he hadn't the chance to move.It started with the death of Voldemort and the one person in the entire damn world that wanted to save him for his own sake following on his heels, and the unspoken left to hang between them, and the single sliver of soul that knew love through him. Harry had no idea where he was, just that he was under attack. He didn't intend to irrevocably alter the timeline. He didn't intend to draw attention to himself at Hogwarts. He didn't intend to get the attention of Tom Riddle. But he did it anyway.

** My favourite Dumbledores all have some significant amount of that grandfatherly, "Alas, Earwax" silliness while still being competent.

--------------

Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)

Exactly what it says on the tin. Harry is a dragon. This is perfectly normal to him. Dumbledore is silly-yet-competent, neatly torpedo-ing Umbridge's reputation one moment and taking Harry to "a Scottish chef's restaurant" (read: McDonalds) the next.

--------------

Albus And Harry's World Trip: linkffn(13388022)

Harry gets expelled after the Chamber of Secrets. Albus doesn't get re-instated as Headmaster. Together, they tour the world while teaching Harry all he needs to know to defeat the Dark Lord and having fun along the way.

--------------

The Amplitude, Frequency, and Resistance of the Soul Bond: linkffn(9818387)

Harry and Ginny share a soul-bond. Dumbledore is a paperwork-dodger and a fun-loving grandpa. Sadly dead fic, but what's there is good.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

Harry and Ginny's reactions to reading each other's minds are appropriately "ew, opposite gender" for being all of 11/12, they spend a lot of time trolling each other, and Dumbledore at one point promises every participant in a snowball fight points to their House if they can hit him - knowing full well that /everyone/ in that snowball fight is a Gryffindor.

He gets stinking drunk when he has it brought home how badly he screwed up with Harry and genuinely vows to reform himself. Unlike a lot of other fics I've read, he still has his slip ups but forces himself back on track, rather than a perfect and immediate redemption. Second story sadly unfinished, but has the scene where he realizes he's overstepping and backs down.
