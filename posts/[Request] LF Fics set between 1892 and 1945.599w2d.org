Looking for longer stories set somewhere between 1892 - The year Dumbledore would have started Hogwarts - and 1945 - The year Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald. The stories can be focused around Dumbledore's time in Hogwarts, Tom Riddle's time in Hogwarts, Minerva McGonagall's time in Hogwarts. It could be focused on the war between Dumbledore and Grindlewald (Which I would be very interested in). Hopefully the stories could include specific reference to the time period - i.e. grappling with either of the World Wars, dealing with the relationship the magical world has with major muggle events of the late 19th/early 20th century. But any stories revolving around the school years of Voldemort/Mcgonagall or Dumbledore would be great. Thanks in advance!

#+begin_quote
  Back in 1942, the trio of McGonagall, Pomfrey and Hooch first walked the corridors together, forging friendships that would last for all their lives. Faced with misfired curses, dragon pox, Quidditch-related mayhem and Slytherin's monster, they'll need all of Minerva's quick intelligence, Poppy's incredible knowledge, and Rolanda's reckless daring to get them through in one piece.

  How could she sit there, looking at all the innocent children she had sworn to protect, when she belonged to the guilty ones? How could she accuse others when she should be accused? And how could she have ever been so stupid to fall for one Tom Riddle?
