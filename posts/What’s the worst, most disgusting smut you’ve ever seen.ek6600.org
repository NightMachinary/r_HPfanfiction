** Cw necrophilia, noncon, mention of pedo shitt.... just don't read for your own sanity. These fics I kind of read./watched they were like a train wreck coming and couldn't take my eyes off it

The famous lucius drilling a hole into the skull of Draco, and then literally brain fucks him. Well,his corpse skull. I believe the same person also wrote a disgusting lucius gang banged by Dementors.

I won't describe it but there is a disgusting fic on a03 with pedophila including all the maraduars And Lily.... Focused on Harry let's just say. I have seen several others with the adults being different characters..

Look, I'm no prude, but that last one.... If a pedo wrote it to satisfy their urges and not victimize kids.... Okay, I get it, though still, ew. But why did they have to publish it?? There is no need to share that! I didn't get that far into the fic but I did read a little bit in shocked horror. I wish I could block that more.

Again I'm no prude. I like reading kinky shit. Sometimes I'm really into darker themes and such. Sometimes I like the fluffy happy shit.

I've read a lot of fic. The strangest smut was great squid/hogwarts tbh. It wasn't horrifying it was more like weird crack almost smut.

Harry was MUCH much younger in the fic I'm unfortunately remembering.

** linkao3(4752719) Honestly, this one is not so bad, it's more cracky than smutty.

The actual worst smut I've seen I won't link because it's riddled with poorly-written underage sex, but it's unfortunately the most-+kudosed+ viewed work in the “Female Harry Potter” tag on AO3.

Edit: Apparently I had filtered “Female Harry” and “Female Harry Potter” on at the same time, so some presumably-normal fanfiction pairing Harry Potter and Voldemort with more kudos than “Hailey Potter the Cock Slut” (the actual fic I was referring to) was incorrectly labeled as a garbage smut fic.

Edit 2: “Hailey Potter the Cock Slut” has the highest hits in the tag, though.

Really? You think the plot focused fic currently with 9044 kudos is worse than the 3rd highest (5913 kudos), which is an actual smut fic titled "Hailey Potter the Cock Slut"?

But, an adult Harry with Voldemort is fine by me!

And if they only cuddle and hold hands, I suppose Harry can be 14, too.
