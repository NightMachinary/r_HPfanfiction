** See, that's an interesting question. I find myself going back to my favorite fanfics all the time, but I rarely go and reread canon. And yet, without canon those fics would not exist. I guess it's inevitable that there will be this element to reading fanfic of "this could have been so cool in canon". The urge to fix things, or improve upon what we see as failings in canon. Fanfic is a strange beast.

There's one, I think. Prince of the Dark Kingdom.

Oh I was telling myself while reading Psychic Serpent that an alternate dimension JK Rowling wrote this novel. As much as I love Tonks and Luna among others, I haven't missed them once while reading this trilogy.

** This is a very controversial question. I'll give you my /honest opinion/ even though I know many will disagree.

The only Fics I'd put on the same level of quality of Canon are the Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave and Hogwarts Houses Divided.

Let me explain my reasoning for the first. This is a 7 year, 2.6m word epic from over 10 years ago that still manages to not show too much age. It sticks with familiar Canon occurrences but changes them oh so slightly to really stand out. The creativity and world the author creates is superb. This is Slash after year 5, and isn't terribly popular around here but I believe it deserves much more recognition.

Onto Hogwarts Houses Divided. My reasoning here is simply this: the epilogue was unsatisfying. This story manages to continue the feel of the HP universe and usher us into the next era.

Both of these maintain a somewhat Canon feel while being unique and doing much more.

** It's hard to compare as most of the great fics are single novels rather than 7 part series. There are fics that I believe did a better job in certain aspects than canon such as with world building or building up of the canon pairings. But I haven't found a fic that exceeding Rowling's plot and simple scope, which she had 7 books to devote to.

For me, there aren't many fics that exceed the series, but there are fics that fit seamlessly into the narrative as companion pieces, for example [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] which offers a different perspective on Deathly Hallows.

** I would have to say The Arithmancer by White Squirrel, and it's sequel, Lady Archimedes. While the first years of The Arithmancer can be described as boring, the latest chapters (its still updating, but close to completion) are the absolute definition of the word Awesome. It is as good as the original, not sure if better but definitely on the same level.

** I guess MOR somewhat qualifies for me, as do a few others. (Don't hang me just yet.)

I have a /lot/ of gripes with canon because I dig consistent world building and well defined magic systems. I just can't enjoy canon that much anymore because I keep cringing at how much conflict is forced by making people act stupidly.\\
MOR fixes a couple of these problems. The writing and the way the story is told is really painful, but after I get used to it I don't really notice, and having at least the attempt of making people non-stupid or having people notice stupidity when they run into it removes a lot of immersion breaking moments I had in canon. To me HPMOR is a pictore of something absolutely beautiful and amazing... drawn by a two year old with crayons.

I remember a couple other fics that did the same or even more for my taste, but I would have to dig those up since it's a pretty long time ago that I read those.

--------------

Basically, I really don't like canon that much, but it does provide an elaborate setting into which to transplant characters as well as archetypes to modify and characters to transplant into different settings.

The fact that you noticed and remembered the shitty writing proves that the story is by no means "printable" quality.

** Yeah, there's /The Merging/, /The Lie I've Lived/, /Lessons with Hagrid/, /Bungle in the Jungle/, /Prince of Slytherin/, /Pureblood Pretense/ and a bunch of others.

Canon's got whimsy though which is nice although books 6&7 set the bar pretty low for fan fic to be 'better than canon'.

** I think linkffn(The Augurey by La-Matrona) is better than canon in some respects m. At the very least, I think it takes the canon characterization and uses it well. Some might not think it's a compliment to say this - understandably, given all the nonsense that cropped up in HBP and DH - but this story nails the characters much better than the last few books and I find it much more enjoyable because of that. Even Ron, who by this point in canon was more often annoying to me, is kind of tolerable here.

** I wouldn't say it's better than the cannon and it starts off weak. But, I have read the Resonance series by GreenGecko several times. It's like the perfect Snape raises Harry story because neither of them get a personality transplant to make it happen. Also, even when Harry gets all super Harry there is still conflict and character development.
