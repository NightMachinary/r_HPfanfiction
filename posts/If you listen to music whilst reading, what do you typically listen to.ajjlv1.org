** Depends on what I'm reading, but usually ambient and experimental stuff like Aphex Twin, Arca, Forest Swords, Tim Hecker, etc. as well as a lot of jazz (as a human being with a pulse, you owe it to yourself to listen to the new Sons of Kemet record). Aside from that, it's mostly depends on the genre and I can listen to anything from The Beatles to Death Grips to Bathory. Though since I end up reading (and writing) a lot of melancholy postwar fics about the trio dealing with adulthood, I'm a sucker for sad-dad indie rock bands like The National and Frightened Rabbit.

** I find that there is this whole following of marching music that I've never heard of people listening recreationally. But now I'm finding out people like to listen to it along with drum marches, just an odd thing I've learned.

** Depends. Today, it was pre-Swordfishtrombones era Tom Waits; yesterday, it was 80s Slayer; and the day before that, it was Toto's Africa on constant loop. Basically it's just whatever I'm in the mood for at any given moment.

** I prefer to read in silence or with some quiet ambient instrumental/electronic music on, but when I'm writing, I usually listen to anything that generally inspires me, from Tom Waits to Janelle Monae. Right now I'm writing my fic's finale and listening to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqHJT5fZuJk][DakhaBrakha]]

** I have a specific playlist of music circa 1991-1997.

It gets me back into the mentality of the 90's.

Of course, if I were being entirely accurate, it would be a cassette mixtape of them but I'm a pedant, not a masochist.
