I know ffs tastes are to each to his own but whats your biggest pet peeve in fanfics? The ones that annoys you and when you notice, you kinda just drop the fic.

Mine is when the charas personalities go very out of character without decent development on how they became like that.

Edit: I just realized i instantly drop ff when Harry is paired to another girl aside from Ginny without decent and reaspnable development. I think the only one i accepted for another fem pair is delenda est where development was decent. Aside from this, ive dropped those which directly paired Harry to another girl, hermione included without decent development. Also as much as ron can be an ass, i dont like bashing him too much and hermione/harry fics just kills my interest.


** "So mote it be", it just comes across as a very pretentious way of trying to sound posh.

That or changing Harry's name on top of giving him a whole different personality. He's just an entirely different character at that point, whats the point?

Also wrongful text alignment as JAFN said.

In addition, multiple "What if's" in the summary, spelling mistakes in the summary, massive blocks of text effectively cut-and-pasted from the books with only a few words added/changed (if I want canon, I'll read the actual books!) and massive walls-of-text-that-go-on-and-on-and-on...\\

I won't even read those.

Spelling the names wrong, especially "Zambini" instead of Zabini, or the Janus Thackery unit. Also Americanized names like "Little Whining" instead of Little Whinging.

Listing the entire canon Sorting Hat song and/or Gringotts door poem. That's just padding your word count.

Genderbending a character, and then making them gay. If you want those two characters together, and they're already male/female, just make it a het pairing.

** While yes i do agree with your opinion of major change in personality without reason is bad.

My biggest one is that so many people make Harry so overpowered without very much reason. Sure if he trains he would be able to get stronger yes, but making him a god from the get go without reason gets on my nerves.

That and the interpretation of "neither can live while the other survives" where neither can live actual normal lifes while the other is just surviving by magic holding them together isn't used more.

Another is when character names are not capitalized in a fic. I will usually try reading a bit to see if it improve but will quit reading quick if it doesn't.

Poor abused Draco. I'm not against a Draco redemption story, but not when his redemption consist solely in explaining that nothing he did or said from book one to halfway through book six was really him and pretending that someone (usually Lucius) was "forcing" him to act this way.

**** The thing is that... magic /can/ do anything. If not by the time Harry goes at Hogwarts or even at the point of his death, someone somewhere will have discovered/created a way to do it with magic.

As Belial666 once wrote (I'm paraphrasing):

#+begin_quote
  Magic is thought, spells are the words that allow you to express it and enchantments are essays (quite literally with runes). The only difference with actual languages is that most people will only really know around a thousand words and even fewer people can write professionally.
#+end_quote

Of course, there are certain limitations like the transfiguration of food, but that's why wizardkind turned themselves to Charms and Herbology to produce food. The thing with magic is that you can do anything with it. You just have to want it badly enough and be creative and intelligent about it.

I read one fic that had an entire chapter devoted to Hermione purposefully harming herself, then several chapters later it had Hermione thinking about how she's never purposefully harmed herself in her life. And it wasn't a dream sequence or Hermione being written as having a faulty memory, it read as if the author had forgotten what they wrote in the prior chapter, even when it had been a large plot point of that chapter. And then it was never addressed again??

If the author themselves isn't going to pay attention to what's happening in the story, why should I?

A smaller but still irksome one: Characters spouting information that they shouldn't know yet without explanation or with just the explanation of "Harry studied more". One of the warning signs of a particularly bad Indy!Harry is him rattling on about Horcruxes and/or the Gaunts and/or the orphanage as if this is just readily-available information that anyone should know.

** Mine's /Good Guy Harry/(tm)

The sort of Harry that does no wrong, is always stupidly nice to everyone, but throws a tantrum whenever he sees something he doesn't like - and is /obviously/ right in doing so. And, by extension, his entire friends group being an echo chamber of that. Characters are /supposed to have flaws/. The lack of nuance in that is just astonishing. EVERYONE has quirks and biases. The whole "Perfect Good Guy Harry Who Fights Inequality 24/7 And Shits Rainbows" trope just doesn't make it a good read. It makes the story bland.

And on the opposing side, the "Kill All Muggles" dark!Harry whose only personality traits are being sadistic, edgy and racist is pretty much just as bad.

I guess the real pet peeve is fanfics that read like political propaganda for real-life political movements without anything else going on in the fic. We are surrounded by politics IRL every single day. Going on FFN/AO3 to read more politics just isn't a good time.

** Brilliant! Prepare for a long-ish rant!

When Harry goes to gringotts and suddenly he is this overpowered, multi-lordship, betrothed ‘god' I mean, bruh, first of all HOW DOES HE EVEN HAVE THAT MANY LORDSHIPS and secondly just because the horcrux is removed, doesn't mean he literally becomes 1000000 times more powerful

When his name is not ‘Harry' but ‘Harold' ‘Hadrian' or some other name.

No comment. Sorry to break it to you, but he is Harry and I'm afraid I will not take another name

When simple surnames or words are misspelt, like once someone misspelled ‘hermione' - it's not that hard.

For some reason it just really annoys me when things are misspelled.

When people's names are shortened or have nicknames.

‘Mione' , ‘Pup', ‘Cub', ‘Dumbles', ‘Moldyshorts'. They are good at first, but after a while, just no.

When weasleys are bashed for nearly no reason, or evil!dumbledore. The amount of OOC required is too much. To this day I still do not understand why some authors make dumbledore Evil, manipulative etc.

Harry/Ginny fics.

I'm sorry, but I don't really see this pairing working out. Especially in fanon, where she is seen as a possessive potion-addict evil person. Please, stop.

Soul-bonds

Noooo! Not soul bonds! I don't see this working. For me, soulmates already push my boundaries. A ‘soul bond' is basically a horcrux. Also, for hinny soul bonds they suddenly need to be constantly in each other's presence. No, No, No.

Overpowered!Harry fics where out of the blue he becomes a god.

Seriously? How bored are you?

There are probably loads of other types of fics that I HATE but it's kinda late and i'm sub-conciously typing this. Some fanfics have been ruined for ridiculous reasons.

*** Hmm. Mione is kinda ok with me especially cos that how i hear her name being called in the movies but it should be said by close people to her like harry or ron. The others not really unless its harry being a dog animagus at a young age and being called by sirius as a cub. That would make sense. The others not much unless the story is purposely written as a comedy strip.

Manipulative Dumbledore kinda depends to the extent. I can say dumbledore is somehow manipulative but not to the point he toys with harry.

Harry/Ginny fics - it ok to me unless its written badly. I mean it is canon pair and most ive read are time travel fics with past actually being paired with her. OOC is a no no though.

For Weasley being bashed - there were fics were they were written evil and definitely OOC to me. I find Molly and Arthur very kind and evil them is jist not my cup of tea. Ron bashing is another tho specially he acts like a total arse when jealous but not to the point he's the arse of the century bashing.

Soulmates would depend on the fic. If its already mentioned as a norm like alpha-beta-omega stories or another type where everyone falls on the same category like all is bounded to another ect.

Lordships still depends on the story, like deleda est where harry timetravels and still carries the black heritage but those which are just OOC, really will drop those. Ive dropped i think 3 of them already.

** For Harry Potter fics specifically, my biggest ones are:

- Dedicating an entire chapter, or even multiple chapters, to Gringotts and/or shopping. No one cares about the inheritances, lordships, money, wardrobe, fancy school supplies, TARDIS disguised as a trunk, or seven-part wand that you decided to give Harry. Especially since there's a very good chance that none of it will ever actually matter.
- Runes are the best magic ever, and can do literally anything. No, they're actually canonically useless and have no actual magical abilities. The only thing they are good for us reading ancient texts, which is also the one thing I never see them used for.
- Swearing on your magic. Again, this has no basis in canon, it rarely serves any real purpose, and its existence as an option just opens up plotholes.
