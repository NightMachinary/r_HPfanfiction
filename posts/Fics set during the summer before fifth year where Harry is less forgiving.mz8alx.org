I always felt like Harry, even though he got mad for a sec there, was too quick to forgive his friends and the Order for basically cutting off all ties with him until the dementor attack. It's particularly appaling since he had just seen a classmate be murdered and hit with multiple crucios courtesy of a resurrected Voldemort before being shuffled off to Durzkaban. Even though Harry exhibits a tendency to forgive when he shouldn't throughout the series, this might have been the moment to change that, give him a backbone for once. So any fics that fixes that issue would be very much appreciated.

P.S. HHr preferred, but not a deal-breaker.


** Nobody cut ties with him. His friends still wrote to him, they just very reasonably didn't give out sensitive information over an open channel.

*** Huh, I had forgotten that they actually wrote him. Just went back and read the snippets. Alas, the effects of too much fanfiction!

***** That actually is canon. Unless I got whooshed. Or unless you meant always rather than sometimes. But in canon they absolutely have him cooking in book one at least

****** Petunia asks Harry to look after the bacon and not let it burn not cook chef-level meals for them. If taken on its own, it's not such an unreasonable request.

******** I'm not justifying in any way the Dursley's horrid treatment of Harry. But it's still not as bad as some fics make it look. That particular incident doesn't indicate that Harry is treated as a little more than a slave. If they want to go for blood, fic authors should pick on the request to groom the garden and then just getting sent to bed with some bread and cheese. Now that's abuse.

*** Ummm... I was thinking fics that progress that way eventually. It just irked me the way he was pissed off for 2 minutes, then just stopped being mad after some light to moderate shouting.
