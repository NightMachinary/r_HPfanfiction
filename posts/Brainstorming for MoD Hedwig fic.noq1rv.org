Right now I'm working on a new fic, and I could use some ideas/discussion with one aspect. Basic concept is that Cannon Hedwig had a nearly complete familiar bond with harry, basically she's smart enough to hold a conversation (but couldn't speak thanks to physical limitations) and dies. She gets a post-death pre-afterlife scene of her own and finds out Harry is about to get cursed with the fannon Master of Death thing, basically every time he dies he's reborn again and never gets rest or to see his family again. Given the chance, takes the curse instead. Over time she's learned to subtly influence the world around her, giving her wizard (or sometimes witch) just enough help that he grows into a leader without being crushed by life's burdens. Can't do everything for Harry or he never grows into his own.

With my fic, she's been through a lot of lives, and learned how to store magic in her soul, carrying it from one life to another. She's become a magical titan, and learned everything she could to avoid boredom, even doing spell research. This life, she isn't born as a owl but as a snowy owl/white tiger gryphon.

What I need help with is the villain/opposition, I'm planning to make this Voldemort also a Master of Death from another timeline/universe that comes into the timeline during or right before the 1991 fall school year. (Hedwig scored points with 'Death' but Tom Riddle deserves the curse so it screws with him when possible. Plus the whole 'marked as an equal' thing? Yeah, it's been getting really ridiculous with the advantages fate/chance give to harry to balance tom having so much knowledge and power. I might have the last Harry Voldie fought with turned into what amounted to a dragon god or something.)

Basically I don't know how to present the conflict, should I have them keep it under wraps? Fight in public? Wage a war in the shadows? Death isn't a big fear for either of them, since they've died quite a few times before.

I have some ideas for Tom to have researched Soul Magic, and use that as his main big gun, even if he can't use the parts that require compassion or love. Hedwig might have been looping lives longer, since she's mastered 'binary magic' which is basically magic that requires two people who utterly trust each other, and also she can use 'Deep Magic' which is powerful and dangerous and has karmic components, think magic that judges both user and target every time its used.

I'd appreciate any ideas you're willing to share, I'm hoping to make this a story that's fun to read, and probably less than 100k words.
