**** Given that the fact that the idea of Sirius betraying the Potters is so out there and Peter was the only 'witness', that idea might be a memetic hazard as well.

** Dumbledore is the last one to fall to the normalcy "virus" and the entire fic would be played out like a zombie horror novel.

Monday 6:00 AM When Harry arrived to hogwarts he was horrified at the /abnormality/ of the place. Magic, he thought, was truely freakish. He supposed it was up to him to bring this dastardly world up to proper standards...

Tuesday 8:00 AM The entirety of the Great Hall looked on in abject horror and confusion as both Harry Potter and Ron Weasly sat eating a completely normal English Breakfast, terribly lacking in pumpkin juice mind you. But more prominently, they didn't wear their expected school robes, but instead wore muggle jumpers. All the while bouting on and on about the ridiculousness of green fireplaces, floating brooms, and old men wearing patterned gowns to work.

Wednesday 10:00 AM Things quickly got worse from there. By second period at least half of the school were wearing muggle jumpers. The muggleborns - including that bright Granger girl - were the first to fall, expectedly. They happen to be least immune to this... Virus going around. Then the halfbloods went. Our only hope now are the purebloods, who have barricaded themselves inside the transfiguration classroom, afraid of what lies just behind enemy lines...

Thursday 5:00 PM An temporary refugee encampment has been set up in the classroom. Food and drinks are sparse. A few students were sent out to gather provisions... However, they have not returned. I truely am beginning to fear the worst.

Friday 6:00 PM We managed to summon in a wizarding wireless radio this afternoon. The survivors listened on in terror as we heard the broadcast. Many students wept, a few cried. For on the radio was an endless drone of muggle music by fellows such as Mikal Jackdaughter and Puns n' Hoses... Or at least I believe those were the names. And most horrifyingly of all, long rants about politics and traffic delays in between the songs. It was completely... Normal. I shudder to even think of it. We are now undertaking efforts to find a cure. Still, a traitorous part of my mind worries we are too late...

Saturday 10:00 PM /The doors are being forced open we don't have much time left if anyone finds these writings please, for the sake of the wizarding world, NEVER be nor---/

Sunday 6:00 AM I enjoyed waking up this morning, eating some toast and eggs with a side of coffee served by our new kitchen staff, who are entirely normal human beings and NOT magical elves wearing stilts dressed in trenchcoats. I wore a well pressed dark gray suit and polished shoes. My beard has been trimmed to a completely proper length. There are plans to super glue the stairways into place and the paintings are to be thrown away. As are the numerous STICKS lying around that are not in fact wands. Because that would be entirely abnormal.

-Sincerely

Professor Albus Dumbledore

Order of the muggle Queen (first class)

Principal of Hogwarts School of Business and Law

International Confederation of Principals

Chief Principal of the Normalgamot.

*** Turns out the "power the Dark Lord knows not" was simply how to be normal. Voldemort is overrun by perfectly ordinary people and flees England because ruling over useless muggles is worthless to him.
