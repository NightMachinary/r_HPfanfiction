I'm looking for any story with a harry that can teleport with no limit on distance like from jumper, and if possible unaffected by any wards. I would like it, but remember it's optional if he uses it similer to how the lead in jumper uses it as in without care and to great affect to help him get away from the dursleys. Extra points if he is under 10, and meets someone else who does it and takes harry under his wing.

** Kinda different from what you're asking, and no one took him under their wing, but in Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them by evansentranced linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them by evansentranced) Harry learnt Apparition by himself at a really young age, and later learnt to avoid the wards in Hogwarts with help from Dobby.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

*** By the way, you contradicted yourself. Dobby took him under his wing. it really is a perfect fit for the request.

**** Well, that's one way of looking at it. I felt that they had more of a companionship vibe though, rather than one looking after the other. Harry always took care of himself, had been since he was six years old; independence was a major theme in the story (see how much effort the author put into freeing the elves and the whole analogy of elves and Harry). Harry and Dobby stay together when they want to, and go off on their own when they've something to do by themselves.

In some aspects Dobby definitely leads him though.

** linkffn(Resonance by GreenGecko)

I'm not sure if it happens in this story or in the sequel, but he develops the ability to appear literally everywhere he's visited (and it's explained exceptionally well, tying into the main plot).
