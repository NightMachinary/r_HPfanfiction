Looking for a fic where he runs his own country (Though it can be other things, like cities or kingdoms)

Fics that get into the more technical side of politics, and managing resources, ect.

Please keep it over 70k+ words!!


** A ASOIAF crossover: linkffn(The Difference One Man Can Make;Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock by Sage1988). YMMV because the first chap of the first one is a bit draggy. The second one is more political.

Mass Effect crossovers: Linkffn(The effects of magic by ElectroVenik;To Break Thy Chains and Cycles by WiseSilver) Another note, these might be dead. Still a good read though. The second one is kind of superharry.

And of course obligatory emperor link. Linkffn(emperor)

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** Sounds like you need linkffn(Voyage of the Starship Hedwig) and maybe some of the later parts of linkffn(Brown Coat, Green Eyes). Voyage is focused largely on settling an alien planet(s), and dealing with various (sci-fi or magical) problems caused by the people and setting. Browncoat is more focused on other things for the first - and IMO better - half of the story, then changes direction later on. It's a Firefly crossover, and you need at least some knowledge of Firefly to appreciate the story (but if you haven't seen Firefly yet, that should be top of your to-do list anyway).

  This is the sequel to Harry's Had Enough. You don't have to read that first, but it might be better if you do. Harry in a position on power, he's a bit unscrupulous in this one. Dumbledore, Ministry and Death Eater bashing. Also a bit of Ron bashing and general wizard society bashing. H/Hr. Now Complete!

  Title pretty much says it all. OotP AU, some swear words. No pairing, though HP/HG is hinted at a little. Harry does what he should have done. Complete for now. Author's Note added!

  AU post OoTP. Poor Harry. Sirius left him far more than a house and some money. Dumbledore is the Dark Lord? And what is he supposed to do with the women he was left? Sometimes, Pranks suck and others they are opportunities. H/Multi
