I got conned into revising someone's stories. I read the first page of the chapters he sent and was like 'oh my word, what the hell did I agree to????' For those that beta, how do you revise fics that you hate without sounding horrid? I completed the first chapter and it had more red for my changes than black his original.

It sounds like you didn't want to review anyway. You've could've just said no. But, since you already in this just tell him the truth. Try not to use harsh adjectives like:

#+begin_quote
  its fucking trash kid.

  Do you even know how to form a sentence?
#+end_quote

Instead just be polite.

#+begin_quote
  I think this sentence/paragraph/story could use some work
#+end_quote

** I think I was conned into thinking this writer was a more mature adult. He claims to be retired and was looking for someone near his age to beta for him. But reading his fics... he sounds like a 12 year old.

â€‹

While not to my tastes as I don't generally like Next Gen fics, this is just bad. No emotion, no description, no depth and no realism. A girl is fat but happy with everyone bullying her about it. Really, don't know what reality that is in! I sent him a revised first chapter and he has 3 betas so the chapter returned for final revision was much improved, but still, I wouln't get past the first page if I was reading it on the web.

*** I've never been a beta, nor have I written anything in a context where I would want one myself, but is it the role of a beta to give feedback on the plot and characterization in a story, or simply to act as a second pair of eyes looking for bad grammar, word choice, etc.? If it's the latter, it might be better for your sanity to treat it as a dry, strictly grammar-based exercise.

**** He wants the later and to canon pick, so I think I will do that as a grammar based exercise.

**** It really depends on what the writer and beta want.

For example, with the story I beta atm, I glance over grammar and spelling, but don't look for them - they are already exceptional with them.

Instead I give advice like: - This part is confusing, I didn't expect such a huge timeskip - This is elexir of life, make it look a little more interesting! - I think this characterization could need improvement because <X> - I love this characterization - The description here is <X>

For others I have gone mostly over spelling, and for someone else I was just a "beta" that went over all the French and German that was there and fixed that.

** Conned, how? Were you lied to? And is it technically bad or just not to your taste? Was it not ready to beta? In which case you should tell them so. Whichever it is, you'll have let the writer know as politely as you can that you can't do it, because if you carry on, you'll get more and more frustrated. If you don't want to tell the truth and risk hurting someone's feelings you could fib and say something important has come up and you don't have time.

You'll know to see a sample of someone's writing before agreeing to beta in future.

** Calm down.

Everyone starts somewhere, and that includes people who start writing later in life. The role of a beta is to be supportive and constructive, and to ensure you only commit yourself to things you feel able to read.

When writing is of a really poor standard I try to put grammar/writing lessons at the bottom. So, I might correct all the places where they have missed punctuation at the end of dialogue and then write a few paragraphs explaining the rules around that. That won't fix the issue right away but it will help.

I also make sure I remember that this is someone else's writing and they will learn what works for themselves as they go. Start with the basics of grammar and spelling, and ignore more in depth stuff for the time being. You can build up to the point where feedback about their characters is useful.
