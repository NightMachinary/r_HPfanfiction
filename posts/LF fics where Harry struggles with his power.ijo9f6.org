A lot of fics where for some reason he gets an immediate increase in power he automatically gets perfect control. I want fics where he truly struggles to get his power under control. Something like Timely Errors or Beauty beneath No slash no femharry no bashing

Removed, although the author states she's working on a rewrite. I still have a copy of the old pages saved.
