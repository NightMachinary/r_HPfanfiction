He spent years thinking that all he wanted was a normal life and to settle down with a normal happy family. Then he actually gets the chance to do that sort of thing and realizes that he desperately misses the crazy shit he used to do.

Fighting a basilisk with a sword, confronting a horde of riled up dementors, out-maneuvering a dragon, walking into an acromantula nest in the middle of the night, etc. That's the kind of shit he lives for.

 

Anybody have any suggestions?

** Very unlike canon Harry, but could be interesting, and plausible enough.

I could see him becoming a professional monster hunter like Lockhart, only, you know, actually good at it.

*** I dunno; if he starts auror training and finds out it's 70% rules, regulations and bureaucratic procedures, he has tons of paper work, politics and restrictions to look forward to for the rest of his career, and the ministry, press and public hound him day and night, he'd get nostalgic about starving in a tent pretty soon.

**** Harry would make an awful auror - he never trusted hierarchy and did things that he thought were right regardless of the rules.

***** It's very possible.

However it's also probable that Harry woukd have stalwart allies in positions of power, both in the aurors and the ministry in general.

The whole Wizard!Jesus thing could conceivably mean that there would be some hero worship towards Harry among the aurors - after all a willing sacrifice (that actually works) is a hugely more powerful gesture than beating someone in a duel.

So for the first time ever, Harry would be wielding actual influence, over skilled witches and wizards, whose thinking is generally aligned with his. It's different to trust a shitbag hierarchy that has fucked you over numerous times (i.e almost everyone to the end of DH) than a cadre of comrades in arms ready to support and fight for you.

  regardless of the rules

I don't imagine the aurors sticking too much to the "rules" when it comes to bagging the last of the death eaters and assorted assholes (snatchers, etc).

Even disregarding the epilogue (which I don't care for anyway) it's not unreasonable to infer that Harry could thrive among the aurors, even to the point of being a bit of a messianic figure with "disciples".

****** Yeah, but, being someone who can get away with breaking the rules because their colleagues allow it isn't a great trait in a cop. In the real world that leads to what we call "the Blue Wall"- how cops close ranks around those of their number who break the law, and the end result is public hostility to the cops, and cops who view themselves as an army at war with the public.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry Potter put paid to Voldemort at Hogwarts; now it's nineteen years later and, as the diesels hammer on, a bushy-haired girl is still searching for The-Boy-Who-Walked-Away... Oneshot, Deadliest Catch crossover.
