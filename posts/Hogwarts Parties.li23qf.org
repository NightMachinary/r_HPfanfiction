Just posted the first chapter of my new fanfic. It's very much taken inspiration from teen dramas like Skins.

An unknown student has started organising the best parties Hogwarts has ever seen. Some are suspicious of this mystery host, but many are just happy to attend these lavishly put together parties that have become a hot spot for student hook-ups.
