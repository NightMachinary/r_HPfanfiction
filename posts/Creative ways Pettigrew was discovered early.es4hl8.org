I was reading the Cupboard series linkffn(10449375) , where Harry was trying to find out more about his parents, and he finds out about Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew. So, he writes letters to them. Sirius' comes back practically the next day with "Cannot communicate with Azkaban inmates" written on the envelope. Lupin writes back a response. The owl sent to Pettigrew starts attacking Ron. I'm not going to spoil the rest of it, but it becomes relevant later on.

I'm not asking for events where the the discoverer knows Pettigrew is Scabbers. They can't have any knowledge of who he is at all.

EDIT: I obviously worded that wrong. By no knowledge, I meant the person causing the event (if it's a person) cannot know about Pettigrew's rat form. But if the event happens in front of say... Lupin? That counts.


** I read a headcanon before where Lupin taught in 2nd year already. Ron tries to transfigure Scabbers into a cup but it just won't work. McGonagall blames it on the wand, walks over and tries to transfigure Scabbers into the cup. However, it wouldn't work for her either so she starts subtly casting spells on Scabbers, thinking that it might be a magical rat when the spells show her, that it's an animagus. She gives Ron a different animal to work on, telling him that he has a very special rat and as soon as Scabbers relaxes, she conjures a cage around him and calls Lupin and Dumbledore. Together they manage to get him into human form and the rest is history.

For the latter, I definitely agree that's a significant... error, and 'there are hundreds of people here and we just didn't notice because it's hard to notice anyone you're not looking for specifically' is a bit of a lame-duck explanation. It's why I like that fic where they try and express support for what they assume is Percy's homosexuality. It's just an interesting and mildly amusing way to cover for that massive plot hole.

******* So for starters: "crup". Sorry, that was just gonna bug the shit out of me.

Second, how do we know that magical variants of animals live longer than their non-magical counterparts? We only have humans as a base and that's because they have potions and spells to cure illness and injuries that would normally kill Muggles. Even if we take Dumbledore as the average oldest (about 150), then that's only about an extra 50% of the average Muggle's lifespan. If that remains true for all magical variants of pet animals, that means your average magical brown rat lives to the ripe old age of.....3 years old. Now, there are some that might live up to 5, but not 12 years.

I actually would have loved to see a conversation between Fred and George telling Ron basically "hey, so, we don't judge, but why are you sharing a bed with a guy named 'Peter'?".

******** It's with a C? Damnit fanfiction. You had me convinced. I've apparently read it misspelled so many times as 'Krup' it's gotten into my head.

And we don't! That's why I said 'could'. Rowling's complete lack of information on that matter means we just don't know! Magic-Dogs could live to be a thousand years, or twenty minutes old. It could be perfectly normal for magic-rats to live longer lives. By 'magic-rat', I mean a different magical species that's basically a rat like Crups are dogs with two tails.

It's technically just under double, since the average age of a Muggle in the UK in 1990 was 76.

But either way, that explanation of Rowling's makes no real sense - the one about their increased lifespans being due to better medical practices, I mean. I'm in mental health and not physical health, but to the best of my understanding, aging isn't really something you can combat with medicine. Aging-related conditions, yes, but aging itself, no. Unless you could slow aging, your lifespan would still be the same as each cell is replaced by older versions until they're replaced by a version that stops working. Unless you could put every important organ you have on life support, you'd still die at about the same time as most humans. I could be wrong - again, mental and not physical health person here - but that's my best understanding.

I don't have a link to the fic, unfortunately, but it's utterly hilarious. All the delicious and terrifying awkwardness of coming out to your family, but from the perspective of the family instead of the closet-ee.

***** - They used it to sneak around and play their misdeeds and pranks.
- They are typical teenagers - meaning short attention span and living more in the moment
- Why would they care where their brother slept or what he did?
- Not all of the map is visible at once. I remember it having numerous folds and such (sorry been long time). So not that easy to notice unless specifically looking at certain part of the castle.
- There were literally hundreds of students, teachers and whoever else on the map.
- They were kids when Pettigrew "died". And was massively over shadowed by Voldemort's demise. Even older people were not all that aware. Why would they?
- People having similar names has obviously never happened before ...
- I may be wrong, but on the map his name would have been "P. Pettigrew" ... so it could be easily Paul or Patrick or whatever.
- And finally why would they expect dead man to be on the map? To them even if they did notice it would simply be another name they would not care about. Not a prefect, professor or head boy.

They enjoyed pranking him, so that is good justification for why they would track his movements, routine or habits.

Moreover, his full name was shown on the map. Even if they did not know who that was, they should have been suspicious on account of the fact that Pettigrew's name would have been intermingled with Percy's for years, unless he did not carry Scabbers around with him. And if he did not, then one must question how they did not notice that this Peter "boy" spent all of his time in the common room or the dorms, despite them never having heard the name.

Trust me, in a shared dorm of no more than 50-80 students, it is impossible that the pair of them would not come to know the names of everyone there.

*** Pettigrew helped create the map. I'm sure the map treated Marauders differently than it treated other people. It would have made sense for it to be designed to show Marauders only to other Marauders, so if it fell into the wrong hands, it couldn't be used against them.

In the books, only Lupin sees Peter's name on the map. In the movie, Harry saw his name, which led to the fandom wondering why Fred and George didn't see him too.

Care to share some proof of that? Because I'm pretty sure it just acted as a magical map with a "hide me" feature.

***** The proof is that no one but Remus could see Peter on the map, so there must have been some feature accounting for that. The alternative is that Fred and George were too stupid to notice their brothers Percy and Ron sleeping with some guy named Pettigrew, which isn't believable.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** A bit of self-promotion, not sure if it's creative enough for you but it's at least logical. Also, it's a crossover, but of the form "character X from another setting ends up at Hogwarts". If you're curious, Pettigrew is discovered because Iruka borrows the Map as a way of watching for the fugitive Sirius Black, but as the students are coming back to the castles after Christmas he spots a different name that shouldn't be there.

  Book 3: Harry is as much of a trouble-magnet as Naruto - first a possessed teacher and a legendary artifact, then a hidden chamber and giant snake, now an escaped mass-murderer and soul-sucking demons. Maybe next year will be less eventful?
