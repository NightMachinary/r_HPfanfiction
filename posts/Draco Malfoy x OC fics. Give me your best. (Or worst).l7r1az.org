** Honestly one of my favorites: its called Slytherin Royals on Wattpad, and is super long and high quality. Warning: major ron and ginny bashing and light Dumbledore bashing. Also the OFC is Slytherin but I love the friend dynamics.

** Green Eyed Monster on FF.net and Potter? on Wattpad although Potter? is SI/Draco so I'd go with GEM bc the OC is a very well written and realistic character!
