I think this is a really good gen fic (there are no pairings in it) that explores how Harry's life, outlook and decisions would change if he became aware of the horcux in his scar early on. It has no bashing, great trio relationships, and has the trio trying hard to be better wizards to defeat Voldemort without the sudden powers or whatnot. It's recently been updated and I just think it needs to be more well known. Take a look!

** It's been a long time since I've read this one. When I read it last, it was on chapter 10 or 11 and I remember thinking it was abandoned, so I forgot about it.

I like it. It sort of follows the plot points of canon, but makes them very different.
