** I have. And then I wish for brain bleach.

The thing I wonder most about is the internal anatomy of a centaur. I mean, they have two torsos! Does that mean they have four lungs, two hearts, et cetera? If not, what organs are positioned where?

*** Centaur-shaped animals are a fun thought exercise. There's nothing wrong with redundant organs if the hearts aren't conflicting with each other. Personally, I liked a similar sci-fi race that had a secondary air intake at the small of the humanoid body's back that supplied the larger set of lungs. No sensory organs, there though. For the digestive tract, the most logical thing would be either a multi-chambered stomach, or a stomach on the horse body.

**** C.S. Lewis states clearly that centaurs have two stomachs and you must feed both the horse and human side, which is why no one likes inviting centaurs to dinner. I'd definitely expect JKR's centaurs to hold with this, and the only way I can explain it is to say it's magic, not science or even sci-fi.

Of all the organs I have to say it's the lungs that I'd never considered. But they are indeed the most problematic... is it possible centaurs take a long time to say anything because they're busy breathing in enough to fill two sets of lungs before they reply?

***** It feels weird to have an herbivore and an omnivore together. If I was going to stick animals together I'd choose an omnivore and a meat-eater. Horses go through a /lot/ of physical food, and they're sort of an inefficient (In that they don't extract as much nutrients out of their food as something like a sheep or goat with the four-chambered stomach.) eater. People called them 'hayburners' for a reason. Something like a tiger or lion might work out better.

It's also a good thing magic isn't real, I probably would have been the guy in highschool with an army of raven/housecat gryphons running around.

****** Horses are not obligate herbivores; they can safely eat meat and will do so if they get the opportunity. They usually don't, seeing as they're built for grazing, and its not terribly good for them when they do, but some horses will stomp on birds that get too close and eat them if they're hungry enough.

A centaur would likely have no problems with an omnivorous diet, especially if the food is cooked for the human half.

******* That'd be an ugly critter, but not something you'd want to fight in large numbers.

Inspiration! : DE's attack a muggleborn that gave up and left the wizarding world, that hates his boss at his cube farm job enough to cheat using magic to not work and still get paid, and spends all his time/money creating mix'n'match critters. Voldemort gets one junior DE back, bleeding out from a missing arm, tells the dark lord that there were /things/ at that house, so many things that shouldn't go together but have been joined. And they're /mean./ Voldemort looks into it, runs like hell when he sees the first basilisk/centipede, and it's FAST. He doesn't see super angry muggleborn guy mind-wiping and turning the surviving DE's into lamina/naga with magically altered basilisks.

A few years later, absolutely disgusted with how the Ministry allowed so many DEs to walk, he becomes a new dark lord, the lord of mis-matched beasts. He sends out composit hunting dogs and collects every muggleborn together, (HP goes along for the ride, meets new people that are JUST like him, is happier in dark lord legions than at his Uncle's) and trains them to be his army, working alongside his beast legions.

Raids in the night, he doesn't kill his enemies, no, the DE that got off become parts of greater creatures. He becomes the worst dark lord ever because he wins, and every foe that falls in battle has their mind altered and joins the mis-shapen horde. Harry and Hermione bond over creating lion/tiger/whatever-people, after raiding the London Zoo and Malfoy/greengrass Manor. (Don't worry Daphne! You're going to be our friend forever, we just need to make you better first!) When he runs out of obvious targets he sails to Azkaban, and uses the prisoners as parts.

The World trembles before the might of the BEAST LORD!

********* It probably won't get started till I'm nearly finished with my current fic, but I have a 46k word, sometimes rambling outline for a fic where HP spends his early years, about from 7 till the goblet of fire, as a black panther. (Or similiar, it's a magical composite form) Essentially, Vernon gets caught stealing funds from his work, gets drunk, beats HP, gets drunker and is about to kill him when a 'Great Spirit' named Bast who is a powerful creature but not a God, (was known as a deity of protection, cats, perfume/ointments, fertility, pregnancy, children, music, the arts, and warfare; â€˜Bastet' was also depicted as the goddess of protection against contagious diseases and evil spirits) steps in to save Harry. Her kind have a law that keeps them from overly interfering in humanity, cause they don't actually want to be worshipped. But, because Harry needed the help, she's free to save him in the whatever way amuses her the most.

Harry spends his formative years wandering England, with a Fidelius like effect keeping everyone, including him, from realizing he's HP. Bast provides suggestive magic that leas him to learn to enjoy life, eventually he meets HG, realizes she can do magic like him and moves in with her. when Minvera shows up, the two of them have been watching anime as a source of figuring out their magic. Harry enjoys life as a cat for the most part, ends up truly hating the ministry, he collects a harem and accidentally an army of werewolves before the goblet forces the revelation. By then, Harry has raised a sailing ship from the depths, and used it to ward-break several private islands whose families have died out. He has been preparing for war against the british ministry for years, and doesn't see a reason to stop.

He also gained an animagus form of a gryphon, Thunderbird and Neimian Lion, and Hedwig reincarnated to this universe as a Thunderbird, (more war-like counterpoint to the peaceful phoenixes) named Static. Harry Potter becomes *the Beast Lord*, having built alliances with all sorts of creatures. Features a planned chapter with the Goblins Rebelling, trying to screw HP and the Ministry, and Harry yells "Curse you Goblins and your sudden, yet inevitable betrayl! Oh, if only someone, some wise and brave soul could have forseen this event! Oh, woe is us!" As his army of wolves, creatures, and golems (HP watched SW: Phantom Menace, and was inspired.) portals in with gear/etc specialized for fighting gobs in tunnels appears.

There's a strong focus on non-human magical creatures, HP working with anyone he can, students of Hogwarts creating pokemon knock-offs with magic, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo7XPvwRgG8]] being the magic to summon raised ships and call them to your location, /PIRATE MAGIC/, and a very bad-ass HP.

Also, it will probably have a lot of smut, so might not be for everyone, but I can add warnings for Ao3.

** Theory: both Hagrid and Flitwick are part of an experimental wizard/creature breeding programme done by the unspeakables. Magical version of IVF obviously. They're the only two successful "outcomes," and Hagrid was taken away from his mum and sent to live with his human dad when she tried to eat him. Flitwick had a little more success with his creature side of the family, and spent all his holiday time at Gringotts with his goblin dad. It was so boring, he read book after book after book, and that is why he is now head of Ravenclaw.

*** The actual penis-in-vagina bit may have been rubbish, but - and I assure you this question terrifies me as much as it does you - how big is a giantess' clit? Especially compared to a shorter-than-average human like Hagrid Senior? I reckon he was probably working with something big enough to get at least one hand on as well as his mouth.

Giants don't seem the type for foreplay, so, faced with an enthusiastic little monsterfucker who knows about human sexual habits, Fridwulfa probably got so overstimulated that she passed out and half-drowned the guy.
