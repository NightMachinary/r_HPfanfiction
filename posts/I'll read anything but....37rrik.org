**** How many people would actually try to justify it? If one of them took Polyjuice, which right now is the best canon explanation I could think of without creating some spell, and drank it repeatedly throughout the pregnancy, I guess it could work. But then would the child be the person's who took the Polyjuice or the person whose hair sample they put in the Polyjuice. I am thinking way too far into this. But the Mpreg that I've come across, two guys are usually just fucking around and then a few days later one of them gets morning sickness and they're so confused.

***** [[http://page-de-reve.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/excentrykemuse-enchantment-series-8-ivy.html][Ivy Kissed]] (Harry/Krum) is the only fic I've ever seen do this in a way that approaches logical. [[/spoiler][Harry's hidden under polyjuice and becomes pregnant whilst on it--and fails to change back. He can't. Then, because he's been stuck as a girl for so long, he will always remain that way. Also, there is some talk about whether the child would be biologically his, or that of the muggle girl he's polyjuiced into.]]

Other than that fic (which, to be honest, I hadn't realised was mpreg when I began reading) I've never found a decent fic that employs it. It's a shame, really, because it could open the doorway to all sorts of emotional and ethical questions, but instead people use it as some kind of gimmick, without even thinking about what male pregnancy could truly mean for a person and a society, and it's possible long-term effects.

** I tend to avoid any teenHermione/male adult (Snape, Sirius, Remus, etc) just because of the whole massive age gap. And they tend to make me feel icky.

I also avoid incest romance fics, like Fred/George or Ron/Ginny. I am just not a fan. I do LOVE good friendship/hurt & comfort Fred and George fics because some can be so beautifully bittersweet.

I also rather dislike Mary-Sue self-inserts. They may work for others, but I love reading about and working with the Universe JK has given us. Mary-Sue characters always tend to be OP, gothic in some way or depressed, obscenely beautiful and perfect, and they just annoy me. I love seeing character flaws and working with them, these flaws make the characters feel realistic and human. Perfect Mary-Sues tend to obliterate that.

Overall, though, I'm rather flexible. So long as it is a well-written fic that has a strong plot, pulls at my emotions, and draws me in, I am happy.

Edit: forgot to add mpreg and realized this after seeing other posts! Whoops. It just biologically makes ZERO sense, magic or not.

I find Harry/Draco much more plausible than Harry/Ron. I have the same reaction to Harry/Ron that some people have to Harry/Hermione. It seems borderline incestuous.

Though I've also only read Drarry that's either massively AU like Sacrifices or set post-Hogwarts where the characters aren't exactly the same people they were in school.

** Hermione-Ron pairing, main character slash (other characters can have all the fun they want), multi/harem. I generally prefer monogamous relationships, but I have found recently that I like triads with 2 guys in them too (it's a nice little fantasy and makes for fun fluff and fancy lemons).

I have a strong preference for stories with the main character being female, but I do occasionally ready others.

I think the main issue is that I'm mostly using HP fanfics as romance novels (with magic!), which means I want a main character I identify with, instead of just read about.

Edit: Guns! I hate them and I am not reading hp fanfiction to learn about how to reload a gun, or what range some random rifle has. Why write HP fanfiction if you're going to leave all this cool magic behind and go around shooting people with guns?!

** Generally I'll give anything a shot if the writing is good enough. Obviously my "good enough" thresholds are different for different things, but if Alice Munro wrote Harry/Draco slash, I'd read it, even if I find that idea ludicrous.

My most disliked trope of the moment is kind of a general thing - basically, the author has a tinfoil hat and a magnifying glass and writes an entire story devoted to this tunnel vision of canon where certain lines are ludicrously read into.

Harry/Hermione is guilty of this a lot. I mean, you want to write that pairing, go for it, make it awesome. But a fic that's nothing but a thinly-disguised essay about how it was actually canon if you read between the lines enough (and take psychotropic drugs) just has no appeal for me.

I think this is the case for all fics written by shippers. They're less interested in writing an interesting romance (which should have narrative structure and conflict) and more interested in justifying their favourite pairing to the reader, i.e. "here are the reasons why I think this pairing is the best/most correct".

Or mental gymnastics to prove she isn't really a shitty person. Narcissa is 100% a bigot, so much so that she lets it put a strain on her relationship with her grandson.

Harry/Bella, Harry/Tonks, Harry/Fleur, Draco/Hermione.

Petunia redemption fic. Sort of the same with Narcissa, really. Vernon is the monstrous abusive one, Petunia only enables him while subtly trying to support Harry, reminiscing remorsefully on her shattered relationship with Lily. I sincerely believe Petunia and Narcissa actually /love/ their garbage spouses. Maybe they actually chose them, knowing they suck, because they, themselves, suck. It just really annoys me when they're portrayed as passively being pulled onto the path of evil by their tyrant husbands.

Fic. where people try to emphasize the exact opposite of how Wormtail is popularly perceived i.e. pathetic, sniveling and just end up going into overkill. He's now the creative one, the great listener, loved and respected by all. All instances of people condescending to him are exceptional. There's also a clear hierarchy within the marauders; they're not a group of equals.

It's worth noting that in the Prologue to PS, Vernon is depicted as only really being so negative about the magical world because he follows Petunia's lead. He thinks wizards are weird and not his sort of people all on his own, but he doesn't really /hate/ them -- that's Petunia.

***** Plausible. How much I enjoy reading them depends on how well they're executed, i.e. usually very badly.

Falling for an attractive person because they're hot, then realising that you're completely incompatible with that person once you're already emotionally invested in the relationship... that's a pretty common situation to find yourself in. It can be a great source of conflict and drama.

Unfortunately, almost all fanfic writers use a relationship as an end, not a means. They establish the relationship then just leave it as more or less "achieved", they don't treat it as an ongoing process.

  Hermione/any relationship people justify using the line 'they're intellectual equals'.
#+end_quote

I like Tomione, but even within the pairing, not all Tomione writers portray Hermione Granger and Tom Riddle as 'intellectual equals'. Tom Riddle clearly is somewhat of a prodigy, as acknowledged by Dumbledore in the books; Hermione is merely a smart student who happens to be at the top of her class. I don't think anyone would argue that, if Tom Riddle and Hermione Granger went to school together, they would be 'equals'. In academics, /maybe/, but as Tom Riddle is clearly a far more powerful wizard than Hermione is a witch...

#+begin_quote
  Riddle being portrayed as not really bigoted, but using the ideology to acquire a following
#+end_quote

"Haven't I already told you," said Riddle, "that killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me any more? For many months now, my new target has been---you." - Tom Riddle to Harry Potter, /Chamber of Secrets/

"I guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry." - Tom Riddle to Harry Potter, /Chamber of Secrets/ [film]

He may use the word 'Mudblood', but here, Riddle clearly only cares about killing Harry Potter. I would use that as an example of him pretending to be bigoted, especially if by using the word 'Mudblood', he can mess with Harry's head. /Especially/ considering the implications of the word 'Mudblood' to Harry, as Harry has two loved ones that are 'Mudbloods'.

- Lily Evans Potter, his mother
- Hermione Granger, his friend

Not to mention all of the Muggle-borns who got petrified by the Basilisk, many of whom Harry had known or met first-hand. Riddle is using bigotry as a tactic in order to try and break Harry's morale.

It's also quite likely that, even with Hermione being a 'Mudblood', Riddle ordered the Basilisk to attack her because she was getting too close to the truth. Many clues hint to this in the book itself, including Hermione being wary of the Diary, and practically connecting the dots (and guessing the truth) correctly on her first try. In the end, she guessed too much. Riddle saw her as a threat, which no other 'Mudblood' had done before - not since perhaps Moaning Myrtle - and decided to try to eliminate her.

I will stop reading a fic if I notice sufficient sexism.

- The Smurfette Principle isn't trivial to shoehorn onto Harry Potter fan fiction, but authors tend to try. You get Harry's love interest and maybe one other female character who averages even one line per chapter.
- Just because you're a woman in love doesn't mean you abandon all your other priorities to devote your entire existence to helping a guy out. Even if you're saving his life, you're going to have downtime.
- A lot of fics tend to insist that women can't fight anywhere near as well as men. They offer no justification.
- It's rare to find a female character whom the author allows to be as competent as a male character at anything.
- Hermione is usually allowed to be a competent scholar and better than named male characters within that domain. However, she's likely to be Worf Effected.
- The use of rape as a way to indicate that someone is evil is crude, overdone, and just not appreciated.

In entirely unrelated news, I haven't finished a fic in a while.

When I'm reading a fic, I become Harry. Like role-playing. As part of the role-play, I adopt Harry's characteristics, but there is a limit. Any actions taken by Harry that I would absolutely not do, therefore, destroy my interest in the fic. These include ranting at adults, torturing people, and sexual preferences different to my own.

Therefore, imo, its perfectly acceptable that he'd develop a tendency towards female friends.

The every girl is a love interest thing, on the other hand, not so much. Also, Harry himself is one of the last characters I'd consider realistically portrayed for their age.

*Torture porn in general. I've just become numb to it because people just try to think 'what's the worst that can happen to my main, ooh lets do that to make this dark!!' and it just feels flat.

*Anything that feels like sexism. So if the female characters are never involved in the fighting, need to be 'protected' by the men, are only there to prop their male lover up, have no consistent personality (sometimes writers like to give them a couple traits and say they're 'smart' or 'strong' but never actually demonstrate it in the story) are usually the Damsel in Distress, get raped/killed to cause their male lover angst or there's one token 'I'm not like the other girls, I can keep up with the guys, I'm a badass, strong woman' character then I'm out.

**** Because that isn't how occlumency works. Occlumency isn't about erecting barriers, it's about hiding things. It's right there in the name: to occlude, i.e. hide.

A barrier, or any kind of active attempt at defence, would be counter-productive. We know that the key to occlumency is clearing your mind of both thoughts and emotions; an active defence is a thought, and likely comes with emotion too, and thus is an opening for the legilimens. By trying to defend yourself, you in fact allow yourself to be attacked. Instead, you clamp down on those things you want to hide, and by doing so deny the legilimens access to those memories and feelings. You cannot enter something that isn't there.

Snape in OotP:

#+begin_quote
  "The Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to him. Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie, and so can utter falsehoods in his presence without detection.”
#+end_quote

That, combined with Harry's lessons in general, is the best insight into occlumency we get. Stage one of occlumency is clearing your whole mind of all thought and emotion, thus denying access to all of your thoughts. This more or less has the effect of the fanon shield, but works by almost the reverse mechanism. It's also rather useless, as the legilimens will immediately know you're hiding something. No one's mind is that empty.

But the next stage, the more advanced level, is that of clearing your mind of specific thoughts and feelings while keeping the rest going. This is true occlumency, in that it can effectively fool legilimens and shows true mastery of the mind.

To take all of this and replace it with shields is like saying "No, I don't want that original, subtle idea. Instead I want to replace it with the most clichéd and simplistic fantasy trope I can find."

***** Thank-you for your explanation. You do have a good point, although I'm not sure I fully agree. Unless occlumency is purely a mental discipline (thus making it non-magical), it seems like your point about shielding a memory (i.e. that shielding always allows legilimens access) will always apply to occlumency. I suspect you might argue the conceptual difference between a shield (i.e. bouncing attacks off of it), versus a hidden item (thus unobserved). But I would then argue that a skilled legilimens would be able to detect that magic doing the hiding. For example, if a thought about X is hidden, and a legilimens is looking for X, then "hiding" occlumency magic would still have to activate. A skilled legilimens would be able to detect this magic and follow it.

I think that HPMOR's "perfect occlumens" might be the best example of your way of thinking. Are there other examples that you would recommend?

One subtle thing to note, I think is that there are two separate issues: shielding a secret, and shielding the fact that there is a secret. (Although one should note that the existence of a "shield" in this sense doesn't necessarily imply the existence of a secret.) Thus people who only care about people seeing /any/ of their thoughts would have a shield. People who want to hide the fact that there might be a secret, would need to do the thought-specific hiding.

No it's not. JKR has said one thing to the effect that bullets have the same effect on wizards that they do on Muggles i.e. they're not going to automatically bounce off wizards because magic.

****** I'm not sure about the guns > wizards part of canon. AFAIK the only part where Muggle guns are mentioned is in the Daily Prophet when a reporter is explaining what a gun is to their magical audience: "a type of metal wand Muggles use to kill each other." I could definitely be wrong, though.

DH's inclusion of the Deathstick is often derided by fans as having thrown out the entire panoply of wand lore for the sake of giving Harry another half-used plot device, but I don't know if that piece of fanon is accurate. I don't know what you mean by 'Luna's Wand.'

Harry /does/ inherit money in the original books, but I'm quite grateful to JKR for not quantifying it down to the last Knut. It would make Harry just another boring yob. Besides, focusing on money is more of Ron's thing anyway.

I have no idea why someone would downvote you for this, though. Seems petty.

I grew up reading Harry Potter. Throughout the series you see him grow along with you as he matures and becomes more powerful.

Then, the last book completely halts Harry's magic progress and she use mcguffins and deus ex machina to basically bypass Harry's development just so she can spent the other half of the book teaching you a lesson.

The lesson is that even if someone is a vile, bitter, creepy, evil human being, if the betray their morals and switch to the other side for all wrong reasons then they are worthy of respect and reverence.

Fuck no. Snape's whole storyline is insulting to morality, and it teaches kids the completely wrong message.

For a long time, we didn't like him. Then we learned he was a complex butthole with some redeeming qualities. Harry forgives him (as is his prerogative).

I'm not sure what this has to do with Snape, it seems that you're upset Harry didn't reach his full potential and learn awesome ways to kick butt? It seems as if you don't like the direction the final book took, but again, not sure how that's Snape's fault.

I thought the point of Snape was the redemption you mentioned earlier and that he found morality, not lost it? That even a bad person can have three dimensions and do good things. We go from viewing Snape from a child's POV (evil, greasy bat) to a more mature perspective (people are complex and their actions may have motivations unknown to you, as well as the fact that you can dislike someone, but still appreciate their actions).

#+begin_quote
  Harry just ignores the fact that his parents died because of Snape and the man hated and resented him. Who gives a shit if he was brave.

His parents didn't die because of Snape. The Potters died because Snape relayed the information, they trusted a friend instead of Dumbledore, Sirius suggested Peter, Peter betrayed them, and Voldemort killed them. Saying they died because of Snape is an oversimplification.

Throughout the series, we /do/ see him grow and mature like you said! And the change in Harry's understanding of Snape is an example of that.

We watched Harry's gradual transformation into a magical force to be reckoned with, and then poof: the potential was hand-waved.

Obviously nothing here is Snape's fault because he's a fictional character.

He didn't lose morality, because he never had any (even until the day he died). Please describe the morally correct choices he made, and why those choices were made in order too satisfy morality as opposed to his creepy obsession with Lily? He didn't switch to the light side because he saw the light. He did it because DD used him and his obsession with Lily to force him to do the right thing.

I feel like I don't even have to address this but I will. Yes it was an oversimplification, but Snape doesn't deserve redemption just because he didn't directly kill James and Lily. It's not like he was tricked, he knew what was going to happen to the prophecy child.
