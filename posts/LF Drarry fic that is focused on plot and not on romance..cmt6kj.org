I only read SLASH fics when they have a good story to make up for the fact that I don't really care about the relationship.

Because of that I have recently read a lot of the popular HP/LV stories that had unique and interesting plots. Now I wanted to do the same with Drarry fics but I only found stories that were focused on their romance and also had one of them being some kind of submissive creature that can only ever be happy if they are loved by their mate or something equally stupid.

So can someone recommend a Drarry fic to me were the story is focused on Harry defeating Voldemort and the romance is only a sub-plot?

Also please no Mpreg...


** linkao3(A Brother to Basilisks) has a background Draco/Harry and the fic's plot is mostly political with a lot of Slytherin Emphasis. Lomonaeren fics tend to have a lot of plot and their writing style is very unique - stories move forward through heavy use of dialogs, which I like for some reason.

Lettered's linkao3(Away Childish Things) deals with Dursley's A+ Parenting. Check out other stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/lettered/pseuds/lettered][lettered]] , some of lettered's other fics remind me of short stories, I've read in Reader's Digest with a bit of humor sprinkled in.

Someone mentioned Azoth, if you like it, you should read other stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/faire_weather/pseuds/zeitgeistic][zeitgeistic (faire_weather)]] , they all incorporate some type of Druid/High Fantasy magic in the fic.. pretty Unique..

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

** I'm recommending "The Secret Language of Plants" series by endrina. It's a sweeping rewrite of the entire series that has amongst other things: a damaged Harry who can dance houses into being with his WalkMan, A Slytherin led socialist revolution in Hogwarts, and the secret to why there's no snakes in Ireland.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

****** Sorry I want back and skimmed through the story. I changed my whole comment upthread because there is Dumbledore bashing. It just takes his canon words/choices and concludes certain things, so there isn't any Gringotts gold theft or loyalty potions, but it's there.

Dumbledore is still intelligent, powerful and wise. He makes few mistakes, but they are great indeed and in this fic he is determined that Harry has to die in order to destroy the Horcrux.
