**** having read all three of them (and greatly enjoyed all) i'll drop some reviews for anyone else that hasnt

chelseyb's stuff is fuckin amazing. its too bad that she up and left during the last stretch of halfblood auror :[

chelseyb also wrote the rebel and the chosen, which is basically a rewrite of books 5-7 with Tonks there instead of being the ultimate side character. it's a romance that's done really well.

Renegade cause is /really/, /really/ good. In my opinion, its one of the most underrated fics on FF.net. Every character feels human, and it has some of the best written OC's I've ever seen. some plot events are incredibly frustrating to read, though, and there are some plot holes (but they're not glaringly obvious). however, it's not for the faint of heart

edit. Kemester is my favorite OC of all time. Just the fact that I remember his name and how to spell it after 8ish months shows you how memorable and well written he was

  and Harry/Tonks should have been canon
#+end_quote

No, no, no. Holy shit, fuck no. I mean, fuck, no. How could you ever get that idea?

Anyway, here are some Harry/Tonks stories:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Summer-Of-Change][One]]. Not sure if that turns into something else -- I don't remember if I ever finished that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3807777/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Acts-of-Betrayal][Two]] this is only very technically Harry/Tonks, but actually Harry/Multi and also shit. So, you know. It does kind of feature Tonks on Harry action. Technically.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10256543/1/Nymphadora-s-Beau][Three]] One hundred percent Harry/Tonks. It's okay so far, but it's unfinished. I think it will be utter shit soon, but so far it's okay.

*** Out of those three, Nymphadora's Beau is definitely my favorite. Not a fan of [[/spoiler][Tonks getting pregnant]] though. I kind of stopped reading there and it doesn't look like there have been many new chapters posted since.

**** trying to do the spoiler thing. Is there a faq? I can't find it

Edit: can't do the spoiler. I don't have a general problem with the thing you don't like, but I hate it in this story because of the ages of the protagonists. It's partially a good story and substantially a bad one. It was updated recently, though, so I assume that the bad part will soon overwhelm the good.

****** There's no reason to use pastebin. There's the code markup which is activated by a four spaces on a new line

#+begin_example
  Like this

Or =inline code= which uses surrounding ` grave characters.

Or the forward slash escape character \ which prevents characters from [registering in]( the markup.)

So here it is:

**** I was so close to forgetting that [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=915&chapter=1][this]] exists. It's reprehensible and very very bad, but it also features Harry/Tonks action -- or at least Tonks pretending/Harry action. It's like link two, only even worse. It might even be the same author.

**** There's one story a can't seem to find. It was one where Harry moved in with Tonks after she rescued him from the Durselys, and it featured Auror work where Harry tagged along (I remember a gruesome crime scene, where Moody calms down Harry after they find a corpse or something like that).

The story's got three problems: I can't find it; it was unfinished; and Tonks was in an abusive relationship with Remus Lupin. So, even if you find it, it's unreadable until you replace Lupin with basically anybody else while reading.
