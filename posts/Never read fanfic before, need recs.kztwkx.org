Hello everyone, new here! So this year marks my 20th anniversary of discovering the series, and it has made me feel so incredibly nostalgic, and I had never thought of reading fanfic before, but I think it's time to do it so please drop your recs. I'm not really interested in any ships or romantic fanfics. I'd love to read more adventure related stuff, and someone mentioned Hermione being a Demonologist so that sounds like something I'd definitely want to read!!!

#+end_quote

That's pretty much my preference too. Here is my list:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]: Harry is thrown back to 1975, and has to team up with Bellatrix, who isn't a Death Eater yet. Very interesting plot and great characterizations, some romance, but it's not the focus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]]: Canon divergent after Year 4. Guerrilla Hermione kills rank and file Death Eaters, while Dumbledore manipulates the Ministry and prepares Harry for his direct confrontation with Voldemort. Dark war epic, some romance, but it's not the focus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]: James and Lily got Voldemort that night with a trap. They faked their own deaths, burnt down their own house, and fled for Germany. Harry was raised by his loving parents and never went to Hogwarts, but that doesn't mean he's a nice guy. Dark war epic with tons of politics and very little romance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]]: My favorite Year 7 canon compliant fic from Ginny's POV.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]]: What would have happened if Dumbledore and the Ministry were just slightly more competent and less negligent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]]: Grindelwald breaks out to avenge Dumbledore and joins forces with Harry. Chaos ensues.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]: This 'Harry' thinks he's Voldemort, acts like Voldemort, has the power of Voldemort, but only wants to teach DADA forever. Thus, he must eliminate all his competition first. A great comedy and the most popular fic on this sub.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]]: Badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are thrown into a very different universe during the Horcrux hunt. It's a very emotional and sad piece, shows you how fucked up it is to turn children into soldiers.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]]: My favorite postwar canon compliant fic. It depicts Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009 from their Muggle neighbor's POV.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]]: All 7 years from a Slytherin Ginny's POV, excellent character development. There are 3 postwar sequels too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/1/The-House-of-Potter-Rebuilt][The House of Potter Rebuilt]]: This fic has some very unique plot and ideas.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]: My favorite postwar fic overall. Harry and his friends had enough of the BS from Wizarding Britain's establishment. They begin their campaign with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who have escaped justice again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship]]: Still the only completed, non crossover "Wizards in Space" fic. It has many great ideas, but the writing itself has lots of problems.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]]: Gilderoy Lockhart found and raised Harry. Thus, he's already one cunning memory charm specialist at age 11.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully][Wish Carefully]]: Harry made a deal with Voldemort and let him build his 'Pureblood Utopia' in Britain. Narrated by Lucius Malfoy, very ironic and very satisfying.

*** Seconding Petrification Proliferation (White Squirrel just has great docs overall), stages of hope (will never read again though it hurt me), strangers at drakeshaugh, the sun of their parts (favourite post war fic as well.)

If OP likes the original series adventure style but wants more world building and character development, the innocent series and the arithmancer series is great.

** I'm not sure just how good of an idea it is that this is one of the first fics you read as a first timer, but here you go. Please mind the tags.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11800899?view_full_work=true][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]] by Brilliant Lady. Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Complete. Ao3.

I also recommend these for a fairly humorus, light-hearted, and heartwarming read:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and where to find them]] by EvansEntranced. And it's sequels. After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky. Complete FFNet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants series]] by Endrina. “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.” What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms. Complete AO3.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1555645][Ever Upward]] by Stranglerfig. Harry finds a better life with the basilisk, but that doesn't mean it's easy. From inter-being feuds, to bloody prophecies, to elven unrest, Harry is in the eye of a hurricane that will change the wizarding world forever. Involving thestrals, merfolk, house elves, centaurs, acromantulae, and various other friends, denizens, and allies. This series is: Queer in a multitude of ways. Morally complex. A massively canon-divergent AU. Filled with oc's and non-oc's. A story about relationships, love, trust, friendship, healing ... and revolution. There will be seven novel-length fics. This does not include the prologue to leap and love the fall or the short story with courage unyielding, which is set during the events of book V, a warmth so bright and fierce. Book VI, together through the night, updates every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. This entire series is completely written, so if you're wary of beginning something that might not end, fear not. Ao3.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897?view_full_work=true][Life skills outside the curriculum]] by Endrina. It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhkäse. FFNet.

For something more adventurous

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Harry potter and the Methods of Rationality]] by less wrong. Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE. FFNet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11364705/1/][Barefoot]] by Zaxaramus. Harry has the ability to learn the history of any object he touches, whether he wants to or not. FFNet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A second chance at life]] by Miranda Flairgold. When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic. FFNet.

For something darker

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/][Again and Again]] by Athey. The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp. FFNet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2378855][Stand Against the Moon]] by Batsutosai. Cursed against his will, Harry made the best of his life until he found himself, again, wandering in Death's realm. When Death offers him a second chance, a chance to right the wrongs he'd been blind to for too long, he can't possibly refuse. complete. Ao3.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]] by lightning on the wave. AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE.

For some shorter Fics

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548?view_adult=true#main][The boy who died a lot]] by star-crossed girl. Harry's always been known as The Boy Who Lived. Only Severus knows that this is a lie. (Or: a portrait of Severus Snape, in seven acts.) complete. Ao3.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The-Wendell-That-Wasn-t#top][The Wendell that wasnt]] by Opalish. The true story of how Harry and Ginny's kids got their names. Really, it's all Snape's fault. Crackfic oneshot.

*** Secret language of plants is my fave in the fandom. Life skills is not that far behind. I loved HPMOR (Methods of Rationality), but I notice that it is extremely hit or miss. If you don't care for it by, say, chapter 10, give it a miss. Saving Connor is similar. I've seen this series recommended quite a lot on this sub, but for me, it was excruciating. I thought the writing would pick up, but I can safely say that it didn't. (I read the first three and most of the fourth one, so that's about 885,000 words, or War and Peace twice.) Obviously, YMMV, but if this one isn't hitting home with you at the start, give it a miss.

** Two big ones that I think are just essential reading. Both have incredible writing. Both are primarily plot heavy fics rather than romance specific. Both are far enough away from the Harry Potter book years that you're not getting confused reading them because they change the original story which was an issue I had when I started reading fanfics.

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387][All The Young Dudes]]* It was my first HP fanfic read and I just got sucked it. It's a Remus/Sirius fic but honestly it is so incredibly well done that even my aromantic heart was rooting for them. It's not romantic but the pairing adds the drama. We follow Remus from 1stbyear to OoTP. He's a bit rough around the edges. There's a whole werewolf side plot. It's wonderfully written. Heartbreakingly sad. The characters are incredible. It's just brilliant.

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410][The Second String]]* This is brilliant. Brilliant brilliant, could not put it down! Harry ends up back in 1978 but doesn't go to find his parents, he tries to carve out his own life and gets sucked into the war his own way. It's brilliant! So exciting and sad and funny and dramatic!!! Harry has to make choices. He learns to fight. There's PIRATES. He owns a pub. There politics and vampires and it's great. So so good!! It's canon adjacent. A different story but you see little snippits and plot points from the books which are so clever! Highly recommend I had so much FUN reading it!

** I have a few recommendations that may or may not completely fit your requirement but I feel like they are unique enough that they could interest more than one reader. For the romance however, I tried to keep it to a minimum and did not suggest any story where romance is the main focus but some of my recomendations have some of it. Not all of them are adventure related stuff so they might not interest you but could easily interest other readers who visited this reddit post so I'm posting them just in case. Really, this is just a personal list of fics that I recommend even if they don't all fit what you asked lol.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12424188/1/Naturally][*/Naturally/*]]*/: (Female Harry Fic)/* A time-travel story where Harriet Potter goes back in time and literally lands in Newt Scamander's lap while he is sitting in a park. Harriet Potter arrive between /Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/ and /The Crimes of Grindewald/. Harriet want to save Tom Riddle's live/soul while avoiding him turning into a Dark Lord at all cost and Newt is kind-of dragged into it all by Harriet. They also have to deal with Gellert Grindewald because the Dark Lord is still pissed about what happened in the first movie. There is some romance between Harriet and Newt and they do get together but from memories, it isn't the main point of the story and doesn't happen until the middle of the fanfic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405386/1/My-Brother][*/My Brother!/*]]*/: (WIP)/* Harry is not an only child. A few months before the attack at Godric's Hollow, Lily Potter gave birth to a daughter named Emma. After James and Lily's death, both Harry and Emma are sent to the Dursleys and when it's time to go to Hogwarts, Emma is left behind since she is a year younger.

I love this fic as it show how Harry would be had he still had a family left after Voldemort's attack. It also diverge enough from canon while staying faithful to the original work to be a good read for everyone. Emma is cute and interactions between her and Harry really gave me some strong /overprotective-big-brother/ vibes toward her. Not exactly adventure-like as it explore more the relationship between Harry and Emma than anything else.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][*/Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always/*]]*/:/* A classic time-travel adventure story where Harry, Ginny and Ron travel back to their first year to change the timeline and avoid having Voldemort destroy the Wizarding World again. (He does a lot more damage than in canon). They also get help from Dumbledore and Snape from the moment they set foot in the past. Our main characters try to somewhat keep the timeline intact for the first few years but it all goes to shit at the end of Harry and Ron's fourth year. There is also the mystery about the identity of the character called "Merlin".

There is some romance in this one (Harry and Ginny are married after all) but it is not the main purpose of the story. Their romance does create some problems during the story however as some people freaks out when they see "kids" being closer to each other than some adults are.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9048823/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Four-Heirs][*/Harry Potter and the Four Heirs/*]]*/:/* Merlin is angry at the way Harry is treated as they Dursleys and decide to take him to a "pocket dimension" and raise him himself. Merlin is aware of the prophecy and while raising and teaching Harry, he makes plans to help Harry. When Harry come back to his time, he meet the Prime Minister and explain how the Wizarding World is slowly seceding from the Crown. Harry bring forth the four Heirs of Hogwarts who are all considered Earls from the point of view of the Crown. From there, Harry claim the title of Earl Slytherin, Neville Longbottom claim the title of Earl Gryffindor, Hermione Granger claim the title of Countess Ravenclaw and Susan Bones claim the title of Countess Hufflepuff. From there, the four Heirs go to Hogwarts and change everything. Not exactly an adventure story, more of a political one (with Noble Houses and all that jazz you often find in HP fanfiction)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8966727/1/Vengeance-from-the-grave][*/Vengeance from the grave/*]]*/: (WIP)/* Harry is distraught after the death of Sirius. Unfortunately for him, the families of his best friends don't want him close to them, the Inquisitorial Squad murder Hedwig and the Gryffindors banish Harry from their ranks. Having no one to turn toward, Harry goes to hide at the Astronomy Tower. Unfortunately, Susan Bones finds him and start pestering him about Cedric, asking why he died and other things like that. Susan doesn't like it when Harry tells her the truth that Cedric died only because he was there and that Cedric was nothing for Voldemort. Unfortunately, she put her foot in her mouth and say something extremely hurtful to Harry. Realising that he literally had nothing to live for (believing that nobody cared about him), Harry jump down the tower and kill himself. Harry is technically saved in extremis by the Unspeakables but everyone else believes that Harry is dead. Harry become an unspeakable and fight Death Eaters and Voldemort. His friends eventually learn the truth but it is years later and near the end of the story.

There is some romance between Harry and Susan but it only become prevalent near the end of the fanfic, by which point the story is about as good as over.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12507814/1/Magical-Metamorphosis][*/Magical Metamorphosis/*]]*/: (WIP, Trans Harry Fic)/* Harry is concerned when Hermione sleeps late and go to her dormitory, not knowing that it's supposed to be impossible for boys to climb the stairs toward the girls dormitory. This makes Hermione realise that either Harry or Magic itself doesn't see Harry as a boy and share her thoughts to Harry. Harry realise that he is really a girl inside which begin her transition toward the other gender.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6035532/1/Souls-Abound][*/Souls Abound/*]]*/:/* What would happen if Voldemort felt the destruction of the Diary Horcrux and ordered all of his remaining ones to become sentients and regroup in Riddle Manor? This fic explore the idea and is a hilarious read as things quickly go downhill for Voldemort and his Horcruxes. There is also some romance between Harry and Hermione but the fic is almost two different stories combined. It is a really good read however and would recommend it for anyone.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12120193/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Veil-of-Death][*/Harry Potter and the Veil of Death/*]]*/:/* A classic Harry Potter fanfiction where Harry is transported two years in the past to the Battle of the Department of Mysteries when he is hit by Voldemort's Killing Curse in an attempt to destroy the Horcrux in him. Realising that he was transported back in time, Harry does his best to save Sirius' life unfortunately is sent in the Veil of Death. Harry manage to get kicked out of it twenty minutes later but, by that point, everyone believes him to be dead. Since Harry already believes that he has to die to get rid of the Horcrux in his scar, he does not disprove anyone (both to protect them and stop them from mourning him twice) and go hunt the Horcruxes alone again, this time under the secret identity of the vigiliente "Pheonix".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3503388/1/Birth-of-a-Phoenix][*/Birth of a Phoenix/*]]*/:/* Harry has a twin and James and Lily survive the attack at Godric's Hollow. However, Harry soon become sick from an unknown, incurable illness. It a somewhat laughable attempt to reduce the pain of loosing Harry to his illness, James and Lily distance themselves from Harry to the point of neglect and try to make their other two sons (Harry's twin and a younger brother who was born in the meantime) do the same but unlike their parents, they refuse to distance themselves from Harry. Eventually, when Harry is five, he decide to run away, realising that his existence is just a burden to his family and believing that his parents don't love him. Harry is on the run for a few years and even get trained by the Flammels before going to Hogwarts and reuniting with his brothers under the guise of his twin's pheonix familiar (his Animagus form).

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13672115/1/Swiftly-Falling-Snow][*/Swiftly Falling Snow/*]]*/: (Female Harry)/* In this story, Harry Potter does not exist. Instead, there exist a girl named Rachel Snow (She is a female Harry even if her last name is different and idk why yet). Rachel go through a traumatic incidents at the Dursleys when she is eight-years-old which makes her unable to speak. (It is not physical but mental.) When she become a student at Hogwarts, her practical work is understandably horrible as she can't talk but her Head of House, Severus Snape, decide to help her talk again.

In this fic, Snape more similar to his movie version than in canon (in short: he isn't as much of an asshole) and truly tries to help Rachel to the point where he adopts her, destroying his cover as Voldemort's spy at Hogwarts. One of my favourite recent reads and would recommend it to everyone. The sequel is currently WIP.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16728228/chapters/39237102][*/Not Retribution, Just Returning Favour!/*]]*/: (Female Harry)/* Voldemort panics when he realise that Harry Potter known about his Horcruxes. In a last attempt, Voldemort curse the Elder Wand to send Harry back in time to the 70s at the height of Voldemort's power if she manage to kill him. The spell activate while Harry is putting the Elder Wand back in Dumbledore's tomb, actually dragging Ron and Hermione with her to the 1970s, straight in Lily Evans and the Marauders' seventh year at Hogwarts.

There is some romance in this fic between Harry and Sirius which is also hilarious because Harry's father is James, Sirius' best friend who is also technically younger than Harry. It makes for some fun, interesting scenes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][*/We are the Golden Trio!/*]]*/:/* Harry, Ron, Hermione and five-days old baby Rose Weasley are accidently sent back in time to their first year thanks to a magical mirror. The trio quickly realise that to their back to their original time, they have to kill Voldemort which means: destroying the Horcruxes. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione also have the problem of taking care of their baby daughter who somehow ended up back in time with them. Can't say more without spoiling the story but it is one of my favourite stories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6820445/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Phoenix-Burning][*/Harry Potter and The Phoenix Burning/*]]*/:/* Voldemort manage to hit Harry with the Killing Curse twice during the Battle of Hogwarts. The first time is fine, as seen in canon but Harry truly dies when he was hit the second time. Back at King's Cross Station, Harry meet a sickly looking Fawkes who mourn Harry's death while blaming himself for failing the last wish of his master Albus Dumbledore. Fawkes decide to send Harry back in time to 1971, the summer before Harry's parents are set to start at Hogwarts. A confused Harry appears in the middle of a Death Eater raid (Fawkes didn't tell him what he was doing) and he realise that he is somehow back in his eleven-years-old body. Harry resist Voldemort's Imperius and Cruciatus before being saved by Aurors who are stupefied at the eleven years old boy. The Aurors find out that Harry's closest relatives at the Potters and call Charlus Potter who bring him home. He is later adopted by his grandparents and become his father's almost-twin brother. Both of them go to Hogwarts and make friends with the future Marauders, Lily, Snape and a few others.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11331407/1/Supreme-Champion][*/Supreme Champion/*]]*/:/* Harry realise that there are some people who whish him to be entered in the Triwizard Tournament. To avoid that, Harry decide to trick the Goblet into spitting out the names of those who wanted Harry in. Four names come out of the Goblet of Fire, including, to Harry's surprise, Dumbledore's. The unwilling champions are then forced to somewhat participate in the tournament or lose their magic.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL
