Ideally Marauders era but I'm not picky. I'll give my favorite one linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7847867/1/Another-One-Goes-By]])

This one is set during PoA and follows an OC whom I liked and I thought the writing was decent. There is also an unfinished sequel.

Incomplete is fine but I like to read longer fics

** There's one by mamastreet. Only I can't remember the title. But it had some religious elements and quite a few OCs. Btw, I've never seen anyone ask for a Remus OC fic.

**** Remus is my favourite too, but since I don't like Tonks in most fics, I'm trying to find something with Remus and an OC and have to say it's very difficult. I've just remembered there's a fic a solution more beautiful by darsynia. But it's an AU where the OC is a book fan who gets transported into the world of HP.

***** I am also not a Remus/Tonks fan. I find Remus/Sirius a really beautiful ship though. Check out [[/r/wolfstar][r/wolfstar]] if that sounds like something you'd be interested in. There are a ton of fics already recommended there and if you don't see what you're looking for, people will be happy to make recs.

** This one has some beautiful writing, and a chapter of muggle Wicca ritual that feels like a trip to an exotic land.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/974964/chapters/1917437]])

I've written some Remus-centric ones in which he interacts with OCs, but there's no romance because he's Remus. He's not meant to be happy.

#+begin_quote
  Darcy Potter returns to Hogwarts for her final year at Hogwarts, overcome with fear at the idea that Sirius Black may have escaped Azkaban to come after her brother. Bitter at Harry's developing independence, he begins to push her away and distance himself. All the while, a new professor has arrived at Hogwarts with connections to her parents' past, and she keeps having strange dreams of a faceless man saving her from a scene of destruction... Her relationships become strained as Darcy feels increasing pressure to figure out who will come first in her life.
