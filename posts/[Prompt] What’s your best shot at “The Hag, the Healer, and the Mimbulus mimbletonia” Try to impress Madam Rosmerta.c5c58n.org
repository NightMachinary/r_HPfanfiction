In HBP, Hermione says Ron sulked for half an hour when Madam Rosmerta didn't laugh at his joke about the hag, the healer, and the Mimbulus mimbletonia. I don't know if this is going to turn into HPfanfiction's version of “[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aristocrats][The Aristocrats]],” but I'd love to see a few takes on this joke.


** A remix of an existing joke

One evening, a man on his way home encounters an old hag saying she's a beautiful princess of a certain kingdom before, because of her unparalled beauty an envied Dark Lady cursed her making her looks like a hundred year old hag and to lift the curse someone must ride a man's Nimbus till they're both satisfied. The man being heroic decides to help her to lift the said curse So he satisfy her desires the whole night, even taste her mimbulus mimbletonia, disregarding the pus. A morning came and man noticed that old hag still looks like a hundred year old hag,

he blurted "why are you still looked like that? You should've turned to princess right now",

and the old hag replied "How old are you young man?"

"30"

"You're that old and you still believe in fairy tales??"
