What did y'all think of *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/][Hogwarts Houses Divided]]*? Let me know in the comment section down below. Spoilers are fine; this is a book club!

The next fic is *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/][The Substitute]]* by /BajaB/. It's a good story but a bit dark.

** /Hogwarts Houses Divided/ is the first fanfic I read in a long time that reads like the original books. The writing is superb. And the characterization is so well developed, even with so many characters. The original characters (Harry, Ron, etc.) seem like an extension of canon and are not redefined or characterized as you see in a lot of other fanfics. The plot is well-paced, in my opinion, with enough hints to the Goblin Rebellion that the ending does not take you by surprise. The battle at the end seems a bit messy to me because of the number of main characters. Inverarity is a great author, and I recommend you read her Alexandra Quick series as well.

** I know this isn't a popular opinion, but Hogwarts Houses Divided is one of the fics I didn't enjoy. Part of it may be the author writing style; I've certainly had that issue with other authors (namely Orson Scott Card). The main problem is that while I feel the tone(?) of the fic reads similar to canon, a lot of the characters are severely OOC. I can't imagine any of the kids who had to deal with Umbridge would have stood for that same level of bureaucracy in Hogwarts, and things like a kid being expelled for having a picture of his Death Eater father because of the Mark seems off.

Inverarity has a tendency to write adults and authority figures as people who only see the black and white, or for whatever reason can't act on important information (especially in the Alexandra Quick novels). For some situations it works (read: MOM in all forms through the original books) but even in the books there are plenty of adult figures who are able to stand up to the issues the Wizarding World faces.

This isn't to say it was a bad fic by any means. I didn't find any grammatical problems and the pacing was fantastic. It flowed. I just didn't find it very similar to canon.

** The ending of a certain character was downright haunting. It stuck with me for days and fanfics usually drift out of my head pretty quickly after reading. Its probably my favorite Teddy Lupin characterization.

The beginning is a little hokey just because the amount of kids in Teddy's year that are connected to the original trilogy is a little silly, but its something I was able to forgive pretty quickly.

** I read this a while ago and couldn't figure out way I was reading it at first, next-gen not being something I was interested in. About a third of the way through it got better as the action kicked in and by the climax I was fully engaged. I think it is probably even a child friendly read (it was about 60 books ago).

Inverarity is a good writer (that must have been why I started it) and this is a good decent-length read.

** I really like Inverarity, so me liking this was a given. The fic flows really well, which is something not found. The plot was obviously meticulously outlined beforehand, as Inverarity did a great job of introducing mutiple plot threads that developed organically throughout the fic.

** Couldn't really get into this one, which isn't surprising since I've tried the the writer's big series without being hooked.

I made it through the first 12 chapters and gave up.

While the writing of *Hogwarts House Divided" shows technical skill, there's nothing that really stands out about it or the plot. The dialogue bothered me too -- many characters don't have distinct voices (Hugh being a big exception), so it all reads like the same person is talking. The "Slytherin is horrible" and "no true X acts like Y!" stuff was laid on a bit thicker than JKR ever managed, which got stale fast.

And though trying to be canon-flavor, there wasn't a whole lot of magical wonder, mystery, or whimsy. For a fic about the future, it seemed more embroiled in the past, going over well explored grounds. Oh look, here's the Room of Requirement. Oh look, here's a blow-by-blow Quidditch game.

... and then, within ten chapters, there was both [[/spoiler][a suicide attempt and shippy talk.]]

[[https://media.giphy.com/media/1WQLKmc1Gfhny/giphy.gif][mfw]]

It was a lot of vaguely sketched OCs with their own POVs and nothing to do but deal with bullying. Even so, I couldn't quite hate it. It wasn't bad but, it wasn't noteworthy.

*tl;dr* - Writer knows how to write adequately but the story was just ... /there/.

** Can I ask how much of the fic is next-gen and how much is Harry/Ron/Hermione/Ginny/Other Weasleys.

I generally avoid next-gen fics because I like reading about the characters from the books, but many canon-compliant authors like Northumbrian and little0bird do a good job of splitting time between both generations.

** I enjoyed readin this a lot. The writing style felt right, and matched the way the book series are written. One element that felt lacking was the Goblin rebellion plot. I wish we'd learned more about the politics of that before the shit hit the fan at Hogwarts. One the other hand, as this is written from Teddy's POV, it might have been something too hard for an 11 year old to understand.

** I did like it-- I just blitz read the whole thing over like the past 12 hours-- but I think the standing criticisms are largely valid.

There was one other thing that jumped out or bothered me and got me thinking about comparisons to canon. In the climax of the story, I had to keep pausing and thinking, this is still first year, right? In SS, the Harry, Ron, and Hermione... encounter a troll, help carry a baby dragon up to the astronomy tower in the dead of night, and try to stop a professor from stealing a powerful magical artifact. The fact that Quirrel is possessed is not something they are aware of or even think to suspect. All they know is, an adult wizard (and one they aren't all that impressed by, considering how he is in class) working for You-Know-Who, is trying to steal the stone. We gotta stop him. That is the extent of the danger they run headlong into, in first year.

The things they go up against by the end of the canon series are more than I can imagine myself as a seventeen year old withstanding, and that leaves me awed and horrified and humbled.

The things these kids run headlong into, as 11/12 year olds? Breaks my suspension of disbelief. Especially when they confront mortal danger up close, escape, and keep going back. I dunno. Maybe it's because I've always had more of a parent mentality, despite my children being, y'know, cats. But an 11/12 year old trying to do any of what Teddy does for some of those later chapters? That's not bravery, that's some kind of reckless short-sightedness and arrogance and boneheaded nonsense ignorant-- it's not the /right/ thing to do. Going and getting help, that's the right thing. Finding a safe place and staying put, that's IS what a child that age should do. Maybe if they'd been older, if the fic had been over the course of their first four years or something, I wouldn't be consumed with this sense of misplaced *BUT-WHAT-ABOUT-THE-CHILDREN!* wrongness.

*** Weirdly enough, that was exactly what I liked about it. I was so tired of "next gen" fics where the plot was just about Harry's kids going to Hogwarts and nothing really happened beyond mundane school drama, so I really liked that you had a next-gen story where things got DARK and SCARY, and the kids had to deal with it -- and didn't always handle it sensibly because, well, they were kids.

But then I look at the entire thing as a storyteller, not as a parent.

** THIS FIC STOLE A WEEKEND OF MINE A WHILE AGO. IT WAS AMAZING.

I get the various gripes (character voices aren't that clear, though I think Teddy's is pretty distinctive, it focuses too much on petty child problems, etc) that others have raised. It's kind of true. That said... This is also kind of true of the first book of Harry Potter. Think of the "Snape is evil because he's mean and a Slytherin" section of the plot, or how much is just... Random Harry and Draco things. Yes, it lays it on thick, but... Guys, it's a bunch of 11-year-olds. Look at 11-year-old Ron for a moment. Remember /that/?

And yet it is so charming and so cute and honestly the plot with the Goblins is way more interesting to me than the actual Voldemort "it's Nazis, but they're wizards" concept of Harry Potter (they're an oppressed minority! But they're bad! But they wouldn't be bad if they weren't oppressed! But that doesn't make them not-bad! Even the idea that some goblins DON'T KNOW GOBBLEDEGOOK blew my mind. Is their culture basically dying?).

The plot manages to blend the past and the future very well, provides interesting perspectives, has the whimsy and visceral power that good children's books have because everything at that age is so affecting and scary and amazing, and deals with complexities that were not really addressed directly in the books (eg: actual issues of race, the joy wizard children have at discovering muggle toys--We never see Hermione showing Ron a Nintendo or something, only Mr. Weasley cares about inventions from after the industrial revolution--, the power of beauty, divorce, even just the Hat having so much agency...). The idea of Slytherins basically getting racialized is amazing. I love how mature Harry is, and how nice yet firm a teacher Neville is.

It is, unfortunately for some, definitely a /children's/ story. It exaggerates the perspective of an 11-year-old and often ignores or only hints at the perspectives of adults. Somebody said the mention suicide was a problem, and... I mean, sure? If that bothers you, you're in charge of what you read. That said, preteens are the most likely age group to try to commit suicide. That's not crazy to include in a story that is basically about the children of a war-torn country's child-soldiers after they grew up. When I was 12, a kid in my classroom ran onto the street during recess shouting "hit me!" at oncoming cars. And from what I know of his life... It wasn't his home life that was the problem. It was that he got bullied so much. /Just like the kid in the story/. Children have incredibly low lows and a very short-term perspective, it happens.

This fanfic is a thousand times better than the "8th book" and if it could get some minor edits here and there I would be PSYCHED for it being declared canon. Even the basic idea at the start (The Sorting Hat sorts people in the wrong houses and tells them it won't sort anymore if people keep being jerks about sortings) is FANTASTIC. I love how the question of whether or not all of our characters actually belong in their houses is handled. Do they? Don't they? What does belonging actually mean? Is it not at the end of the day just that others accept you as you are and care that you feel welcome? Where /else/ would they belong, if in the end that is the case?

A++. Will read again.

But this particular next-gen fic had me hooked; the kids actually had personalities, the plot was interesting, and the entire thing did a great job of "redeeming" Slytherin without turning it into a house of misunderstood woobies, or trying to insist that the entire house is a noble elite filled with expert political manipulators.

Aren't double classes supposed to be classes for one subject being twice as long on certain days of the week, or has it always just meant that two houses were in the same class in a double and only one house in a regular class? I have always been under the impression that a double class was the former and all regular classes had at least two houses learning together.

Other classes are Gryffindors alone -- except for the electives like Care of Magical Creatures or Divination, which has students from all four houses.

In Hogwarts Houses Divided, they're trying to force inter-house cooperation by having ALL classes be shared.

**** Ok, that makes some sense. I guess I was confused because I've never got any hints that all classes didn't have less than two houses in them while reading the books. Though, that now makes me more confused about how the classes are scheduled so that only one teacher per subject can teach all seven years in the same week, with electives that are only taught to third years and up throwing a monkey wrench into the works. I have a feeling that I should look this up or ask about it in another sub.
