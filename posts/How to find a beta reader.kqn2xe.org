First off, if this isn't the right place to post this, just let me know and I'll take it down. I wasn't really sure where to post it. I am looking to get back into writing a fic that I started a few years ago. The link is here: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18455381/chapters/43723232#workskin]] - it's basically a master of death fic where Harry accidentally runs into himself and merges with his younger self. He's been hopping through time up until this point and has made some interesting friends along the way. Things are going to diverge from cannon pretty quickly in the new parts that are coming. I am looking for someone to bounce ideas off and to check my grammar and double-check that everything seems to work together. If anyone is interested, please let me know. Or if you know of other resources I can use to find a beta reader, those suggestions would be welcome as well. I am planning on having a new chapter ready sometime this week.


** You can post here. :)

And it is totally normal to have more than one beta reader. I am a non-native speaker of English, so I don't feel confident in helping with spelling and grammar. But I have beta-read for short fics before, so I am totally open for any of the other things.

*** Thanks, I just messaged you about betaing.

** As maryfamilyresearch said, you can post here. There's also the weekly beta swap thread on [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]]. Can't remember when it is, but they have a schedule in the sidebar.

If you have strong skin, there's also the Dark Lord Potter forum, which has 'work by author' threads that let the users there read and review your work. They are quite bluntly honest though, so really don't post unless you're thick-skinned.

FFNet also has a beta function (if you check out the top-bar on the website, it's the last option) where you can navigate through the filters to get HP specific betas.

There's probably a few more options too - I've known writers to work together and review each other on discords and yahoo groups and the like - but those are the main ones I know about.

*** Thanks, I'll check both of those out. I have read through the reviews on DLP before and know that they can be pretty brutal, but I want to advance my writing so that might be a good place to look. I am also going to try out [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] and see if I can't find someone there too.

**** You're welcome. Good luck with your writing, and your hunt for a beta. :)

Oh, and come to think of it, there's a lot of writing subs and resources around on how to improve your technical writing, so it might be worth posting in those subs (eg. [[/r/writing][r/writing]]) to ask for advice/resources and/or doing searches for tips and resources in subs and generally online to find advice that you might be able to tailor for your own purposes.
