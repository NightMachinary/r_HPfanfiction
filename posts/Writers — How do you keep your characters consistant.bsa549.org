Or rather, how do you keep characterization consistent in your fics? For one or two-shots I don't really bother, but for longer stories, it's a struggle for me to keep the main characters in character, especially if I can't relate to them. Do you write down character traits and go from there? Do you write out a detailed paragraph for each year of their lives (for multi-year fics)? Or somewhere in between? How do you work with the character's verbal tics and catchphrases?

Thoughts?


** The app I use for writing is called Scrivener, and it's very useful for file organisation. So I have a folder for each of my characters where I have a brief personal history and personality overview, and also where I dump all the dialogue I've ever written for them (and some defining dialogue from canon, of course). Then I skim that whenever I need to write for them.

** I have a notes file where I keep a list of characters with some bullet points of anything that seems relevant and/or useful.

I don't stress about it too much, though. Everybody has moods, and people act differently in different situations and with different company. There's a lot of wiggle room there.

And then every once in a while I'll re-read and edit my whole WiP to make sure it still makes sense cohesively.

*** Happy cake day!

What I'm doing so far is writing out all the major characters and giving their basic personality traits followed by a brief summary by year.

** That depends, sometimes you don't want to, especially if you're writing a story where they essentially fall to the Dark Side. Then, their personality changing into something unrecognizable makes sense, so long as it happens slowly, methodically, and logically.

** Personally, what I do is define a lot of backstory for this character (most of which might even not make it into the story in the end). I draw a complete mental image of them, sometimes associating certain traits of them to people I know in real life. I imagine fictional stories about them; what they do, what they say, how would they react to different situations...

I do write the basic description in a file, but generally, since I've defined so much, I manage to remember enough details to write them consistently enough. In the end, it's as if I know them well enough to always "get right" what they might do in a certain situation. Just like you might predict what a friend of yours might do in their everyday life, too.

** Consistency? I think your confusing well written stories with fanfiction here.

** Huh. This seems like an odd question to me, since I know my characters like I know my family and friends. Just like the real people in my life don't suddenly break character (or if they did I'd know that something weird was going on) my fictional characters don't either. Neither my old apartment-mate nor Sirius would spontaneously put a new roll of paper in the holder. If characters get inconsistent, you haven't fleshed them out well enough from the start.
