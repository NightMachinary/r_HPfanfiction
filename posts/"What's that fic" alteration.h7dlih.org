I'm not sure how easy this would be to do, but would it be worth it to copy [[/r/tipofmytongue]]'s format for the "What's that Fic?" flair?

Specifically, to trigger an automod action to shift the "What's That Fic?" flair to some variant of "Solved" when the fanfic that OP is looking for is located?


** Doesn't that already exist?

I mean, you have to manually change the flair, but there is a Found flair for What's That Fic.

*** There isn't a flair listed already. You can manually change the flair to "Found" by typing it in, but it's not listed as one of the subreddit's flairs. But I was suggesting a way to automate it, that would allow the OP to reply to the comment that was has the fanfic they were looking for, change the flair to reflect that, and maybe even automatically notify anyone else who wanted to know about the fic being found without resorting to the remind me bot and checking back manually.

*** I did not know that. I'm going to look back through my posts and update as necessary.

ETA: Turns out my sole fic search was in a different sub. But I still learned something. Take my upvote.
