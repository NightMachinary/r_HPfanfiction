The idea came to me after reading

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3446796/1/Magical-Relations]]

#+begin_quote
  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year
#+end_quote

I thought it would be a Dudley story, but after trying it out, was pleasantly surprised to find that not only is it Harry centric, but the writing and characters are actually quite good.

What about you, what stories have you tried after blowing off, only to be happily surprised?


** linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle by jbern) has both an annoying title (I hate that Jethro Tull song) and a pretentious summary. I avoided it for a long time, then one day opted to read it if only for the excuse to leave a scathing review.

After a rough first couple of chapters, I settled in and found it an enjoyable read at the time. (I was starting my obligatory 'Indy!Harry' phase on the [[/u/Taure]] stages of fanfiction reading.)

**** Heh. To each his or her own.

Here's a [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=294087&postcount=9][link]] to Taure's stages, something that I'd propose probably should be sidebarred, as often as I've linked it here.

His stages 1 and 2 are pretty universal (for DLP members, at any rate), as is stage 4. Stage 3 takes different forms for different people.

***** Damn, that's pretty spot-on except for the very last bit. If it's a good fic I still prefer sprawling and huge because if it's good I want more of it.

***** Oddly, I started with Lily/James fics, then went to Harry/Luna pairing stuff.

Then I went on a soul bond kick.

And somewhere in here I had a very long time travel/super AU spree.

Now I spend my days really disliking any common pairing, and reading a shitload of crossovers. H/Hr, H/G, etc. And liking the more fringe -almost OC- pairings. HP/SB is probably my favorite pairing.

***** I see where he's going with that, of course. And for the most part I can agree with them. However, in my case I still just really don't enjoy a fic unless it's H/G or J/L. And that's okay with me to be honest, everyone enjoys what they enjoy at the end of the day.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

*** Just finished this last night. It kind of fizzled out near the end for me, but the first two books were great. I liked the novelty of a harem fic that makes SENSE in context without feeling forced. And it's not necessarily an outcome the participants want.

**** In a world where men are traded and sold like breeding stock and the strong ones have their magic forcefully crippled by the women in power to make them docile, a young boy enters the wizarding world prophesied to change the world. PS: Fuck the matriarchy.

It's basically a world where radical Feminism is in power and oppresses and hobbles men's ability to be men. If you are to strong you get raped and your magic bound into servitude to a designated women. If you fight against the system you become a dark lord. 3:1 Witch to Wizard ratio. Since it's a dark marth story it also contains harem.

The premise makes it my favorite hpfanfic.

  Harry must have been lonely while living at the Dursley's. What if he wished a friend and it worked? "Inquisitive, unconventional Harry. Lots of humour" like someone said. Writing gets better later on, said another. In the end H/Hr, some N/L.
