It's full of cliches, like finding a Snorkcack, OP Harry, but he doesn't care about the tournament. He does some kind of Conjury ritual and breaks Gamps Law and conjures actual food Cows, and does something ridiculous in the 2nd task as well (I don't remember what) and the third task he doesn't try, still ends up winning somehow, and because he didn't try in the tournament, the blood of the enemy ritual goes wrong somehow, and Voldemort ends up dying because of it, including all of his horcruxes GG (Harry is unharmed). Harry ends up sleeping in an almost Magus like Workshop in one of the Classrooms, and gets 2 Masteries before the end of the year as well.
