As a college student who also works part-time, I'm at perpetual battle with time. Looking at the word count for some stories/series I'm in serious awe...How do people find time to write so much? What are good ways to force words when you're tired and undermotivated? Discuss tips and strategies.


** There's those that don't work for whatever reason, among them retirement (ex: Captain Compass), medical reasons (myself, though I don't post any more), or that are currently unemployed. There are those that use all their free time to write instead of other stuff that you or I might do such as play video games and watch youtube or twitch. There are also some who have been writing far longer than you might think who came up with plots and passages long before they're published. Then there's those like DZ2 who treat every month like NaNoWriMo where every thought makes it to a story.

*** And then you have people who just don't. stop. writing. Looking at you, Megamatt09... Pretty sure he's more than one person.

** I work 40hrs/week. Lunch break? Writing. Downtime? Writing. You have to want it. More than a shitty turkey burger at the cafeteria.

** You have to either have the time to write or you make the time to write.

Last year, I had a job where I had plenty of time to write. This year, not so much.

You can only type so many words per minute. At the end of the day, you just have to have the time to write and the discipline to keep writing.

*** I took this cool online test. 132 WPM. It actually meant something when I was younger.... I doubt anyone cares how fast you can type now.

That said....being able to type faster.... Seems like more BS, faster, than back in the day.

** Some people are just efficient. When they log on, they write straight for an hour+; they don't waste time looking through dozens of "story writing tips" blogs, and then they go on with real life. Also, many people write on their phones on the bus to work, or during their lunch break, instead of waiting to get home to use their special writing software.

There's also a matter of knowing exactly what you want to write. If you're an Architect type of writer, then generally everything you write will make in in the final version. Whereas, if you're more of a go-with-the-flow Gardener type, you could be writing thousands and thousands of words, then scrapping it when you realize it doesn't go anywhere, and then re-write, and re-plot, write some more, scrap some more...

** Any advice for staying focused and motivated? In particular, ignoring the distractions of the internet.

I have spare time, but I end up writing a few sentences and then going on reddit or reading the news or whatever.

The only times I've been productive in terms of writing were when I was away from civilization with nothing but a notebook and a pen, and bored out of my mind.

*** There's a neat little program called [[http://writersblock.io][writer's block]] which you can use for that. You can enter a time or a word count that you want to achieve, and until that is done, it won't let you alt+tab out.

** I suppose it depends on what you mean by prolific. I sure don't cut it by any means, but I've managed around 5k per month for the past year... that covers five months on a working holiday (mostly part-time) and the other seven in a 40hr work week.

In theory, it's simply finding the time if you want it enough, but in practice, the only reason I've managed to update (fairly) consistently is because I'll feel bad otherwise. Writer's/artist's/making-stuff-person's guilt FTW.

*** Agreed. Guilt works wonders for writing/updates. I write at a notoriously slow pace (mainly because I nitpick over every sentence - incidentally, I'm also a brutal beta ) but I don't think I've ever /stopped/ writing. It just happens in super slow motion.
