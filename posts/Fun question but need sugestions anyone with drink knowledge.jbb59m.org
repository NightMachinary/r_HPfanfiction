What would a half German oc that is rich? Favorite cocktail be? Also favorite cocktails suggestions for the marauders?


** I would still prefer beer, even if I were rich. I'm full german though.

Moony got his name before the others knew about the werwolf thing. He was distilling and selling Moonshine since his first year at Hogwarts.

Padfoot would never drink something called "cock" + "tail". So whiskey for him?

Prongs likes to pretend to be a wine connoisseur.

Wormtail is the designated appariter.

** Gin and Tonic for Remus. Rob Roy or just Scotch for Sirius. James Potter would be a martini guy, dirty. Pettigrew... Some bs vodka drink like a screwdriver or something.

Aperol spritzes, negronis, and whisky sours are also good stuff. I'd also say they'd all drink beer. Probably just lagers.

**** "Whiteclaw or white wine, whichever," said Peter.

Sirius and James looked at him as though they had been betrayed.
