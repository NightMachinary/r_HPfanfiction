*** Plot twist: Draco Malfoy is secretly BWL. Lucius has ‘defied him' three times. Voldemort's hit pregnant Narcissa with a spell of some sort while he's in the womb and marked him.

**** Or it turns out that January, 1 corresponds to the end of the seventh month in some obscure and antiquated calendar, therefore Voldemort was born at the “end of the seventh month” to a father that soured his mother's advances two times before the love potion and abandoned them when the effect passed and a mother who sold their family heirlooms, maintained him hidden from the magic world and left him in the worst orphanage she could find, therefore defying him three times (his father by not contributing willingly to his birth and his mother by separating him from the magic world and their family's history). So what the prophecy actually meant was that he would end up committing suicide by killing off all his followers and them making enough of a nuisance of himself that his enemies would attack in mass to kill him.

***** You don't have to. There have been enough calendar systems on the planet that most, if not all of the days of the year are covered.

When you add in the multitude of fiscal calendars, school year calendars, Government Calendars, and other utility calendars, the coverage becomes crazy.

  It was foretold that a child born at the end of July would be his downfall. Lord Voldemort didn't want to take any chances as to whom the prophecy could apply to. Malfoy POV, Complete.

** This, plus the "prophecy fails to specify which calendar's seventh month" for extra chaos.

Plus, for lunar and lunisolar calendars (where each month starts with a new moon), you /could/ possibly twist the words of the prophecy to be particularly vague and refer to the 'death' of the moon that is the /beginning/ of the seventh month (which is a stretch, but even more chaos).

Hermione would maybe qualify under "Hebrew/New Moon of 7th Month", but she's born a year too early (September 19th 1979 is 27 Elul, 28 if she was born after sunset).

**** Ooh I like that.

You even get a secondary Death connection - there was a superstition in some places/times that babies born 7 and 9 months were viable, but 8 month babies were not.

Under that paradigm, an end-7th-month baby would be straddling life and death.

  Is it cannon that Trelawney gave her prophecy in 1980 or could she have given it any time between August 1st 1979 to mid July 1980. If it was between August 1st 1979 and mid September it could be Hermione.
