I used to obsessively read Draco/Ginny fan fiction, I haven't done that in like 12 years so I'm curious if there are any new fics I missed worth reading. If you end up recommending something I've already read, I might re-read it anyway for old time's sake. So I'm open to whatever, just tell me about your absolute fave!
