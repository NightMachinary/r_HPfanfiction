Heya! Time for my random request of the year! I'm looking for crossovers that have absolutely no reason to exist, and even less reasons to work (but they do). Anything goes, I'm not picky for pairings, and I don't mind slash as long as it's well written. Ideally more than 40k words, because I like some meat on my bone. Thanks a lot people, and a happy new year!


** Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce. Sounds wack, but it works. Linkao3(12805206)

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

  The Fab Five face their greatest challenge yet: Rubeus Hagrid. He's got no closet, no bathroom, a bad recipe for rock cakes, a fifty-year-old moleskin coat, and an overgrown beard. Along the way, the Fab Five realize that Hogwarts itself seems to need their help just as much as Hagrid. YAAASSS QUEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!WINNER for 2018 Beyond the Nook Fanfiction Awards, Best Comedy!
