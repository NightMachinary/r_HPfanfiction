Okay, I know this sounds silly...But it's in the spirit of this: [[http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35977315]]

If JK Rowling put data in spreadsheets about her canon and this, along with analysis of the books, was used by a computer program to generate new Harry Potter stories that in theory could have been written by her, would you want to read it or not? Why?


** Even if it ends up choppy and incoherent, it's possible to get at least a skeleton for someone else to write a better fic out of it- that's probably the max limit of it though, an outline of events. I find it hard to believe a computer can predict plot holes to exploit/missing backstory to embellish from. You'd probably have to throw in spreadsheets of lots of other things like mythology. How would a computer be able to capture the flavour of the atmosphere in the books either? Still I can see how it would be useful for a fanfic author.

** I have read several short stories and one screenplay written by computers, and the technology would have to get much better for this to be truly possible without it being obvious.

Actually I don't think I'd like to read one the JKR was putting out as canon and her original fiction, but I'd be happy to read fanfics written this way if the computers got better at it.
