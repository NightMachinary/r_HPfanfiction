:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! I'm looking for a specific fic where Harry is in the beginning of fifth year, is sitting on the couch with Ginny and accidentally gets sucked into an alternate universe where his parents are alive. He gets injured and is taken to the Potter house. His alternate self was kidnapped when he was a toddler by Death Eaters so he's pretty violent. He has a sister named Willow that is a seer. Sirius doesn't like him and eventually Harry sneaks onto a mission and gets killed saving Sirius. He's revives after having a chat with his parents in the afterlife who tell him to not trust Alternate!Dumbledore and the Potter cottage is attacked. Hermione and others found an instrument to send Harry back to his own universe, which he only did because James said he didn't want him there.

Cue original universes Sirius comforting Harry.

I hope this is enough is find it, I've been looking everywhere and it's really bugging me.

Thanks to everyone helping!!

*** It's honestly all over the place and very angst ridden (because fifth year Harry anyone?) but it's an enjoyable read, if a bit ridiculous.
