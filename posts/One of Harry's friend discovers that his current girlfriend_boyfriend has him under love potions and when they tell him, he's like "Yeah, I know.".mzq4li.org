Harry knows that he's being dosed but he doesn't care because he's happy for once. If it's in 5th Year, he doesn't have think about Umbridge torturing him, about Snape mind-raping him, about the Prophet slandering him, about the Ministry not believing him and people thinking he's insane.

If it's 6th Year, he doesn't have to think about Sirius being dead, about being the Chosen One, about the fact that Voldemort has so much more experience than him and he's most likely going to be killed by him when they inevitably fight. The only thing that matters is how in love he is with "..." and how happy his relationship with them makes him.

When whoever discovered that he's under love potions comes to him with their discovery, he's all "I know, but I'm happy, and I want to stay that way.", he asks them not to do anything and emotionally blackmail them with "If you're really my friend, you won't take away my happiness."


** I think anyone under a love potion, if given the option, would choose to stay under the love potion, regardless of how much they were suffering before, although I guess the books say something like they'll fly into a rage if someone points out they're enchanted?

That's kind of how they work, by. making the subject enjoy it. The Imperius is the same way to a lesser extent - it feels good and people want to submit because it's uncomfortable not to.

******* I'm so glad it's been working for you, and that it's stable so quickly! I've had a particularly bad time with them as well as other medications, only one antidepressant medication has worked in any kind of way, and it made me gain so much weight that we had to take me off of it, so I'm pretty intimately familiar with bad reactions. Some people's bodies are just going to do weird shit.

One anti anxiety medication we tried had me writing poetry instead of prose, like I literally couldn't write my fics anymore it was so fucking weird. But then you're trying to change the chemicals in your brain.

I've also had some people having allergies to potions ingredients in my stories, it just makes sense, but I haven't had them reacting to the mind altering ones. I think I might stick that in a fic or two

That's a really interesting reason for Snape to be like that. I imagine they might feel like part of their Magical inheritance is being denied them and just the unfairness of the universe, that there are these miracle cures but they can't use them

** Alternately, Harry takes the potion not because he doesn't worry about other stuff, but because it keeps his head too full of the person the potion is keyed to for Voldemort to get anything useful out of it. It also pushes him to get better at defense, so he can protect the one he "loves." The "power the Dark Lord knows not" is ironically not love, but love potions.

**** That's kinda how I see it. Like Ron catches Ginny spiking Harry's drink one day and begins making a fuss. Ginny tries to play it off like it's some fun thing they just do but Ron's not having it. Hermione drags the off to McGonagall. Meanwhile Harry is trying to tell his friends it's cool, but they thing he's still potioned up. He gets more and more mad and gives up trying to explain anything, which they take as condition it's all worn off and he's mad at Ginny. When they get to McGonagall, Harry is silent as Ron and Hermione say what they've discovered. He then demands to see Dumbledore, and eventually explains everything to him. Ron and Hermione are suitably embarrassed by the whole fiasco.

** sounds like an interesting metaphor for drug-use, along with some moral debate on the topic of consent.

Downside is that we see how love-potion works in the story, and it tends to make the victim quite... silly and lack situational awareness.

*** To be fair, we see how one love potion works in the story. And IIRC, Amortentia is called something like the "most powerful love potion," which means that there must be other, less powerful love potions. So it is definitely canon-compliant for a story to feature a love potion that is much less overpoweringly effective, but also doesn't have obvious side effects.

And honestly, that probably makes the metaphor work even better. It's not hard to imagine Harry in this situation requesting more powerful love potions as his life gets worse.

** "I know, Hermione."

She froze mid-tirade, jaw hanging open. Finally, she said, "What?"

"I said I know. Daphne and I have been dosing each other with a diluted brand of the stuff you can buy from Fred and George for weeks now."

"But... but why?" She just couldn't understand it.

"It's recreational, really. It actually started out as a bit of a game between us, but we both liked the effects." He looked earnestly into Hermione's eyes. "I really like her; she really likes me. We each have our own flaws that we don't like about the other though, and the Potion just smooths over the cracks so we don't get annoyed by insignificant things during our times together."

She shook her head. "You're not in your right frame of mind. I'm sure that once you take a bezeor--"

"Hermione," he said flatly, "all you'll be doing is wasting a good bezeor that someone else may urgently need one day. I guarantee you that Daphne and I would be downing another dose a minute after either of us having swallowed one."

He rested his hand on her shoulder and gave her a comforting squeeze. "I know you're looking out for me, Hermione. I appreciate it." He looked deep into her eyes and she was mesmerized at how green and intense they were. Her breath hitched a little at the back of her throat. "I love you like the sister I never had, you know."

Something inside her abruptly shriveled and died. "Yeah... yeah, I know, you great prat." She smiled weakly at him. "Go on, you've got just under two hours before other people start asking where you've gone."

"Thanks, Hermione. You're the best."

An hour later, no-one could understand why quiet, bookish Hermione Granger had become irritable and brooding, almost hexing Cormac McLaggen when he spoke barely just two words to her.
