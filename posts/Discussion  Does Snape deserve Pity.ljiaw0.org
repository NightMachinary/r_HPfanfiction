We all are aware of the controversial character in Harry Potter Severus Snape, he is renowned a hero by some, a traitor, or just a terrible human. What do you guys think about Snape, does he deserve our forgiveness or not?

I personally feel that Snape is a character who should be remembered as important but, not renowned. Snape was the one who alerted Voldemort into action to plan his murder of the Longbottoms and Potters. He made a mistake I get it but, he only realised he had done something wrong when he realized Lily would die. Selfish. Then he went to both sides, (Dumbledore and Voldemort) to beg for Lily's life, without giving a damn about the husband or children. However, after they died and Snape was cradling Lily's body he could have picked up Harry and taken him somewhere safe. He didn't. He then proceeded to terrorise children and stop many potential Aurors because they didn't want to have to deal with Snape. Once Voldemort came back Snape was worthy of redemption. He put his life on the line for a while to protect peace. He lied to the face of a very powerful Dark Lord and he was the one who argued against Harry being set up as a lamb to the slaughter.

​

Snape is good and he is bad, I think he should e acknowledged but not renowned. What do you think!


** Maybe this is a nitpick, but Snape never went to Godrick's Hollow to cradle Lily's corpse while crying baby Harry watched. That scene in the movies always struck me as super creepy, but never happened in canon. For all of his terrible behavior, that's not something that should be held against him.

*** Yeah and At that point Lily hadn't been friends with Snape for around 6 years its just creepy . I don't think Lily would forgiven Snape at all, she probably never even thought of him in those 6 years unless it was bad things and she would hold the same disdain for him as any other Death eater.

**** I agree, and do think she made the right call in cutting off their friendship when she did.

I don't think he ever tried to bother her or contact her after she made it clear their friendship was over. If he had then James, Sirius, and Remus would have at least known about it, and likely retaliated. As it was nobody who was alive during the timeline of the books knew that Snape had feelings for her besides Snape and Dumbledore. I also doubt he ever confessed his feelings to her directly at any point before their friendship ended.

** I don't think pity is a matter of deserve. You pity someone regardless of whether they deserve it. I pity Peter Pettigrew, too, and even Voldemort to a certain extent. No matter what someone did, if their life ends up in a sad miserable state because of their character flaws and the choices they made, they're pitiful.

Do I also have zero tolerance for Snape and think that he was a terrible human with few redeeming qualities if any? Uh yeah

** Nah.

Is he an interesting character? Sure, but does he, as a character, deserve pity after everything he's done? No.

Like you said, he only felt bad about telling Voldemort of the prophecy once he realized it would affect Lily, not because it was an awful thing to do, and damning a child and family to be murdered is pretty awful.

Also, I could be wrong, it's been awhile since I read the last book, but I think the scene where he holds Lily's body is in the movie only, and was only done to make Alan Rickman's Snape into a more sympathetic character.

*** I agree with you but I find the movies canon as JK Rowling has basically pt her stamp of approval on it. And even if Rowling doesn't approve of the scene the scene itself is stupid. We are supposed to forgive Snape for leaving a baby in the cold with no one to watch over him but 2 dead bodies. A scene which is supposed to make you forgive him makes me dislike him more. Snape's morals are questionable, he is like a loose cannon who only focuses on one thing and only works for one thing only while ignoring everything else.

****** That's okay, here goes:

Arthur and Molly are okay, but Bill was no better than a cardboard cut out of what we /could/ have had, like he was depicted as so cool in the books, but was transferred into wet paper in the films. Charlie wasn't even in the movies, so there's that, Percy was pretty on point, and the twins were okay also, but Ron and Ginny got shafted /big time/.

Ron, like you said, all of his good lines and actions were given to Hermione, and he was depicted as a selfish, lazy comedic relief, while Ginny got the Bill treatment also, meaning that she had none of the personality or presence that book Ginny had, effectively causing Ginny/Harry to crash and burn before it could ever take off.

Honestly, I think it comes off as an unconscious (I hope) classist take, portraying the Weasleys in a bad light because they're poor, while they made a character like Draco appear far more sympathetic (likely because it's implied that he's wealthy) when he's a whole violent bigot with 0 redeeming qualities in the books.

Sorry for the shpeel, I clearly have many thoughts on the characterization in the films lol

** Does Snape deserve pity? Yes, I think he does, because he had a horrid life, for the most part.

Now, forgiveness... that's a whole other kettle of fish. Severus Snape is an arrogant, miserable, hateful and hurtful piece of shit. Sure, he had to maintain his cover to act as a spy, but it's easy to do, when all you have to do is to be yourself.

He mistreated not only Harry, but Neville, as well. He treats almost everyone with at least a measure of disdain, and scorn.

He may not be evil, but that doesn't mean he's not a failure as a human being.

*** Dumbledore really bears a lot of responsibility for stuff that went on in the classrooms that he never stepped in to fix.

Snape started teaching at about 21 years old. That means the Slytherins under his care were literally his former housemates. And the Gryffindors were kids who had witnessed him getting bullied and humiliated by their beloved star seeker, who had recently been martyred in the fight against Voldemort. This bullying is heavily implied to have included having his underwear removed in front of the school (which was sexual assault). Which makes me wonder if his early Gryffindor classes had students acting like twerps and fooling around in dangerous ways. Like did they call him "Snivellus" to his face when he was giving instructions to the class? Did they do anything worse than that, like when Harry threw a firecracker into a cauldron?

Wizards don't get any post secondary education. Snape had no training on classroom management. He was just put into a room with dozens if not hundreds teens that personally knew him when he was a teen himself, and somehow had to keep them from melting their faces off or killing each other by fooling around.

It's not too surprising that with his personal background he resorted to harsh discipline and intimidation to manage his classes. And when a behavior gets the desired results, it's really hard for someone to change. So when he was older and those students were gone and he could have gone a bit softer, he didn't.

I do not understand why Dumbledore never stepped in to show Severus more effective ways of handling the students. Also, if Dumbledore had explicitly forbade certain behaviors such as insulting students based on intellect or personal appearance, I don't think Snape would have went behind his back and done it anyway. It doesn't make him a nice person if it would have taken that to make him stop, but the fact that Dumbledore never intervened or gave him adequate support to learn how to teach properly isn't okay either.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

Nothing about Snape's personality suggests that he would stop being a miserable dickhead just because Dumbledore asked him not to. Dumbledore tried to get Harry to be civil to Snape. Who's to say he didn't get Snape to be civil to his students?

Don't want to get bullied? Don't join the wizard nazis and throw around racial slurs. Especially if there's a war going on and the people that are called by that slur are getting murdered by the people using that slur.

If I knew Dylan Roof before he shot all those people and saw him getting bullied, I wouldn't give a damn. That was who Snape was in school.

Keep in mind that even passing an OWL is considered something of an achievement, let alone getting the highest grade.

** I think he's a tragic character who was very well written and he is written in a way that makes him very easy to hate.

One thing to note: Snape went to Dumbledore when Voldemort disappeared. Both knew that Harry Potter was the child of prophesy, and Dumbledore tells Snape that one day Voldemort will rise again and Harry will be in grave danger.

#+begin_quote
  *Canon quote:*

  “He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone ---”

  “The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does.”

  There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself, mastered his own breathing. At last he said, “Very well. Very well. But never --- never tell, Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I cannot bear . . . especially Potter's son . . . I want your word!”

  “My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?” Dumbledore sighed, looking down into Snape's ferocious, anguished face. “If you insist . . .”
#+end_quote

Essentially, Snape went through his teaching days /knowing/ that one day Voldemort would return, so he played the part of villainous Potions Master to maintain his position so he would be in Voldemort's good graces once the Dark Lord regained power. The war never ended for him.
