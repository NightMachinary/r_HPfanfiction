I've been looking around and have found quite a few but none are very good in terms of plot, grammar, etc.


** I am now toiling my way through linkao3(Looking Beyond by shini_amaryllis) which is fem!Harry&George, and my only motivations is shifting now only to the desperate hope that there must be somewhere some original idea and some plot in the whole thing, not only copying JKR's books verbatim. So, no “well-written” doesn't fit.

**** Did I say “waste of time”? I should. There are couple of nice substories (like five pages in total), the rest is just JKR story with HUGE amount of text just verbatim, the same. Why should I read the same story again, when I read the original books (and who of readers of this fanfic hasn't read the books)?

****** Nothing is 100% prefect. Although, even if I have my complaints with JKR books (e.g., [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][blog]]), I have not meant this like it. What I meant is that I expect from fanfiction to bring something of its own, not recycle the original text. For example, you have every right to just say that the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament is same, then why you can just summarize the events in two paragraphs and bring something of your own, and not to have two chapters which are mostly the same as what Ms. Rowling wrote in books.

******* I think we are on the same page.

Although I'm not at the point where I hate the stations of cannon yet though.

******** I think I don't hate the stations of canon /per se/, but I dislike when the information about them takes the same amount of space as in the books. Whenever I hear Professor McGonagall explain how there are four houses of Hogwarts, verbatim copied word by word from the books, I scream out of frustration and desperation. We have all read it, just cut it out, and bring your own ideas! If you are repeating some story from the books then it *must* be different, bringing something new. So, I don't mind The Third Task in linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) (and note that his Tasks are different from the books), because its conclusion and progress is very different from the books. That makes sense. Copying it almost word by word (with some sassy remarks in between) in “Looking Beyond” doesn't.

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it. It only made sense that she would fall for a prankster, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. Somehow, she was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived.
