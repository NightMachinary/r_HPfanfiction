** linkffn(8615605) The Never-Ending Road is great. It isn't fem!Harry x Snape at the age of 12 though so don't worry about that. It is very slow burn so fair warning.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. Future Snape/Harriet. Sequel "No Journey's End" (Ootp - DH) is now posting.

*** Isn't this series while Harriet is still in Hogwarts? I don't think there's been any romance so far.

**** Yeah but I feel like the sequel is heading in that direction. I mean it might keep at the impasse that is there right now. But maybe there will be a sequel after Hogwarts years.
