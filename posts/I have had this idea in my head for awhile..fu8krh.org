The idea is to have a third group of humans trying to commit genocide against both Wizards and Muggles. This would cause a world war, starting in 1996, resulting in a third world war. Both light and dark wizards join with Muggles to fight against this third group, called something like, I don't know, the Army of True Humanity(Not it's acutal name, just a placeholder i came up with). The story would be very grimdark, with the atrocities committed by the ATH being far worse than anything Death Eaters have ever done. Like, Imperium of Man from 40k level of bad.

What do you guys think? Is this a bad idea, or a good one?

**** Good idea. But I feel as if there would be couple of corners you will back yourself into. Humans don't do well with surprise. two groups who muggles didn't have an idea even existed come to the forefront at the same time. Why won't muggles lump them together? Supernatural Vs humans. That would be the motto of muggles. What's the true differentiation between wizards and this third group? Atrocities? I give you the cruciatus. Looks? I give you goblins, trolls, half giants, werewolves all of which come under wizarding domain. Essentially non Muggle domain.

***** Well, they basically look like futuristic warriors on the outside, but underneath their armor, they resemble ADVENT soldiers from XCOM 2. Their leaders/creators were supermen, like the Augments from Star Trek, but created by a squib scientst. They see the violence and destruction in both worlds, and decide(Since they're insane men and women with Napoleonic ambitions), that genocide is the only solution. They have perfected the art of combining magic with science, and by the third chapter of my story, have already taken over Africa and the Middle East.
