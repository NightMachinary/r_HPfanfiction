I'm looking for fics that don't treat Neville all too well. Could be varying from tame to outright bashing.

Don't have anything against the character. Just tired of fanon trope of making him Harry's best friend and bashing Ron.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

** This is interesting

I've never read a fic that bashes him before or really seen him in a negative light-except for one, kind of. I cant remember the name but if I'm remembering correctly, it was after the war and some of them were returning for their 8th year and Neville had dated Luna over the summer but they broke up and now he was dating Hannah Abbott. And I think the fic was showing that he was kind of flaunting his new relationship with Hannah in Luna's face, sort of.

That's about as negative towards him as I've seen

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.
