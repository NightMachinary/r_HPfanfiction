I have been writing fanfiction on and off for the last 7 years or so, but I feel like I keep hitting walls, and it's so frustrating. Normally I will write in short bursts and get so enthusiastic about the story that I'll just burn myself out and become very disinterested in it.

I'm currently going through another bout of enthusiasm where I'm researching elements to the story, expanding and fleshing out the plot and doing short chapter synopses- but I can feel that interest fading each time I start to type out the story.

Does anyone else go through this? I could really use a 'pick-me-up'.


** I'm often reading fanfiction and get frustrated when they don't go the way I want them to go. For example, I have never read a dark!Hermione fic where she really goes on a rampage through pureblood throats. So, I'm writing that to satisfy my need for such a dark fic.

Also, fanfiction seldom explores other parts of the world. Whats magical society like in, for example, Japan? Central Europe? South Africa? Arabia? The cities of Babylon, Atlantis and other legendary places - are they maybe just hidden from muggles? So thats why I write a fic where Harry gets raised in these places.

So, my inspiration is mostly just the lack of themes and premises I want to read about.

** I usually read other fanfiction and come across a passage that makes me say, "That was awesome."

It inspires me to try and write something better.

*** Almost the same except the opposite: I read fanfiction and when I get to a point in an otherwise enjoyable story that makes me roll my eyes, I suddenly feel compelled to write something better.

The whole reason I started writing fanfiction was realizing 'They get praise and popularity even for this garbage? I could do better than /that/'.

** A good 90% of my inspiration comes from talking about HP with people on IRC. In particular MattSilver, Newcomb, and DarkSyaoran.

Those kinds of hours-long conversations exploring the contours of a plot bunny are the kinds of conversations that turn an idea into a story.

As for the other 10%:

- 5% getting an idea from rereading parts of the HP books, watching the HP movies, or reading fanfiction.

- 5% getting an idea from other media, whether it's TV, movies, or other books.

*** Is there a significant HP IRC channel I don't know about? Ours and [[/r/harrypotter]]'s are dead.

**** Darklordpotter's channel is highly active, though not always on the topic of HP.

** I don't really know. I kind of just know exactly what has happened, what is happening, and what needs to happen, with my current HP fanfic. Other times I just need to push through and think about it logically. Instead of waiting for inspiration, read over what you already have and think about what should happen next. Think about what's already happened and anything you may have set up previously.

Force yourself to think about it. Write some of it down. Write and continue writing even if it's terrible. Stick in some filler, then when you get around to the actual plot again, cut the filler.

Imagine the story in your head. Think of cool imagery and dialogue you'd like to write. E.g. "it would be cool if Hermione had a conversation with a pureblood traditionalist who wasn't racist". Then write it.

** The other ideas in the thread is probably best, but I'd recommend music a lot as well. It's surprisingly effective!

Just listen to some appropriate music when doing what helps you think freely the best, like lying in bed or walking, and let it inspire you. Other than that, if you want to find more original plot ideas, reading classic literature, watching movies or reading history is quite effective.

Talking ideas and plotbunnies with others are probably most effective, though, if you are not a particularily creative person. It makes the bunnies breed like nothing else!

** I've seen an excellent profile from a ff.net author who primarily writes Pokemon stories with extremely helpful writing advice. I don't read any stories from that fandom, and I've neglected to bookmark it. Perhaps someone else can help me out with a link if they know the user I'm talking about.

How much do you plan your stories out ahead of time? Do you outline or just write when inspiration strikes? I find that outlining the themes and settings I want to use helps set the pace and tone of the conversations and interactions throughout my story. If you're tired of writing short synopses, then there are other things to do to improve your story such as editing previously published chapters or writing detailed character profiles.

If you aren't feeling it, then don't force it. Good luck!

** Just read really good stories, like AQ, or read legit books (ones that are good, that is). You'll get ideas galore.
