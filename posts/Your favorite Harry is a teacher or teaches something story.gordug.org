I love the idea of Harry teaching. Rather he teaches Aurors, he teaches Defense, or he teaches something else entirely. In canon he's seen as a pretty good teacher, and after the Death Eaters are placed in Azkaban I could see him being done with fighting dark witches and wizards. Or even him changing his mind in general about being an Auror.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual et cetra. (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing).

Can be on any site, anyone can be the main character, can be any length, Harry more powerful or more smarter than in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable, like he worked for it.

Can be canon or non canon with the rest of the story, can be an older or newer story.

Would rather not have Weasley bashing, if at all possible.

Would like for it to be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Edit: Since someone made a comment: I am fine with time travel and/or traveling to another AU stories.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

  At twenty-five, Harry Potter is at a crossroads in his life. He's achieved his dream of being an Auror, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, and with one child and another on the way, he's missing out on precious time with his family. But being an Auror is all he knows how to do - right? So he's in for a surprise when Professor McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, offers him a job as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ...
