*would you feel

I.e. "Moving back" the timeline, so that PS is set in 1961-62 instead of 1991-92. It would certainly alter events and characters.

E.g. Grindelwald vs Dumbledore would be changed to occur during WW1, instead of WW2. If we set things back by 30 years, Harry would be born in c. 1950.


** I wouldn't say many people outright dislike shifting the timeline. I think a lot of people strongly dislike pointless or silly change.

What often causes the dislike of time shifting are stories that change the timeline wholly, so they can have Harry listen to an ipod and the author can tell us how cool Harry is for listening to a certain song and what that says about him as a person. It is irritating when the timeline is moved just so the author can natter about their favourite band. I would also say that it's the same dislike of change that leads to people looking down at a lot of wandless magic fics. Any change that tells you more about the author than the characters is probably a bit hamfisted.

If you move the timeline for a good reason that adds to the story then go for it but the reasoning has to be clear. Trying to be too mysterious about why you've changed the timeline can lose readers, readers invest nothing in a fic, so they have nothing stopping them dropping it if they think it is stupid.

To make a sweeping generalisation, people dislike bad writing.

*** sometimes, you need to shift the timeline for crossovers, like for example with Stargate. The interesting and "setup" parts happen when Harry's still in school or extremely young, and if you wanna write about an adult Harry that joins the Stargate Program as part of the all-magical team, then you have to shift one of them. I actually prefer shifting Stargate into the future, because those characters don't have the extreme attachments to historical events.

*** The thing is that, because the series takes place almost entirely on the Wizarding side, the timeline on the Muggle side is almost completely irrelevant. Time-shifting things to enable the use of technology (standard caveat: as long as it's done well) can work, and a lot of crossovers almost require a time-shift.

*** I agree to an extent - but I can also see an argument for shifting the timeline if the author is more comfortable writing in a contemporary setting.

After all, the original series was just set in what was at the time the present - and, interestingly, I believe that it targeted a very different feel in the UK compared to abroad (IE, that it was meant to feel very 'real' in the UK, with a lot of familiar elements - and then abroad, a lot of that familiar culture aspect got rolled into the wizarding world).

What I mean by that is that if someone would rather not have to look up what was available in the 90s for muggles and just write them all with smart phones and the like, the Wizarding World is generally removed enough (and long lived enough) in relation to muggles to make shifting it back a few decades not a big deal in my book.

** Well, it takes more research and diligence to write a fic taking place in 1961 and prior, because most fanfic writers haven't grown up in that time period. They grew up in 21st century. And quite honestly, I don't want to read about Harry's texts and social media posts. The magic in the series is about meaningful connections and real-life adventures. Not to say that doesn't happen anymore but...that's not why the timeline is being bumped. Otherwise they'd just leave it in the 90s.

Personally, I'd read the heck out of a story that pushed back the timeline. All of my stories are set in pre-canon 1940s. But the reality is most readers aren't into that because they can't relate.

** I'm not sure if I would like it any more to be hoenst. What's the reason for the shift? Does it make the story better? What is the story you want to tell with that?

While the setting matters, what you do with it, matters more.

** What if you rewound it /way/ back? Like, before the statute of secrecy, before the muggles had steam power and during the early days of the British Empire? Or maybe even earlier still, perhaps shortly after the founding of Hogwarts itself. Maybe Slughorn learned potions from Salazar Slytherin himself? Maybe Dumbledore is Gryffindor's personal protege? You could do a lot with that.

** I wouldn't like either variant to be honest. If the marauder era is 1970s, the fic has to be set in that time because it's that time I want to read about. If I wanted to read about something in 1930s, I can pick up an original novel and do that. I think I'm just very picky when it comes to this. I can read time travel, but I strongly dislike time shifting.

** I feel awkward with both. In fact, I feel awkward if Harry Potter is crossed over with another piece of work and that piece of work has its timeline changed; I just hate time shifting, in general, though especially with Harry Potter.
