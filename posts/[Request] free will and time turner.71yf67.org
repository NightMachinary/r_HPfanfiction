Well... Is there a fic where harry, hermione, or albus have a philosophical thought about free will and its relation to time turner?


** Well considering that Time travelers are supposed to avoid their past selves at all costs and that people have killed their past selves i would imagine free will does exist. Havent seen such a fic though. Philosophical debates and Harry Potter fanfics rarely go together, which is a shame.
