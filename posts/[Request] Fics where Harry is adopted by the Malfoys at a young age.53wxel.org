Looking for good (ideally complete or consistently updated) stories where Harry is adopted/taken in by the Malfoys...and essentially grows up as part of the family.

I read one awhile back where Lucius took him in because he had heard of the abuse the Dursleys put him through...and it was so good!!...but abandoned. Le sigh.

Thanks in advance!

Edit: Also, a fic where the Malfoys are not written as abusive or jerks to each other.

  Dudley Dursley is just a normal boy, not like his freak cousin. At least that's what he thought. Turns out he has magic too, and that revelation is going to change everything for his entire family.

  The Dursleys have never wanted Harry, so when he fortuitously stumbles across a book on Wizard Family Trees, he writes a letter, hoping to find another family to take him in, hopefully one that won't mind when he does 'freaky' stuff....WIP

** If you don't mind Drarry, there is this really amazing fic where Harry is adopted by the Malfoys after they discover he is being abused by the Dursleys. Draco and Harry are 'soulmates' but their relationship is purely platonic for most of the fic. Lucius and Narcissa are sweet and loving parents as well. linkffn(5254833)
