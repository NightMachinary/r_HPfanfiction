Hey there. I'm searching for a fiction where Harry goes to Ginny's home to see her or something like that, only he is attacked by the Bill and Charlie and Harry suffers a panic attack and wonders why does he let them, being younger, take him down (or is angry, no wondering why, don't remember)...they also don't know him and ask themselves who would gift Ginny a necklace (that's what I think it was)...


** That sounds like it could be from /Dodging Prison, Stealing Witches/...

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
