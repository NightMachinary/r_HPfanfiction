In any capacity really. I love dimension travel where it's â€˜orphan Harry reunites with Lily and James' or they never died or time travel or any thing else fanfix writers have thought of!


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11278299/1/]]

Hindsight

One of Voldemort' plans goes awry. Lily and James literally crawl out of their own graves and immediately look for their baby. Except they've kinda maybe been dead for ten years and it's a little awkward.

** I'm currently reading How Like Home by waitingondaisies. Harry travels to an AU where his parents are alive. They have their own Harry in that universe, too, but both Harrys get along well with each other. It's a very fluffy story, but not yet finished (still being updated, though).

  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. Instead, he finds nothing at all. When he wakes up, he is informed by Unspeakables that he is from an alternate universe. Thanks to his uncanny resemblance to his counterpart, Harry is readily recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James Potter. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe. Now, Harry must adapt to life with loving parents in a peaceful world.

** I'll recommend linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) once again, then :). Description copied from TVTropes:

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Tom Riddle launched a political party instead of a war, Harriett Potter grew up with both of her parents and all of the Marauders alive --- but as a half-blood, she isn't allowed to attend Hogwarts, and worse restrictions are coming. She isn't going to let that stop her from getting a world-class Potions education under Professor Snape, though, and so she plots with her pure-blooded cousin Arcturus Black to swap identities during the school year. Too bad that they didn't realise how outstanding she could really be, and how much attention "Rigel Black" would attract from those who would use or control "him" --- especially Thomas Riddle himself.

#+begin_quote
  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** One fanfic I will never NOT recommend is linkffn(12317784) which involves time travel and a relationship between Harry and Bellatrix. This story is incredibly well written in my opinion and I really love the dynamics between all the characters.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
