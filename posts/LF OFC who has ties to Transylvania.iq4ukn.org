:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read the fic about a year ago and have been looking for the past few weeks to read it again but can't seem to locate it. It has an OFC whose family owns a fire whiskey company and helps the Order with gaining allies in the Transylvania area as she knows werewolves from that area. I think she also went to Durmstrang for a bit and dated a few people there before ending up at Hogwarts during the TriWizard Tournament.

Thanks in advance for any help!
