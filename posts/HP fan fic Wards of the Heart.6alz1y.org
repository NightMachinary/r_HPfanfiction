Hey everyone, my wife is currently writing her first fan fiction. She has wanted to put one out there for years , but was scared. I finally convinced her to give it a try. She's looking for reviews and really eager to improve. It's a harry potter fan fiction that's four chapters long and she is putting out more content for it every few days. Feel free to check it out and provide feed back :) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12475448/1/Wards-of-the-Heart]]


** Might post it to [[/r/HPfanfiction]] for a more targeted group.
