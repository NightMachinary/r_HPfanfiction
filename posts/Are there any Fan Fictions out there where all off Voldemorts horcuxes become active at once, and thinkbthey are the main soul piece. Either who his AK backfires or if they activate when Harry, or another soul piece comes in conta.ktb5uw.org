** It isn't confirmed yet, but there's the Dark Lord, Marvolo Gaunt, and Professor Tom Slytherin all wreaking havoc in the Wizarding World. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16940712/chapters/69873198]])

There is a fem, Slytherin Harry but she's still very canon. (Not the story, the character)

  They sought her out for conversation sometimes, cornering her in the garden or at the park, not that they ever had much to say. Really, Harriet thought snakes were rather dull.---------Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.
