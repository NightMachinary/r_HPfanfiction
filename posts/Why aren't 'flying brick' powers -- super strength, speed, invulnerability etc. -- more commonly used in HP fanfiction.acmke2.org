Especially in OP or super-powered fics. I get it; Harry Potter is a /magic/-based series! Still, you would think that authors would want their OP main characters to have the standard OP power-set, e.g. running and reacting at speed exceeding mach 10, or lifting 1 million tonnes with relative ease. What if said powers came from the magic of the user? Would it not be interesting for the MC to not rely on magic, instead having powers like Superman?

100 stunning spells? -- Did you feel a breeze?

5 powerful reductos? -- Nice try.

Crucio? -- Barely tickles.

Avada Kedavra? -- OK, that one hurt quite a bit.

Of course, even having such powers should present different obstacles. No magic means no access to magically-locked areas. Just because you can fly doesn't mean that you can escape the maze. Maybe ancient magical relics can pierce through their skin or maybe there are non-physical obstacles to being so OP, i.e. alienation of classmates.


** The biggest issue I see is that none of that is necessity for a typical story. So then you have to picture what kind of story that stuff would fit into, and the further you go, the less the story feels like an HP story, and more like a Worm story. At some point, it just becomes a random character with the name Harry Potter attached, and that's not very satisfying.

*** Ironic, considering Worm's rep is based on how innovative it is with avoiding pure Flying Brick types.

*** Yeah, you can do most of that with magic already, and the charm of HP is that you have to use a wand (or be supremely skilled to do wandless magic, far more than in your average fanfic). Why would you want super strength when the levitation charm is canon?

You are basically asking why people buy performance cars if you can tune a Supra to 2000 HP. It is doable, but the other options are usually seen as more attractive by most.

** Indeed I would be interested in a fic like this. I read some but they were incomplete and I don't remember their title.

The most recent I read had Harry having stronger bones and skin but in the end it was barely used in the story unfortunately (just Harry not dying after taking a hit from the troll in 1st year). It was in Harry Potter and the Children of Change (unfortunately abandoned) linkffn(6764665). He still got an invulerability to AK.

[EDIT] The also abandoned Invincible from Kathryn518 (a shame she never finished any story) linkffn(11779002) had a similar idea with Harry getting stronger from what hurt him (Doomsday style).

  The night in the graveyard, produces a very different result as Harry discovers things he didn't know about his heritage. Before he only had a castle, now he has a whole wide world to get himself in trouble. At least he has his responsible godfather along for the ride. That should help... right? Or not.

*** Well the thing about "Invincible" is that unless you know A LOT about the DC verse casual readers will get very confused. And it is tiresome to read than her other stories. linkffn(12101842) written byy her is actually quite good.

** My guess is that authors generally enjoy Harry Potter for the possibilities of its world and magic system. People wouldn't be so incredulous, even years after the fact, about Harry's Expelliarmus obsession unless they wanted to see what someone using their magic in more interesting and varied ways would look like.

To add to that, things like the Killing Curse are absolute killers. Even Superman would die if hit with one. Since it's the primary weapon of the antagonists, it means that other defenses need to be cooked up, which means that other routes to OP/super-poweredness are favored.

*** But if you're going for a superhero-esque route to badassery, then the killing curse simply encourages dodging, and by extension, Flash-type powers. (Speaking of which, there was one where Ron became Kid Flash and it was amazing.) Or, what happens if the killing curse strikes someone/something who is not alive (i.e. a metal man, a litch, the jar of a brain-in-a-jar type, or just /full body armor/)?

Even flying brick types have some advantages, simply because of their sheer mobility and durability to everything but an AK to the noggin.

**** Well, sure, but 'Harry was faster than the curses' isn't very interesting to read. It's not impossible to /make/ it interesting to read, but one of the reasons people criticized the movies was that it always wound up being a DBZ-esque beam war, and at their most basic level, being hypercompetent with some niche magic gives the readers something more interesting to take in than raw physical superiority.
