After reading the most recent chapter of [[/u/TE7]] 's Limpieza de Sangre, I began to think; who is more powerful? Emily Riddle/Price or Tom RIddle as we know him in canon? Emily seems to be much more cunning than Tom Riddle. That being said, she shows an amount of restraint (on occasion) that Tom is incapable of showing which could arguably make him more dangerous than her,

What do you all think?


** One of the biggest differences is that Tom Riddle's followers are motivated almost solely through fear. Emily's follow her through love and admiration. Malfoy deserted Tom as soon as he could, but Emily's stay with her through everything - Ch 30 of LDS sees Avery obeying her final request after her death, and he respects her so much he freely admits he wouldn't be able to beat Harry because she'd taught him directly.

A fight between the two individuals might be fairly even, but between the two groups, Emily's forces would win every time.

I'm obviously biased but I think Emily would wipe the floor with Tom. Tom would underestimate her and probably think she was a weak and stupid girl and call her Riddle.

And Emily would annihilate him. Tom is worried about Mortality. Emily is not. Emily is stubborn, willful, and incredibly determined. She is willing to sacrifice bits of herself to accomplish her goals, while Tom seems more worried about hiding anything away.

She also faced a great deal more adversity than we ever Tom having to deal with. And, despite being constantly beaten down, from repeated childhood rape to living in fear during the blitz, to getting her ass handed to her on a silver platter by Grindelwald, to losing her family after the war, Emily always got back up.

I don't think Tom had it in him to survive the same situations that Emily did. While 'magical power level' (ugh this isn't dragon ball Z...) they'd probably be quite even, I don't think Tom would have any idea how to counter the sheer determination, ability, and lack of fear Emily would display. I don't think Tom ever really had to fight someone of her caliber.

Tom's forces would defect to Emily's before the battle started.

How does that make him more dangerous than her? Between a predictable idiot who get easily taunted and a cunning patient women, Emily is way more dangerous.

*** I would generally agree, My thought was that a less stable person is unpredictable and will often do whatever it takes to achieve their goals. Emily appears to at least have more thought out motivations and perhahps more reservations about what she will do to achieve those goals than OG Voldemort who's motivations pretty much boil down to "I don't want to ever die lol XD"

** The issue with this is the fact that unless Emily made seven Horcruxes (I have not read the fic), it cannot be matched. Tom Riddle was deceptively cunning, ambitious, and immensely powerful. He pretty much controlled Britain before his defeat of a baby with +10 plot armour because it was a children's book.

Tom Riddle was the villain and was set up to lose. I mean, ever since Harry was born his life was absolutely pants. How can the two be compared unless they went through the same issue of being defeated during their peak of power and then unable to do anything because Harry “+10 plot armour” Potter? xD

*** He didn't control Britain in the first war. He never took over the Ministry back then.

**** He may have not, but having succeeded in being called the Darkest Lord and leaving an image so strong and horrifying on Britain that even years later people still fear uttering his name, to me thats as good as having captured the whole country in an embrace of fear and Horror.

***** That's still different than having control over it. Also, because I'm petty, Voldemort is the only Dark Lord as far as we know.

****** Ever heard Of Grindelward? Salazar? Emeric the Evil? And yes I mean Dark wizards, Voldemort was the only one called Lord because of his arrogance he called himself Lord. And despite Grindelward, Salazar and all the rest, he is still considered the most dangerous dark wizard of all time during both wars.

******* Yeah, they weren't Dark Lords. They were just Dark wizards. But it doesn't change the fact that he didn't have control over the country. The Ministry will still fighting back hard.

******** As if he was himself truly a Lord. But yeah, he didn't have utter control or real reign over it, he somehow controlled Britain through Fear. He made it acknowledge him, acknowledge his might, fear him and fear his very name, that is a form of control. But full control? That he never did, not even in the second war seeing as there always have been rebels and such. Control comes in many degrees and under many forms.
