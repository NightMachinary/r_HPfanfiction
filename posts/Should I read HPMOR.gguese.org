Title

Give me your thoughts on it, and why or why I shouldn't read it.

Thanks

**** Yes, they read only 1-3 and a lot of fanfiction, so the fic (excepting the rationalist philosophy) is more of an answer to common fanfiction tropes than to canon (there are a lot of blink and you'll miss it allusions to popular fics in the text). One effect of this is that they were under the impression that Snape and Lily were together at some point, not just friends (this was corrected soon after).

** It depends on what turns you off a fic honestly. It's well written although it gets weird/er/ by the end and it skips between ridiculously serious to just plain ridiculous quickly. It's very long, but it only spans a year, so there's too much character development for 11 year olds. For all it's flaws, the lack of bad imagery and grammar alone makes it better than a lot of the stuff you find in ff.net.

** It's remarkably free of typos for fanfiction, and it's free. There's no reason not to try it and see if you like it.

Just don't mistake it for a textbook on Mendelian genetics and you'll be fine. Also, be aware that this Harry is written as an unreliable narrator. He always thinks he's right, but that doesn't mean the author thinks he's right, or that the reader should.

** HPMOR is an adequately written screed for a poorly thought out philosophy, backed up with some very flawed science. There's tons equally or better written fics out there that aren't trying to convert you. Why waste your time?

*** Yes, the science itself is flawed. It doesn't need to be accurate: science in fiction is usually flawed to keep things simpler. That's not the point - you're not supposed to learn Mendelian genetics from a story. It's about the underlying concepts, like how the scientific method works - and those are described faithfully. And while I can't speak for everyone, I personally, did understand them better after reading HPMOR.

** Try it. If you don't like it, move on.

It's one of the best, most well-thought-through, well-developed, and just straight up entertaining HP fics I've ever read.

It's also oddly paced, preachy, and takes frequent long digressions.

If you don't mind the latter, as I do not, the former more than makes up for it with sheer awesomeness. But if they're deal-breakers, or if the characters just don't work for you - as is the case with a great many people - then it would be better to not force your way through it.

*** This. Concept wise it's great, but it often tries to be too clever and had some poorly executed nerd culture references.

** I absolutely devoured the first half of that fic, but at a certain point it lost its luster for me. I really enjoyed the worldbuilding and interactions of the characters, and the concepts discussed were really interesting, but it got too plot-oriented for me at a certain point, which I felt took away from what I enjoyed about the fic. It's definitely worth a shot, though, and you might enjoy the things I disliked about it. It has its flaws, but it's well-written, engaging, and often very funny.

** It's one of the fics that are worth a damn. A lot of negative reviews are by people who completely misread what it's trying to be. And many people just can't relate to the mindset of the characters. So you might not like it.
