Bobmin have uploaded the final chapters of Beneath Sovereign Skies, at least to their yahoo group. It turns out Bob has had lung cancer and they found spots on his brain and now his bones.

  I have uploaded the remaining chapters to the story. In a day or two I'll post a message giving a brief synopsis of what I had planned.

  I wish I could have finished this for everyone. Since I posted my original message the only news I've had is bad news. First lung cancer, then they found spots on my brain resulting in radiation treatments. Finally I fell getting into the tub and hurt my hip. X-rays of the hip showed no fracture thank god, but they did find a spot on the bone which is now also scheduled for radiation treatment.

  If I sound depressed, it's because I am. It seems like I haven't been able to catch a break at all this past month.

  A lot of people have sent me messages of support and I do appreciate them even if I don't reply to each one.

  Enjoy those final chapters, I just wish there was more of them.

*** The survival rate of metastasized cancer (cancer that spread from its point of origin) is 4%. Survival rate of bone and brain cancer are individually in the teens. Sad, but not much of a fight at this point.

*** I'll see if I can get them posted here. He included 2 chapters and then a broad summary of how he had planned the story. I haven't had a chance to read it yet, I only read the message this morning before heading into work

**** Ok, thanks. I left the group over a year ago because of how toxic the environment there was (and Bob & Alex didn't help!)
