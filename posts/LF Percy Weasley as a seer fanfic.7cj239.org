A while ago, I read a fanfic where Percy was having visions, and was in the ministry to prevent them, like last year. He made a contract with the founders portraits or something? I don't know what exactly it was, but I can't find it, and that's kind of an issue


** Oh I just read this one, it's in archive of our own not ff.

The meaning of ... Book series.

Percy as a seer starts in either book 2 or 3. Book 1 is Snape and lupin care for Harry and book 2 starts as Harry in Hogwarts.
