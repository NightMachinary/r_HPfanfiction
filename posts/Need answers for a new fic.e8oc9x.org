Ok so an idea struck me and I've started planning out.

It's one of those Sirius escapes Azkaban (or is rescued as he is in this case) early and raises Harry. I wanted to involve Marlene McKinnon somehow but not as a love interest - at least not for Sirius. Remus would be in it as well and so would Amelia and Susan Bones. They pick up Hermione somewhere along the way....yada yada yada.

I want them to have a family dynamic but I'm feeling indecisive. I'd like to point out how I'd characterise Marlene though because she's often done really badly in fics, describing her as a female Sirius with only his bad qualities. She's a Mary Sue, in Gryffindor and Lily's best friend. Not going to happen here.

I want to characterise her as kind of having her head in the clouds (lIke a very toned down aspect of Luna), being smart but not really smart and being careful with work bu5 not super powerful. All in all, very average. However she has to be at least somewhat close to the marauders to trust Remus when he tells her Sirius is innocent and that they need to break him out so help with that would be appreciated!

Also I need relationships. Out of the four adult characters I've mentioned (and anyone else, though preferably not an OC, characters with no canon names are fine) who do you ship and why should it be in the fic? Gay is fine! I kind of want Marlene to be single but I'm open to anything except Gen (Remus/Tonks is fine though because she‘lol be older than canon in this.....she and her mom will be in the ‘family' too because....I'm pathetic)


** Looks interesting! I'm always an advocate for more f/f in HP fics since it's rare for primary or secondary characters. I'm one of the people that ship Remus/Sirius but it can also be written as a close platonic relationship.

Some things to think about: What are the state of werewolf laws and does Remus have a wizarding/muggle job? Maybe Remus is training to be healer since he's interested in treating the affects of dark creatures (eg chocolate for dementors) Does Sirius or is he Harry's primary caregiver? What is Marlene's job? Common fanon options are Healer/auror/something else ministry.

Think about whether they would have been friends with Marlene or Amelia at school or not, and if not, how they got to know each other - with the most straightforward option being through work. Though if Marlene is a healer then she could be patching up Auror Amelia, or otherwise tangentially meeting each other.

Think about giving them complimentary skill sets, where they each have different areas of focus, abilities and attitudes to life.

*** Thank you so much. I'll think it through. I like the idea of Marlene being a healer and meeting Amelia through that. I think I'll add that. Remus/Sirius is always good so that's definitely an option.

**** I enjoy brainstorming ideas like this :) Another thought - where do they go for nights out? Is there another more hipster/youth wizard enclave or just nightclub? Perhaps in another city like Brighton (known as the unofficial gay capital of the UK)

**** I always liked the 'Person gets hurt during a fight (perhaps Amelia got injured at Diagon Alley in the first war?) and befriends the off-duty medical trainee who tries to help the wounded and won't leave when the battle swells again' trope. That might be an interesting meeting for them.

Regarding Sirius and Remus, I'd second the advocate for their relationship, but you don't have to decide early - there's a great saying that you're only really best friends with someone if there's a semi-seriously taken rumour that you're secretly involved. Could be fun to have them play around with that in the beginning until Harry/some other romantic interest for one of them confronts them to demand a straight (heh, pun) answer. Either way, you still write them like they're dating, you just don't have to decide until that question is asked. :)

Regarding Marlene meeting Remus, I basically just second everything PurpleMurex said. They covered the range pretty darn nicely. Something I saw once that was interesting was two magicals (I forget who, precisely, but they were of the adult Marauders-Generation get) meeting at the same Muggle therapist - this fic didn't use the fanon invention of mind-healers. Either that or just have it be something utterly inane like they met at the bank or while waiting for a floo (think How I Met Your Mother cast meeting the Mother-style).

Both could be fun. :D

Either way, I look forward to seeing this! I hope you post a self-promotion tag-post when you upload it. :)

** Sounds interesting, since she was in the original Order of the Phoenix, Dumbles may have given her a spot at Hogwarts if she lived, she had to have been a talented witch.
