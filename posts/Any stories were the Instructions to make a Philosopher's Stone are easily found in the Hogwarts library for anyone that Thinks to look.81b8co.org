Like a world were after making the Philosopher's Stone Flame put a how to guide in the Hogwarts library(and other magical Libarys) that was spelled so you couldn't tell anyone about it but it was there for anyone who went looking for it and most people Don't find it because they don't even think to look before they have graduated Hogwarts and have lost access to the Hogwarts library and by the time they come back and teachers they don't even think to look because it would not even cross there mind that the instruction on how to make it would be there?

Maybe the Alchemy Class at Hogwarts fell out of Use because the Philosopher's Stone the pinnacle of Alchemy has been reached. and then because the book was spelled so you could not tell other people about it once you had found it people slowly lost interest in Alchemy


** My head Canon is that it is well known how to create one, just that Flamel is the only one skilled enough to successfully make it.

I mean the stone has been around for hundreds of years, surely someone else would have stumbled across how to make one in that time.

I like to think of Felix Filicius in the same vein of thought. It's devilishly tricky to brew but also requires luck (as an ingredient of sorts), hence it's rarity.

*** Gives me this idea.

"The Stone is unique, Dumbledore. Do not take those words to mean little. Uniqueness is one of it's properties. Should another alchemist try using my method, even should they do it perfectly, they will fail. There can only be one Sorcerer's Stone. If the original is destroyed then it could be remade elsewhere which is why I cannot simply break it as you ask. Now you know why I cared so little when my research was illegally publicized. There was never any fear that something would come of it."

**** Cool idea, a conceptually unique magical item.

I just think that he would still care, a lot, about whether or not his work was publicized.

If people know it's unique they'll try very hard to destroy his and make their own.

** Considering it was made in the 14th century and if the rules of alchemy holds true in the hp universe (Equivalent Exchange) then it wouldn't surprise me if one of the ingredients is a few human souls.

immortality for more than one person + the ability to transmute gold would require quite the sacrifice IMO.

Actually makes me wonder how many people one stone could sustain with eternal life. We know Flamel shared it with his wife, but how many more could he do? Did he design it with his wife in mind?

**** Well, it fits the rules of that universe. It can bring the dead back to life. It's only natural that the cost of creating it would be really high.

That may not fit the tone of the HP universe though.
