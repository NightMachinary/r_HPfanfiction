Okay so I'm a fan of some good old bashing with reason. But I'm sorry if Dumbledore (or another character) fucked up my life like he did in some of those fics, I would run a knife through the bastard. Instead the authors lock themselves in a childish game of 'pranks' which lets be honest is the most overused thing in fanfiction.

(Behind eyes as orbs, ect )

I would much rather read a story about plots and trying to kill the opposition than changing bearded Hitler's hair purple.


** Part of it is that in most of those fics, the acts of the antagonists are incredibly dumb/simplistic. To me, that implies that the author is either not taking it seriously, or isn't thinking through it well.

For instance, manipulative Dumbledores /should/ be a fairly terrifying threat, when written correctly. Instead, they're bumbling fools - and we're left to wonder /how/ exactly they got all the power they did.

Combine the desire to keep having that antagonist relation (eg, to be able to keep bashing them), and you can't have a 'competent/powerful' Harry try to kill them - because with how dumb they invariably are, he should be able to take them out in a heartbeat. And then you won't have the character you're bashing anymore! ;)

** Bearded Hitler in HP... I thought that Voldemort was clean-shaven ( or more probably, he was incapable of growing a beard).

** The guy is the most powerful wizard in the world. If he were that easy to kill Voldemort would've done it ages ago. Unless the main character is evil or Dumbledore is evil instead of greater-good, killing him seems like a lot of effort for little reward.

** The guy is one of the most respected wizards in the world... if you run a knife through him then that's a one-way trip to Azkaban regardless of your excuse. Better to prank him and slowly ruin his image.

*** Wizards are virtually brain-dead so I'm sure it would be easy to kill him and get away with it. I'm more wondering why pranking is even suggested. It just ridiculous.

** Start reading those darker bashing fics, almost every dark bash fic I read has the bashed character dying in some horrible way.

** I haven't actually found a fic yet, in which Dumbledore is the equivalent to Hitler and he gets pranked... I think that most people who write about mass-murder and genocide generally write pretty serious stories. If you want to say that you didn't mean mass-murder and genocide as evil!Dumbledore's crimes, it would probably be a sensible idea not to compare him to Hitler...
