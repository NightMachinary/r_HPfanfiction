** The first time I got a really long, detailed review from someone appreciating the subtle touches I'd put into my story.

Remembering that high is why I still write.

Oh- you meant a /scene/! Too many to choose from.

** The 'Ron turns into giant canary' scene from Harry Potter and the Champions Champion. At several points in that story I laughed my ass off, but I couldn't breath properly for several minutes after that scene.

'Starting immediately after that this day, dragon researchers spent years trying to figure out what exactly about a five and a half foot tall yellow canary-looking creature causes Hungarian Horntail dragons to go absolutely berserk. The only thing that they could determine was there used to be some yellow creature similar in size that was the mortal enemy of the Horntail and the urge to kill it was implanted into its genetic makeup, overwhelming all other instincts.'

** Let's see... (Spoilers, obviously, though I've tried to be fairly vague about them.)

Ron and Hermione finding Merlin's tomb in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]], finding the heartwrenching words that Jasmine carved there.

The beginning of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]], where Harry has to make a tough call in the Chamber. Pretty much the gold standard for how to start a piece of fanfiction.

The Harry/Fleur interlude in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3920129/1/Sixth-Year-The-Steps-Toward-The-End][Sixth Year: The Steps Toward the End]]. It doesn't make them great people, but that's fine. Complicated characters are good. It's a stolen moment, really wonderfully written.

Hermione entering the library in Chapter 9 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/9/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]].

Harry seeing his reflection in the shop window in Chapter 10 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/10/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks]] and coming to a realization. One of the more beautifully written introspective moments in the fandom.

Alduin getting some resolution at the end of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/31/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]].

I just finished reading this one. One of the better pieces I've ever read. I agree with your remark about that scene being emotional. I think my other favorite moment was when Jasmine remarked about how boring it was to speak Modern English.

Harry is starting up the DA-equivalent. Moody is present, under a disillusionment charm because he is presumed dead. Harry says something to the effect of, "hm, what should our first lesson be?" Moody appears out of nowhere and shouts "CONSTANT VIGILANCE!"

It's also pretty awesome to see an update by a favorite author, find a new fic that's /actually good/, or stumble upon a finished story you started years ago.

** Two endings stick in mind: The end of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/20/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], when Harry looks into the mirror of Erised.

The other ending has Voldemort coming back as a ghost. Since I've only seen it in the one story, I found it unique. Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of the story.
