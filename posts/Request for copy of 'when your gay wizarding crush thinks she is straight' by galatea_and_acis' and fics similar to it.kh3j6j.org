Two part question again. First, does anyone have a copy of 'when your gay wizarding crush thinks she is straight' by galatea_and_acis? It seems to have been deleted, but I really wanna read it again. Link below.

LINK - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24286036/chapters/66426745]]

Second, does anyone have any similar fics, specifically covering that kind of 'self-exploration' of sexuality? Which sounds way more like masturbating than I meant it, so to clarify - I mean a character realising they might be not-straight (and actually exploring the development of that insight). Double points if the story really focuses or delves into that kind of identity exploration. :)

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).
