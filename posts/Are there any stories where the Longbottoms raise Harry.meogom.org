I wondered if anybody knows of any (good) stories where Harry is raised by the Longbottoms? With Alice as his godmother, and the attack on them not happening until after the one on the Potters, there would have been a possibility for Alice to be demanding custody of Harry.

I've never seen a story going down that road though, and I've been reading HP fics for YEARS. So if anybody has any recommendations for ones along those lines that would be great!


** I have one planned out, but haven't started. From my discord server:

To Speak Without Words - Healer!Harry, AU Childhood UNPUBLISHED, Planning Stages

The morning of November 2, 1981, Alice dispatched her mother-in-law to bring back her godson at all costs, leveraging the full power and influence of the Longbottom name. Later that same day, a vicious attack and prolonged torture by rogue Death Eaters left Frank and Alice completely physically disabled; their minds are intact, just unable to communicate. Harry and Neville, raised together by the Dowager Longbottom and two invalids only able to communicate through legilimency, must struggle with resentment, jealousy, expectations, and what it means to belong.

** Part of the lack of them could be that Alice Longbottom being his godmother isn't true. It's just a common thing for fanfiction authors to add, particularly when they're trying to give Neville a reason to be a closer friend to Harry. Harry didn't actually have a godmother.

*** To be fair, it's usually customary to have both. It used to be way back when that you'd have two godmothers and one godfather if a girl and two godfathers and one godmother if a boy, but that went out of use.

It's most likely as it never was mentioned in the series, that Harry's godmother, presuming they followed standard stuff, was killed in the war.

**** Oh, it absolutely is customary to have both. You're correct that it was never mentioned in the series, but JK Rowling has said in an interview that he didn't have one.

The “Alice Longbottom is Harry's godmother” being considered a fact is a pet peeve of mine, since there's no evidence to support that they were friends other than both of them being in the Order.

***** Oh, definitely. I rather like the idea of a godmother in fanfic, but Alice is to my mind a bad choice unless you're really wanting to do something with Neville, what with her being hospitalized and unresponsive.

Any number of possibilities are better if you want to play up the Godmother angle.

I wasn't aware that Rowling said he hadn't had one. That's kind of odd to me, but hey, that's what fanfic is for. :)
