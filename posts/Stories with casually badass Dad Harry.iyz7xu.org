Fics where Harry is casually badass Dad like That universe over here on ao3.


** The only time I've really seen this was in a Bash!Fic on FanficAuthors where Harry had gone to America until Hogwarts kidnapped his child for 'reasons'. I can't remember the name, but it was a relatively entertaining B-Movie of a Fic.

** *Double Back* - linkao3(19267840)\\
After a time travel /accident,/ Harry angsts for a week before he realizes he can change things. He promptly apparates to Privet drive and punches Vernon in the face. YOINK.

He has a thing for punching people in the face.

OH! And people think he's James potter.

He's a badass Dad to Little Harry, Susan, and Daphne. Oh yeah, SURPRISE! Daphne isn't the romance target.

Warning: this fic has some pureblood culture. And by that, I mean political marriage including concubine contracts and whatnot.

#+begin_quote
  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Changing time is difficult though, and the more changes he makes, the less predictable the world turns out to be. Though now maybe he actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well.

** Define 'casually badass'.

​

No, never mind. A little ditty I've been playing with staring Harry's middle child, Eric. A squib, Eric does the best he can while being a member of the most famous family in the world.

His dad is Harry, (of course,) his mom is the absolute ruler of an alternate dimension.

You don't want to know what happened to the kid who stole Eric's milk money in primary school.

​

Eric looked around the crowded pub, hoping against hope that he might meet someone tonight.  He like the anonymous nature of pubs in Muggle Britain, no one knew his family name, or of his father's fame, and even fewer cared.

He spotted her arm before he noticed the woman herself.  Specifically, he spotted the intricate tattoos on her left forearm as she signaled the bartender for a drink.  His interest piqued, he made his way to her side and drew breath to start the conversation.

"No," she said.

Eric blinked.  He hadn't said a word, she had not looked at him, and there was no mirror behind the bar to offer his reflection for her evaluation.

"No, Eric Potter," she said, rotating on the barstools swivel to face him.  "You cannot buy me a drink.  Were I to accept, we would follow that with three dates, each more disappointing than the last, ending with both of us walking away counting our blessings.  You would never make it to second base.  The Universe tells me that even first base is unlikely, which is odd considering how much I enjoy it."

"The universe tells you?" Eric repeated.  "You're a seer?"

"I am," she acknowledged.  "If you remain in the pub, after leaving me, you will approach the blonde with the upgraded breasts," she said nodding toward a pair of young women sitting at a small table, a tiny brunette and a most amazing blonde who was almost falling out of her dress.  "She will give you a false phone number.  Should you remain after that, you will approach the Redhead sitting next to the DJ stand.  She will take you out to her car, where you will make it to 2nd base, before her husband pulls you from the car and beats you bloody.  It is a game they play, as he cannot achieve an erection without 'discovering' his wife with another man."

"Bloody hell," Eric breathed.

"Your best option is to go home and try again another night," 

---ooo000ooo---

"Morn' Bahs," the hulking troll said.

"Hmph," Eric grunted as he made his way to the coffee maker, while reaching for his favorite mug before filling it with the life-giving caffeine and taking a long pull.

"Good morning, Klathtic," Eric said after swallowing.  "Ready for another wonderful day?"

"No fem laast nite?" Klathtic asked sympathetically.

"No, just my normal luck," Eric sighed.  "You?"

"Four," Klathtic shrugged.  "Slow nite.  Biker gang want to throw down, den dere women treat Klathic nice."

That figured, Eric sighed to himself.  A troll's slow night was better than anything he had ever had.

"Be in bak," Klathtic called, "Num six Steam Press unna pressure, need look at that."

"Okay," Eric agreed.  "Yell if you need help."

Alone in the front of the store, Eric busied himself straightening up until the bell over the door rang.  He looked up to find six figures in black robes and white ivory masks entering.

"Pickup up or dropping off?" he asked helpfully.

"You are behind in your tribute!" the leader of the group rasped.

"Tribute?" Eric asked curiously.  "I got the note that was tacked to the door last week and thought it was someone's idea of a joke.  What Dark Lord do you lot work for?"

The utter lack of concern of the store owner's response surprised the minor horde of minions enough so that one of them actually answered.

"We serve the Dark Lord Fol Dacryoma!" he declared.

"Fol Dac..." Eric's eyebrows rose toward his hairline.  "Draco is at this, again?  Didn't he learn the first half dozen times? Or... did you lot screw up something he thought was important?"

Again, the minions were taken aback.  "We might have accidently walked in while he was playing with his dolls," the talkative minions supplied.

"Action figures," the leader corrected, "Our Lord was plotting an attack, using the action figures as place holders for his victims."

"Yeah, that sounds like Draco," Eric nodded.  "Listen lads, you don't want to be trying to rob this place, or even express your thoughts on how it would be unfortunate if something were to happen to my place of business.  Did Draco mention my name?"

"No," the leader admitted.

"It's Eric Potter," Eric said with a wry grin.  "And yeah, my dad is Harry Potter.  Draco been trying and failing to have a dick measuring contest with Dad since they were in school together."

"Oh, Merlin!" the talkative minion whined.  "The Dark Lord is trying to get us killed."

"No, nothing like that," Eric disagreed.  "Dad hasn't killed anyone since the Voldemort war.  What he does when he finds someone who needs to be punished, is he seduces and bangs your wives and girlfriends.  In front of you."

"Oh, is that all?" the talkative minion sighed in relief.

"No wife or girlfriend then?" Eric asked.  "Sorry to let you know that in that eventuality, Dad's been known to do mums.  The first time he did a mum was during Draco's first attempt at being a Dark Lord.  In all honesty, I think Narcissa keeps putting Draco up to it, because she wanted a return bout after dad put Lucius' own attempt at being a Dark Lord down."

"Oh my god," the Minion's leader said as he removed the mask from his face, looking a bit ill.  "My wife encouraged me to lead this mission."

"Yeah, the word has gotten around among the wives and girlfriends of various dark groups," Eric nodded.  "And some mothers.  My understanding is that when they're looking for a bit is the other, they push their men into attacking a Potter."

"Oh, Merlin, oh, Merlin, oh, Merlin," the talkative minion babbled.  "I've got to find a new job.  With someone who isn't going to get my Mom molested."

"Hey, Dad doesn't molest anyone," Eric protested.  "He romances.  He seduces.  He takes them out to dinner and a show, serves champagne, and just generally makes a major production of it.  The ladies really appreciate it.  Just ask Narcissa and Astoria Malfoy."

"If you're serious about a new job," Eric continued, "the two corkboards on either side of the door have available listings.  The blue board is for heroes, the red board for Dark Forces.  Dark Lady Pendha was in just yesterday looking for young healthy applicants for her dark legions."

The middle Potter child couldn't help but smile when the minions crowded around the Help Wanted boards.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter.
