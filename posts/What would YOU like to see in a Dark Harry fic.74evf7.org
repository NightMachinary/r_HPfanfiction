Just as it says, what would you like to see in a Dark Harry fic? What is something you always expect to be done...but no one ever seems to do it? What is one thing you'd wish people would do differently when doing a Dark Harry fic?

I'm asking because I'm currently writing one, and i'd like to know what pitfalls I should avoid.


** I've never seen the attraction to the Dark Harry stuff but the things that annoyed me most about the ones I've tried to read are generally about justification.

A simple question you have to answer in your planning is if dark magic makes you a bad person? Seeing as all of the Dark magic we see is violent and nasty I would have to say yes myself. Perhaps there is even an element of the dark magic that makes you worse as a person. The follow up to that is what would make Harry resort to that?

When would Harry Potter resort to becoming what he hates? I honestly don't like the idea of a dark raised Harry mainly because they've all been awful and the Death Eaters who do awful things are shown as being misunderstood. Maybe there is a case to be made that muggles and muggleborns might be having some negative influence on magic and the magical world but I think we could all agree even if that was true the Death Eaters are not the right way to go about dealing with it. That gives you a canon Harry and something that makes him give up on his own beliefs.

A quest for vengeance perhaps, one he knows is wrong but he wants to hurt them in retaliation so much. Perhaps his surviving friends are trying to stop him before he goes too far and if he does they want to put him down leading to a three-way conflict.

Harry is ill or cursed and has a limited time left and he knows it. Knowing he won't be alive to deal with the repercussions of his actions might be enough for him to stop caring about right or wrong and just wants to get the job done.

Harry is tortured into using dark magic and whatever corrupting influences it might have he can feel. Even after he escapes/breaks out he feels it and it begs for more. Filled with hatred of himself and of those that did this to him he channels that hatred into a downward spiral as he resorts to darker and darker methods of filling that desire.

Harry believes in knowing your enemy, knowing what they are capable of. When the others find out what he's been dabbling in they shun him and treat him like a leper. Without the guiding influences of his life and filled with self-loathing at what he allowed to happen the strikes out.

** My takes:

1. Dark Harry doesn't have to use dark magic. Dark magic is a mean he might choose to gain tactical advantages, such as Avada Kedavra bypassing the shield charm. But there are other times when its use could mean strategic disadvantages, such as negative PR and loss of public support. I want to see dark Harry weighing his options and be smart about it.

2. Dark Harry should have a worthwhile goal, a goal readers can sympathize with. Dark Harry having a kick murdering people around is just another glorified serial killer and stupid. Dark Harry imitating or joining Voldemort is boring and uncreative. There are quite a few characters in our history who butchered millions, but are still respected and revered by people today, among them Genghis Khan, Caesar and Augustus, and Napoleon. You might want to know what they did right. Also, Chairman Mao had an uncanny ability to turn the general populace into his willing henchmen.

3. Killing is all but mandatory for dark Harry. In fact, war is about killing people, as general George Patton so 'wisely' put it: "The objective of war is not to die for your country (cause), but make the other bastards die for their country (cause)!" Don't go into overly complicated moral justifications for killing people, unless it's an in-story plot to convince formerly moralistic person like Hermione. "I want to win this war, because failure is not an option!" is enough.

4. It's expected that a dark Harry would resort to torture, and he would do it to gather intelligence, to carry out revenge, or to satisfy his sadistic urges. In canon, Voldemort often used Cruciatus to soften up his victims before hitting them with Legilimency or Imperius. That was exactly the same approach Harry did in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] after Veritaserum proved ineffective against the Lestrange brothers. Or he didn't even need to get his own hands dirty, but allowed his subordinates to run organizations that were engaged in systemic torture, murder, kidnapping, extortion, and sabotage, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]].

5. Dark Harry doesn't mean he should act arrogant, rude, and a total jerk to others. Too many fics seem to be written by edgy teenagers who completely fail to understand that politeness and subtlety will get someone a lot farther.

** I want a selfish fucking motivation. You know how fucking hard it is to find one of those? Every author is trying to make their Harry betrayed and bullied and oh so angsty well you know what? That shit is fucking stupid. I want an MC that says know what? Fuck dying I'm going to be immortal and I'll fucking kill the shit out of anyone who gets in between me and the prize. Hell, I don't even care if it's immortality, maybe it's taking over the fucking world because he wants power and just can't satisfy himself with Britain, maybe it's because he joined a cult and his god demands sacrifice. Regardless I am /so/ fucking done with these stupid cookie cutter angst-filled "dark" Harrys using their powers for good to fight evil manipulative Dumbledores who "brought their fate upon themselves" that people puts out that it's completely put me off trying to find good ones in the overflowing Marinas fucking Trench of nigh unreadable filth.

** I like fics that explore the idea that there's more to dark magic than just throwing around Killing Curses. Similarly, I want the story to be more than hurrdurr I throw around unforgivables, I'm a dark wizard! I want there to be a difference between someone who uses dark magic, and a dark wizard, and that it doesn't really have anything to do with good or evil, or taking the "easy" route.

You do have to be careful about the misunderstanding trope that we see a lot. Like, the idea that dark magic is just a category devised by the Ministry and that half the spells on the list aren't actually dark magic... that's sort of thing isn't necessary. It kind of goes with the Hermione trope where she's like a third year but knows that X&X spell is learned in the sixth year and there's NO WAY Harry could have learned it(!), similarly, this trope regularly involves her identifying random spells as dark magic. All I'm saying that that actual dark magic has to mean something and not just be a category on some spell list or a checkmark in a checkbox, though whether or not your character is trying to defeat the common (and likely incorrect) perception is up in the air.

Lastly, never use the phrase "light magic" or "light side"

** UndeadBBQ touched on it: the reasoning has to be solid.

I know some authors attempt to liken dark magic to drugs and showcase how its a "slippery slope" and people were "just experimenting" and "lost their way". No. That is weak bullshit, in my opinion, and while it might work as a justification for a tertiary character, if you use it for the protagonist, it will result in an extremely shitty premise. The descent should be deliberate, consuming, painful and character-encompassing.

Harry can't turn to dark magic "just because". The story has to showcase clearly that at the particular time period, there is demonstrably no other way for the protagonist to achieve some vital goal other than with dark magic (as far as he knows). Past that first use, you might demonstrate some kind of addictive component, but it's easy to fuck it up. Also you have to demonstrate clearly that cost such spells exact from the caster. (slowly diminishing empathy feels like a natural starting point here).

Kinda disjointed, but these are my thoughts.

** I want a Harry that agrees with Voldemort in spirit. Power is everything. Power to keep his friends safe, power to put down his enemies for good, power to do what he wants, when he wants. A kid that grew up in a neglectful household is going to have some pretty big issues concerning repression, self indulgence, lying... just about anything, really. Like, if you want /any/ kind of personality flaw built into Harry, the Dursley's is the place to get it. I want a Harry that glories in his power over Dudley. I want a righteous revenge that turns into something worse.

** The easiest way to justify a Harry, who uses dark magic, is the power differance between him (a schoolboy) an voldemort (an acomplished wizard). If you use a magic system, which explains dark magic as something, that requires a personal sacrifice but gives you something realy powerful in return, then it would sound quite reasonable to resort to it in desperate times. If your Harry for example fights a longer "war" against the death eaters, because he did not find (for example) the cup-horcrux, and he realy gets desperate, while around him everyone dies, it wouldn't seem to far fetched, that he would use more grizzy magic. The sacrifce could be for instance a slowly loss of any positive emotion, which would drive him even more in the dark direction. Also thinkable would be something like a petrification of thought structures, which in canon is actually verified in some way if you look at voldemort or bellatrix, who really suffer under a monofocal mindset. With this you can create a believable dark Harry, that is not just some kind of evil caricature. Also it would offer you a nice subplot surrounding minor charakters, who try to heal Harry from his obsession.

What you really shouldn't do is to build up some kind of dualistic world woth a "light" and a "dark" camp, who are born as "light" or "dark". Most storys, which do that give no explanation to that, other than: "You are dark. Your nature is dark. Now you have to use dark spells, and kill and torture everyone in your way." Its just boring. Fanfictions like that set a unexlained premise (your nature is dark), which fundamentaly means nothing. There is no reasoning and no decision, just a plain dogma. I really don't like stuff like that. Mostly with arguments like that, discussions don't take place, the worldview of the side the narrator benefits is allready declared as the only right and just way to look at the world. An that again is extremly lame. With that you would rob your own story huge potential.

** First off, I'd like for Harry to actually have a reason to go with his original character to use dark magic. So for example, he sacrifices his magical purity and moral high ground to save Hermione, or so that others he cares about don't have to use it. Maybe he needs to create a horcrux for the sole reason of saving a lot of people? Stuff like that.

Second comes the explanation and apology for Harry being an utter villainous dick. Killing is not ok. Full Stop. Torture is not ok. Full Stop. Rape is not ok. Full Stop. The moment the fic tries to justify those actions it goes into really awkward territory (and I say awkward because I give authors the benefit of doubt here and just assume they aren't psychopathic rapists). Anyway, its also important to notice that a character itself /can/ try to justify his actions. It has to be made very clear, though, that it is /the character/ that tries to justify it, not the author trying to find excuses for his readers so that they won't hate Harry.

I think its very important to be conscious about the moral depravity of characters using dark magic in the HP universe. There are some ridiculously evil people in that universe and the overarching trait they all share is that they excel in dark magic.

I also dislike it when Harry has this extreme power surge. Let Dark!Harry be Harry, just despicable. Meaning, he is capable of some great magic, but on a very "need to know" basis. He won't become a scholar just because he's wielding dark magic. Harry, if you keep him somewhat in character, will pick and choose through the evil books for a few spells with big impact. Hermione (for example) would be more the type to learn 4 different dark organ-removing curses. Harry doesn't bother with fancy. He just wants the other guy gone for good.

The rest is just typical writing advice. No Mary Sues. Side-characters with personality and agenda. No magical cores. You know... the usual.

****** Philosophy may have several.

But in any case, I just talked back because I can't stand comments that basically say "You're wrong, but I won't tell you why". I'm well aware that morality is /at best/ a glacially moving, semi-constant cultural concept and has, especially in its unsaid details, about as much forms as there are cultural groups on the planet. So, of course there are morality systems that provide some form of examples and reason for killing someone in special cases.

******* I don't know why you got downvoted. Killing is so very controversial and it's precisely why it's discussed so thoroughly in philosophy and psychology. The idea and symbolism of killing in all kind of field symbolize this well.

Can killing ever be justifiable? Yes it can. Self defense. But at what point does self defense justifies murder? At what points do we draw the line? And it's not clear either. Is killing ok when it comes to death penalty? Is it okay for self defense? What about anticipated self defense?

The problem that you arise is that justification do not happens when treating murder in self defense. Those are self justificating in most cases and do not need elaborated excuses to make the act even barely acceptable.

The problem is that the situation you describe, and which is present in most dark Harry, is the attempted justification of gratuitous, often times premeditated murder to levels that makes it barely humane. Incredible cruelty that is brushed off with little concern and even attempted to be passed as an acceptable outcome. So yeah I agree with you. If you want a psychopathic, sadist MC, at least dont try to justify his actions behind rose tinted glass. At best it diminish the impact of his actions and at worst it leave a vile taste in the mouth of the readers.

Also depends on where you'd ask. In most nations (if not all) killing in self-defense is understood as a necessity. In a lot of countries it still is as far away from being "ok" as you can get. The death of the aggressor is the worst case of a good outcome of a violent situation.

And when we talk about enemy combatants fighting it out, morality gets even less clear. Or more clear, depending on how you look at it, I suppose.

But lets not kid ourselves. This is a thread about "Dark Harry". We aren't talking about self-defense here.

**** I really don't get why people follow the whole "Killing is bad 100% of the time crap." It's like saying that if a country invaded, we should just use tazers and non lethal methods. Sure, they're bombing and killing us mercilessly, but hey, we don't want to get our hands dirty, do we? Nope, we'll just swim in the blood of the innocents instead.

Remus Lupin could be alive if they agreed to Ron in the diner in Deathly Hallows.

How many people did Dolohov and the other dude go on to kill after that night? It's so stupid. These people are straight up fucking evil. As far as I'm concerned, they can drop dead and a shit ton of innocent lives would be saved.

The best way for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing. And stunning might as well be doing nothing.

***** Its not "crap", if you understand what these people are actually saying.

There is almost no one out there who is a Jesus-like 100% pacifist who lets himself be killed before he would bring violence upon anyone else.

The base statement is "Killing is 100% wrong". We established that. However, that often (as in 99.99% often) only means that they won't /start/ with the killing. Almost every philosopher has some form of exception when they talk about morality that (very often) states that as the defender you may answer in a force great enough to *stop* the aggression. Two examples. In german law, for example, you will be asked why you killed a man in self-defense, if a possible way of defending yourself would have been to crush his knees, or something else non-lethal (and in some cases defenders have been jailed for unreasonable force). Such laws are often found in morality systems which seek to uphold a level of civility even in dire moments. Another example would be the, as you brought up, invasion. Here one could measure the morality of the defending side's actions by judging if their force is enough to stop the overtaking of your country, or if they indulge in barbarian actions like torture in order to fight against the aggressor. Basically, the rules of a morality in which killing is always wrong is valid as long as you are not forced to kill with lethal force. Most moralities admit that the preservation of your own life is a basis of human life and therefore any reasonable action to do so, is morally "right".

In Harry Potter, and especially in that scene with Dolohov, we no longer talked about a civilian situation (in which you could bring an aggressor in front of a court and then prison), but a situation in which combatants of different sides fight against each other. Here is where it gets tricky. A utilitarian morality would ask of you to kill Dolohov. If you work after a morality deriving from Kant's works, you may find yourself in a grey area when it comes to killing Dolohov (a, at that point, unarmed and unconscious combatant).

Anyway. Last time I counted there were roughly around 20 different major morality-theories around the globe. Every single one of them would tell you something different. I wouldn't be so fast in calling something "crap".

** I don't like "Dark Harry" fics.

Either they turn Harry into an overpowered Harry Stu who breezes through everything and wins at all because he's so cool and dark and powerful, and boy is he ever the anti-authorian rebel who forges his own path while he tells that tyrant Dumbledore where to stick it and YAWN...

....or they're just shallow-as-all-hell "psychological" studies that justify Harry going Dark by showing how very, very evil and abusive everyone else is and they all DESERVE being brutally murdered by the tragic victim that is Dark Harry.

But if I HAD to have a Dark Harry fic that didn't make me cringe... well, these things might help:

1:

Give Harry a proper reason for turning Dark. "Everyone was so MEAN to him" is not a proper reason, nor is "Dumbledore was a manipulative old coot who stole Harry's money and kept him from his true heritance as Lord Black because reasons." These reasons just fall flat, and they feel more like excuses than anything else.

Harry going down a Dark path for noble reasons and/or with good intentions could work, especially if it's a sort of "downward spiral" -- say he uses Dark magic reluctantly to protect his friends, but as he continues doing it it becomes easier, and he needs less justification for doing it... starting with "I had to Imperius that guy, he was about to kill Ron" and then ending up with "I had to Imperius that guy, he was standing in my way and didn't want to move." That actually COULD be interesting; the Dark Harry fics I've read just has him go insta-Dark with curses and murdering from the get-go, but if it's a slow spiral into corruption it could be the tragic tale of a good man who became a bad one.

Acknowledge that a Dark Harry would, effectively be a villain. Don't try to turn him into a hero, or even an anti-hero. Don't go the "the Dark side is just misunderstood" route, or try to justify it with "but he only tortures and kills and rapes people who REALLY DESERVE it."

And absolutely don't try to paint him as this revolutionary hero who rebels against a rotten-to-the-core wizarding world, because in those stories Harry always manages to come across as ten times worse than the system he's rebelling against, except he tries to justify it with all these self-righteous rants that are supposed to paint him as noble, but really just paints him as a giant hypocrite.

He could still be the protagonist, mind, and he could have sympathetic motivations and even have moments where he did do genuinely good things. But don't pretend he's not a villain.
