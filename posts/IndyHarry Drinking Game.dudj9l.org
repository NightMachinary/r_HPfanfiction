I'm spending a lazy, and freezing cold, Sunday under a blanket reading my way through my too read list. For some reason there's been a lot of terrible Indy!Harry stories.

So I made a drinking game. I have cider, but drink along with your most indy story and your beverage of choice.

Drink if:

- Harry goes to Gringot and charms them by being polite/shaking their hand/being sooo much smarter than anyone else.

- Lord Harold Gryffindor Black Slytherin (by conquest) Ravenclaw Merlin God Potter

- Magical Guardian. And yes, it's always going to be evil Dumbledore.

- Animagus Power 100, Metamorphus power 80, Fire Power 75 and on and on and on. Empty glass if he can use his powers without even trying.

- Someone, and we all know it's Dumbledore, have locked his true magical potential and power.

- Karate; or Harry going running in the morning and doing yoga and how it really helps his Power Levels.

- Harry finding his mothers trunk in the attic where there's a letter explaining how evil Dumbledore is.

- Harry getting a snake. Empty the glass if it's a rare, magical snake with crazy powers.

- Trunk you can live in. With a library to rival the one in Alexandria.

- Meeting and befriending Hermione/Luna/Ginny before he starts Hogwarts.

- Harry's Queen: blonde, sometimes raven-haired, blue, at times violet, eyed beauty Daphne Greengrass.

Empty the bottle; then a bottle of painkillers:

- 11 year old sex God Harry with a Harem of both older and younger women, and Blaise and Draco, including at least 2 professors.

**** My dude, do not go down in terms of proof, only up. Otherwise hangover will be even more of a bitch. In your case, you start with cider and then switch to rum and coke.

Also, hope you saved a bottle of Gatorade for the morning. If you didn't, green tea works well enough.

Krum being super noble or Daniel Wooderson and a racist.

Talking about Magical cores.

Magical exhaustion.

Exaggerated Dursley abuse.

Fleur being a walking french stereotype.

Luna being a seer.

Gred and Forge.

McGonagall suddenly being relevant to the plot.

Voluptous Susan Bones.

Hermione either being Emma Watson or a humanoid beaver who reports to Dumbledore.

SAS Daniel Granger and "Cool with you shacking up with my daughter" Emma Granger.

Britain either being backwards or muggleborn not understanding the "culture".

Harry gets a new wand.

"6 ft. tall."

Technological anachronisms.

You might die though.

*** Lemon drops are omnipresent whenever Dumbledore is involved, whether he's manipulative or just your "typical" normal Dumbledore. He'll /always/ offer it whenever someone ends up in his office, whether they're about to be expelled for some heinous action or made a great service to the school. Honestly, this has never really bothered me -- hell, I'd probably be a bit thrown off if it /wasn't/ there.

*** Make sure Harry doesn't take a lemon drop because Dumbles has poisoned them with truth/obedience/compulsion potions of some sort.

Also Harry takes in Dobby and every other house elf on te planet because he treats them nicely. Dobby also gives super wierd names to everyone Harry meets and calls Harry something rediculous like 'The Great and Kind Master Harry Potter Sir'.

You also cannot forget Harry's little visit to the chamber of secrets and selling the basilisk for $999,999,999,999,999 because there hasn't been a basilisk in a thousand years. Then we get all the ancient books that Harry finds in the secret room if the chamber that Voldemort never saw.

Lets not forget that every woman Harry meets has the biggest set of tits you have ever seen and they all join his harem.

*** Like, abstract power levels, or literal ones?

HP certainly has power /tiers/ - Dumbledore and Voldemort eclipse everyone else in raw magical power/ability, then there are a lot of people described as 'powerful' in magic that would be under them, and then there's a bunch of people that are much worse.

But if he meant 'Dumbledore has a Magic Indicator Rating of 323,186,253 - good enough for the 3rd strongest mage in Britain', that's kinda dumb lol.

**** Power levels in general. Remember it was before fanfiction was even a thing. Back then a wizard was just as powerful as any other wizard, the only question was skill and even that was murky (Dawlish, Fudge, Umbridge etc.). Most wizards, even Voldemort, in the books didn't show any amazing magic apart from Dumbledore (the arrest scene in OotP).

** This whole list of comments made me laugh so hard. I think you've hit nearly every cliche (and I should know, I've read a crazy number of these fics). Except maybe "Harry is miraculously great at potions after all, Just Like His Mother, and Snape becomes His Biggest Fan because of it." Because naturally Harry is Actually Totally Slytherin. That feeds into the overall theme of "all the Death Eaters are actually good and Just Misunderstood." Which isn't a theme of *all* indy!Harry stories, but quite a few.
