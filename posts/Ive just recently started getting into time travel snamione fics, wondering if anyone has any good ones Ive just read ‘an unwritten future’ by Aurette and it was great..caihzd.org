Im also mostly looking for fics where hermione goes back in time where snape is still a hogwarts student or older!

(Heard this ship gets downvoted alot by petty people ðŸ˜› hopefully no one is THAT immature right?)


** I love Snamione. This one was fairly good. I'll see if I can find any others in my favs.

  In the midst of the Battle of Hogwarts Hermione is given the opportunity to help save Snape's life. Little did she know it would require visiting Hogwarts twenty years prior. She has thirty-one days to befriend the sullen Slytherin, and perhaps save his life. But, as always, things don't always go as planned. HG/SS, time-travel, EWE

  Hermione holds a Time-Turner in her hands; where and when it will take her, she is unsure. But she knows she will always go to the presence of one man and so she turns the dial without hesitation. A different type of Time-Turner romance. SSHG

  Harry wants to meet his parents, Draco wants to avenge his father and Hermione just wants to keep the future from changing! When this unexpected trio is shot back through time they are unaware of just how much their actions are reshaping their world. And due to jealousy, lust and betrayal the boy who lived may not even exist in the future.

** linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258) and linkffn(The Young Adventurer's Club by artemisgirl) both are very different unconventional takes on HG/SS time travel.

linkffn(Forbidden by Savageland) doesn't have any time travel, but has some of the most unique and incredible worldbuilding I've seen.

linkffn(For Hogwarts: A Regency Gamble) also doesn't have time travel, but it's a good read nonetheless.

Hope you enjoy some of these!

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

  Ten years after Harry Potter defeated Voldemort, the Wizarding World seems safe: until two Hogwarts students disappear without a trace in the Forbidden Forest. Strangely linked to this incident is Severus Snape, who died in the Shrieking Shack. Or did he? When Hermione Granger is pulled into the investigation, she discovers the unimaginably dangerous truth. Complete.
