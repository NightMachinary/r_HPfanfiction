Every time i read a GoF fic where harry is forced to compete, i cant help but rage in my mind, i know its cannon and all, but it's got to be the biggest plothole in the whole series.

If moody can trick the goblet to make harry compete, then surely they can just enter moldyshorts name to off him? Or 1 new school per deatheater to rid the world of them. That logic is so flawed that it just can't be possible to enter someone else. Thats assuming the goblet can read...

Wouldnt it be more logical that it registers the magical signature of the one putting IN the paper? I would like to see a fic where somebody questions the fact that harry obviously cant be made to compete if he didnt put his name in, as the one putting in the name was bound, regardless of the name on the paper.

Any fic like that exist?


** I don't remember anything specific, but many indy!Harry fics question Harry's entry in the Triwizard tournament, usually blaming Dumbledore's manipulations. Calling them "intelligent" might be a bit of a stretch though...

*** It's probably because the way poly juice was shown to work in 2nd book and 7th book it seems that Headmaster failed to detect fake Moody. How do you not recognize that your friends of decades is not acting like he is supposed to be.

** JK Rowling tried to be smart by adding an age line to create unnecessary confrontation. If there is no age line and still someone from 4th year is picked by GoF from last of students including 6th and 7th years then your 6th and 7th year don't deserve to be in competition anyway.

2nd way could have been to let there be only 3 champions. Goblet didn't care about age, the age line by headmaster fileted out below the age candidates. Every confrontation would have happened even if Cedric wasn't champion.

I was more worried about bad media handling from Harry's side. Rita Skeeter was poisonous but she never wrote any false fact. She just interpreted those facts in poisonous way. I would love top see a Harry (or writer) who doesn't shrugs off political stuff with 'this is rubbish' attitude.

  In his dreams Harry discovered Voldemort was going to attempt to get him into the TriWizard Tournament. In retaliation he tricked the Goblet of Fire to emit the names of the people who wanted him in the tournament. Four names came out, including Albus Dumbledore. Now the new Supreme Champion is forced into the tournament. See how he fares. Dumbledore!Bashing.

** The best interpretation I've seen is in linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow): the contract isn't binding on the Champions. It's binding on the schools and on their governments, and it obligates them to make the Champions participate by any means necessary. So, even if Harry never put his name in, he still has to choose between participating and becoming an outlaw in the combined catchment areas of the three schools (which may well be all of Europe).

** linkffn(Weres Harry) Harry avoids competing by placing his own ward line, which causes any slip with Harry's name on it to instead say Draco. He winds up giving each school three champions, with hilarious alternate names for their schools.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
