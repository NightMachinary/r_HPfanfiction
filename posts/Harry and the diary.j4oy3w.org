Has anyone ever read a fic where harry get the diary 2nd year instead of ginny? Nust a random thought that occured to me. I've read fics where luna got it or even draco once but I think it would be interesting if harry ended up with it somehow.


** In canon, Harry had the Diary almost as long as Ginny:

- Ginny had it from late August until mid November when she threw it away in Myrtle's bathroom after Justin was petrified. A few days latter, Hermione began brewing polyjuice in the same place, which she finished shortly before Christmas. The time to brew the polyjuice is one month.
- Harry found the Diary sometime in January next year after talking to Myrtle. Diary Riddle showed him the memory of how Hagrid was blamed for the first COS incident.
- On Valentine's Day, Harry's bag was ripped open and Ginny saw the Diary there. Also, Ginny wrote that poem without the Diary in her possession.
- In early May, Ginny broke into Harry's dorm and stoke back the Diary. The attack on Hermione and Penelope Clearwater followed immediately after. That was when Dumbledore was sacked and Hagrid sent to Azkaban.
- On May 29, the Diary took Ginny into the COS to force a final confrontation with Harry

So if you do a little math here, both Harry and Ginny had the Diary for almost 4 months.

*** But harry didnt write in it beyond that one time whereas ginny wrote in it at minimum nightly pouring her hear lt and soul into it. I'm just curious as to those with the talent for writting would handle harry doing the same.

** He might have it in linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos) It's kind of impossible to tell right now. I suspect everybody in this story, but he does at least have a journal that is directly connected to Voldemort, and it definitely might be the diary.

The only other one I can think of is the fem!Harry one on AO3. It starts with a “M” but I can't spell it to save my life.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

*** I'm curious on the fem harry one. I find those a guilty pleasure especially when they're not just an excuse to write lesbian harems

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12029172/chapters/27229608]] This is a mentor Snape fic and it is part of serie, it is really excellent but it gets lost in the third year, the first two years are excellent though. In this fic Harry talks to the diary for several days in a row and is possessed, I really recommend reading it, maybe that's what you're looking for. (Here Ginny still uses the diary but they don't have any kind of close relationship)
