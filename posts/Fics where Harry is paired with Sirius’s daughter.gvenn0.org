  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

*** Did't Have the patience to read Black Bond, the fics focuses too much on the girl, and most of the time Harry seemed to be useless, also her liking for Draco was very annoying, and led me to believe that the romance would be slow because of the incoming love triangle.\\
But i love the idea of the fic and it's very well written, so could you talk a little about it ? So i can decide if continue or not.
