:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Its where Harry grew up in an orphanage with a few other kids, him and at least some of the kids had been at a different orphanage before that was abusive, other details I remember are that the nun taking care of them died and the eldest took over running the orphanage, Harry was also friends with a goblin and knew their stories. When he goes to Hogwarts he would tell his group of friends the stories as well. There are other small details I don't really remember right now.

  Harry was proclaimed dead when he was two years old and ended up in an orphanage. But that was only the beginning of his journey. While trying to find his place in the world of magic, he never forgets those whom he views as family. LONG-TERM HIATUS.
