Does anyone know of any good stories where Dementors become a bigger threat to the Wizarding world? Maybe the added variant of Lethifolds? Or really just a Wizard vs. the Dark Creatures sort of plot line if there's no good options from the initial point.


** In The Second String Voldemort and the Dementors end up being a pretty big problem. But it's not really a Dementors vs Wizarding World sort of thing. Great fic though and definitely worth a read. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13010260/1/The-Second-String][The Second String]]
