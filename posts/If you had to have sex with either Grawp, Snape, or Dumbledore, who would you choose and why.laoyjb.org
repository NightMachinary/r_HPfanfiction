** Grawp is a hazard to health so really it's just a choice between Snape and Dumbledore.

On the one hand, Dumbledore is old. However, Snape in the books is described as truly hideous, with unhealthy, sallow skin, lank, greasy hair, and crooked, yellowing teeth. His personal hygiene is extremely suspect.

Dumbledore, at least, is likely to maintain a basic level of cleanliness, and on that basis, I'm going with Dumbledore over Snape.

******* A lot of people see him only as a coward but I personally abhor him more so than almost anyone else in the series. He indirectly kills one of his best friends and sentences another to what he expects will be a life in prison. He kills those twelve muggles, Frank Bryce, and Cedric.

Worst, however, is how he, more than probably any other character, is responsible for Voldemort's return. In a way he's indirectly responsible for everything Voldemort does post GoF

****** No. I know he's a bastard but he also cares about the students. There's a part early on in the books where that becomes obvious so I always took it as read that he was behaving that way for a reason. Which still isn't an excuse of course.

But there's a difference between a teacher behaving cruelly and a parental figure doing the same. I had a teacher much like Snape and I hated her, but her cruelty never bothered me like my parent's did. But that may just be me. Either way my point is that for Snape having grown up in an abusive household and having experienced cruelty from others at school, he would likely have felt that what he was doing was less awful than it really was. A small price to pay for maintaining his cover.

I may be cutting the man too much slack, I know, but I don't think he would ever have knowingly left a child in an abusive household.

I understand that others might not see him the same way I do, or might not care about the distinction. Any cruelty is terrible of course. But I have an irrational affection for the man in spite of his viciousness.

******* He... Doesn't, tho?

I mean, he explored Harry's mind, all his memories, while teaching him Occlumency. Now, I refuse to believe that you'd think Harry wasn't in an abusive home, so tell me, what did Snape do?

Did he wallow in self-pity, convinced that he did to Harry what James did to him, but worse because you can't fight a teacher? Did he give any kind of excuses to Harry for the way he's been a massive piece of shit?

Fuck all, he just told him "lmao u suck at occlumency" and continued assaulting Harry's mind.

Another proof he doesn't really care? When a non-Slytherin gets injured by a Slytherin, he just mocks them, and doesn't give a fuck about bringing them to safety. Like with the incident between Malfoy and Harry, in GoF, where Hermione's teeth grew up because of Malfoy's spell. I don't remember what happened to Crabbe, but he was allowed into the infirmary. Hermione had to /skip classes/.

Which means as a professor, he was bad enough, unprofessionnal enough, and uncaring enough to /play blatant favourites/.

Sure, the poor wittle Severus Snape, always consorting with future Death Eaters, cursing "Mudbloods" in his off-time, was constently targeted by the Marauders. Poor baby. That must justify the years of abuse the children of Hogwarts suffered under him.

Poor little Severus Snape, creating dark spells made to injure permanently someone at age 16. Can someone give us an F in the chat for this poor lost soul.

I can easily see why Dumbledore, the well-meaning but old and disconnected Headmaster of the best British Wizarding School + 2 other full times jobs, is infinitely worse than someone who didn't hesitate to betray the guys he was working with, because the other guys could maybe do more to save his crush. His crush that, must I remind you, /he pissed off because of his racism/.

So yes, your affection towards this piece of garbage is deeply irrational, much more than your dislike of Albus Dumbledore, whose biggest failures are probably not seeing the individual pieces in a war he fought for, what, more than 3 decades?

******** As far as we know he saw only snapshots the same as Harry did. He saw him get chased up a tree by a dog, but he didn't see that Harry spent the next few hours in that tree, etc. Granted the things he saw should've been enough to concern him. But we have no insight into what he thought of the things he saw. He may have been concerned and he may have taken those concerns to Dumbledore who convinced him he was mistaken. He may have brushed off his concerns himself, seeing them through a lens of his preconceived notions.

What we do have context for is his reaction to Harry's attempts to learn occlumency. The one time Harry forced himself into Snape's mind Harry saw Snape's memories of his abusive father and fully expected Snape to lash out at him for having seen something embarrassing, but the man didn't say anything about that. He was only interested in the fact Harry had shown himself to be capable of learning the skill. Then a moment later when he saw the fact that Harry was still having those dreams he went ballistic over it, seemingly furious that the boy was still in such grave danger. Although I know some think he was merely concerned about their losing the war because their weapon was at risk.

I won't deny that his treatment of the students was inexcusable. But I don't think he was a terrible person. There's a difference between being cruel to someone for a few moments and sentencing a person to a decade of cruelty. Both are terrible, but one is a hell of a lot worse. Dumbledore groomed Harry to off himself in the hope that he would survive it, not the certainty.

I get that you like Dumbledore and you don't want to see him as a complete bastard. But I have never seen him as anything other than a manipulative bastard. He reveals at the end of the second book that he knew Lockhart was stealing people's memories. I hated him from that moment, but I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps he didn't know until after he hired the guy that he was doing that, hard to believe but I tried. But in my opinion the books provide too much damning evidence of his guilt.

I'm not trying to argue you out of your opinions of either of them. Just clarifying my own. I think we're going to have to agree to disagree.

I'm not saying he's evil, just, not nearly as good as people make him out to be. I don't think he ever grew out of his phase of seeing people as peons to be ruled over with a gentle hand. He just got better at hiding his contempt for other people. But I grew up in an abusive household so it feels much more personal than it would otherwise. I loathe abusers. I have tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but the evidence is pretty damning in my opinion. I know a lot of people still see him as a kindly old man, but I can't.
