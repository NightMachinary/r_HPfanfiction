** If you don't like people complaining about cliches they don't like, stop reading posts about them.

And besides, at least in my experience, most of the frustration with those cliches comes from finding a fic with an interesting summary, opening it up, and then finding out that it starts with all that Gringotts inheritance garbage.

*** Same can be said for people complaining about said cliches. If they don't like them, don't read them. Yet we hear them bitch all the time anyway. That was the whole point of the OPs post, if they don't like those kind of fictions, don't read them, as there are PLENTY of fics out there that don't use those tropes

** First of all, dude, seriously, how fast do you read? You start like daily 10 new request posts. I'm really impressed... it usually takes me like a month or so to read a 100k word story.

Secondly, I hate lord Potter Black stories because the trope is so talked about that I get sick of it. I've read some parodies, but probably the closest to the trope serious one that I ever read was Harry Crow and even for that I only read like the first two chapter and then the conclusion. But if I recall... even that one didn't have lordships and stuff (or maybe I missed the part).

Depending on how busy you are, and your domain over the english language, reading speed can be surprisingly fast.

The prologue of one of my favorite fics is 51 pages / 26,105 words long. It takes about 40 to 50 minutes to read.

I still remember reading OotP during one school night because I didn't have money for it and a friend let me borrow it.
