** 1. Superstrong harry with multiple titles and lords it over his school mates. (That's exactly opposite of Harry Potter.)

2. Weak/spineless Harrry who allows everyone to walkover him.

3. Where he tells his pitiful life story to every new character introduced.

4. 11 year olds politicking and beats Dumbledore, Fudge and Malfoy.

5.Dark Harry.

1. Hermione bashing

** I don't like karma houdinis, so someone who does something wrong without facing adequate consequences annoys me to no end(Snape's endless bullying of a child because he hates a man that's been dead for over a decade; Umbridge, full stop).

I can't think of any tropes that both make me cringe, and are a guilty pleasure. If it's something that makes me cringe, I don't derive any pleasure from it.
