It only goes back to the 100,000 Fic so I can't see the last one


** so ao3 was created on the 15th of November 2009. This is the list of all HP fics that ao3 identify as having been posted on that date - [[https://preview.tinyurl.com/y5p8aha5][*https://preview.tinyurl.com/y5p8aha5*]] however, the work ids are all in the 10k range, so its missing the back-dated fics from that day. Checking the back-dated works sorted by posting date gives linkao3( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17]] ) as the earliest work, and given its work id is 17, I'd incline to think its up there in terms of the earliest. Out of the lower work ids with 1 chapter, there aren't any HP ones and I'd need the individual chapter ids to check the multi-chaptered ones unfortunately. Those are mostly imports from four or five authors though, and none of them have a sufficiently early enough HP story to knock Decline and Fall down though.

I severely doubt there's an earlier HP one though.

(work ids seem to be sequentially assigned based on time of the draft being created, so searching for the lowest isnt guaranteed to be the earliest posted just the earliest draft created, but its a reasonable stand in. Plus on day 1, i think it was mostly works being imported not new works being added.)

** You can limit by date, so something like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Search&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Btitle%5D=&work_search%5Bcreators%5D=&work_search%5Brevised_at%5D=%3E+20+years&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bsingle_chapter%5D=0&work_search%5Bword_count%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bfandom_names%5D=Harry+Potter+-+J.+K.+Rowling&work_search%5Brating_ids%5D=&work_search%5Bcharacter_names%5D=&work_search%5Brelationship_names%5D=&work_search%5Bfreeform_names%5D=&work_search%5Bhits%5D=&work_search%5Bkudos_count%5D=&work_search%5Bcomments_count%5D=&work_search%5Bbookmarks_count%5D=&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=created_at&work_search%5Bsort_direction%5D=desc][this]] works, but you should play with it a bit more. And many stories apparently have wrong dates.
