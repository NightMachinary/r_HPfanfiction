Hi, everyone. I'm currently in the process of writing my first HP fanfic, and it's a labor of love that is also a pretty huge project. I don't want to give away my direction, but just know that I'm essentially tackling all 7 books with one major difference that mirrors the original, but is also very different. That said, it's going to be pretty damn long.

I'd like to ask you, the readers, your opinion on chapter and overall story length. If you've read any fics in the past that stick pretty close to the canon material, what did you like about it? What didn't you like about it? Do you think it's better to gloss over situations that are pulled from the original, or do you like reading the writer's take on the events that unfold even if it's something you've already read in Jo's books?

Currently, I'm glossing over things and focusing on what makes my idea change the narrative, but it feels flat sometimes. The only way I can think to give it a better flow is to describe things, people, and situations that we have all heard/read/seen before. Would you rather read a story that sacrifices flow for "getting on with it", or one that flows better with chapters that may take an hour or more to read, even though you already know what happens in, say, the Triwizard Tournement (which, for my story, wouldn't be affected very much if at all.)

Thank you in advance for any thoughts and suggestions.


** I definitely wouldn't describe events (or anything else) that are the same as canon. This is fanfiction, your readers already know it and it would be hard to do without slipping into plagiarism. But what you can do is describe what other characters are doing while the canon events are happening. As long as what they are doing drives the events of your story in some way. Essentially, tell your readers what they need to know and don't include things that don't add anything to the story. That's a basic rule for any fiction writing. As regards chapter length, everybody has different preferences but apparently the general advice is usually 3-6k words.

** This sub strongly dislikes canon rehash fics.

We don't need to read Wormtail stunning Harry in the Graveyard hundreds of times. It's boring.

Develop your own plot, unshackle yourself from the chains of canon plot, and your story will be highly appreciated.

*** I read this comment shortly after you replied and have been thinking about it since. Gave me an idea on how to rewrite the first chapter and how to write around canon stuff in the future. Many thanks.

** I'm doing a similar fic myself, but since I'm starting in the years before Hogwarts, it'll be a bit longer.

That aside, a recommendation I would have (if possible) would be to not stick too close to canon in every detail. I mean do we need to have the troll incident again? Having the trio together is nice, but sometimes it's rather welcome to have them come together in a different way than usual. Like in my own upcoming chapters, Harry & Hermione meet before Hogwarts because, for reasons I don't feel like detailing, he saves her from getting hit by a car when they're 9 years old. Getting into the characters's inner thoughts about the situation at hand can also go a long way for characterization.

Also, if there's an aspect of the canon events that doesn't make sense, I'd ditch it or rewrite it so it's coherent. Chuck the bad out, basically. :-)
