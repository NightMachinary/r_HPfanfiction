Does anything exist like this that's worth recommending? It was a random thought I had earlier about Luna going through the series as if she were the chosen one, carrying piece of Voldemort and all. Seems like an interesting idea to me, seeing how personalities we know would handle these things, instead of it being Harry's twin or sibling.

If you guys don't know of any I'll be sending out prompts on tumblr to the authors I follow!

Edit: no Neville as the chosen one. Looking for a character who wasn't one of the original possibilities.


** There are a probably at least a thousand "Neville as Boy Who Lived" stories out there.

*** I should edit the topic to reflect 'No Neville' Lol. Thanks for pointing that out. I want a character who wasn't originally one of the possibilities.

** In the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2un7rh/your_best_wartime_stories/co9xdqf][Promises series]] (~700,000 words & complete) it's one of the marauders. Although it has a rather original plotline and a competent writing, I think you'll still have to check it out for yourself first to see whether you like it or not.
