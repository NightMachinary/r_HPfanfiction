I would like to see it applied in different scenarios. Logically, it should be the ultimate protective spell. 'Expecto Petronum' literally translates to 'I await a protector'. It could be used like a shield in many cases.

I've already read linkffn(One Trick Champion). But that was kind of cracky. I'm looking for more serious fics.


** It is also used against Lethifolds. And it can possibly be used as an actual shield as well given that at least a corporeal Patronus can actually interact with the environment. Ron's patronus actually pushed Neville's legs out from under him.

** I wonder if it'd have worked against Voldemort's wraith form, honestly. Maybe not as strongly as against a dementor, but it inspires happiness and love, which Voldemort is repelled by.

Additionally, a fun thought is if it'd repel a Nazg√ªl, or a Balrog, in a LotR crossover.

*** You needed the power of a contained Maia to repel a Nazgul with light, much more than happy emotions and intent given form. Otherwise you needed especially crafted swords or an Elf-Lord.

And the Balrog need either another Maia or a very, very powerful Elf Lord to kill it.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

*** Don't think this is entirely correct. Also been a while (decades ish) since I took Latin but it would definitely have a way to distinguish between a possessive pronoun (e.g. my) and an article (i.e. a, the). While you're correct that there aren't articles, there are definitely pronouns. They aren't always used ("veni, vidi, vicci" e.g.) but they can be and IIRC usually used if they're possessive ("mea culpa").

In "I await a/the protector," "protector" would be the direct object and conjugated (or whatever you call it for nouns) appropriately, maybe in third declension? In "I await my protector," "protector" would be in fourth (?) declension (don't really remember, think it'd be whatever ablative case is? Dative maybe?) because it's an indirect object.

Tl;dr I think "I await my protector" would be "expecto meo patrono" or close to it.

***** Totally fair, the only thing I super remember about Latin is that Mallomar/Mallomares is a third declension noun, which is what you use for imported words, because we'd go on class trips to get them from Rite Aid.

On that note, writing that makes me think I think I conflated cases and declensions in my comment, so maybe don't take my word for it... Either way, I'm sure Dr. Wheeler would be proud I remembered that much :)

** Here's a scene I started writing to explore some headcanon on the Patronus Charm. It's a small bit from an OC/SS epfic -- she's a musician and a soul healer, and the timing is the summer before HBP. Sorry this fic is still much closer to outline than draft, so there are author notes with TODOs in a couple places. Also I should credit the Beatles for some lyrics :)

--------------

Despite his posture relaxing, Severus scowled again. "At least the Dark Lord has a preference for the window between supper and midnight. The Headmaster's timing is all over the map. It's probably better that way, strategically, but it's bloody annoying."

Liz scowled, too, but it was at the rolling fog, which was thickening and bringing a chill to their lounging spot. What had he said about the Dementors being close? And breeding? Yikes.

He tightened his grip on her shoulders and asked quietly, "Can you cast a patronus?"

She shook her head. "Not a corporeal one. I'm not so sure I have a memory suitably happy."

"It doesn't have to be a single memory. And /happy/ is a bit too broad to choose the most effective moment and feeling. /Joyous/ is rather closer. Maybe on the edge of /euphoric/. You should make many attempts, exploring that entire family of emotions."

This explanation helped a lot, actually. She had plenty of memories she thought were happy, and she had worried about what that meant when faced with the formless wisps of her own patronus. And his idea for her study of the charm was a good one, as his ideas usually were.

(*/A/N TODO/* pick a better memory, or make one /wink wink/)

Then she pulled back, drew her wand, and cast, "/Expecto patronum!/"

It was hard to make out exactly which bird burst forth from her wand, and it circled the small clearing, rising higher and pushing out the radius of the fog as it chirped out a melodic song.

Liz closed her eyes and listened carefully. She knew that song, somehow. One of the birds in Marlena's garden, maybe.

Severus leaned in close and murmured in her ear. "A songbird. How predictable."

"Oh, hush," she scolded, and then giggled, holding out her hand out as a perch, almost the form of a formal greeting.

The magical bird glowed brighter and spiralled back down to the place where the two of them still sat on the ground, landing neatly on her finger. Though a patronus was always silvery-gray in color, she could easily imagine the right color on this one.

"Well aren't you just a little flute of a warbler?" She giggled again, and tilted her head toward Severus without taking her eyes off the animal. "A common blackbird, I think."

The bird pecked at her fingers.

Liz was oddly pleased to be chided thusly, and she grinned. "Sorry, sorry, there's nothing common about you, is there?" Then she drew a deep breath and called out in tune, "/Blackbird fly, blackbird fly... Into the light of a dark black night./"

It turned its little beak to point directly at Severus, and then it opened wide and blew her away with an exact reproduction of the words she just sang.

Gobsmacked, Liz watched as it launched and flew off, spiraling back up, singing its own trill when it reached the top and flew over the trees toward the walking path.

Her jaw was hanging open, so she snapped it shut and turned toward Severus. "Tell me that was normal and expected."

His eyes held a touch of the mirth she had felt a moment ago, and it calmed the slight uneasiness she felt in this moment. "Usually," he drawled, "for those who can even cast a corporeal patronus, it takes a little more practice to connect with your patronus in that way, but considering the power infused in your song, I would say that was normal and expected."

She breathed a little sigh of relief and then grinned, feeling again the joy and mirth that allowed her to cast and maintain such an apparition in the first place.

"It is useful for sending emergency messages across short distances, but it is a method which the Dark Lord knows is favored by the Order of the Phoenix."

Mirth squashed, she said darkly, "I see." What a shame that practicing such glorious magic must be weighed against the risk of retaliation from a Dark Lord who was probably incapable of feeling such joy. "Have you ever seen /his/ patronus?"

"No."

"Hmm, so what's /your/ patronus?"

His eyes narrowed, and he reached to wrap his free arm around her again. "Yours is better. Whenever we need one, you should cast it."

Despite the rare praise and affection, Liz could feel her expression sour. He hadn't answered her question, and she didn't exactly believe that she would have already passed his skill at this charm.

"The patronus is soul magic, /Healer Althea/, which is just another reason I'm not surprised by the strength of yours. In fact, I am surprised you hadn't mastered the corporeal patronus long before today." He frowned, not quite all the way to a scowl. "It's a defense of your own soul against any evil that would drain you of it."

(*/A/N TODO/* something salty about how he wasn't her Defense professor)

** In my personal headcanon, the Patronus Spell can technically stave off PTSD fueled nightmares., similar to a dreamless sleep potion, but without ingesting it. Supposedly, if you can manage it while asleep, the aura it gives off would stave off your own negative emotions so long as it remains.

Assuming you let it stick around, and it actually DOES, of course. Which, theoretically, is possible, but it's just not done.
