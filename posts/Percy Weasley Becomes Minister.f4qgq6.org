:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It wasn't like the main part of the fic, but I think it was after the battle, and Percy becomes interim minister reluctantly and then the official minister later on in an election.

Edit/Update: I think he became it by default because everyone above him was being charged for corruption, so he got it as assistant or undersecretary to Fudge.

Ok I finally found it, it's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5733297/1/A-Time-for-Changeling][A Time for Changeling]]

**** Important Percy (not necessarily the Minister of Magic) is in linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities) and especially in its kind-of-sequel linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities).

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth and arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this. ON HIATUS
