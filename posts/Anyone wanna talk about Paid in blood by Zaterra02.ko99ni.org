Apparently it was deleted and reuploaded by someone else (we aren't here to discuss about whether it's ok to do so or not).

I read upto ch20 and as much as the bashing was extreme, I was ok with it. A lot of hurt and all but the plot point where I stopped reading was Scylla. Harry's action towards Scylla really felt heart-breaking to me and I couldn't read the story afterwards. What were your opinions about that? I know it's a dark Harry fic but so far his actions were plausible (except the very first chapter) to some degree. But the part with Scylla, that reminded me why I don't like dark Harry fics. I read so far cuz it has a nice Haphne in it (central plot is Haphne)

Didn't want to give spoilers thats why the vague tone.


** It's a plot point. Scylla does not die. Bwahahaha.

** I couldn't even move past the bashing in this fic it just made me cringe. Not for me.

*** I totally get it. But it's a complete AU fic so we don't need to feel like the author misinterpreted the Canon. And to be honest, I only stayed for the Haphne as it has been my recent obsession üòÅ
