In the years after finishing Hogwarts, Tom Riddle regularly snuck into the Chamber of Secrets to conduct an experiment with the basilisk based on Salazar's notes on binding parseltongue to his descendants. The basilisk's only condition was that Tom swear an oath not to harm her hybrid clutch. Almost every egg hatched into a human/basilisk hybrid, except one. The remaining egg hatched a girl who appeared entirely human, except with the basilisk's vibrant green eyes and crest-red hair. When the rest of the clutch's gaze started terrifying, Tom located a random muggle family who would be happy with magic and confounded them into thinking she was their daughter...


** Wow that did not go where I was expecting. But this would be a really good idea. Also would have a good explanation for Harry surviving the AK.

** Or....hear this now...the basilisk is actually Salazar's mother and she used to be able to transform into a human, but can't anymore. Or maybe Salazar is like Lily. So Harry would be Salazar's nephew??? Hahaha. Harry Potter---nephew of Salazar Slytherin.

** LOL. Well, if Hagrid is the result of a giantess and a regular human and there are selkie and goblin/human hybrids...a basilik/human hybrid isn't crazy. After all, aren't mythical Nagas that?

** Oooh, a fic like this could potentially go on to explain why Tom picked Harry as his equal between baby Harry and baby Neville. Also, if he knew Harry's mom wasn't actually a muggleborn but some cool hybrid experiment then that would have been a good reason for him to have tried to recruit her when she was a young adult.

Would this Lily have been a parselmouth too then? I wonder if she would have been sorted into a different house based on her heritage in this scenario.

** Okay, I don't know if this is realistic in snakes, but maybe they could have memories from before their hatching. Though the pregnancy was caused by a potion (tom would never consent to breeding with a snake) and Lily remembers her mother (Basilisk) and father (Tom) which means that Harry remembers the information she tells him on magical theory. Though that will make him the actual heir of Slytherin in third year regardless if he wants to be or not.

​

I wonder what that would mean when Harry overhears that his Grandfather (Fleamont Potter) has named him the heir of the family instead of the angry/immature James.

*** Tom would totally consent to breeding with a snake if it got him what he wanted. It's not like this would be likely to harm him in any way.

Remember, you're talking about a man that killed a fellow student and mutilated his soul at 16.

***** Nope. Just that super scary glare that makes people crazy themselves.

If you want a reason why she doesn't have the basilisk glare then it's because she's wearing contact lenses, hence people are paralysed by her glare.

******* You know that look that you got as a kid when you parents knew you'd done something no matter how much you tried to hide it from them?

Multiply that by, I dunno, ten? Then add her using your full name, first middle and last, in THAT tone of voice.

Then you'd probably be close to having an idea how scary her glare is.
