Is he still somehow Boy Who Lived? If so how? Are Horcruxes still a thing? Does he have a Horcrux inside of him? Is he raised by Vernon and Petunia? et cetra, all those are up to you.

  It was Mrs. Figg who suspected first. She noticed many things, sitting on her side of her fence with her cats chasing butterflies and nuzzling her ankles, Mundungus and the other watchers dropping by for tea now and then. Mrs. Figg noticed that Petunia was a nosy bit of work with insecurities hanging from her every harsh angle. She noticed when Dudley learned the word MINE-- the whole neighborhood noticed that one. She noticed that Vernon glared at owls.She noticed that when Petunia gave Harry a truly horrendous haircut one year, it grew back in at a normal rate. Harry was uneven and weird-looking for ages, hiding under beanies when he could. When Mrs. Figg had Harry over for carefully miserable afternoons of babysitting, she noticed nothing moved that shouldn't. He didn't accidentally make flowers out of fallen leaves, or levitate anything during tantrums, or turn toys funny colors. Mrs. Figg called up her mother, interrupting the wizarding bridge game she was winning against the nursing home staff, and asked her how she had known, decades back, that her youngest daughter was a squib.

  The day Harry Potter turned eleven was the day he would have re-entered the magical world. But the letter never came; Harry Potter was a Squib. Dismissed by the wizards, he makes a quiet life for himself and will not stand for them to ruin it.

** Can answer pretty succinctly, for once:

1. Yes he is still the Boy-Who-Lived. Harry's magic, or lack thereof, is irrelevant since it was /Lily/ who made the sacrifice that killed Voldemort. In practical terms, Harry still becomes a horcrux, people don't know any the wiser just like canon. Maybe he cannot go to Hogwarts, but his blood protection at the Dursleys probably works either way.
2. Yes, Horcruxes are still a thing. Why wouldn't they? Voldemort had already made five by 1981, with the intent of making his last one with Harry's death.
3. Yes he is raised by the Dursleys. /Why wouldn't he be?/ The protection is still there, Voldemort would inexorably feel the need to kill him at some point (because prophecy), and possibly need his blood if the Philosopher's Stone doesn't pan out well (he still wouldn't get it out of the mirror without help).
4. Really, the major changes aren't the dynamics of Harry and Voldemort (the difference in ability is hardly affected by Harry's magic or not, and their personalities are largely the same). Rather, it would be how Harry could survive a confrontation beyond the first attempt. There is a good chance he would survive the first time, since he is still protected from Voldemort via Lily's sacrifice. And of course how the Wizarding World deals with discovering their savior is a powerless squib. Or whether Harry is even introduced to it at large.

*** No, I was just meaning in the story, how AU you want it to be, based on him being a Squib.
