Theres a fic that i read a while ago and cant for the life of me remember. I know it was a time travel story. One where harry apon arriving in his parents era was sorted into slytherin. The marauders and harry may have had some altercations. And it may have been slash.


** The only one I can remember like that is "Vacation 1975". Sorry if that's not right.
