Does anyone have a copy of Finite (also called Dark Matter) it was a TheoxLuna Fanfiction a spin off from Draconian (Dracoxhermione). Hepburnettes took it all down from wattpad and it sucks because as fans of the fic we are all suffering. It according to me is counterproductive since now we have no choice but to circulate pdfs to read it. Besides wattpad gave videos to Draconian with which she could also earn but she decided to take it off due to plagiarism issues. But come on any work whether on net or in print form had the risk of plagiarism.
