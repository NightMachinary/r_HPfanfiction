** *God of Luck*

/What I liked/ Harry is the God of Luck. Hilarious! People start praying to Harry. He starts hearing the voices! I want more of this.

Link: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17356286]])

*Gossip Queens*

/What I liked/ Neville and Harry get drunk. Drunk Neville trying to say Hufflepuff! It's good, clean fun.

Link: linkffn(4389875)

*Pandemic*

/What I liked/ Heartbreakingly human. Harry's loneliness when his social life is stopped because of a pandemic resonated with me. Bonus: an amazing portrayal of Delphini-Voldemort relationship. Great writing, characterizations and world building. No character bashing. The one thing that sticks out to me is how the fic has a ton of heavy subjects but balances it out with humor. It doesn't feel like reading a heavy fic.

Fell into the trap of reading a real book this week. I didn't get much fanfic reading done.

*** Oh my gosh yes pandemic, and the prequel that explains it. They just are the best thing I've read recently. I can't talk about them enough. So absolutely beautiful. Turning Tom/Voldemort into a sympathetic character in a realistic way. I just. I've re read it three times already. I could gush all day.

**** Yeah! I loved how the characters are incredibly human and flawed. The women are portrayed so refreshingly differently. I loved the characterization of Narcissa in /A horse with no name/ and Minerva in /Hold the Line/.\\
All the seven stories of the series are definitely going on my reread rotation.

Agree with you that Tom/Voldemort characterization is the standout in the series! The backstory, the impulsiveness, the fear of being alone, the selfishness... It is the rare fic I read that keeps Harry as he is and makes Tom/Voldemort sympathetic.

The writing is so beautiful. Bold and original. Hard to describe it. I felt it was more about what was left unsaid than the dialog or the introspection. It has this way of zooming into the character which I haven't really encountered before.

  Harry and Voldemort are two lonely men looking for their peace. As a world comes crashing down, they find their pact in Delphini. "When I told Delphini of my past, she ran to Draco and refused to see me for months. Heartsick, frightened, I waited. When she returned to me, I took her to the temple of Apollo, to the place where I had shed my madness in oleander's fumes, upon cracked stones, under Saturn's bright. The stone came to Delphini." And she had given it to Harry, this stone that had fallen from the skies upon the ancient edifice where Voldemort had surrendered madness and ambition. A pact of peace and of forgiveness. They had not raised her to hate. A cursed child, the press had called Harry once, for the scar on his face. Delphini was no cursed child.

  A fifteen-year-old Tom Riddle slips through time, pulled by a scarred boy into a seemingly idyllic future. Harry Potter falls with him into a reality untouched by Voldemort's reign. Taken into the Potter household, the two form an unlikely bond -- but between centaur magic, government conspiracies, and the darkness at the heart of the Forbidden Forest, this new world is not as it seems.(In which Tom learns to be kind, Harry learns to be cruel, and ancient magic sings to them both from the woods. Meanwhile, a war of metal and secrets brews in the shadows, threatening an end to the fragile peace.)

** I read Exile ff([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile]]) and loved it! It's about Draco Malfoy's redemption. It is about Draco alone and his self discovery. What I especially like is how he navigates the muggle world and faces problems that I didn't even consider and also that Draco isn't glorified by the author so they portray him very human. I also liked that it doesn't include romance directly because it's refreshing to my cold dead heart.\\
I didn't want it to end but alas it is complete.

*** I'm about 2/3rds of the way through this story, and I think it's a great story and really well written, however I find myself skipping the smut.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a well written smut scene, and the ones in this story are some of the better written ones I've ever encountered, but there's just SO MANY OF THEM. So. Much. Smut. It's frequent enough that it entirely loses its novelty. One sex scene transitions into an encore sex scene, and sometimes there's one more just for good measure. It's a bit much.

I'd still very much recommend this story though, it's a really effing cool take on time travel unlike any other fic I've read so far. Thumbs up!

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29671068/chapters/72955533][Lost & Found]], Gen, by MouseInTheCastle. It's a post-war AU where everyone lives. There's only a chapter out so far, but it appears it will center on Severus, an OC niece that has recently come into his care, and Remus, whom Severus will come to have a romance with. The dialogue punctuation in this first chapter is a bit rough, but everything else is solid. As this is their first fic, I'm confident that will fix itself with a little time and practice on their part.

  Loneliness was something that Harry Potter was accustomed to. He had learnt that there was none that cared for him, none that would rescue him from his misery and none that heard his pleas for help. Much to his surprise, however, Harry Potter had been wrong. Someone had been listening, had been there with him through it all. But, just who was 'Tom?

Holy crap. What an amazing fic. It's a Snape takes care of Harry fic, except unlike any I've ever read. The emotions in this fic are so raw, and so real, and the characters are incredibly well written. And it's the perfect length (although I would've been so happy if it'd been longer). Just a beautiful, tight story.
