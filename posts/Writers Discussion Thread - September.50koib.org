** I'm writing part two of my story, linkffn(The Opposing Movement), but there's a lot going on irl, so it's moving along slowly. Right now I need to gather up enough energy for it, as I'm only 3000 words into the part. At least I planned it all out, it's just the putting it on paper part that's causing me trouble at the moment.

One thing I do want to say, though, is that writing and publishing a story can teach you a lot, both about yourself and a whole host of other things. It's stressful at times, but very rewarding at the same time and writing brings a joy to me I haven't experienced in a long time. :)

  Christmas, 1993. Harry Potter is spotted in the company of wanted fugitive Sirius Black, and is forced on a dark, treacherous path. He is pursued from all directions by a Ministry intent on capturing him, and a seemingly immortal Voldemort always looms in the shadows. The road ahead will be dangerous for Harry, and the toll will be higher than ever before...

** So in that last thread I mentioned my fanfic was going to be around 35K when finished. Well it's currently 44K with around 40% to go. There's going to be some serious revision when I finish it up, but it's shaping up to be a more entertaining and complex story than the one I originally envisioned.

But Harry Potter. Oh man. Right now he's as flat as flat can be. In my two-shot he was a lot more lively. Now he doesn't have a clear goal other than "help the protagonists", so he's just going through the motions. I need to seriously sit down and map out his goals and ambitions for the story. Otherwise everything will come to an end, and his side of the story will end with a big resounding "meh".

** Well, after three long months of writing approximately bugger all (technical term), I forced myself to get back in the saddle. I posted a new chapter for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][The Shadow of Angmar]] last week, and I am nearly half-way through the next chapter too.

While I enjoyed my holidays, it's nice to be back and writing again. It started off a little rocky, though. I wrote close to 1000 words before realising that, geographically, it was all bollocks. So I had to bin that and start again. Good stuff.

** I have two main things going at the moment, Seasons of the Witch, linkffn(12120450), and Euphoria part 2. Currently editing the first iteration of Euphoria right now, correcting some of the mistakes people have messaged me about over the last year. And in the process, I'm re-acquainting myself with some of the smaller details I may have have forgotten.

I'm also coming up with random ideas all the time, writing small snippets, and storing them in a vault. That's pretty much how Seasons came about. The one on the forefront of my mind is a Harry/young Bellatrix thing that avoids all the nonsense that ruined Delenda Est. I've got quite a few scenes written out, but nothing in chapter form yet.

** I'm at 143K/~240K in my fic, so I'm rounding up and saying it's 60% completed. I've managed to get through several important 'flashback' scenes and am approaching the point in the story that first inspired me to put ink to paper (so to speak).

Even though I planned out the major arcs far in advance, I'm constantly surprised at how much I have to change due to feedback from betas or new ideas that crop up as I'm in the act of writing.

** Greetings! on the fanfic sites i am aliengirlguy, and i specailize in HP/Crossovers and one Long Journey Fic.

- The Boy and the Beginning.

I am currently editing a few chaps that i have written, though its slow going.

- The Wizard of Middleton.

Currently have a draft for the next chap, pending edit.

- Master of Death and the Equestrian Adventure.

Temporary stall.

- Grey in the Stars.

got some chap drafts pending edit.

- Arrived at Dusk.

Currently working on he next chap.

As for the other questions: I'm going slow but steady alot of RL stuff sorting out, so i am ok in the feedback department, but if someone wants my advice for crossover work or doing rare shippings in said genre, they can PM me at fanfiction.net under aliengirlguy. I don't use beta's or beta others stories, though i do provide challenges for crossovers if people need an idea boost. Handy advice? hrm...if your not sure on a paragraph, say it outloud to yourself.

** I'm currently playing catch-up with Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome, which is why I'm up at 6am on my day off. Scavenging for time to write is proving almost as frustrating and exhausting as the thing itself.

It's all good, though - canning this obsession I had with cramming so much into the next update was liberating to say the least. And the readers get two chapters, so everybody wins (after half a year, but who's counting?)

Guess I'll be holding off my original stuff for another decade, lol.

** I've begun working on a long-shot I'm tentatively calling "The Ballad of Arlfield", which I mentioned in a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4jokl8/discussion_share_your_bestmost/d38evb3?context=3][comment]] a couple of months ago. It's a very weird fic to write, being half detective noir with a kidnapping subplot, and half Football Manager, but I'm enjoying it a lot.

As for actually published stuff, I'm still working on linkffn(The Lesser Kindness), though I've been a tiny bit short on inspiration for it. I know where I need to go with the next chapter, and I've had time to write lately, yet I never seem to go about finishing the chapter. Hell, I should be writing and here I am typing this instead. Tbh the lack of motivation probably has to do with the lukewarm response the fic seems to have gotten, but I'll not go further into that for fear of sounding like an insufferable whinger.

I seem to be getting more and more interested in writing original fiction these days, but I don't really have the time for both original fiction and more fanfiction. Because of this, I might be finished writing fics in the near future, in exchange for the time to start working more rigorously on original stuff. I'll still be around to read, but I think I'm definitely in my waning days when it comes to writing.

  It goes without saying that a witcher's life is one of thankless peril: brutal training, mutations, vagrancy, and all they get for it are insults and a few coins to tide them over to the next contract. Still, to be a witcher is to lead an fascinating life, and Harry tries to make the most of his. Heavy AU.

** Well I haven't posted a new chapter for Treasure Hunter in almost two months, so I should probably work on getting past the general outline for the final arc and just sit down and write it. However, I'm super distracted by the HP/Warcraft crossover I'm writing which is almost double the current length of the story I'm actually publishing. (It also doesn't help that the new World of Warcraft expansion just came out and any free time I have is devoted to that)

If anyone is willing to provide an opinion; How do you deal with faith in a fic without coming off too preachy? I myself am not religious in the slightest but in my Warcraft/HP fic Harry is a paladin and a major pillar of any paladin character is their faith. Luckily in Warcraft a paladin's faith is not focused on a specific deity/god but instead comes from their faith in the Light (Holy Light) so for the most part I can avoid Harry preaching but I'm also shaping a scene in which Harry has a deep spiritual moment, basically witnessing and aiding in the performing of a miracle.

It's weird how characters can just lead you on these journey's you had no plans for when you first started writing.

Is your protagonist ever confronted with someone with a differing opinion? If so, how do they act? If they get indignant and angry, then that could be segue to being preachy. On the other hand, if they're calm and open to the idea of other people having valid opinions, then you've managed to make your character even-handed.

**** Harry I have plans to always be the kind of middle ground type, he has things he can't stand (demons, undead, traitors) but he's the one who appears most open to cooperation between say Humans and Orcs (in warcraft the two races normally despise one another).

However, other characters will react indignantly and angrily to those who oppose them or their views. Mostly because they're villains, in Warcraft there's a sect of paladins, priests and others called the Scarlet Crusade whose soul purpose is to wipe out those they consider lesser.

It's not just that Harry might be too preachy it's also that I have several scenes showing him in training which include philosophical conversations between himself and his teachers on the nature of the Light and a paladins place in the world. So I'm hoping that comes off more as world building than actual religious dogma.

** I'm writing a CC fic and I'm finding it quite a frustrating process. Partly because writing is a frustrating process for me anyway, but mainly because I feel as if the new canon is so insubstantial and inconsistent that there is very little solid foundation to build on - do you know what I mean? Still, I pretty much have the story planned.

The other problem is more abstract; it's that my story is really part of a series - basically a sequel to another fanfiction (so is a fanfiction of a fanfiction. Meta I suppose). But that means that even at this very early stage I know there will be a minute number of readers for it. And yet I still feel that I need to get it out of my head. It's a bit like planning a massive party all the while knowing that none of the invited guests will turn up.

Anyway I've been boring people to death with my questions and complaints about The Play so if anyone is up for private brainstorming about it I'd love to hear from you.

I've got a brilliant SPaG beta for the story but I would be interested in another - specifically to pick apart plot holes and inconsistencies, though I won't have anything ready for a while.

Likewise I'm happy to beta odd chapters but can't really commit to anything long term. My turnaround time varies depending on how busy I am IRL.

A while ago I deleted the story I'm currently working on and after a few months of thinking went on with it somewhere else. My problem is that while I can see little mistakes most of the time, I tend to see the greater ones at once in a way that is crushing, so either I am over-confident and not critical enough, or I completely despise my story and don't think I am the correct person to be writing it (even though there are like 100 versions of it already written by other people , all different from mine and good in their own way, and I have no inspiration for something else at this point in my life). My advice for other writers is to read (other people's fanfiction), look critically at yourself but don't give up on something that brings you joy and to listen to music to cheer yourself up when you feel like quitting (again). It's never too late to become a 'better' version of yourself when it comes to writing (terrible cliché, I know), however sometimes it takes more time than you would have liked

*** I do understand and share that lack of confidence; it is very hard to judge the quality of your own work and I'm terrible at doing that. there is no doubt that the best thing you can do to get better is practice. Do get a good beta if you can - easier said than done, I know.

I wouldn't recommend reading a lot of fanfiction if you are looking to improve your own writing. Even out of the best, there is very little that is written to a publishable standard. Read fanfiction to practise giving constructive criticism and to learn to recognise some of the pitfalls, but to improve your own writing, read real quality published work.

**** yes practice is very good too. I dislike bothering people (seeing as I can't be a beta in return for people myself, due to that English isn't my first language, and I have no special expertises) and relying on someone else, but I agree that sometimes you just can't get all the mistakes out yourself. I didn't mean reading a lot of fanfiction as a replacement for published works, but personally it always inspires me. Thanks for your reply.

** I'm actively working on two fics. One is over 325k at the moment and it's a time travel fic with an OC. I've written about 60% of the scenes I've mapped out for it, but I'll need to go back and cut a bunch before I publish it. If I ever do. I vacillate between loving the story and being proud of it and the way it's coming together and hating it because I know so many people dislike OCs (me included most of the time.)

The second fic has exactly 50% of my mapped out scenes written. This one is basically smut-with-substance. It's got a plot but it's also got a lot of gratuitous sex scenes as well.

August has been a bad month where these two stories were concerned, but I did get a little plot bunny in my head a few days ago and sat down and wrote 4,500+ words on a new idea in one day.

I also wrote a one-shot (that could possibly have more plot later) earlier in the month written from Ron's POV which is really different for me. I should really publish the one-shot at least, but I feel like I need to polish it some more before I let it out in the world.

I'm in that middle section on both of these fics and that's when I always tend to bog down and lose interest. Anyone have any tips besides just pushing through it and hoping for the best?

** I'm trying to finish a Harry/Tonks oneshot I have in my head. I've only recently started writing and I'm struggling to write anything I don't hate, but I'm getting there.

** It's been just over a year since I started writing [[/r/magicmuggle]], and I marked the year anniversary just a few days ago. Currently planning the third year in detail.

If anyone's wondering why it's on Reddit and not a more traditional site, it's because it started from a prompt on [[/r/writingprompts]] and I wanted to keep it on the same site for the readers' convenience.

** I'm working on "Divided and Entwined" and "Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water", at the usual rate of one chapter per week for each story. The second story should finish this month.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.
