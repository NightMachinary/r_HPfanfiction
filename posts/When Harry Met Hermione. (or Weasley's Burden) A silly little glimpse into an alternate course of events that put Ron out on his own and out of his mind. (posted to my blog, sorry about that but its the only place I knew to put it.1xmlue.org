** Why is the text centered? That just makes it difficult to read.

*** Yeah I know, it's irritating, sorry. I probably should have fixed the formatting before I posted it. Honestly, I did it in a hurry so I wouldn't chicken out. Now that it's up I see so many problems with it, but I was kind of daring myself to post it.

** The change in tone was a little odd for me near the end, but I liked it.

*** Thanks. It started as just the first part without Harry. As I added more, it kind of became harder to figure out how to finish it. Also, I just noticed that Ron is a bit more cockney (for lack of a better word) in the first part and completely different in the rest. Thanks for reading it and giving me your feedback! If I ever do this again, I'll edit and proofread it a bit better.

**** The cockney did throw me a bit at first, but after a few paragraphs it made sense with the way he'd changed, made him sound a bit like Dung, which is how he was acting.

I get that would be difficult to finish without making it super long. Nice job though.

**** I read it in the style of a comedy skit, or a short play, and appreciated it more that way. YMMV

***** That was the intent, thanks. I'm new to fan fiction and really this was just an idea I had that wouldn't go away until I wrote it down.
