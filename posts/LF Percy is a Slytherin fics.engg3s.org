I don't think I've ever come across a fic in which our favorite (big)Head Boy is a Slytherin but I'm interested in the concept.

Does anyone have any recs?


** linkffn(11657021) is a rather short one-shot but I think it explores the concept well

  He's a villain. He's a monster. He's a child of an adulterer god and a scorned goddess. He's a fool. He's a menace. He's so many things, and yet to his father's and his siblings, he's stupid.

  Complete. AU. Canon-inspired. Nearly eleven-year-old Percy's attempts to run away from home gets him far more than he'd ever bargained for. Encountering an Azkaban escapee, procuring an illness that brands him as dangerous by Ministry standards and being sorted into Slytherin, he tries to find his way back home again. DARK. Percy/Audrey endgame.

** He'd have made an excellent Slytherin, wouldn't he? Well it does happen in the 'They shook hands' series by Dethryl, though I can't remember if it's in the first or second year story.
