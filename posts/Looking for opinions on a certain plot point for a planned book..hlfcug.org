I've been planning a Marauders Era OC romance book for about a year now. I've got tons of ideas stored up, I have a timeline, and I'm currently working on individual chapter outlines.

I'm good on my story for a long time. It's only when I get up to the point of Lily and James deaths where I run into a roadblock (that's not to say James won't be a possible love interest). I'm looking for opinions on the final outcomes of some characters.

The options are as follows: A.) Lily and James die B.) Lily and James live C.) The OC dies D.) The OC lives E.) Some combination of the options listed above F.) Something else entirely

I originally tried to make a poll about this on here and [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]. Polls are apparently not allowed on either of these subreddits.

Please state your opinion in the comments starting with option A or options A and C (for example). Feel free to discuss what other things you'd like as well. The story is mostly planned out already, but I'm always looking for other opinions. :)


** Lily kills James
