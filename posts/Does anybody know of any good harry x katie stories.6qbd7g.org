Its really hard to find but I'm persistent and want to know of any cause I'm currently reading one and I'm hooked so If anyone can find any please do tell. Also the story has to at least have 60k plus words. It also preferable if harry is in slytherin


** It's not the pairing, but the best Harry/Katie relationship I've read is in A Cadmean Victory. The pairing is Harry/Fleur, but there was a point where the author said he was split between continuing the Fleur pairing or moving the story to Harry/Katie, and it shows. Katie's character is just well done and fun, and even though Harry/Fleur is my second favorite pairing (after Harry/Tonks), I kept rooting for Katie in this fic because her character was freaking amazing. I'd recommend you read it even if it isn't exactly what you asked for.

*** Well definitely thanks but if you did want to read one I'd recommend the one I'm reading right now but its split into six different parts and the pairing doesn't fully come into play until late part 3 and part 4

** Here's seven of them, not all of them are 60k plus. You're not going to have a lot of luck with such a specific request. Asking for such a rare pairing, that's 60k+, you're lucky if you find a decent oneshot with Harry/Katie.

I'm guessing you're reading DrizzleWizzle's series. I didn't really get into it, but if you find another good Harry/Katie story, make sure to leave a post with a link. I'd like to see a few more stories with them, and maybe others will too.

*** Wow obviously you are either strict canon or don't like a little variety. Plus I had already mentioned that I'm currently reading a well don't fanfic for that pairing.

**** I think Katie/Harry is an awesome pairing that is decently plausible. But, there's only like 100 stores on FFN that are even marked with them both being in the story, let alone a pairing. I've gone through them all, and unless some amazing story has come out in the last 2 months, I wouldn't quantify a single one of them as good.
