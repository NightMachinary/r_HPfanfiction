[[https://www.quotev.com/story/10276825/Harry-Potter-The-One-Within-The-Veil]] /Fanfiction friends and buds/ yes I am writing my first ever /horror story/ and it is also my first /ever/ horror /fanfiction/! :) Yes it is Harry Potter! It is about the mystery of the Veil deep in the Ministry and yes it is so very scary and gross! I am trying to write it that way because that is good /horror/ but it is scaring myself. Yes I do not /like horror/ but I want to try /something/ new so yes here I am. :) Yes please read my story so far and also yes tell me how I can make it better? Yes because my last /promotion story/ someone told me that my dialogue needs to be less stiff and robotic and yes not natural. So yes please tell me more things like that about my new horror fic please? :)


** I will give it a look, but please don't use 'yes' quite so much. It's starting to feel like a writing tic.
