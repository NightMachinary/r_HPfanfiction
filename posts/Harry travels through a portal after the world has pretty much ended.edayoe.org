Harry and Voldemort are the only people left, he travels through a portal. He can travel by â€˜flaming' and he meets and befriends the Flamels. He goes to Hogwarts under the disguise as the heir of the flamels it appears Draco's ghost also came back


** Is it linkffn(I'm still here by kathryn518)? From a quick skim it looks right, but I don't remember Draco's ghost coming back in time.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

*** Malfoy's ghost going back in time is the best part of that fic. The way he's super proud of doing well in class despite the fact he's an older time traveler, and trying to play it off as being nonchalant.

** The "I'm still here" fic inspired hundreds of other people. If you look hard enough you should be able to find similar fics. For example in one fic Dracos Ghost comes back. In another he somehow travels with Harry to avenge his dead son and betrayal of his parents. "I'm still here" is definitely one of the best fanfics out there.

**** There is also two other fics that are *heavily* inspired by I'm Still Here. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13035363/1/I-m-back][I'm Back]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13025350/1/From-Ruin][From Ruin]]. From Ruin was updated recently and the other may be abandoned.

linkffn(13035363; 13025350)

Also there was one with a older Harry from another world but I don't remember the title. Only that Riddle isn't Voldemort but there is still a Dark Lord similar to what he was in the original universe. Bella is his daughter in law and she has a daughter named Dorea. Riddle took the Slytherin name if I remember well. Someone may know which fic it is.

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.
