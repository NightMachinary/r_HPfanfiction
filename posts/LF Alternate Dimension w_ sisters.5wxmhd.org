Hi,

A while ago, I read a fic where Harry meets Fate (or Death) and gets thrown in another universe where he replaces the Harry who used to be there. The original Harry was a sadistic kid and had arranged for his parents to die. That's about all I can remember. Pretty sure I read it on ff.net

Thanks


** linkffn(Sacrificial Second Chance by NaruAndHarrHaremFan) This is dimensional traveler Harry. He was sent to dimension where his counterpart is somewhat cruel. Their personalities were mingled together, so he got some of those traits too. Although I don't know if you meant this story.

** I've read this one, it was one where the Harry he replaced was obsessed with his sister. Ended up being an odd incest relationship. Right?

Checking if I can find it.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself... Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? Warnings within and please note that this is a very dark fic.
