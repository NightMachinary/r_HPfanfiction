We arrived at my house. I saw my girlfriend there standing in the doorway looking impatiently.

“Look, I need you guys to stay here and wait until I am done, ok?” I order.

“Ok,” everybody said.

I exit out of the car and walk towards Katy.

“Hey sweety, how have you been?” I asked.

“How have I been, how have I fucking been. You had me worried when the call was cut and you didn't call me back. And who the hell are they?” yelled Katy.

“I understand you are mad, but trust me, if I tell you who they are, you won't believe me,” I explain.

“I won't believe you, look, Donnie, I still love you and I will understand if you just tell me, okay?” explain Katy calming down.

“Ok, then let me get them for you. Just get inside the house.” I said as I signal the family to get out of the vehicle.

“Fine,” Katy said.

As the family got out and started making their way towards my house, I stopped the trio.

“So before you three get in, I need to get some information from you guys so I can help you. Like how the hell you didn't start the car or protect me? But also, with the major thing how it is hard to understand how the hell I supposed to take you to the magic world where there is no fucking magic in this world. Again we can do some acid and see some magic but that is it. Or we can ask the fucking Wiccan community.” I yelled, “Also how I am going to explain this to my wife?”

“Just tell her the truth,” said Harry.

“Tell her the truth, sure. I will tell her that a group of people just appeared out of nowhere and I was being attacked by the wizard version of the KKK. Tell me, how will that sound to you!” I yelled.

“Don't worry about it then, I will tell her,” said Hermione.

“Ok, thank you, Hermione,” I said calming down a bit.

As we enter the house, I saw Arthur curiously looking at the tv. My wife came up to me and told me how he is acting like this is the first time seeing tv and asked me who they are. I reassure her that I will tell her the truth just hold on. I got everybody to take a seat and then Hermione began to tell my wife what happened.

“Yeah right, and I am fucking pope. Donnie is this why you been avoiding me?” said Katy.

Hermione, being very snippy, took out her wand and transform a vase into a bowl. Katy looked on with amazement. She is very shocked and couldn't find words.

Hermione, putting her wand away, explain, “Like I told your husband, we need your guys' help. He who shall not be named transported us here and he has sent death eaters to hunt us. When your boyfriend found us, we were attacked. I don't know why he sent death eaters towards us and what he wants with this world, but it might not be good. So what we need...”

While Hermione was talking, I saw a tall white man with long blonde hair that dress in black coming up towards the door from the street. He has a snakehead on his cane.

“/Shit,”/ I thought.

“Ok, I need you guys to hide in the basement. We have company.” I explained while having them up.

I push them to the basement and then I went up to Katy.

“Katy, I need you to follow what I do, ok?” I said.

“Ok, what is the plan?” said Katy.

“We still have some Cambodian weed, right?” I asked.

“Yeah, why?” Katie asked.

“You will see, just get it,” I said.

As soon as Katie got the stuff, she and I have been making joints and lighting them up as fast we could. I got a really good buzz, while Katie was high. The doorbell rang and I went to get it. I answered the door to see the familiar guy standing in the doorway. The smell of the Cambodian weed came out like a spray and hit the guy.

“Excuse me sir, but I have seen you bringing in a family of redheads with a brown hair girl and black hair boy in your house. I was wondering if you guys can return them to me as they are wanted by the law.” said the man.

“And who the hell are you?” I asked.

“I am Luscious Malfoy.” said the man.

“Well I don't remember seeing a ginger family, heh ginger, what a funny way to name a person, ginger. Who the hell are you again?” I asked again feeling the full effects of the joint.

“As I said, I am Luscious Malfoy.” said the man.

“Oh like in the Harry Potter movies. Heh, Malfoy is a very funny name. It sounds like mouth toy. Heh heh. Hey, Mr. Malfoy do you want to step in and we can get this situation done then?” I asked.

“Sure I don't see why not,” said Malfoy.

As he stepped inside, I guide to the couch where my wife is being dazed and confused.

“Is your wife, ok?” asked Malfoy.

“She is fine, she is just high,” I said as I was lighting another joint, “here you go Mr. Malfoy, a man of great wealth should smoke some really good shit,” I said passing him the joint.

“No thank you, I don't do that.” Mr. Malfoy said.

“Oh that is bullshit, you are evil and you never do drugs. You are apart of the death eaters and you were going to kill me and my girlfriend. I dare you. I double dare you motherfucker to try to kill my girlfriend and me!” I said raising my voice.

Mr. Malfoy stood up, “It seems that you muggles are to smart for your own good. Congrats on seeing through my disguise. But you were right. I was going to kill you,” as he said this he raises his wand to me and my girlfriend, “Avada Kadava.” He said the spell but nothing happened. He said it once more and nothing happen again. While he turned around my girlfriend, awake, got up grab the vase and smash it against Mr. Malfoy's head. He fell, but still conscious. I walk up to his body.

“Welcome to America, motherfucker!” I said punching Mr. Malfoy out.
