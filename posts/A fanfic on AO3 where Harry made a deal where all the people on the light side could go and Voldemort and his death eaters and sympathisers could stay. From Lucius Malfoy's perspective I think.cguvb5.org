Because of the inbreeding, it gets harder and harder to produce children, yet alone non squib ones. I remember it mentioned that Crabbe and Goyle were nothing compared to the new generation. They kidnap some people from other countries to get children. The halfbloods and muggleborns that made up a huge percentage of the workforce disappeare and the whole of magical England was in shambles. Harry and his friends bought an island where they lived happily for the rest of their lives. Thank you.
