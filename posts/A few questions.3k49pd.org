So while I was reading/searching for fics, the following questions came up and I wondered if I could get some answers from this community.

I often see fics with like a few hundred wordcount and ask myself. Why do the writers even bother? It's not like you can tell a tale in a few hundred words...

Where can I actually find/post challenges? Would it be alright to post them in this subredit?

Are there any fics out there that are similar to A Long Journey Home?


** I think you are referring to oneshots, which coukd be described as vignettes. Just a short scene. Many range from 1000-5000 words but some run under 1K words. Sometines it is just a absurd plot bunny that the authors pens on a whim. There are some seriously good oneshots though.

*** Yeah,but I'm not talking about obvious one-shots, because I understand those. But there are those fics that promise so much in the describtion that when I read I'm like "Oh yeah, how didn't I find this before? This sounds amazing!" and then I check out the wordcount and it's like 250 tops. Those are the ones I don't understand.

Did the story come to a resolution or just end abruptly? I'm guessing that's just an poor author who started a fic and abandoned it a day later. I've seen some writers with dozens of those in the profile.

***** I didn't even bother opening them. I guess they write the introduction then leave it there. To be honest I'm not much better, but I atleast write 5k+ and THEN abandon my stories XD

I don't know about that. Hemingway wrote one in six words. "For sale: baby shoes, never worn."

Most fanfiction of any length is junk. I haven't looked at a bunch of short stuff to judge, but I'd imagine it's a similar rate.

** There are short skits out there (forgot the actual name for them) which often only do one dialoge or scene.

Sometimes its also authros who're a bit more into posting their stories than actually writing them.

I think you can post challenges here. Another place are the countless fanfiction forums. Fanfiction.net being the biggest. Finding them is probably a thing to do in the forums and not on the sub.

** Yeah, I get what you mean. When you don't even have to scroll to complete the chapter, it's really odd, especially when they have loads of chapters. I think people just don't have enough patience and are eager to get feedback.

*** Having lots of smaller chapters is an easy way to get more hits and reviews.

Alternatively, or in addition to that, having daily updates with small chapters and the resulting daily deadlines can lead to a overall faster writing output. I noticed that during the "August fic a day" challenge myself.
