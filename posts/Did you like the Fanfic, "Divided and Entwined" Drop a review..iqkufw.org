*** I think that you are being unfair in that review... The 30 year war can be an interesting read if the author is good.

**** It can, there are certainly many war novels in the Muggle world, which are very good, but I am sorry to say it (I really liked “The Accidental Animagus” a lot) [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/another-comments-on-the-accidental-animagus-al.html][neither “Animagus at War“ nor “Divided and Entwined” are one of those]]. What I can discern from the great war novels (e.g., “For Whom the Bell Tolls”, “All Quiet on the Western Front” or my beloved “A Bell for Adano”) the key to writing a war novel is that you don't write about all those battles from the bird's eye view, but you just pick one (or few) characters and follow them through those battles never letting your eyes fly too high. Actually, if I understand it correctly (I have never read the whole book) “All Quiet on the Western Front” is written as the obvious critique of the top view (how down in the trenches the reality was very different).

Why then both of these fics let the personal stories (that's what I meant that I missing more talks about Neville × Hermione relationship, Harry catching a mouse, or the love triangle in “Divided and Entwined”) slide somewhere to the back burner and they are now mostly ignored? Those are the stories which are most interesting, newspaper-like descriptions of the battles should be left to newspapers (characters read them in the morning after the battle) and kept just to few paragraphs.

See also [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][this post]] about the structure of plot: the only thing which is interesting is how Harry, Hermione and others navigate through those battles, battles themselves can just stand as the background. And that is true even for the large Hollywood blockbuster war films. During the “Return of the King”, in The Battle of the Pelennor Fields all those giant elephants were just background for the real stories we are following: those of Théoden, Aragorn, Éowyn, or hobbits. Those little stories are the ones which carry whole emotional load of the story there (which is for example the reason why Legolas and Gandalf were so bland in that battle, despite all their jumping on the elephant or riding of the horse through the streets of Minas Tirith; they were just part of the background, there was too little of their own real story).

***** Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising (WWIII in the early 80s) manages some top down really well by having the PoV of a general who wasn't really on board with the war plan but then does his best to make everything work as intended. Or the captain of a ship whose convoy is attacked. And I've read a few decent top-down battles over on alternate history, but those also used a King's PoV rather than an omnipresent narrator.

But to be honest, the initial comment was mostly a joke with a nod towards the storytelling of Joakim Broden (the front man of Sabaton), who have an album about the 30y war and the Great Northern.

****** Yeah, the story of a general may be good way how to sneak in the top view to the personal story.

******* I don't know how you think I deliver top-down descriptions of battles - I write in 3rd person limited and I use both the fog of war and tunnel vision in battle. And Divided and Entwined is all about how the war affects the people involved - how some go from being decent people to bigoted murderers, and others avoid falling that low.

******** I am really sorry for not providing more thorough review of your story, but I would have dive into it and spend more time with it than I have, and more effort than I care about it, to be frank.

My overwhelming feeling from the story is the repetitive battle scenes were too similar, too impersonal, and after some time they began to be plainly boring. I think that the substory of the love triangle between Harry, Ron, and Hermione is dragged for too long without much life in it, and it seemed like missing a personal angle in whole story.

********* My issue isn't with your opinion on the battle scenes - that's your opinion, and you're entitled to it; tastes vary, I can't stand overly "duelling" battle scenes where everyone uses clever spells in the middle of combat, instead of sensible tactics - but I take issue with the claim that I write "top down" battles. That's not true. And as I said - the focus is on how the brutal civil war changes people. OC Aurors, Daphne and Tracey, Draco, Hermione, Harry, Ron, Fred and George - none of them go through the war unscathed, and all of them have to struggle with the temptation to take a few more steps on the road to hell. One character, for example, goes from opposing bigots to following Voldemort because of the war. Then you have muggleborns who become bigots. And then, when the war ends, all those people have to sort out the peace.

***** I would be interested to know if you've read Lady Archimedes, and if so, how the Battle of Hogwarts in that story compares with the one in Animagus at War.

****** That's a good question. It was some time I read Lady Archimedes (which I think is an excellent story) so I may not remember everything perfectly, but as far as I do, it was very personal story of Hermione (and some other minor characters, dimly remember Ron and Harry with Ginny; the battle with Bellatrix was something really memorable) and through those lens we saw the battle. Which is exactly what I meant as one good way how to approach this problem of non-personal battle.

Concerning Animagus at War, I don't have that many objections against the Battle of Hogwarts (there was some story of Harry), but I was really disappointed with The Battle of Prague (on the other hand, you have brownie points for noticing there are other cities in Europe than Paris, that is very rare; and of course, greetings from Prague!) and The Battle of Czarnoksiesto. I just cannot make myself care about those, and it seems I shouldn't care: they are just filling to drag good guys to deeper and deeper hole and trying to keep attention of readers for as long as possible (and not being too easy on good guys; this is just an opposite ... beating them down for no good reason whatsoever). The result is that I am just skipping over the last chapters, whether you stopped fooling around and started the story again. Apparently not yet.

I am sorry, if I am too discouraging, I don't meant to be. It is just my disappointment, how a good story fell short of my expectations (and I really liked the original Accidental Animagus, although it has some empty chapters as well ... I still don't understand what was the purpose of meeting between Harry and Dudley in the amusement park).
