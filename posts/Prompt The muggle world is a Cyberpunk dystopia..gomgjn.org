I think this would be a great idea for a fic. Cyberpunk is one of my favorite genres of Sci-fi, even though I disagree with some of it's political underpinings.

Harry and the others would grow up in very different parts of this society. Harry and the Dursleys being poor criminals, and Hermione as a rich daughter of a corporate head, etc. Ron of coruse would still be pureblood.

For those wondering, in this story magic does not effect electricity the same way as in canon. I really don't want Hermione and Harry dying as soon as they walk into Hogwarts.

What do you guys think?


** I've being trying to find a story like that for a long time. Sadly, this fandom dislikes scifi

*** If you're okay with crossovers, there's Harry Potter and the Illusions of Reality, the one and only HP-Matrix crossover. Not quite what [[/u/LordMacragge][u/LordMacragge]] described above, but it is sci-fi w/ HP and is a well written, interesting story. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4135485/chapters/9325320]])

  Harry has felt for a long time that there was something strange about the Muggle world. But when he begins receiving strange messages from the notorious mass murderer, Sirius Black, he begins to wonder if the Wizarding world is what he believed it to be. COMPLETE!

** That sounds pretty interesting. Especially if magitech was involved somehow.

** I'd read the shit out of it, especially if the whole magic v man made machines conflict is portrayed realistically.

Personally I would add a fake darker version of Harry taunting the MC Harry as a way to be a moral compass like Joker in Arkham Knight.

I love Cyberpunk as well, one of the coolest ideas to grace this planet.

You could just say that their own magic integrates the cybernetic components, so stuff that's a part of them still works, but any external devices they bring in don't.

I wouldn't necessarily make the Dursleys poor. If one makes things parallel to canon, Hermione is an only child (as far as we know) in a two-professional-income household, so I can see her being more moneyed than the Dursleys, but not categorically so. There might be differences such as Hermione's implants being less noticeable than those, say, Dudley, could get. The bigger difference is that Vernon probably wouldn't invest as much into Harry's enhancements as he would into Dudley's.

On the other hand, in these sorts of dystopias, "bosses" tend to be far more prosperous than "labour"---even professional labour. So, it's not implausible that Vernon makes an order of magnitude more than the Grangers put together, but if "dentists" translates to "cybernetic implant specialists", Hermione could end up being chock-full of experimental or grey-market tech or maybe be able to patch her implants' firmware on the fly, for better or for worse.

You know who would have be best stuff? Justin Finch-Fletchley, who was down for Eton and has a hyphenated name, both of which suggest some degree of nobility.

But, I think that a more interesting question is how /Hogwarts/ would change. Odds are, Harry's year wouldn't be the first year of cyborgs coming to Hogwarts. If their artificial eyes can see more colours, how does that affect Potions? What does it mean for the social dynamics when the Muggle-raised can suddenly think and remember faster and better than anyone else?
