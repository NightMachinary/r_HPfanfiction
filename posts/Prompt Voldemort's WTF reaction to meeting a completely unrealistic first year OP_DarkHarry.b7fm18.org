** Almost there! Dumbledore and the other teachers are distracted by the troll! I should have enough time to test the Stone's defenses!

"Hello Tom. Long time no see."

What the hell? Dumbledore? No, that sounded like a first year! But who would... "Potter!"

"That troll was pretty nasty. But did you really think it would be a match for me?"

Did he.. Impossible! No first year can defeat a troll!

"I see you're trying to get the Stone. I'm sure you understand that I can't let you do that."

He's threatening me? "Do you really think you can stop me, Potter? I am /LORD VOLDEMORT!/"

"And I'm the Boy-Who-Lived. Sounds weird, I know. Unlike you I didn't get to make a fancy anagram. But that doesn't matter, what does matter is that I'm prophesied to kill you and I can't let you attempt the Stone's defenses or Dumbledore might notice that I took it weeks ago."

Prophesied to kill me? This could be bad! I still have no idea what the second half of the prophecy says...

"But since the prophecy says that I will kill you and I can't do that if I'm dead, it implies that as long as I haven't killed you yet I'm effectively immortal, so you're more useful to me alive than dead. Very useful, and I didn't even have to split my soul for it. I'll let you get away with it this time, but if you ever try something foolish like this again or interfere with my plans you won't survive long enough to regret it."

This is ridiculous! I am the greatest Dark Lord Britain has ever seen and he's a first year threatening to kill me! "I won't run from some arrogant child! I am the Dark Lord! I am immortal! /Avada Kedavra!/"

What the... did he just stop the Killing Curse with his bare hand? Impossible! What the f***ing hell is going on here?

"Your mistake. By the way, your little trinkets won't do much to help you. I mean, seriously? Your mother's family's home? You couldn't have picked any less obvious spot? The only reason I haven't destroyed them yet is that they keep me alive in a way too."

How does he know? If he really has them all... This is a disaster! He could actually kill me! Anything but that! "What do you want, Potter?"

"I want to take over the world, obviously. If you are cooperative I might even let you have Britain. But for now, cover up this mess and keep up the harmless teacher persona. Don't try anything. I'll notify you when I have a mission for you!"

*** Hmmm.. I had never considered a Dark! or Powerful! Harry story where Voldemort becomes subservient to him. I wouldn't be surprised if one exists somewhere but still, the idea is intriguing. Especially if it's less dark and more powerful based and Voldemort just realizes that it's better to gain some power under Harry than be dead.

*** It really doesn't. HJPEV may be significantly smarter than canon!Harry, but HPMoR!Voldemort is just as intelligent and far more experienced.

**** Prompt doesn't say Voldemort has to be canon Voldemort, this is definitely /a/ Voldemort's reaction to a completely unrealistic OP Harry.

***** If you'd said "sounds a little like Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres," I'd be fine with that; but you specifically referred to the story, and no confrontation like this occurs in HPMoR.

*** Judging by the OP's own prompt fill, you'd be right, but I originally interpreted the prompt a little differently. I thought Voldemort would be reacting to how stupid the concept is.
