**** Yeah, I like next-gen but don't like romance-centered stories in general.

This is really good stuff. The romance is minimally cringey and actually drives the plot, and vice versa, rather than those two things being disparate.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.
