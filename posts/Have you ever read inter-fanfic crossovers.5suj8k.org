** Well if you're familiar with the Spacebattles & Sufficient Velocity websites, there is a whole craze about Planetary Annihilation/Multicross Self-Insert fanfics where the author inserts themselves into the body of a Von-Neumann type machine called a "Commander" and goes traipsing about the multiverse (Warhammer, Halo, Stargate and a helluva more) fucking shit up. It was started by Drich, and taken up by others like Tiki Tau, Torroar, Fusou, Faith. Now the above five basically have the largest and oldest fanfics of this type, and are pretty famous for them, and they've gotten together, and have started merging their stories into one storyline (each of them has like a hundred chapters written; Drich has like 200-300). So your idea of merging with a friend definitely wouldn't be unique, or even close to a big project, but it could turn out great. I'd say go for it. I can't link you since I'm on my phone, but just Google something along the lines of "PA multicross SI." You'll get a fuckload of fanfics and the trick is separating the crap from the gold. Have fun, and good luck with your story :)

** Check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1318815/The-Carnivorous-Muffin][The Carnivorous Muffin]]'s works. She writes a good number of stories and has written crossovers between her different stories. The crossovers are noted in the summary, so they should be easy enough to find.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/users/copperbadge][Copperbadge]] has also written crossovers using [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/scifigrl47/pseuds/scifigrl47][scifigrl47]]'s Marvel OC character DJ with his own Izzyverse (another Marvel OC). They're the last two fics of [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/141054][The Izzy Chronicles]]. You can find DJ in the series [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/18990][Tales of the Bots]].

** Only fanfic like that I know of was a Mass Effect SI that crossed over with the Masses to Masses fic 'verse. Don't remember much of it, to be honest.

** I've read a Percy Jackson fic where multiple Percy Jackson's from different fanfics came to help fight and one of them got a lot more fleshed out than the rest

** Oh! In "Unbuttoned" by lastcrazyhorn a version of Snape from another fic appears to give this Snape advice, (at least, I think it was Unbuttoned? I know it was one of lastcrazyhorn's fics). I've also seen a fic special she wrote for Snape's birthday that featured every Harry from her fics coming to celebrate.

** Crossovers of specific fanfics, I've never read that. If you're interest in general fanfic crossovers, I'd look into linkffn(dimension hopping for beginners).

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

** I've never read one, but I think about it sometimes. In dimensional hop fics what if instead of canon Harry they got the Harry from X fic.

** Oh! I remember one which is over 10 years old by now ( have I really been reading Harry Potter fan fics so long?).

linkffn(Complicated by Neurotica) is a cross over story of the Dangerverse by Whydoyouneedtoknow and Neurotica's Truth's Universe.

Also, whydoyouneedtoknow also wrote a cross over story between those two universes. linkffn(Dangerous Truths by whydoyouneedtoknow) .
