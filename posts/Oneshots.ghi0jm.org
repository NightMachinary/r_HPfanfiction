Been looking lately for some good fics that I could conceivably complete in one sitting, so what are your favorite one-shots and other short stories? Drama, Crack, it doesn't particularly matter so long as it's something you enjoyed and it's on the short side.


** I got a nice list of one-shots, and depending on how fast you read and how long the sitting could be read in such a time.

Chopping Wood - linkffn(13576920) - An interesting story that starts out somewhat innocent but has an darker undertone to it.

The Kiss - linkffn(13313966) - A short and sweet Haphne story.

Fever - linkffn(13441078) - A Frozen Crossover that is very interesting and well done.

Family - It's in the Blood - linkffn(13292346) - One of the longer one-shots but it is a good read.

The Dark Lady Tonks - linkffn(12998962) - A fun crack story about Tonks.

The Dark Lady Potter - Black - linkffn(13008507) - And its fun sequel.

Ice Cream - linkffn(13323518) - A sweet and ice cream filled story that is really well done. A personal favorite.

Twins - linkffn(13491812) - An odd pairing story that is very interesting and entertaining.

The Assassin Wore White - linkffn(10071063) - A unique fic that brings a whole new meaning to the Healer's Oath.

Dancing in the Green - linkffn(11703507) - A long one-shot that explores the fourth year and develops an good and entertaining story. Another favorite of mine.

  Anna's birthday was supposed to be perfect. The last thing the Queen of Arendelle wanted was to end up sick and helpless on her sisters big day. Then again, if she hadn't been, she would have never met the green-eyed Wizard and his owl. Coming to the realisation that she wasn't as alone in the world as she thought could really take it out of a person.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.

  Cho cried and she survived Pansy Parkinson's cruel jabs about a dead boy. She wept and she passed all her classes, kept up with Quidditch, watched fairweather friends scatter in the cold wind. She got very good at wordlessly summoning tissues and she joined the DA against her parents' wishes.They had told her to behave, begged her, ordered her, as the threatening darknesses of the world clung close even inside Hogwarts, and Cho walked out to the little pub in Hogsmeade and wrote her name down on Hermione's list.I hope someone in the DA told Cho that she ought to have been in Gryffindor. I hope she laughed at them, hard. Integrity. Truth. Honor. Dedication. These were the tenets of her House, of the blue and the bronze, the eagle called raven (called nerd, called stuck-up, called so many things that were not their names). Bravery was only one way to be a hero.

  The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it.OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.

  Harry wanted to be outraged on behalf of the castle that he still considered to be his home. Hogwarts didn't deserve to have a piece of Tom Riddle lodged inside it like a particularly vicious splinter. But there was something he was annoyed about even more than the fact that he was once again alive at the same time as a once and future dark lord. For the first time in his life, he sympathized with Voldemort, and knew that in this one instance, Voldemort might sympathize with him. Harry looked at Tom head-on, and said, "Albus Dumbledore is a bastard."*Both turned down for the position of Hogwarts DADA professor, Tom and Harry have a few things to say to each other.

He drew Snape as Headmaster, his sneer easy after seven years of notebook margin practice. Dean drew the Dark Mark over London's skyline and he left his work nailed up around Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Godric's Hollow. He signed his name. He had things he wanted to say. There were long days when he didn't talk to anyone-- walking old fields and long roads, sleeping in haystacks. There were long weeks when he only talked to strangers-- passersby, shop owners, sympathizers, snatchers who he traded curses with. He drew the Gryffindor Common Room, hearths all ablaze. He listened to Lee Jordan's radio show on the crackling airwaves. He drew his little sisters, who had gone to France with his mother and father. He drew faces from the darkened boys' dormitory-- Harry's long bangs hiding his scar, Neville practicing his dance moves for the Yule Ball, Ron asleep with his head on his thick Weasley sweater, Seamus grinning at him over a three a.m. game of cards.

  Prompt: What about Lupin? Lupin, who lost everything the night James and Lily died, who forgave Sirius, who died in battle?--When they told him the news about Lily and James, Lupin finished the mission he was on before he went to Godric's Hollow. He stood in front of the Potters' ruined home and fell apart in the cold streets. He picked the pieces up, slowly, over years and years.In the first half hour, he remembered how to breathe. He picked up his composure sometime the next week. He patched together nights of sleep. Sometimes the stitching couldn't hold; sometimes he couldn't pull himself out of bed in the morning.Remus kept picking himself up and patching himself together. Today, he walked by a beautiful woman with long red hair and when she laughed he didn't flinch with sorrow. Today, he made a joke, the kind James would have collapsed at and Sirius would have smirked at. Remus patched himself together, scars and sorrows, kindnesses and chocolate. We are the ways we rebuild ourselves.(a brief, rambling character study of Remus Lupin)

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Faith and Understanding]] by Lethe Laguz

This is the chronicle of Ginny's friendship with Luna, with Ginny's musings therein.

It's funny, it's heartfelt, it's goofy, it's sweet. Ginny and Luna argue and tease and confide in one another.

This is my favorite one-shot Harry Potter fanfic ever. The closings lines are absolutely beautiful:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

  Regulus wishes -- sometimes, not too often -- that he were like Sirius, able to make things up on the spot. Sirius says he has never seen a single bloody thing in his tea leaves, or his cards, or his palms, in the milky depths of a crystal ball or the glistening entrails of a dead pigeon. He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes. He really did deserve that P in Divination. - Or: Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways.
