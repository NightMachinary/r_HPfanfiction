This fanfiction was SO good, but I've completely forgotten the name. From what I can remember, Ginny is sorted into Slytherin and develops powers after her familys trip to Egypt. Something about a series of rings and goddesses? It was HarryXGinny, with Draco being another important character. Absurdly great, impossible to find. Any ideas?


** The Unforgettable Fire by The Labris.

It's hard to find because it got taken down from FFN. [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/1232217/1][I found it on fictionhunt.com though.]]
