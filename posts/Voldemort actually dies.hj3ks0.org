I'd love to read some fics where Voldemort ACTUALLY dies the night at Godric's Hollow but Harry's parents are still dead. Maybe Sirius isn't in Azkaban or the Longbottoms don't get tortured, but Harry is still an orphan. Thanks!


** There are zillion bad things about linkffn(6439871), but Tom's death is not one of them. He really should ... NO SPOILERS!

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

** So this isn't quite what you asked for, but it's a brilliant fic and I would totally recommend it. Voldemort doesn't actually die for good, but he isn't the big bad of the story anymore linkffn(11773877)

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
