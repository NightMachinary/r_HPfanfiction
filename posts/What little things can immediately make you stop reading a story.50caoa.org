For me it would when people forget about silent casting especially if Harry is an auror or MOD, if he's an adult he should be able to silent cast. Also what I refer to as lazy magic, with your google translated Latin spell, with that there's no obstacle that can stop Harry. Oh Please.

** 1. 'Dont like, Don't read.'

2. When the author thinks it's a good idea to do a crossover with a bunch of different things

3. Bad grammar, and huge blocks of text

4. Repetitive use of events copied from other stories. It's been copied so many times you don't even know who did it first. Like...Dumbledore bashing! I honestly don't care who you choose to destroy as a character but what I want is that it is somewhat believable and it is done in a creative way.

5. When the author puts 99% effort in the summary and 1% in the story making it a good click bait but a terrible story. Disappoints me a lot because apparently the author is creative enough but isn't willing to put in that extra mile for the story.

Not saying it's impossible but on my story I definitely sat there looking blanking at the summary box for 10-15 minutes trying to figure out what to say and re-writing it several times.

**** Uhh i know, people are so unimaginative with animagus forms in general. Too be quite honest i think a Wolf suits canon Harry pretty well but it's just so boring.

There was one time travel fic i can't recall the name of where Harry's form was a hummingbird and i loved the fic just for that because it was the first time Harry wasn't something immensely useful and covert.

There are so many possibilities for forms that just never get explored simply because the authors want to take the easy way. Honestly i think most wizards don't bother with animagus training because their forms are useless and the whole thing is a waste of time and yet there are so many fics that give literally everyone some kind of cat, bird or dog that can be used in fights.

Anyway i can usually live with reading about the same forms over and over but if you give Harry a Phoenix form i'm not even gonna bother. Hell, it's gotten to the point that a normal Phoenix isn't even enough for these people. It has to be a Lighting Phoenix or a Shadow Panther or some equally ridiculously overpowered magical creature.

*** I don't think this qualifies as a "little thing." You're describing character voice, and it's a major element of writing skill and characterization.

I agree that it can make or break a story, but it's not just a minor choice that the author made that could be fixed with a quick rewrite. It's a fundamental lack of skill, knowledge and understanding of the characters (an attention to detail, sure).

I've worked on this a ton, and it's not a quick fix. Took me months to establish a distinct tone for the characters in a two person scene. The result was great, but it was a slog.

I had to work with experienced authors, who understood the characters I was writing and could tell me where I fouled up by making them act out of character or say something that sounded odd coming from them.

** 1. Just dialogue, no prose.

2. When paragraphs are not properly spaced and/or the paragraphs are never more than two sentences.

3. Summary: "I suck at summaries, sorry."

4. "You" perspective.

5. Poorly written. This isn't so much about grammar and composition. It's more about whether or not I can read it without cringing at the cheesiness or over simplified prose.
