** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave]] This series does this very well. There are a few dozen 'Lords' and 'Ladies' who are much stronger than ordinary wizards and witches and have unique powers, Harry, Voldemort, and Dumbledore are three of them.

**** It's not exactly clear, most of the other Lords and Ladies aren't involved that much in the story. Don't want to spoil it, but Harry and Voldemort share a special ability that makes them a step above everyone else, although in raw power, Voldemort is a clear #1 for much of the story (once he comes back).

** linkffn(6995114) I've read this multiple times and even now I enjoy it. Might not be for some people with elements taken from other sources (primarily Nasuverse & Naruto).

In particular to your desire for a super-wizard I'll post a speech given by Moody (picture because FFN sucks for copying). [[https://i.imgur.com/GDyfYLd.png][Link]]

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351]] - Holly at Hogwarts Series. The main character (Holly) is Dudley's daughter and has unique powers. A couple of things I love about the series (really trying to not give too many spoilers): Dudley is not entirely open-minded about the whole thing. While over-powered in many ways it's fun to watch Holly wrestle with learning new magic (so yeah, she has a cool power, but she has to learn to use it). The author plays with some ideas in different ways that are really intriguing to me (time travel). Also, Holly has a brother and it's pretty interesting to see her interact with her muggle brother.

The only thing I don't like about it is that the author consistently misspells one of the spells (can't remember which for the life of me).
