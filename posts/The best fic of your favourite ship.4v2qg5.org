I want you to make me believe in your ship by recommending the best fic from that pairing. It can be as outrageously AU as it wants to as long as it's well written. Slash is most certainly welcome.

*** A great HHR, [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Years_of_Rebellion/Through_The_Looking_Glass/][Years of Rebellion]].

The best Hhr fic and one of the best realized fics to date. The "redux" diluted some of the fun, but this is what fan fiction was when fans awaited the final installments. Book six and seven hadn't come along, and the story still had some legs.

** I notice a serious lack of slash... So!

HP/SS linkao3(304714) Chrysalis - Probably one of my favorite Snarry fics. Takes place after the end of the war, and Harry is has PTSD, and the way his PTSD is written makes me think that the author suffers from (or knows someone who suffers from) an anxiety disorder of some sort. It's beautifully written. The only downside is that the whole thing is posted as one chapter, which makes it hard to keep your place. But regardless, even if you don't even look at any of the others I rec, read this one. It actually might be my favorite fic period, lol.

linkao3(2457953) The Most Powerful Magic - Really cute fic, takes place many years after the war, involves Harry's canon kids, but he and Ginny have been split for a while because, you know, Harry likes guys better lol. I love Sev's interactions with Albus, and the whole thing is just kinda sweet.

linkffn(7117395) Secrets of Midnight - I love this fic, not sure why, but just a warning, Harry is 15 at the beginning, but the story does cover several years if I remember right.

HP/LV linkffn(8149841) Again and Again - My personal favorite HP/TR, I love the way Harry is portrayed, and any OOCness is actually explained in a way that totally makes sense. It's not finished, but I don't think it's abandoned. And the smut is HOT!

linkffn(2032067) Abandon - One of my favs, though the Dark Lord is pretty OOC, but it's cute. The first like 3 or 4 chapters are insanely short and a bit rough, but after that it's great (and those chapters are so short you can read them in like 15 minutes or less lol)

linkffn(6985795) Xerosis - Honestly, very similar to Again and Again, which is probably why I loved it, but it's faster paced, completed, and just as well written.

May these keep you busy for a while!

It also really allows you to sink into the HBP build up of H/G in a way that's really rewarding and satisfying.
