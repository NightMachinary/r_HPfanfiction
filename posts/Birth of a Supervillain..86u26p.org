Harry Potter set down his drink and turned to his friends, commonly known as the Ministry Six.

A half-decade of years past Hogwarts, Harry had come to a decision during the trial of a former Death Eater who had recently been arrested again for muggle baiting.

"I am going to become a super villain."

Hermione pinched the bridge of her nose as the rest just eyed their drinks wondering if they had been spiked. "Okay, I'll bite. Why?"

"I was able to sneak a subclause into the latest amendment to the statute," he told her, handing it to her.

The others grouped around Hermione as she read though Ron mostly did it to get closer to his wife and fondle her discreetly.

Hermione gasped. "You've gotten yourself permission to reveal yourself to the muggles alongside one other?"

"Yep. I'll be a supervillain. They'll be the superhero who opposes me. But not as Harry Potter or whoever elects to be the hero---and I'm thinking Dean should do it."

"Why my husband?" Ginny asked.

"He's comfortable in both worlds and I'm thinking his personal should make use of his excellent imagination to counter my mad scientist persona. Speaking of, Hermione, I want you to be my lieutenant."

"What about me?" Ron asked.

"I got you season tickets to the Cannons if you don't try to help," Harry said with a grin on his face. "With invites to training camps."

"Deal! Just make sure my wife comes home safely." Everyone laughed.

Hermione sighed again but nodded. Life had gotten somewhat boring. All her social work had been realized now by a number of new Ministry Departments. "Okay, but I'm designing my costume, not gonna wear a metallic bikini."

"You wore one last week," Ron reminded her.

"Yes, on vacation in France, not in London."

"Actually, you did."

"Working on my tan in our backyard doesn't count," she snapped.

Hermione changed the conversation. "Where's Gabrielle?" Though she wasn't part of the group, she usually came to the quarterly meetings now that she and Harry were married.

"She's researching what my mistress should wear in public."

Hermione raised an eyebrow, deciding not to ask more. Gabrielle was a burgeoning supermodel in France and often wore scandalous outfits, at least when they were all in muggle areas. "So how're you going to get minions?"

"Well your dad already volunteered as my chief enforcer and master torturer when I asked for his input but I figured my legion of doom will be synthetics. Golems. Animated armor or something. Dunno yet."

Hermione rolled her eyes. Of course her dad was involved. He and Harry were the best of friends now, golfing, shooting, and hunting together all the time. She wished Ron and her dad were that close but aside from her, they had little in common.

** Harry and Dean would then proceed to cause lots of property damages, and Ron (or George) would buy them on the cheap and flip them at market price after fixing them up with magic.
