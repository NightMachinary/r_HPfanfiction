Hey, I've been wondering if anyone knew of a fanfiction Remus/Tonks based on J.K.Rowling's "recent" release of the Remus Lupin background story.

"It had never occurred to Remus that Tonks could return his feelings because he had become so used to considering himself unclean and unworthy. One night when they lay in hiding outside a known Death Eater's house, after a year of increasingly warm friendship, Tonks made an idle remark about one of their fellow Order members (‘He's still handsome, isn't he, even after Azkaban?'). Before he could stop himself, Remus had replied bitterly that he supposed she had fallen for his old friend (‘He always got the women.'). At this, Tonks became suddenly angry. ‘You'd know perfectly well who I've fallen for, if you weren't too busy feeling sorry for yourself to notice.'"

Seriously, this i such a good inspiration. Why haven't I found anything? I would be so happy if anyone could tip me. :)


** Something exactly like this situation happens in MarauderLover7 Innocent Saga, Let me see if i can find the excerpt

Found it! this the chapter [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/67/Innocent]]

#+begin_quote
  It happened in mid-October, a few days after that odd afternoon when Sirius hurried off to the Ministry after all of the talk about prisons.

  Tonks had had an early morning training session, and found herself at Remus' only a few hours later. He didn't have anything planned; the full moon was rapidly approaching, so he was taking things carefully. He offered her half of his late breakfast and they took their food outside to eat in the sunny garden.

  They set their plates down when they were done -- ants moved in within ten minutes, but Remus didn't appear to mind -- and neither were overly fussed about moving inside. Tonks started plucking grass -- and was promptly told off -- and so she lay down instead. After a moment's hesitation, Remus lay down beside her -- somehow managing to look very awkward as he did so - and Tonks smiled, without taking her eyes off the clouds.

  It was silent, but companionable; Remus' breathing slowed, and his eyes slipped shut, but she didn't think he was asleep, just very relaxed. Tonk was rather relaxed too, and her mind wandered as she watched the sky.

  Ben and Yaxley were buying a flat together; Yaxley's parents weren't impressed (Ben was a Gryffindor, and a half-blood at that) but they were going ahead with it anyway, they'd announced that morning. Tonks had about as much interest in decorating as Ben -- who'd confided that he was leaving that to his girlfriend -- but the idea of moving out had affixed itself in her mind more strongly than she'd realised.

  Not because she actually wanted to move out - while she had the money, she wasn't in any rush to leave Mum and Dad, and have to fend for herself entirely -- but because she'd been fleetingly curious about what it would be like to live with someone that wasn't one of her parents. Remus, specifically.

  And, she knew it was far, far too soon to even consider that; they'd been good friends for over a year now, and she fancied him, but he didn't even know that (or at least she didn't think he did) and even if they were dating, moving in together was a big step. It was an entirely irrational and impractical idea, and one that had only passed through her mind briefly, before she'd expelled it, mortified.

  But her mortification had remained, and it cropped up every time she was around Remus (which was rather regularly). It had encouraged her to redefine her feelings for him, yet again. It had been a month and a half since she'd decided she'd fancied him, and, while she didn't love him -- well, she loved him as a friend -- she was definitely well on her way to falling for him.

  And you don't even know, she sighed, glancing in his direction. She hadn't the faintest idea how to tell him, and she'd spent more time than was probably healthy trying to work out how to go about it. Usually, she'd just announce it, or kiss him -- both of those were pretty obvious giveaways -- but Remus was... different. Or maybe Tonks was just shyer around him than she had been around any of her other -- rather short-lived boyfriends. Either way, she was driving herself to distraction trying to work it out.

  She'd even considered asking Sirius for help, but didn't think she could stand the mockery that would probably come from such a talk. And she didn't even know how she'd go about that conversation... So... I sort of fancy your best friend...

  It was only when Remus stiffened and opened one eye that Tonks realised she'd spoken out loud. She clapped her hands to her mouth, and felt her hair turn a brighter pink than it had probably ever been before.

  "He always did get the girls," Remus said quietly. He'd pushed himself into a sitting position, and his shoulders had a resigned sort of slump to them. He was staring very hard at the grass by his feet.

  "Not-" Tonks cut herself off, and then forced herself to speak; she'd be embarrassed, of course, but she couldn't leave things the way they were. She definitely couldn't let him think she fancied Sirius; they were second cousins, after all, and while it was strictly legal (particularly for purebloods) the idea freaked her out. "Not your best friend. Sirius'. Sirius' best friend." Remus had gone very still.

  "I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about," Remus said, very politely.

  "I fancy Sirius' best friend!" she blurted. "I fancy-"

  "Those plates have ants on them," Remus said, clucking his tongue. He gathered them up quickly and then got to his feet and hurried inside.

  Now I've done it, Tonks thought miserably. She hauled herself to her feet and headed for the door. "Remus, I'm sorry, I just-"

  Only Remus wasn't there; he wasn't in the kitchen (and neither, she noticed, were the plates), and he wasn't in his bedroom, or in the bathroom. Tonks was almost relieved that he'd left; he wasn't there to see the tears start.
