Can anyone recommend any FF that picks up after the Battle of Hogwarts.

I prefer ones that are closest to canon ( disregarding Cursed Child)


** fics from little0bird are decent. there is one that starts after the battle. Dont remember the name.

​

Unnecessary trivia no one asked for: i credit little0bird for my foray into fanfiction reading.

*** Same goes for me. Little0bird initiated me into fan fiction too. I think you're referring to linkffn( the first day)

**** Yeah. I think that is the name. little0bird's fics are mostly connected. The post epilogue ones. There are so many of them. cutesy one shots. Real stories of what the ptsd would have been like. I just seriously love that author.

** linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh)

This isn't quite the normal fic but it follows what we know about canon but from a totally different perspective.

FloreatCastellum (on ao3) has some really good series that follow canon and then has tons of one-shots listed on their Tumblr.

** Northumbrian has written over 80 fics set post Hogwarts, and they all build on each other. Everything he wrote is headcanon for me. His writing in general is amazing, and I love his characterisations of minor characters

Strangers at Drakeshaugh is good, but the best place to start is Tales of the battle in my opinion.

** This technically covers the Battle as well, but it has enough action just afterward to be interesting.

It's sorta canon-ish, but also takes a certain veering away from it that I think will be relatively unique.

** linkffn(The Aurors by FloreatCastellum) is awesome. It is one of the best post-Hogwarts fics I've seen purely in terms of characterization and the suspense is amazing as well.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.
