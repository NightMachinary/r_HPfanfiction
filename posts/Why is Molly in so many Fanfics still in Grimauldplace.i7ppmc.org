Hey Guys and Gals

Can anyone tell my why the f*ck Sirius allows Molly to stay in Grimauldplace in most fanfics?

Many Fics have the, by now already classic, Weasley bashing and portray Molly as a controlling c*nt that tells Sirius the OWNER AND LORD OF THE HOUSE how to behave and what to say and do, yet never does Sirius have a backbone and just kicks at least molly out or makes sure she minds her own business...

More often than not we have a situation where some of the members of the order are unhappy with dumbles and his decisions or want to help harry in someway and thus disagree with Dumbles.

Every time they then describe Molly to "Scream like a banshee" and admonish them all for disagreeing with "the great and infallible" Albus Dumbledore, yet there are close to no Fanfics where the "Opposition" either decides that enough is enough and they dont want Molly or Snape or McG or... to stay there anymore or at least manages to make Dumbles see things their way and try to really be the Great good Guy that he was originally intended to be....

​

What is all your opinion on this matter?

​

Kudos!


** I'm fairly sure that the fics that do that are simply expanding on their take on Molly's actions and words during parts of Chapters 5-9 of OOTP.

This is not a comment on whether she was right or not, but there are definitely points in those chapters which could be used as the basis for the way she acts and speaks in those particular fanfics.

  ‘I've been meaning to tell you, Sirius, there's something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room, it keeps rattling and shaking. Of course, it could just be a Boggart, but I thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at it before we let it out.'

  ‘Whatever you like,' said Sirius indifferently.

  ‘The curtains in there are full of Doxys, too,' Mrs Weasley went on. ‘I thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow.' ‘I look forward to it,' said Sirius. Harry heard the sarcasm in his voice, but he was not sure that anyone else did.

  ‘And they're quite right,' said Mrs Weasley. ‘You're too young.'

  She was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists clenched on its arms, every trace of drowsiness gone.

  ‘Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to ask questions?' asked Sirius. ‘Harry's been trapped in that Muggle house for a month. He's got the right to know what's been happen---'

  ‘Which bit?' Sirius asked politely, but with the air of a man readying himself for a fight.

  ‘The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know,' said Mrs Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words.

  ‘What's wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, however much you might look like him!' said Mrs Weasley, her eyes still boring into Sirius. ‘You are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it!'

*** I think OP's question is more why that particular bit of canon is copied when the author is already bashing the Weasleys.

And to be perfectly honest, the last sentence ought to be reason enough to never talk to Molly again. Victim blaming someone for unlawful incarceration in what has to be the worst prison on earth, for having to endure dementors for a decade through no fault of his own.

(As Pettigrew demonstrated rather well with his ONE spell, he was a clear and present danger and therefore it is not deplorable that Sirius tried to track him down after ensuring Harry's supposedly temporary safety)

** I mean, even if you're writing a story that's bashing Molly, Dumbledore, and whoever else is in the Order and they're all genuinely twatbags within that story, they're still in the Order.

If you're a vigilante group fighting against a government mostly controlled by a terrorist group, not liking people is kind of a silly reason to stop working together. You're trying to stop Wizard Hitler, fighting amongst yourselves when you're the only ones fighting at all is just a quick path to failure and Voldemort ruling the world eternally. Canonically, they even work constantly with Snape despite the man literally being in the Wizard KKK as a kid and the whole Nearly-getting-eaten-by-Remus Drama. They have more important concerns than bickering, basically.

** I think it's better to ignore the "bashed" Molly we see in most fanfics (looking for logic in these fics in pointless anyways), and focus on the Canon character. In canon, Sirius does not throw Molly out of the House because they are both mature adult that, despite their differences, have both only the best of Harrys interest in mind.

Molly (and all the Weasleys in general, save Percy) agreed to put their own life at risk to protect Harry and fight Voldemort. A minor disagreement about what informations they should give to Harry does not even begin to compare to that. Especially when, in the case of Sirius, his opinion is clearly minority among the members of the Order, even if Molly is his most vocal opponent.

I also think that both of them have fair points in their arguments. Sirius want to treat Harry based on his deeds, and consider that surviving Voldemort gives him the right to know things. While Molly want to treat Harry based on his age, and thinks he is still a child that should be protected. Technically, they are both right.\\
Molly is also afraid that any information given to Harry would be known by her children (over which she has authority), which is a 100% valid concern.

More like unforgivable insult tbh. If Sirius got busted with, I don't know, two tons of wizard's meth her remark would be understandable, but she is basically victim blaming Sirius for being illegally incarcerated and tortured by dementors for a decade.

I think we don't have the same opinion on this scene. While I agree that Molly went too far with this insult, I think she made a valid point. Sirius could not take care of Harry during his childhood, because he had been sent to Azkaban. And even if he was sent there after being framed by Pettigrew, he put himself in the position to be framed in the first place.

I'm the first person to say that Dumbledore made the right call when he placed Harry with the Dursley. He may have knowingly condomned Harry to 10 dark and difficult years, but he did it to ensure that Harry grew up alive, and as well adjusted as possible (which would have been difficult in the magical world, considering his fame). And I think that what happened in canon proved him right (I'm pretty sure Harry would have died at the end of PS without the protection brought by his life with the Dursley).

That being said, Sirius didn't know any of that. As far as I'm concerned, he had a choice between keeping the promise he made to his friends to keep their children safe, or try to avenge them, and he chose the later.

As far as I'm concerned, there was no good end for Sirius the moment he gave Harry to Hagrid. Ever he failed to kill Peter (which was his goal) and end up framed as the Death Eater who betrayed the Potter, or he manages to do it . . . and end up in the same situation (except maybe the murder of the muggles).\\
What he should have done is directly go to Dumbledore to explain his side of the story. Unlike the Ministry, Dumbledore would have at least listened to him and probably verify his claims, and it's unlikely that Peter would have managed to escape him.

So yes, Molly went too far but it's not like Sirius is 100% innocent ever. His trip to Azkaban is at least partially due to his actions.

​

Also, I would want to come back to the illegally incarcerated part. I'm not sure that Sirius was "illegaly incarcerated", a court could have condemned him in his absences (in their opinion there were probably more than enough evidences), or Crouch "War Time Power" could have permitted him to send someone to jail without a Trial. And anyways, even if he was, I don't think that it changes anything.

In the case of Sirius, I don't think a trial would have changed anything to his situation. The court would have plenty of evidence to use against him (Albus testimony that he was the Potter Secret Keeper, Pettigrew last words, the death of all the Muggles, even his family reputation), and the only thing Sirius could have used to defend himself in a pretty outlandish tale.\\
I don't think /anyone/ would have believed Sirius if he had told his side of the story. I know people like to throw "Veritaserum" as a problem solver, but even when ignoring the obvious ethical troubles brought by this potion, I don't think it would have worked:

- Rowling explained (on Pottermore so outside of canon, I admit) that it was possible to "fool" the potion (seal your own trope, change it in water . . .)
- Sirius dissapeared during 5 days before being arrested. In a world where Oblivator and Mind Manipulation exist, it's more than enough to make believe anything.
- People thought he was Voldemort right hand man. You just need someone to yell "Voldemort must have taught him some tricks" during the trial to have everyone distruss him even after taking the potion.

Unless caught Pettigrew and forced him to admit he was the Secret Keeper and the traitor, Sirius would have been 100% condemned if he got a trial. If anything, the trial could have turned into a political propaganda where Sirius is turned into a scapegoat for Voldemort and given the Kiss. Or the fact that he is an animagus would have become known and precautions would have been taken, stopping him from escaping in PoA.

***** Under normal circumstances what Sirius attempted to do would be called self defence since he rightly assumed that Pettigrew was dangerous and quick to throw lethal curses around. Basically every legalisation allows lethal force in self defence if the other side tries to kill you, certainly British law does.

Ideally, Sirius kills Pettigrew (given Pettigrew's choice of spell it would be reasonable force), is interrogated, cleared on the grounds of reasonable force and imminent danger and then takes Harry in.

There is just no way the "Self Defense" argument would work. Sirius tracked Pettigrew and cornered him into an alley, declaring his intent to kill him while Pettigrew was desperatly trying to escape, if anything /Sirius/ would be the imminent danger.

As I said before, I don't think Sirius getting a trial would change anything to his situation. People would have a lot of reason to distrust him (including the testimony of several trusfull member of society, including Dumbledore who could all swear that Sirius was the Secret Keeper and thus, the only person in position to betray the Potter), and he doesn't have tangible evidence to support his claim that they switched the Secret Keeper. It would be a different story if he had caught Pettigrew alive, but in your scenario, he is dead.

And even if, by some miracle, Sirius manage to convince a jury that he is not a Death Eater, and didn't betray the Potter, there would still be several charges against him :

- Murder : Pettigrew being a Death Eater does not justify tracking him for days and killing him in broad daylight. The legal course of action would have been to contact the Aurors, give them every usefull informations, and let them do their job.
- Breaking of the Statute: To kill Pettigrew, Sirius would have had to use a spell, in a street full of Muggle, willingly breaking the Statute of Secrecy. Considering that maintaining the Statute is the Ministry main job, I doubt they would have liked that.
- Unregistered Animagus : I doubt Sirius could have maintained his secret while in a trial, and being an Unregistered Animagus in enough to be sent for some time in Azkaban.

I'm not sure all of these charges would have stood, but it is very likely that Sirius would have been sent in Azkaban for some time (months, if not years). Once out, Harry situation would already have settled and I doubt he would have been able to obtain his guardianship (especially since a lot of people would want to get Harry, and all could use his recent incarceration against him).

Or Sirius bravely tracked a terrorist down in an attempt to stop further harm because Pettigrew had directly aided the public enemy number one while the Ministry failed for years to do anything consequential and was about to fall.

Any law student with two brain cells could get Sirius off under the circumstances of that time.

It is clearly established that the magical law enforcement is a joke. Umbridge used that department for political assassinations of a child and no one batted an eye while its previous head broke out a convicted death eater. Also, from what we have heard the Ministry was about to fall to Voldemort and the attack on the Longbottoms shows that they did not have things under control in the aftermath of October 31st.

Calling the law is only a viable option if there is an agency worth its name.

**** The answer is simple, because it is fanfiction. The fanon Molly that "screams like a banshee" is a bashed character, and as all the others characters, she doesn't make any sense and only behave like this because the author want to add some cheap drama.

How can Manipulative! Dumbledore could still be considered as "The Leader of the Light" when he is basically worse than Voldemort, and pretty much all of his plots can be thwarted by a motivated 15 years old? How could Death Eater! Ron even managed to become friend with Harry in the first place since he is worse than canon Malfoy in every way and doesn't even try to hide it?

As far as I'm concerned, as long as a fic bashes character, you can either close the tab, or read the future trainwreck as a guilty pleasure.
