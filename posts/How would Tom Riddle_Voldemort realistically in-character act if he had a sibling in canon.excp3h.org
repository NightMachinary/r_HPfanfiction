I have my own headcanon, personally, but I was curious as to what others think.

I'm sorry if this discussion has already been made. I searched and couldn't find it on this sub.


** Kill them. He's obsessed with his slytherin heritage because he wants to feel "special". He's just a little less special if he has a sibling that also shares his heritage.

*** but your forgetting he would grow up with them which would change his mindset

I imagine he would be super protective of his sibling

*** I agree - the only possible way Tom has a sibling would be an older one as Merope dies while giving birth to Tom. Tom wouldn‘t accept an older sibling who “steals“ his heritage.

** It would depend on circumstances. JKR has said in an interview if his mother had survived - there would have been no Voldemort. Her love and care would have been enough to ground him.

Similar could be true if he had a sibling. I do think effect would be profound. But really would depend on circumstances:\\
- Is his sibling equal to him? If so then they would have one another to lean on, help, comfort. Maybe even experience brotherly love.\\
- Is one superior? Intellectually or magically? It might either devolve into abusive relationship, but could also develop into overly protective one.

From there could really go in any way. Heck they might start close, but grow apart at Hogwarts and maybe while Voldemort would go down dark path, his sibling might feel it their duty to oppose and stop Voldemort. Perhaps even attempt to save their brother ...

Or they could be a dark lord duo - both psychopathic murderers bent on world domination.

*** Yeah there's about a thousand ways Tom having a sibling could change the path he chose, especially depending on when and how they meet, how close in personality they are, and how healthy of a relationship they have together as they grow up.

***** Oh god Tom Riddle Sr. has a legitimate son with someone else who ALSO ENDS UP BEING A WIZARD. I'm pretty sure that would drive Tom Jr to insanity even faster than canon.

** Humilate them and keep them firm in control. He is in canon at least a sociopath unable to love and he doesn't like sharing power either. Thought he would most likely not kill them as he is obsessed with old families. So obssesed that he didn't want to kill neville because he is from an old family.

** I've always been of the opinion that Voldemort is a sociopath rather than a psychopath. That is, he became what he was through life experiences, not by being born like that. So tossing a sibling in the mix would drastically alter things. I think he would still be dark, and the sibling would probably be the same way, but not the full-blown serial killer nutter that single-child Voldemort became.

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.
