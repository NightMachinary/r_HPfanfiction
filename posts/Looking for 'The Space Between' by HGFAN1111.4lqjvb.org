I have recently been bingeing on hgfan1111's wonderful fics and as she has taken them down it has been a bit of a feat to try and get all of her archived fics. One that keeps being mentioned is 'The Space Between' and I am now desperate to read it. Does anyone know where I can find it, or does anyone have it downloaded in pdf or epub format. I would be forever grateful!

** I have an archive of what I think is most (if not all) of her stuff, PM me your email if you want it.

Edit: Also, nice choice, that one is my second favorite of all of hers :)

** From what I can tell, [[http://dukebrymin.livejournal.com/63646.html?thread=572062#t572062][it was a fic never published on FFN, but only on her livejournal]]. My Google-fu is better than average, I would think after years of participation in [[http://www.90fmtrivia.org/][this]], but I'm completely unable to find it archived online anywhere. The only possible source would be to find someone who has it downloaded.

Good luck.
