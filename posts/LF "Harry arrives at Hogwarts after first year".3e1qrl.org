  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

***** I dropped it after the first two chapters, then, because I got into a discussion about it, read more, and then, ultimately, got through the whole thing. My initial impression of it was not disconfirmed. To avoid repeating myself, here are my earlier posts on the subject:

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3dagum/any_trained_harry_fics/ct4byxa]]
- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2i1r8c/request_all_things_hermione_granger/cl03f2d]]
- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/28080f/harry_and_hermione_pairing_where_they_meet_later/cij8m0d]]

Thanks to this fic, I now have a rule that goes something like this: "If a fic delays Harry's arrival at Hogwarts and his activities in that time make him more badass relative to canon; and the fic is a Harmony fic; then the changed circumstances must result in Hermione also being more badass relative to canon by an amount comparable to or greater than Harry's increase in badassitude."
