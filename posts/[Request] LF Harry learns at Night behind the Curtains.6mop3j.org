Harry is abandoned by his friends. They do not want to have anything to do with him anymore. They tell him by letter. After receiving Harry's top OWLs, we learn that he secretly learned at night behind curtains.

I read it in a story years ago. Unfortunately, I no longer remember the title or the author. Does anyone know this story?


** This could be many fics, as that is a cliche that is repeated, but I think I've read the same one as you; or at least to that point. But I'm sorry that I can't be of more help.
