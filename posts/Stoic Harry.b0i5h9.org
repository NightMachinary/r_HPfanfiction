I'm looking for any fics where growing up with the Dursleys has immunized Harry to offensive people.

Draco talking shit about his bloodline and just being an ass? Snape abusing his authority, insulting his father, and being generally nasty? Feels just like home; Harry's been eating this kind of abuse for breakfast since he learned to talk. Forget actually riling him up, it hardly even registers. The fact that they can't/won't really do anything significant to him just makes it that much easier.


** Sounds interesting. I'd like to know as well

** I wouldn't call him stoic, but Harry acts like this towards Draco and Snape in linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste). He brushes off their insults and takes it as just something they say without taking any of it seriously.

Draco and Snape do end up giving up trying to antagonize him though since no matter what they do Harry just continues trying to befriend them in order to get better at potions.

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

Is that story actually any good?

**** I haven't read it, so I can't speak to quality. I'm just commenting to point out that you misread the tags. â€˜Character A & Character B' indicates a non-romantic relationship. Character A/Character B indicates romance.

**** There are no relationships in this fic, it's entirely gen. The & sign between the character names refers to non-romantic relationships and interactions.

I like the fic a lot and have seen it recommended many times in this subreddit. It does feature Snape and Draco as major characters though so it may not be for everyone.

It has a humorous writing style and has some amazing snarky sassy dialogue between Harry and Snape. The great thing about it is that it keeps both Draco and Snape in character and does not whitewash them by getting rid of their flaws.
