**** I have only like 3 chaps, though I have the outline for the best part of the story... and some places I want to take it on sequels.

It is time travel, as most of my stories are... So really have to nail that Ron expression when the hat sends Hermione to Ravenclaw. I also wanted to make the whole story on Harry's POV and the sequel, at least the first, entirely on Ron's POV.

  In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults.Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.
