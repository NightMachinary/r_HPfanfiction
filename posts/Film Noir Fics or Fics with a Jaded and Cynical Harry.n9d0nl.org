So, someone recently misspelled boggart as 'bogart' and now I kinda wanna see if there are any fics with a Casablanca vibe. So anything particularly cynical and jaded about life, with a really stylised way of telling the story.

To open this up a bit, I'm also asking for any fics with a jaded and cynical Harry. I don't mind if he's right or wrong to be jaded, or if he grows out of or into it throughout the story, I just wanna read something where he's all cynical about life.

O-oÂ¬O-o_O-o-O

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

**** Glad to help. Heather is a part of the Dark Lord Potter crowd, so sadly I cant say she's a friend of mind, but she's a solid writer when she finishes her work.

  Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG

*** Ooooh. That's an excellent summary. That first line already grabbed my attention enough I'm adding it to my to-read list without checking the chapter. :)

** Chilord's Wind Shear is very much about a jaded, burnt out Harry that gets accidentally sent to the past. All he wants to do is get a drink, but wouldn't you know it, the Death Eaters show up...

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
