First a quick overview of my story:

Basically I'm half way through writing my first Harry Potter fic. It's an AU where Hermione is a prefect in Ravenclaw and sees Luna getting bullied and protects her since she's a hard ass and doesn't have many friends since she's out Ravenclawing the other wizards and witches in that house. Luna kinda gets obbssed with the prefect and it goes through the years at hogwarts together with the girls being outcasts but obviously for different reasons and they both bounce off each other ect.

The only thing is I've never wrote any Harry Potter fiction before and although I really liked the films I've only ever read the books once so would love if anyone's interested to kinda Beta and make sure the stuff I'm talking about isn't complete gibberish. Find myself constantly having to Google proffesors and random Ravenclaw culture. Just want to make sure someone who is more well cultured with all the Harry Potter lore who might want to read this story isn't taken out of it every 30 seconds with a mistake I've made in terms of someone's name being wrong or me just getting a huge piece of back story wrong aswell.

I really like Luna/Hermione dynamic and wanted to explore the logical mind vs the more innocent creative thinker in a world without a huge war (although characters and some similar experiences do happen) Just would like help making sure other people can enjoy it aswell.


** i completely lack the dedication and reliability to be a beta.

That said, as a ravenclaw, be careful about "she's out Ravenclawing the other wizards and witches in that house"

Ravenclaws are really not like that. Most of us don't really care about grades all that much. I'd, for example, "prefer to spend three days reading this really interesting book on wandlore than study for my charms owl. under the principle that "As long as i get better than a P it's all good"" and had a tendency to stay up all night reading, before falling asleep in class.

It's more likely, in fact, that hermione wouldn't be able to deal with a lot of ravenclaw's absolute disregard for schoolwork in deference to whatever their latest random interest is. and her constant preachyness about grades would grate on them.

â€‹

Not saying i don't love hermione, I do, i just don't think the reasons she'd struggle in ravenclaw are quite the same as many think.

That said, if you can't find a beta feel free to send it to me and i'll do a chapter or two, I just tend to not be able to maintain a schedule for beta-ing over a long period :)

*** There was a tumblr post about how teaching Ravenclaws is like herding cats away from a box. It was about how a Ravenclaw student can argue with a teacher for an hour about a thing that is completely useless and needless for class
