** linkffn(The Legacy) is pretty good at handling Anti-Hero tendencies from Harry. He does what has to be done. Sometimes he threads the line of anti-villain, as well. Pairing is Harry/Daphne, superbly done. Nothing is rushed and the characters stay quite in character. Harry has a (somewhat) different personality than in canon, but /there's an actual reason for that/.

*** The problem I have with this fic is the writing style, it doesn't really flow so much as crawl at glacial pace. Personally I couldn't make it past the 1st chapter though so it could improve...?

**** The style is not the usual... "speed" of other fics, but perhaps that's why I liked it so much. It was refreshing to see a story that actually took its time to set the world, and the characters in place. It made the resolution of certain subplots /amazing/ due to that wait, and I feel the wait was totally worth it. It does get quite better the more you read, so if you haven't got past the first chapter, I'd definitely reccomend you give it a try!

***** I really enjoyed quite a lot of the plot of The Legacy, Dudleys subplot is freaking fantastic imo, but it is painfully wordy at times and for readers who can't deal with that it's a non starter. Normally I can hang but there were a couple times where I had to stop and take a break for a few weeks/months and I'm actually not finished at this point, I had to take another break somewhere in the low 70 chapter count.

I'm actually having a hard time remembering what it was exactly that made me bug off, but something did and the feeling is still strong. It's been more than six months since I've tried to pick it up but I get this angry/disappointed feeling whenever I see it recommended. I told myself if they started updating it again I'd give it another chance but it's nearing a year since the last update and I don't have much hope. Maybe I should reskim those chapters to see and to make my argument more tangible but it really sucks when you've invested so much time into a a fic and then something annoys you enough to make you lose interest.

*** I have a problem with how inconsistent it is, really; Harry taking his role seriously before the Prophecy (4th Year) would make much more sense, especially in the context of THIS Harry, who seems to be more up for jumping in and having a go at it. I also have this odd problem with OOTP and HBP divergence stories, where I feel as if the story is purposely giving itself only 2-3 more books time frame to end the story, whereas a fresh new story or maybe an earlier divergence, creates a more open-ended feeling to it. Once, again, it's my personal preference, but I wouldn't recommend it to OP.

**** I think it is, as you say, a matter of preference. I personally like stories that stick close to canon while diverging in interesting ways, so I gravitate toward later year stories than earlier ones.

In any case, are there any stories that fulfill OP's guidelines that start earlier than my suggestion? I'm curious.

***** Imprisoned Realm starts post Hogwarts, but it has a very open-ended feeling to it due to that and it gets sort of angsty depending on who's reading it.

Forging The Sword is a popular one that gives us an Anti-Hero that is willing to sacrifice someone if needed, and suffers from a sort of identity crisis.

A while ago I would have recommended Magicks of Arcane or even Gods Amongst Men, but those fics present a style of action that I personally dislike.

**** I agree that it may not be everyone's cup of tea when it comes to speed, but I feel that /a lot/ of fics (example, james spookie's works) rush themselves into a corner pretty fast and you are left with the sensation of "what now". This is the exact opposite here. While some things take quite a while to resolve, when they /do/ is even more amazing because of that wait.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): This Harry was generally benevolent, but also did TONS of very nasty things, and was capable to do more. Most of the story took place after 2008.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): Harry and Ginny were awful people in an awful world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): This is a time travel, and they were all highly disturbed people and killers. Lots of dark humors, especially their conversations among themselves.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): This one is a top favorite of mine, and this Harry definitely qualifies as an anti-hero by end of the story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5998729/1/The-Valley-of-the-Kings-Massacre][The Valley of the King Massacre]], linkffn(5998729): Only a one-shot, but he did very nefarious things later.
