Actually Slytherin Harry, actually dark or at least grey. Pairing with Daphne preferably, multi is okay as long as it's realistic and not “all the girls bowed down” sadly I have read that line. Preferably doesn't like Granger. Any recommendations?


** Have you read the Downward Spiral saga?? Harry gets super dark in it, and he's with Daphne after the 2nd or 3rd book I think. The first two books honestly aren't the best in terms of writing, but if you can get thru it just to understand the content, I PROMISE it gets so much better. Here's the first book. Linkffn(12867536) Happy reading!!!!
