I'm looking for any cliche plots that seems like your typical cliche but then it goes a different way with it.

So say Wrong Boy/Girl Who Lived: Harry is raised well as opposed poorly, or raised by different people as opposed to James and Lily or the Dursley's.

Slytherin Harry Cliche: Harry is friends with Muggleborns, he's friends with different people outside of his house and doesn't like the other students in his house.

Severus raises Harry (Note I've read a majority of them, so would be best not to give me any unless they are relatively new) Anyway something done differently with this cliche then what we normally see.

Or just any cliche that does things differently then you'd expect them to. Note what I said there were just examples, and there could be other cliches as well, not just those.

As long as the story is well written, has some interesting turns when it comes to the cliche (whatever the cliche may be) and it's just interesting to read.

Any rating is fine.

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione. Any other pairing is fine.

Would rather not have character bashing but if it's believable enough I'll allow it.


** In most of Slytherin!Harry, he is friend with muggleborns, particulary Hermione.

** Hmm...what about Unbreakable Vows not actually being unbreakable?

I mean, canon is full of wizards and witches believing the worst without any evidence whatsoever; what if an Unbreakable Vow can be broken or weakened like any other curse? What if an obnoxious protagonist finds to their dismay that the Vow they squeezed out of X Slytherin Antagonist to keep their secrets turns out to be ineffective?

--------------

Or, what about subverting 'goblins are warriors and greedy bastards'? Griphook's a poor representative there in canon, but what if goblins are philanthropic and artistic and all kinds of other peaceful good guys? Building up Gringotts as a work of art, making all kinds of intricate tools (including weapons and armor, though), using their position as financial managers to sponsor and invest in all manner of entrepreneurs...

--------------

And I voiced an idea before where Harry was continually obliviated and having his magic bound, but rather than Evil!Dumbledore being behind it, it's actually an unknown, sneaky observer who obliviates everyone they encounter and binds Harry's tremendous magical power in order to keep their third-world a secret from wizardkind.

*** I read a one shot where Harry was being obliviated in most cases at his own request, because it was information he would have rather not known.

**** I vaguely remember that one. Dobby came in at one point to explain how he impregnated a turkey.

***** Tried to anyway, and yes. It also had an /explaination/ for why Dumbledore didn't want any of of the Marauders taking him in, and that most of his generation are half-siblings.

  COMPLETE. I wasn't the Lavender that could have been ... I was no Gryffindor. (A realistic attempt at an SI fic, attempting zero Mary-Sue-ishness).
