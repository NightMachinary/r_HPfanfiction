I'm in that type of mood where I want to see the Dursleys get there just desserts. Bonus points if he doesn't use magic, and is just stronger, faster, etc... than them. I wouldn't mind magic either, just want to read Harry punching Vernon out. Also more bonus points if he stays there, and treats them how they treated him.

Thanks, Warryn.

Harry living well after leaving the Dursleys doesn't affect them at all.

No it's not. That's not even /revenge/, let alone "the /best/ revenge". The only merit the entire phrase has is the notion that /they/ should suffer from your revenge, not you (or to put another way, your quality of life is more important than the vengee's quality of life or lack thereof).

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.

**** I tried reading it, but The Denarian Renegade never really piqued my interest. Just not my style of writing I guess, because the story seemed interesting enough, but once again the style of writing kind of ruined it for me.

Thanks anyway, Warryn.
