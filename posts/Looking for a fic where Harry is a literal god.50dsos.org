  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six-year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

******** Sort of? Go to the author page and read the one chapter blurb. The author doesn't really rewrite anything the whole premise is that Harry is animagus form being me you can use the abilities of all the Pokemon. I know it sounds cliche to say it's much better than it sounds, but it is. It's not an overpowered Harry story it's well thought-out and paced. It is weird don't get me wrong but it's good. It took me admittedly a very long time to convince myself to try reading it because it does sound so weird.

  Death messed up his job at Halloween 1981 and now neither Voldemort nor Harry Potter are dead. As if that wasn't bad enough that noisy little brat appears to be able to see him. All of that was quite unexpected. Still it doesn't explain how he somehow found himself stuck to raise the baby. Alright, now that's just awkward. Complete (sort of)
