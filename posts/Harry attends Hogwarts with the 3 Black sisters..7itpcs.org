** Female Harry jumps through the veil of Death and ends up in a weird, cracky relationship with the Black Sisters and his mother. It is not at all serious but nonetheless very enjoyable to read. Here's an example from the first chapter:

  Honestly it had been her desire to impress the strangely beautiful little blonde Ravenclaw that had been a good percentage of what had led her here tonight. Sure there was certainly some concern for her supposedly captured god father but most of it was a hormone driven need to get in Luna's pants. She suspected that Sirius would approve whole heartedly of her less than pure motivations in this regard.

  After a disastrous battle in the Department of Mysteries that claims her life Harriet Potter is sent back in time to prevent the second rise of Voldemort. A response to Anubis' Two Lillies challenge. Rated M for adult situations and some rather fruity language. Femslash HP/LE and possibly more. Wink wink.
