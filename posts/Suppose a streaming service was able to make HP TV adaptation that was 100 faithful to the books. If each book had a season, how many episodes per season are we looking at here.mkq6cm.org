** With 22 minute episodes, like WandaVision, they might pull off the entire series in 8-12 episode seasons. The movies are already pretty good at pulling off the general idea. Add an hour or two, the holes of book material will fill up. To make more is to add filler. Actually, might be good for, like, expanding the less respected aspects of canon, like the Harry/Ginny situation and Ron/Hermione. Also, they would have the whole idea right away, so they'd pick actors who'll have chemistry and stuff. And not get a hottie for the woman, who settles for the sidekick.

** Assuming it's a one-hour episode and each episode takes up 1-2 chapters of the book:

Season One: Philosopher's Stone: 8-17 episodes.

Two: Chamber of Secrets: 9-18 episodes.

Three: Prisoner of Azkaban: 11-22 episodes.

Four: Goblet of Fire: 18-37 episodes.

Five: Order of the Phoenix: 19-38 episodes.

Six: Half-Blood Prince: 15-30 episodes.

Seven: Deathly Hallows: 18-37 episodes.

Overall, we're looking at 98-199 episodes across the entire seven seasons. In comparison, Marvel's Agents of Shield have a total of 136 episodes across seven seasons.

*** Without bad fanficiton levels of filler these totals are asinine.

The entire audiobook of Philosophers Stone is 8 hours long.

By comparison, the First Season of Game of Thrones is almost verbatim the book in ten one-hour episodes. It is 33 hours long.

You would only need 4-5 hours to make a '100% faithful' adaptation of the first book; and probably about the same of the second. I would think you could cover the remaining books in ten episodes without any sort of issue. I can't imagine needing more than fifteen and even that would likely only be for Order of the Phoenix.

7 - 10 episode seasons would be more than enough time to cover the material. Hell, you'd probably need to be 'unfaithful' to the first two books just to fill enough time.

The show you site is a bad example. As it's designed to have a weekly filler sense to most of it. Hell, the entire first season is 20 hour of waiting around for Winter Soldier to happen.

**** There's no need to be rude. That's why it's called an assumption and I included the lowball and the highball estimates.

**** So that's about, 16 episodes for Year 1, and about 8-10 episodes each for Years 2-7, if we're going on a 22 minute plus 8 minutes of commercial if we're going on regular TV?

** You can do high quality 10 episodes of 1hr, having to add some material and subplots for first seasons.
