** Some sites, such as [[http://archiveofourown.org/][AO3]], include a download option for the fics you want to save. EDIT: I have also saved some fanfic in PDF format, which is readable thru my Kindle app, though obviously with limitations.

*** Personally I'm partial to [[http://fanfictiondownloader.net/download.php][FanfictionDownloader]], but Calibre and the fanfiction downloader plugin that [[/u/avcay]] mentioned are useful as you can input multiple urls at once and set it on it's way instead of doing one at a time, and Calibre is useful for converting and organising things.

** *Posting this because some people are unaware:

Do you have a smartphone? (a phone that is running Windows Mobile 6.1 or later or Android...)

If you do, return the kindle and get an E-Reader for your mobile - like Cool Reader.

Saves you money, and less devices to manage.

*** The Kindle's screen is designed to be like a book page so that it doesn't hurt your eyes to read. Amazon does have an app so that you can read on your phone, but I've found it easier on my eyes to read on my Kindle. I think it's worth it to have both devices.

*** I think it depends on how much you read. I'll read on my phone if I'm waiting for the bus, or in line or something quick and can quickly pull up a bookmarked story. However for most of my long reading, I prefer a kindle, since reading on my phone for a long time is very tiring for my eyes.
