** I don't really read stories like that, so I'm not sure I'll be able to help, but I'll still try my hand at tracking it down! But I'll need more information.

Do you know what site you read it on? Was it very long? When was it published? When did you read it? How did you find it?

Do you remember anything about the author? Did he or she publish a lot of stories? Did the story seem popular (lots of reviews or favorites)?

Do you remember how Harry was sent to the AU? How old was Harry when he was sent? Is it canon-compliant? If not, where in the series does it diverge from canon? What do you mean by "rebuild his reputation?" Were there any pairings? Were there any common tropes (Harry Harem, Super Harry, Dark Harry, abusive Lily and James, incompetent Dumbledore...)?

Can you recall anything about the writing style? Was the story in present tense or past tense? First person? Third person? Multiple points of view?

Do you remember anything about the ending? Was the story completed? Was there a sequel?

Give me anything you can remember! Every bit helps.

*** I think it was a long story but I read so many stories its hard to keep track lol.

I think Harry was sent post war and when I say rebuild his reputation I mean the alternate universe harry was evil... so "our" Harry needs to regain the trust of his parents, sisters, and ppl he thought of as friends.

It was in present tense, 3rd POV...

I remember in the story after he was sent to the AU and tries to "be good" after that world's harry spent so long being isolated and evil-ish his mom, Lily, was the only one to take him seriously. And I also remember at some point one of his sisters punches him in the face for some reason...

...The more I talk about it the more I think my imagination is too detailed for its own good haha....

**** Hm, OK. I'm searching now, but new questions have arisen! :)

Do you remember anything about how AU!Harry became evil? Did the attack on Godric's Hollow ever occur? Is there still a Boy-Who-Lived? If so, who is it? Is it AU!Harry? Is it Neville? Is AU!Harry aligned with Voldemort, or is he independently evil?

Since you can't remember if there were ships, do you think it was shipless? Or do you think there might have been ships, and you just can't recall?

And are you positive you can't remember where you read it? :) That's pretty important for my searching methods. It'll even help a lot if you can just rule some sites out.

Edit: Oh, and do you know if the "sending" was intentional or accidental?

***** I'm going to assume it was ff.net.

I think he was independently evil, and from what I think I remember he was just evil from a young age and it sort of grew with him. I don't remember if there was a BWL in the story... and there could've been ships and i just dont remember...

I think it was another force that sent him, so in that sense it was intentional.

****** Awesome, thank you!

Well, there's a story called "Changing Lives" by fufu.aka.speechless which sounds promising, but I can't locate it anywhere. Looks like the author wiped everything. The summary: "Harry wakes up to find himself in another universe, but there he is considered rude and cruel. How will Harry deal with this new world, especially when his parents are alive?" Another person ([[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/stranger_trilogy/message/3311][here]]) says: "So, lately I was following a AU harry story (at fanfiction). The story is about Harry being transported to another world, where he replaced the other Harry. This Harry is known as an arrogant type, dislikes his sister and other stuff." Another user replied that "Changing Lives" fit the description. So, if that rings a bell, I'd recommend you ask around everywhere you can to see if anybody still has a copy. If not, let me know and I'll keep searching! But I'm not sure how much more I can -- I'm running out of ideas :(

Edit: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2715415/1/In-Search-of-a-Family][This story]] was also given as fitting that other person's description. Not quite sure if it fits your requirements yet, but I'm skimming it now.

******** No problem! :D I hope you're able to find a copy, because as I continue searching, I just keep ending up back at "Changing Lives." I'll keep an eye out for any other story that looks like it might fit, though! Good luck!

** A Stranger in an Unholy Land, by serpant-sorcerer? It's on ff.net, and I think all of your criteria are fulfilled, except he only has one sister in the AU, Rose Marie. It was pretty good.

*** This is the one that came to mind for me too. Voldermort sent him there accidentally, Harry from the new universe is a well known Death Eater and he now has to prove he's not evil.

**** Stranger in an Unholy Land is gen (no pairing). The sequel (which you have to read on a different website because most of it isn't posted on ff.net) /might/ have Harry / Ginny leanings, but I'm not positive. After a while, some of the fics start to blend together. :)

****** I've read the rewrite but then decided, because it's not finished, to try the original and you can pretty much read the original. They are both the same with some parts mixed or cut off.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7806627/1/][Sacrificial Second Chance]]

Author: NaruAndHarrHaremFan

Harry dies killing Voldemort,and is given the chance to go to a world where his parents are still alive.See how he handles all that life throws at him.HaremSisterIncest Powerful/Harry NevilleBWL

The Harry of "this" world has red hair, two sisters...Ivy and Rose I think. The old Harry was pretty fucked up (animal torture, serial killer, pay for hit on his family) and part of old Harry didn't go away when "our" Harry took over his body.
