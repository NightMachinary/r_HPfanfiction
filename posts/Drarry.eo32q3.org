Harry and Draco have a clandestine affair after Hogwarts and for a reason, I don't remember (perhaps having lost another war against Muggles) they both decide to go back in time to their 10-11 years. Both are sorted into Slytherin and try to prevent future disasters. I don't think they joined Voldemort.

Do you know any ff that matches these parameters?

Thanks
