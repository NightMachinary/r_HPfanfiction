With a penchant for flowers, coffee and cute animals; pureblood Princess: Daphne Greengrass entered into her fifth year deciding to be open about her crush on Harry Potter. Declaring to the school her desire to court and marry him and politely asking the girls in the school to kindly give her a chance to win Harry's heart, before they attempt to.

No one is able to say no to the "Slytherin Softie", arguably the kindest and sweetest (if a bit naive, out of touch and/or aloof) to ever grace the Halls of Hogwarts.

However, the populace is baffled that her actions, which include: gifts, open (if timid and stammering) flirting and very brutal political manoeuvring for his benefit, seem to make him uncomfortable.

Regardless of what ploy she attempts, which include: trying out for Quidditch (upon thinking he likes Quidditch girls), sourcing a litany of obscure Dark curses for the DA and even tricking him into brewing Amortentia so she can figure out his favourite smells...

She's a sweetheart, very sensitive (to the point of tears, which REALLY upsets the Slytherin's) and even more in love with Harry James Potter.

***** I'm basically thinking she's like Haru from P5, but she has all this wealth and political clout and actually knows how to use it.

But, as a trade off, her entire understanding of romance is from books and media so she's trying all these tricks behind the scenes but is still monumentally shy and has no idea what she's doing.

Actually, Tracey Davis can play Chika Fujiwara really well.

Except, James Potter wouldn't be alive so we couldn't have a Dio voice.

And we don't know who could play best girl Ishigami-kun.

Edit: Just the thought of a bruised and battered Tracy pointing proudly at Harry and telling Daphne that she raised that boy is definitely going to be a riot! 😂😂😂

** Harry ducked into the secret passage, leaving the hidden door open just enough to see into the hallway, he stayed very still as he saw his "hunter" as Hermione called it, passed through followed by Tracey Davis.

Daphne Greengrass was a strange character for Harry, it had all began on second year, when she stopped to talk to him in the hallway, saying she didn't believe he was the Heir, he was grateful for that.

And so it began.

Contrary to popular belief, Harry wasn't stupidly oblivious, he caught on quick that she was flirting with him(or trying to), she would send sweets and other small gifts, and then either of them would try to talk to the other between classes, and engage in what Hermione called "the most endearing and frustrating flirting ever."

Now, also contrary to popular belief(even if those two should be contrary), Harry had no clue about dating, or even flirting, his relatives were never examples, his social experiences had been dreadful until he reached Hogwarts and he was barely thirteen.

He needed help, because for once, he was interested in her, not only she seemed to be truly sincere in her interest in the real Harry, he also found her pretty, and cute.

But who could help him? It would need to be a girl, and she needed to be knowledgeable.

He almost slapped his face, there was only one answer.

------

Hermione had barely entered the common room when Harry intercepted her.

"Hermione, I need your help!" the desperation in his voice immediately raised alarms.

She guided him to one of the tables and started whispering.

"What is it, Harry? Is it Sirius Black?"

Harry frowned before seemingly just remembering there was a mass murderer out to get him, but he shook his head, he had priorities.

"What? No, look, it's about Daphne, Daphne Greengrass."

Hermione immediately relaxed, before a small smile came over her, "Oh, Harry, look you just have to gently let her down..."

"Let her down! No! I want to..." he lowered his voice when he realized he had almost shouted, "I want to try and..." he blushed, "date her Hermione, and I, don't know how."

Hermione tried not to gush, he looked so cute doing that! But she limited herself to widening her smile and tried to speak in a comforting voice.

"That's great Harry, and there's no need to feel ashamed, we are still young."

"Yeah! But I don't even know how to ask her for a date! Or even, what to do in a date." his blush increased two fold," I know about kissing and...stuff, but that's not all there is to it, people have to talk, and have fun? Right?"

Hermione put a comforting hand on his shoulder, holding her frown when he tensed a bit, she didn't have to think hard on the reasons for Harry's lack of social skills, but she vowed to help him. Harry had gone through too much already and deserved some happiness.

"You are right, Harry, definitely right! But don't worry, I will help you, and I think there are some other people who would want to help too."

Seeing him get ready to protest, Hermione raised a hand, "I trust them Harry, and I know you trust them too."

------

"So, little Harrykins wants to ask the sweet Miss Greengrass on a date?" George asked with a smile.

"And he wants our esteemed help."

Harry wasn't sure of that, but he wasn't placed in Gryffindor on a whim, "Yes, but guys, please..."

Fred stopped him before he could continue, his smile a bit less mischievous "Oh, don't worry mate, we will take this seriously, you are our friend, and after what you did for Ginny."

George nodded, "Yeah, and if Mum gets wind we did something to distress you..." he grimaced.

Fred looked at his brother, "She might actually tell Dad." both paled a bit and shuddered at that, making Harry believe they wouldn't turn it into one of their tricks.

Hermione, with her arms crossed, looked at twins for a bit before nodding, "Ok, with this out of the way, here's the plan, next weekend is a Hogsmeade one, so Harry, I think it would be good if you invited her to go with you. On. A. Date."

Harry's stomach sunk, so soon? Would he be ready? What if he messed up? He was thinking he preferred to face the Basilisk again, at least it wouldn't make him feel the worst person on the planet for making it cry.

"Calm down! Harry, we will help you." she gestured to her and the twins, "And it's very simple."

"But what do I say? What if she can't go? What if she doesn't like Hogsmeade?"

The twins shared a look, before placing a hand on each of Harry's shoulders. "Oh, don't worry, our date challenged friend, we have a solution for that." Fred removed two very small spheres from his pocket," this, is a prototype for one of our products. It was supposed to help us hear sounds from behind wood barriers."

Hermione narrowed her eyes at that.

"But, sadly, it can't do that very well, it will, however, hear what you hear if you place it on your ear, and when if we use two pairs," he removed other two spheres, "we can talk back and forth, and us three can guide you while courting your blond haired snake."

Harry wasn't very sure that would help him, but needs must.

*** ------

Harry walked down the hallway where Fred and George said Daphne would be passing through(how they knew that he didn't ask.) trying and failing to control his nerves. He tried to forget how Hermione and Fred were following him under his Cloak.

And then he saw her, blonde, on the tall side and with a very pretty face, he especially liked her gentle blue eyes, gentle, but with an undercurrent of strength that was oddly familiar.

He smiled softly, for some reason thinking of deep red hair.

He must've been distracted, because he did not notice she had stopped, her eyes widening, he stopped too, and both looked into the other's eyes.

Tracey Davis who realized she hadn't even been perceived, huffed with a smile, Blaise Zabini, who was coming on the back, scoffed and glanced at his companion, both nodded and stepped back a little.

/"Harry, talk to her."/ he had almost forgotten about the magic radio.

"Er, Hi, Daphne."

She smiled and he thought it did look cute, "Hi, Harry, how are you?"

"I am good, thanks..." why did this have to be so hard.

There were sniggers on the radio, before the sound of a muffled 'ouch' and then Hermione spoke.

/"Compliment her Harry, and ask about her day."/

"I like your eyes, they are pretty. How was your day?" more sniggers, and he now noticed the two other Slytherins a few paces behind Daphne, Tracey seemed to be coughing, but her eyes were full of mirth.

/"That was...nice, Harry, now let her answer."/

Daphne smiled again and took a few steps towards him, "I am having a good day, Harry, thank you for asking." she giggled.

"/Ask her to Hogsmeade."/

Harry froze up a bit, and couldn't look Daphne in her eyes, he started rubbing the back of his head. "Look, Daphne, I..."

She apparently took this the wrong way, because her face took a sad expression, but still tried to smile. "I understand, Harry..."

His eyes widened and he looked at her "You do?", only to frown as her expression.

"Yes, I know I am trying to hard, and you aren't interested, I am sorry to have made you uncomfortable..."

"/Harry, talk to her! Right Now!"/

Hermione once said Harry was good at reacting to things while under pressure, while others would panic and be paralyzed, Harry could act with a cooler head, or at least do something.

Once again, she was right.

Harry took a step forward and grasped her arms. "No! I am interested!"

He also barely heard Zabini murmuring "Smooth, Potter." and Tracey giggling lightly, Daphne however, smiled widely, her eyes alight!

"You are?"

/"Say yes! Say yes!"/ two voices repeated on his ear.

"Yes!"

"Ask her to go with you to Hogsmeade!"

"WillyougowithmetoHogsmeade?" he said without stopping, trying to ignore the soft laughter on the other side of the line and from Tracey.

"What?"

Harry took a deep breath. "Will you go to Hogsmeade...with me...for a date?"

Harry was expecting a myriad of reactions, from laughter(despite all her signs, he was still insecure) to a soft yes or even no, he wasn't expecting for her to launch herself at him and give Hermione /and/ Molly a run for their money in hugs.

"Yes! Yes! Of course, I will go with you!" she said, the smile clear in her voice.

Harry had stiffened when she hugged him.

/"Harry for the love of Merlin hug that girl, right now!"/

He did so, and had to admire how he enjoyed it, she smelled of lavender and gooseberries, and was also soft, and warm, very warm.

"That's good," he said into her hair. If he was talking about her answer or her hug, even he didn't know. Perhaps both.

They stayed in that position for a few moments, just enjoying the close contact, one of the few times Harry enjoyed close contact, actually. And he wished for more.

Daphne was the first to pull back, but she kept her hands on Harry's upper arms, and smiled at him, her cheeks flushed, something that Harry thought made her even more attractive.

They looked into each other's eyes, but Harry, couldn't stop his eyes from going to her lips.

Someone cleared their throat, and Daphne looked back with a furious expression.

"Sorry, Daph, but we /really/ need to go."

/"Harry, say to her you are happy she accepted and that...you can't wait."/ Hermione said.

"And place your right hand on her cheek while doing so, trust me." Fred piped up.

Hesitantly, and with courage he would bet came from the high after the hug, Harry did so, and if Daphne noticed his slightly trembling and somewhat clammy hand, she never said it.

She only blushed even more and smiled, and Harry found himself caressing her face, finding her skin soft and warm, just like she was.

"Daphne, I am happy you accepted, and I will be counting the days until our date." she placed her hand over his squeezing it, and he felt a bit faint.

"Me too," she said softly, before she quickly pressed forward and touched her lips to his,\\
a featherlight kiss, but it sent a such a jolt of excitement through him, that he barely noticed when she caressed his face too before turning back with a smile and almost skipped back to her friends, face alight.

He also didn't hear the gasp coming from the line.

Both Tracey and Zabini said their goodbyes, though Tracey said, "I think you broke him, Daph." and upon seeing her friend was not all there either, grabbed her arm and started guiding her away while rolling her eyes, "probably mutual, what do you think Blaise?

"That I need an insulin shot."

With that, the trio left, with Daphne turning back and waving, Harry returned it in a bit of daze, before placing his hand on his lips.

"Wow, Hermione, and you said he needed help? Our Harry here is /smooth/."

He almost jumped upon hearing Fred's voice, now not muffled by a spell, and turned back just in time to see them remove the Cloak.

Hermione walked up and hugged him with a smile, "I am so proud of you Harry, you did well."

"Yeah, mate, she was putty in your hands."

"Yeah," Harry smiled, before his eyes widened, "I got a date! Hermione, I got a date! What do I wear? Where should we go?"

Hermione just smiled at her friend and patted him on the back, "Don't worry Harry, we got the full package deal, we can order clothing by Owl mail and ask for Alicia or Angelina to adjust them a bit, and Hogsmeade is full of places for you to go."

As color was returning to Harry's face, Hermione turned to him, "Don't worry Harry we will not let anything ruin your date."

As that trio left, no one noticed when a tabby cat emerged from the shadows, looking for all the world like she had eaten the canary.

**** On Saturday, at precisely two in the evening, Harry and Daphne met in the Entrance Hall, he was dressed in black and silver robes, with a small Potter family crest on the breast(apparently Madam Malkins had a register with them and went all out when Harry wrote to her in such a formal way), his hair was just a bit tamed, and he was without his glasses(Madam Pomfrey talked to him about contacts /out of nowhere/).

He had a nervous smile on his lips, that turned into a full-blown one when he looked at where Hermione was pointing.

Daphne was dressed in a pretty green dress(a similar shade to his eyes) had her hair out in wavy locks, and just a hint of makeup. But Harry thought she was the prettiest girl he had ever seen.

He tried to remember the tips Hermione, The Twins, and The Chasers gave him, Hermione was thoughtful enough to put them in a list.

Compliment her.

"Daphne, you look beautiful, very beautiful."

He was rewarded with a shy smile, and an honest compliment too. Trying not to dwell on it, he went to the next item, one of the hardest.

Offer your /hand,/ gently, and confidently.

He did so, trying to control the trembling, but he didn't have to wait long because she took it earnestly, and squeezed it, both exciting and calming him at the same time.

This dating stuff was confusing.

"Shall we go?" He indicated the exit with his had and what he hoped was a confident smile. It wasn't confident at all, but he looked definitely happy.

She nodded and kissed his cheek, he gently pulled her a bit closer and returned it, before guiding her to the entrance. He turned to look at his friends.

Hermione was smiling gently, and nodded in encouragement, Ron grinned at him and gave him a double thumbs up.

Properly encouraged, Harry left, enjoying the feel of Daphne's hand on his.

Hermione and Ron were joined by Tracey, who was smiling too.

"Good Work, Granger, I couldn't stand all that flirting and dancing around anymore."

Hermione nodded, "They look happy."

"Oh, they are, and will be, if we have anything to say about it."

Hermione turned to her, "So, Malfoy?"

Tracey smiled, "Poor Draco, breakfast just did not agree with him today, I think he will be in the dungeons until tomorrow."

The other girl nodded with a smile, "Good, we've got people on the village to make sure it all goes well."

Ron, was frowning, thinking about something, "What about the Dementors?"

"Didn't you hear? There was a bunch of them on the entrance when the Headmaster's Phoenix swooped in, with another Phoenix, a Patronus one, and if what the upper years told is true, the Dementors /ran/, or flew fast I guess, as if scared."

Hermione filed that information away for later. Ron laughed "Heh, I think Professor Dumbledore had enough of them near the school."

The girls smiled at each other, thinking. "Probably."

-----

Harry and Daphne had a great date(the first of many), they noticed they had two followers, completely missing the third(who wouldn't, when the person would look different every time).

After a few hours, Harry was finally able to relax around Daphne, and know more about the girl who was interested in him, while he became interested in her in the process.

He found her funny, driven, and caring; even if a bit aloof(he thought it just added to her charm). She loved her family, friends, and magic.

Harry could relate to two of those, the other one was a bit harder, but he talked to her about some things he never had before.

She also liked Quidditch, horses, and dueling magic(she promised to take him to see a professional duel).

Daphne found Harry to be funny too, very determined, brave, and even a bit cunning, even if he could hide it well(and didn't that make him all the more cunning?). He loved his friends, Quidditch, and magic. He liked Hogwarts

And Daphne could see he never had enough opportunities to experience the world, to get more things to like, she vowed to provide those for him.

They returned at the last minute, just before Filch closed the gates, their cheeks were flushed and they looked ruffled, if from running or something else, only they(and a young Auror) knew.

Fred and George returned a bit later, being baffled as to how the young couple could lose them for most of the day, they caught on that same hallway, halfway between the Tower and\\
the Dungeons.

That goodnight kiss was definitely /not/ featherlight.

My try at cheesy 'romance', perhaps a bit too much, but I felt it was appropriate for this Prompt. I would like to explore Daphne's character more, but it would become just too big.

After Harry resumes Hogwarts, Daphne watches her betrothed from afar, too scared to do anything like approach him, but she is shown lightly affecting how things happen in the story and helping the Team Potter from afar.

Year 1 is tough, but year 2 maybe she's someone who helps tip off hermione as to what's petrifying people, and she and her father drag Malfoy through the mud after year two and his attempted attack on Harry after Dobby is freed. Year 3 Mr Greengrass scours the Great Britain for information on Sirius Black and finds out he never got a trial, and lightly uses his influence at the Ministry to push a trial for Sirius through. Year 4 Daphne is one of Harry's only supporters and Harry constantly hears tales of people being sent to the hospital wing after terrorizing him (of course he has no idea what happened to them). Year 5 Daphne turns it to 11 and tries to move forward with things and yeah. I also like the idea of throwing in some Mr Greengrass spends years trying to figure out where Harry has been staying after seeing him at the end of year 1 at the train station (of course he's always blocked somehow from actually communicating with Harry). Eventually he finds out about the Dursleys, and maybe gets a vague idea of how they treat Harry, and implements a Revenge plan (I like the idea of him buying out the company Vernon works for and firing him)

***** That's kinda what happens in marriage contract fics though. If the parents aren't against it they're often "friends of James and/or Lily" and were "supposed to take care of him". And they often use their political sway or capital to solve all of Harry's problems

****** Yeah you're not wrong. I was thinking about it while reading through my comments again. I guess the biggest difference is how Daphne acts compared to normal fics like that, but it might be better for her to act like that NOT in a marriage contract way.

** First time posting on Reddit, so here goes.\\
I've been working on a fic ever since I came across this prompt, and I felt compelled to try my hand at it.\\
Without further ado, here is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13610399/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Pie-Throwing-Championships][Daphne Greengrass and the Pie-Throwing Championships]].

I posted on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24626260][Archive of Our Own]] too.\\
It'll be quite a few chapters. Probably around 100 - 200k words.\\
I hope it's what you're all looking for.\\
Enjoy. :)
