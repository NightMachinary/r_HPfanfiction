Fountain pens are a thing, and I remember using them at school way before Wizarding school age. It's a very simple system that would not be susceptible to failure in proximity to magic. Why would you then downgrade from that? You just pull the cap off, press the metal to paper and start scribbling. You run out of ink ages later, and when changing cartridge there is very little risk of spillage. In contrast, breaking a sentence just to get a dab of ink on the tip would be stressful and prone to dripping all over the place, especially in an exam setting.

Even a ball point pen would be better than a quill. It's much more tiring than the fountain pen but it lasts even longer.


** The best reason I can think of is the /ink/. Europe used the same ink for over 1500 years, and magic might like that ink or one with the same drawbacks of it.

What are those drawbacks you might ask? It has large particles so it clogs up fountain pens, and it is slightly corrosive so if you leave it in a fountain pen it /will/ eat away at it from the inside. Quills use this ink just fine, so wizards might have stayed with quills for that reason. As for why muggleborn use them? Might be like how american schools like number two pencils, various anticheat spells or similar might not like modern ink or graphite.

However there is a smart way around this for smarter muggleborn, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dip_pen][dip/nib pens]]. They don't have as complicated as a mechanism as fountain pens (or the more modern pens) so don't clog, and you don't keep ink in them so they don't corrode.

Edit:

#+begin_quote
  Quill pens and dip pens have certain advantages over a fountain pen. They can use waterproof, pigmented, particle-and-binder-based inks, such as India ink, drawing ink, and acrylic inks---each of which would destroy a fountain pen by clogging it---and the traditional iron gall ink, which can corrode fountain pens.

*** You're right about iron gall ink and nibs. But that'd actually be an argument against it, wouldn't it? Iron gall can corrode paper, too, and can fatally damage any codex over time. It's something you should avoid if longevity is a primary concern.

For a society that should value knowledge over any other type of resource (seeing as how you can basically replace anything with knowledge), that seems counterintuitive.

Then again, we should probably stop reading too much into these minute details.

**** I mean good point on the corrosiveness of iron gall being something to worry about on multiple points. It might however be cool if iron gall took preservason spells way better than other inks do, so as long as you do your due diligence, it will actually last /longer/ than another ink. (that or the ink wizards use just has a bunch of fine particles in it that are magically conductive but jam fountain pens.

*** TIL about pens.

Honestly, I dislike it brought up as a plot device. It leads to the whole "muggles are superior to wizards; wizards have no logic." trope that's common. Or the author doesn't realize it's filler I'm going to skip. And it never directly leads anywhere.

Next you'll have Harry with an iphone walking around with WiFi and investing in Tesla.

I exaggerate, but I don't. I think that copying muggle innovations magically preserves the fantasy element. But overdoing it... Well that just removes the plot.

** Because you've just been shipped off to a new society, you're isolated, most the kids around you are using quills and think you're weird if you don't, and the adults are all telling you to use quills.

99.99% of 11 year olds will swap to a quill asap.

That's ignoring any potential magic that the quills may have, though from what I remember of canon it seems like most students were using mundane quills.

** Because they are only eleven years old, have just recently learned about magic, and are most likely freaking the fuck out. They are dumb kids and most dumb kids want to fit in and follow along with what every one else is doing. I could see a muggleborn raising a fuss once they are fourteen/fifteen and have had a few years in the wizarding world but not at eleven.

Plus, I'm sure if JK were asked about this she would come up with some sort of 'logic' that the parchment used was charmed only to accept magical ink. You know...because, magic.

JK actually already thought of this argument by coming up with the self inking quill.

** Social reasons. You're /eleven/. Literally everyone else in the school is using these. They're required for your work. Maybe there's an "actual" reason behind it, maybe there's not. But you're an eleven year old /child/ and children are easy to indoctrinate with ideas and ideals. All of your friends are doing it, all of your peers, all of your professors. They treat quills as normal and pens as abnormal. Pens aren't even allowed. /So, like 99.99% eleven year old children, you follow the rules and do as you're told because quills are normal and you want to fit in./

** Hell no, I can actually be reasonably sure it would have never happened.

​

Setting aside the fact there is no way in hell my parents would have allowed for a boarding school at age 11. Setting aside the fact my Mother would have razed Hogwarts to the ground for some of the shenanigans that went on there. Setting aside the fact that my parents would have never allowed me to give up on a primary education (math/science/etc). I would have been completely horrible with the amount of longhand writing Hogwarts would have required to the point of almost certain failure, and would have found another way.

​

When I was in 5th grade (or maybe 4th? Unsure) (so ages 10-11, so a year before Hogwarts) I ended up with a teacher that insisted that the ability to take page-long timed dictation was critical to a 5th grade education. It was supposedly for the unit on grammar. I was basically unable to do this: I was exceedingly slow at writing longhand (and still am pretty much, to this day. I had a hell of a time on the GRE, acing the math and english parts but failing the essays) and it was made clear I'd just fail the class if I was unable to do this particular assignment. It was particularly frustrating when I actually was decent at getting the grammar right, I just either needed more time to write it out longhand or needed to type it which I could do at a decent clip.

My parents were very involved in working through this process, and I ended up on an IEP for that year (It has the ability to force teachers to accommodate).

I'll be honest, when I was young I thought having your parents that involved was simply standard operating procedure (Both my parents were extremely involved even though they both had full time jobs and there were three of us problem children ;) ). I didn't learn till later it wasn't the norm. My family has always had a "You are at school to learn, if you are learning then you are accomplishing your goal. Grades are not important if you are learning the subject matter.".

​

I remember standardized tests, they never made sense to me. When I voiced this, my parents were fully supportive of me opting out of the tests. (The tests help evaluate the school, and have no effect on individual performance. But boy do the schools guilt trip you into participating.) When I was going through, there was a process for opting out, but I can tell you very few people actually went against the mass (I think in a several thousand person school there were less than 10 of us). And, I'd imagine, if there was no formal process for opting out and you just had to go and refuse to take the test, even less would have done that. I'd like to think I'd have the strength of character to have refused if there wasn't a formal opt-out. And this was in elementary school, so I was learning those lessons of questioning authority and carving your own path before I would have entered Hogwarts.

But yes, I would have been a major problem child for this. And I would have raised hell. It helps perhaps, in hindsight, that I have full faith that my parents would have upended their lives and moved to a new location if that was what it took to have their child get a good education. (... You know, this reminds me how much I <3 my parents. Go Dad! Go Mom! You da best!).

** I do write with quills for reenactment and like it, but doing it for a longer time cramps your hand. The Quill is just too thin and slippery. A very pretty and more comfortable alternative would be a [[https://www.dhresource.com/0x0/f2/albu/g7/M00/81/F1/rBVaSltMSieAKri9AAIz61pOLcs278.jpg][glass quill]], which come in many shapes, sizes and weights, making it a lot easier to write with.

Edit: Just realized that if your not bound by the era you reenact, you can use a quill with a metal handle. Also an option to have a better grip.

** fuck that, I'm using an enchanted-to-all-fuck ballpoint pen. Like, buy a model that's not the cheapest plastic, and then start charming away. Unbreakable, everfull, self-cleaning, multiple ink colors, anti-summoning, anti-vanishing, anti-transfiguration, anti-theft, waterproof, etc.

make yourself a super pen and go to town. I don't think I could cope with a Quill for more than a few minutes.

You can probably even put an illusion on it to look like a quill, or even a charm that makes nobody care about it.

** IIRC, there was one story that actually addressed that point. The reason given was that Pens generally do not work well with Parchment and the reason that Parchment was used instead of paper is that Paper is harder to use than Parchment when you're using a Quill.

** The older ones even didn't have the cartridges, but were filled directly from the bottle, so they could be happily compatible with the supplies available in Hogsmeade / Hogwarts.

I think this is just endless disaster, where I suspect JKR was thinking too much about this [[https://atolkienistperspective.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/gandalf-in-the-minas-tirith-library.jpg][image]] and forgot the reality of her story. I can admit that quills were used in the times of The International Statute of Secrecy ratification, but parchment was certainly out long long time ago ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchment#History][Wikipedia says]] 15th century).

However, JKR was still hooked on that image so she had to force poor Hogwarts students to look like Gandalfs even though it didn't make any sense whatsoever.

** One thing to keep in mind is that they're at an age where switching up is not a huge deal to the kids, and to the parents everything would be super strange.

For instance, the elementary school I went to in France never used pencils (and at least one of my teachers would have been apoplectic over introducing them), and we all used fountain pens - finding it completely normal. When I came to the US, all my friends had never used one, and wouldn't want to use fountain pens ever.

Now, for JKR it's pretty obvious that she included quills and parchment instead of pen and paper as a way to differentiate the WW, and make it seem a bit more archaic/traditional. But I don't think it's quite that surprising to have kids that age (perhaps already used to fountain pens) to embrace that as part of a general enthusiasm for this wonderful and strange new world they're a part of.

** For one quills actually write for a surprising amount of time. The feather is hollow, so when you dip the nib not only is there ink all over the tip but the shaft of the quill is also filled with ink. A dip pen (from experience and using fountain pen ink, which is thinner than dip pen ink) will write for three or four words before you need to dip it again. Add in a reservoir in the quill shaft and a thicker ink that flows a bit slower? I wouldn't honestly put almost a whole sentence past a quill before you would need to dip it again. For essay writing that pause would allow someone to stop and consider what they're writing, which would (hopefully) lead to better essays, not that that is likely to happen if the one writing is eleven.

Anyways, just a few thoughts.

In school, we had to use fountain pens even though there are a myriad of other and definitely more convenient kinds of pens. Convenience isn't the final argument in any debate. Magic quills? Magic ink? Maybe it was just a gag on Rowling's side? I don't see what kind of knowledge can be gleaned from asking these questions. HP canon is fiction; not everything has to make sense. And even if it did, that wouldn't mean we'd have to be able to understand its logic.
