** Tom Riddle cowers in the basement of the orphanage he grew up in, along with just a handful of other children. Most of the others had been evacuated to the countryside months ago, but not him. He'd been at Hogwarts when the evacuation happened. Another bomb explodes nearby, shaking the ground, and Tom again considers if he should risk violating the laws against underage magic to protect the building above from destruction. It wouldn't be perfect, but if he managed a similar charm to what they put on Diagon it might reduce the chance of dying a bit. He decides against risking his right to magic, and mentally curses Dumbledore and Dippet and the Ministry of Magic for sending him into a warzone over the holidays, without being allowed to cast a single Protego. And the muggles. Can't forget the muggles are the ones actually causing all this destruction. One day he'll show them what it's like. One day, he'll get his revenge.
