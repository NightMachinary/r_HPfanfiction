** I'd also totally read one where he gets ptsd from burning a teacher to death with his bare hands at age 11. The end of the first book sounds traumatic AF

*** It's not what I call a ptsd fic, but I'm currently writing a variant of Furyvore's linkffn(The Goblet's Surprise) where everyone /else/ gets a firsthand view of all three end-of-year adventures and takes it very badly indeed.

Still in the revision phase, though.

Now that I think about it, though, I remember a oneshot where Harry developed a phobia of gloves because he knew he would have died if Quirrel had been wearing gloves that day.

#+begin_quote
  As part of the Triwizard Tournament, the Goblet of Fire may re-ignite after choosing the champions. This is a rare part of the choosing ceremony during which the goblet justifies its choices by showing something about each champion that influenced its decision.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  AU. The Sorting Hat doesn't just let the Sword go when it falls on Harry's head in the Chamber, but also Sorts him again, this time into Slytherin. Harry is furious and terrified, and the adults aren't helping much.
