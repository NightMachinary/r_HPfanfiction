Looking for anything Hermione centric, cannon compliant, can be about her friendships with Harry or Ginny, relationship w Ron, really anything like slice of life or missing moments kinda things?

  Winner of "Best Depiction of Ron" at the 2009-10 Ron/Hermione Awards on Livejournal. The story of Ron and Hermione's complicated romance, with added biscuits. Not remotely fluffy despite the title, and rated M for later chapters.

  Minerva McGonagall can see a lot of herself in Hermione Granger, and so, when she catches her skipping a Charms class, she decides not to punish her. That decision is the beginning of a friendship that will carry them through triumph and disaster, as Hermione grows up in one of the most turbulent times the Wizarding World has ever known.

  "Penny for your thoughts?" said a voice in the dark.One minute Remus had been alone in the garden, leaning against the Weasleys' broomstick shed, facing away from the Burrow and that peculiar limbo between Order meeting and wedding preparations. But then he lit up, and the flame briefly illuminated the face of Hermione, now lounging next to him. Remus allowed himself a deep drag before answering, "Life's but a walking shadow." She'd get it.Her frown confirmed that she did. "Macbeth sort of mood?" she asked.Macbeth sort of world, Remus thought.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”

** It has even this name, linkffn(The Missing Moments by Ash-and-Vine). The author tried to be complete (and still missed couple of them) so the quality is a bit uneven (sometimes she just rewrites in couple of paragraphs what JKR wrote in one sentence), but some of them are very good. Decidedly following canon.
