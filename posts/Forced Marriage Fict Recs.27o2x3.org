The last thread for forced marriage/bonding was Dramoine, which is a nice ship but I am more of the slash persuasion. Any forced marriage/forced bonding ficts featuring Harry is welcome as long as it's not creature/wing/veela fict.

Bonus Points for:

- over 100k and complete or 70k and updating.
- Harry with either Voldemort/Tom Riddle, Snape or Lucius
- mpreg/implied babies ever after
- well written smut.
- is on an archive I can download from

I have already read The Marriage Stone and would like to see similar quality.


** The sort of thing you're looking for is written badly 99.9% of the time for a very good reason. Your best bet is going to be to take 1 or 2 of these criteria and look for that. The Marriage Stone is the only remotely tolerably written on stories in this style and even that has its fair share of issues.

Long story short good luck, you'll reaaaaaally need it.

*** Aren't you a ray of sunshine? 99.9% of FANFICTION is horribly written but that doesn't stop me form finding little nuggets of goodness. Cheer up a bit. :)
