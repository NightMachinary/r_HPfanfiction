Little bookworm and prankster! Do you like them together? If yes than what is your favorite fanfic? And if you don't like them together than... why? I really wish Rowling put them together in the end. But well... we always have fanfiction, right? :)


** The Arithmancer and sequels have Hermione/George. Close enough?

I liked the first one better than the second, though.

*** I don't know why but I don't like Hermione/George... I can't even tell which one is Fred and which one is George but.. I don't know, I am weird, well.. :)

** On Ao3, my favorite fic of all time is Falling through Time by wittyhistorian!!! The premise is Hermione gets caught in an avalanche 3 years postwar and gets sent back to right after the events at the ministry 5th year and she decides to try to prevent what terrible things she can, and the fremione is top shelf ok??? I love it so much. It is a WIP and the most recent chapter is uh sad but it's so good love it. I feel like this is a good time travel fic for people who don't usually do time travel fics

Another fave, which may be controversial bc i was really into marriage law fics back when they were the trend and yes i am aware of the myriad of human rights violations a marriage law entails I know they're fucked up but what can I say I like what I like. Anyways it's A Sense of Belonging on ff.net by annewed. It pretty much follows standard marriage law stuff, they get matched and start figuring out how they're gonna live together and all that. I haven't read it in a bit but I think this included a fair bit of Hermione working at the shop which was cool

*** Sometimes I read the last chapter to find out if couple is together. I love happy end. And I read that Fred (SPOILER FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T READ FALLING THROUGH TIME) broke up with Hermione so I didn't read this fic :) A sense of belonging - I think I read that! :)

**** Oh well, it was nice to bond with a fellow fremione shipper anyways! I have high hopes for falling through time, and am convinced they'll find their way back to each other, so maybe check back again in a few months and it will be better?? Good luck on your fanfiction hunt!
