In a reversal of the situation that Lily and James had, Daphne meets Harry on the train and takes on James' role. This confrontation causes a butterfly where she goes into Gryffindor with him instead of Slytherin.

Much like James' early interactions with Lily, they were pretty childish (you know, like "pulling on a girl's pigtails because he likes her"), but as they both grew up, it became pretty embarrassing the way she kept trying to flirt with him (and, eventually, how he began to like the attention before he admits to himself he likes her, deep down).

Harry finds her too brash and arrogant... much like how Lily found James for the first few years.

She's jealous of Harry's friendship with another girl in Slytherin, maybe even Tracey Davis or Pansy Parkinson to subvert either the trope of Tracey being Daphne's best-friend or Pansy being one-dimensional, much like how James was of Snape.

The other students find it oddly hilarious and eagerly keep an eye out for the next "episode", like it's all a soap opera: The teachers find it strangely amusing and sad, since they've seen this happen before with his parents.

Snape, however, acts strange on seeing these "episodes": it's like viewing history repeat itself.


** I wouldn't mind reading this. Sounds much more interesting and character-driven than the types of fics that Daphne usually gets shoved into.

Bonus points if there's a young Snape equivalent who is jealous of Harry and Daphne's relationship. Just...not Ginny. Leave that poor girl alone for once, fic authors.

** I think the dynamic could work, but putting Daphne in Gryffindor automatically removes the attractiveness of the pairing... the fact that she's in Slytherin.

Let's be honest people, the only reason Haphne is a thing is because Rowling dropped the ball in making the series so Gryffindor oriented and people like the Romeo-Juliet dynamic of Harry dating a Slytherin. And since we don't know a thing about Daphne, that makes it by default better than Pansy or the rest of the Slytherins.

Also, Daphne in Gryffindor just makes the series even more Gryffindor oriented.

** "Look Potter, I'm sick of dealing with you Lions and your ridiculous prejudices." She slapped away Harry's helping hand, Tracey Davies staggering to her feet with as much of her dignity as she could muster. Her eyes puffy and red and her hands angrily yanking down her robes and skirt, mortified still as the slowly dispersing students still snickered at the view they'd received of her underthings.

Curtesy of the foul Daphne Greengrass, who's housemates Brown and Patil were dragging her away from the the verbal dressing down a furious Harry had given her,

"Look I don't condone what Daphne or any of the others do to you or any of the Snakes who aren't hateful gits. It is wrong and I always call them out, you know that!" Harry's impassioned declaration tinged with desperation. Tracey's eyes were burning with fresh tears, "We're going to get you to Snape or McGonagall and have Greengrass out of here in no time. That was way too far."

"Oh sod off, Potter. I don't need you and your pity parade." She snarled up at him, not at all perturbed by his full body flinch, "I heard you and Weasley earlier, talking about Slimy snakes after cursing Malfoy. Suppose I'm 'one of the good ones' right?!"

"I mean, you are? I- what am I supposed to say?" His voice shook in his throat, suddenly hyper conscious of both the still present crowd and the loathing that flooded into her tear-filled eyes,

"Of course. Cause the great and NOBLE Harry Potter wouldn't deign to sully himself by loitering around a Slytherin unless he had some sort of excuse to make her worthy."

"What's gotten into you?" Harry snapped back at her, her imperious sneer making his skin crawl, "I'm your friend because I like you, Trace. What the hell is your problem?!"

"My problem is my so called best friend is just another Gryffindor pretending he likes me, but mouths off about my house just like everyone else."

"Look, I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean Slytherin's in general are 'slimy Snakes', just Malfoy and his goons." Harry implored, cheeks a bit red and breath coming shorts, "Besides Tracey, he was calling my mum-"

"This isn't about him, Potter! This is about you and your House picking on me for wearing green and 'daring' to speak with you!" She screamed, fists balled at her sides as she took a half step forward. Shoulders squared as angry tears fell, "Besides, why should I care what he said about your mudblood mother?!"

She screamed and everything stopped. The words having barely passed her lips before colour drained from her face. Harry taking a hairbreadth longer to register them.

His glare was murderous.

On the sidelines, Snape's world came crashing down around him. As, once again, he beheld those wide green eyes. They were hers, not just in colour and shape, but in how they looked upon Tracey in that moment. The same glare that had pierced him all those years ago.

"I... I didn't..."

"You know what Tracey-"

"Detention, Miss Davies!" Snatching their attention from one another to the approaching Potions Master, dark eyes alight with a fury neither of them had seen before.

But the thunderous expression did not last. Snape's heart broke a little in the face of her utter defeat. For Harry differed from his mother.

Instead of screaming and shouting at her for saying that word, for spitting in the face of their friendship, for lashing out with her frustrations and insecurities on the one person who wished to help...

He just stormed away without a backwards glance.

***** It does! :)

We know he fallout from the Lily/Snape situation: He falls in with the Death Eaters, and ultimately it leads to Lily being killed because of the partial information he passed on.

At roughly the same time (maybe a year or so later), James stops being a dick and finally catches her interest.

How do you think a reflection would work here?

Tracey pushed further into Pansy's 'camp', and by extension Malfoy's (with the excuse "see, told you Potter was the 'wrong sort')?

Tracey reluctantly becoming a Death Eater or an Unmarked supporter between Sixth/Seventh?

Her giving away information that helped lead to Harry's canon capture at Malfoy Manor (maybe Daphne had "Blood Traitor branded into her skin like Hermione had Mudblood carved into her, or something)? Or where he died (before returning to off Voldemort), shattering her heart into pieces? Or where she became part of the DA, despite people's protests, but the divide is furthered after she unwittingly betrays them like Cho did in the movie or purposefully did like Marietta did (thinking it was for his own good?).

Would talking to an imprisoned Luna help drive things home, and cause her to turn traitor to the Death Eaters to keep Harry safe, like Snape did for Dumbledore (that ultimately failed)?

Would Daphne become more grounded/mature after seeing the sobering effects of the student population dividing? Maybe Astoria, who could still be in Slytherin or be in Ravenclaw after being pressured by her sister, is attacked/seriously harmed? All the while Tracey sees Harry starting to slowly reciprocate Daphne's attentions, which angers/causes more despair?

How about the ending? Bittersweet compared to Snape/Lily? Still being ostracized? Would Tracey let things go/forgive or refuse, becoming bitter like Snape? Would she be involved in the Potters' lives as a godmother or aunt to their children, or something?

Ooh, so many possibilities!

** Harry stomped through the corridors, his temper flaring, and students scattered out of his way, the scene was familiar to some, the aftermath of another Potter-Greengrass event, sometimes dangerous, very noisy, but always entertaining.

The also noticed the way he was going, and if the pattern kept, tomorrow there would be the oft-repeated sequel, a Davis-Greengrass event, this one was always dangerous, and sometimes not that enternaining, and for some reason it rankled Professor Snape something fierce.

Harry opened the door with roughly, and then threw back, closing it with a bang.

The other occupant of the room wasn't impressed.

"Wow, Harry, so much testorone, so much masculinity, are you going to roar now or after?"

Instead of snapping, Harry smiled, and turned sheepishly at his friend.

"Sorry, Trace, it's just..."

"Greengrass" Tracey Davies rolled her eyes, but couldn't stop a little venon from coming out in her voice.

"Yeah," Harry breathed, before looking at one of his best friends and smiling, not noticing her forming blush, those damnable eyes.

He sat down and didn't notice as she scooted closer in the bench, rather, he did notice, but didn't think anything of it, ever since the first year Tracey had been a very physical person, it was the first time Harry was exposed to an abudance of hugs, or close contact, and she was one of the few people he was entirely comfortable with.

"So, Transfiguration or Potions?"

-----

The other day, the event was already expected, for it was spread fast that Daphne Greengrass was told that Harry had spent yet another full afternoon in company of Tracey Davies, the "evil Slytherin".

Which was the opinion of very few(namely Daphne), the only 'evil' Slytherin by commom accord would be one Draco Malfoy, but after a disastrous fourway duel (Crabbe and Goyle were there, but they were taken out in three seconds so they don't count) in Second Year he had decided to stay the hell away from Potter and the crazy women he associated with, thank you very much.

So, it was with a mixture of aprehension, expectation and concern that students saw Daphne Greengrass stalk towards Tracey Davies, while flanked by Susan Bones, Luna Lovegood and Padma Patil.

"Davis, what part of "Stay away from Harry" you didn't understand?"

Tracey subtly palmed her wand, but faked nonchanlance.

"The part where you have any say in what I do or don't do, Greengrass."

The blonde girl huffed, while Luna shook her head and pulled Padma back a little, Susan rolled her eyes but palmed her wand to.

"You listen here you slimy-"

"Oh, sod off Greengrass!" the abruptness was enough to stop the girl so Tracey continued,"I don't know what you are thinkin, but if you think Harry is going to like you while being the biggest bitch in this school you clearly don't know him."

"What? How dare-"

"I dare! He's my best friend and I know him! Harry is gentle and kind, and he would never be with a.../bully/ the likes of you" the brunette took a step closer, making Daphne tense, and two sets of blue eyes, one bright and the darke met, and Tracey said in a low tone.

"I think /I/ have a much better chance."

Luna sighed, and Daphne saw red, snarling in frustration and pointed her wand at the girl.

"You'll never-/Furun"/

"Expelliarmus!"

Daphne wand went sailing to the side, right in the hand of a fuming Harry Potter, flanked by a paling Ron Weasley and indignant Hermione Granger, the first of which was shaking his head and murmuring "Blimey, not again".

Harry's face was red and his eyes glaring, now the student body got a little warier and lot more excited, a Potter-Greengrass-Davies event was a rare treat, but always a messy one, the students were so excited few noticed a first year slip out to call a Teacher, a prefect would only become collateral now.

"What the fuck do you think you are doing, Greengrass?"

"Protecting you from her, Harry!" Daphne pointed at Tracey, who smirked.

Harry sighed and passed his hand through his hair, Daphne noted he was still holding her wand with that hand though.

"Again with this crap? Tracey is my friend, it's you who comes after her, if anything I should protect /her/ from /you."/

Daphne recoiled, Susan shrugged, Luna nodded and Padma sighed, normally Daphne was fun to hang around with, but coming from a traditional family didn't help her social skills at school, if only she would be her normal self around Harry and not do all this posture she would have a genuine chance.

"Me?"

Tracey snorted, and Harry shook his head in disbelief.

Ron was slowly walking backwards while Hermione had opened her book again, wand in hand, this row was shaping up to be another 'air your dirty laundry' one rather than an ' extreme spell shootout' one and Harry was a big boy now, and she had just gotten into Moria, so she would just wait out the teenage drama.

"I don't understand you, Daphne." the anger was out of Harry's voice, and the frustration in it, along with the use of her first name, surprised the crowd.

Daphne looked at Harry oddly "What you don't understand?"

"How you can be so different when it comes to me," he sighed and gestured at Daphne's group "the Daphne I see from afar is like another person, this Daphne that laughs with her friends over silly things, that plays harmless tricks with the Twins, that is kind with the younger students, that trains at night to be one of our best Chasers," Harry looked at her mournfully, and now even Hermione was looking over her book, "this Daphne I would like to know," Harry was blushing now, and Daphne too, "but /this/ one" he pointed at her, his blush disappearing and being replaced by a hard expression "the /bully/ Greengrass, who goes after my friend over nothing, who sneers at people because of their House, that prances around the school like a damn peacock?" he shook his head, Daphne flinching at every sentence.

"This one I will stay well away from, I have no interest in knowing her, never would."

Some students were grimacing now, but Luna had a small, unseen smile.

Harry fixed Daphne with an intense stare "Which one will you be?"

He threw her wand to her as he turned to leave, and she was so shocked that Susan had to catch it, the redhead whistled lowly, before squeezing her best friend's shoulder and turning her around.

"Fucking finally, Daph, let's see if you can take your head out of your ass now."

Ron and Hermione followed their friend, both realizing something had changed.

The crowd was dispersing just as Flitwick turned the corner, he looked at the hallway and sighed mournfully, "Ah, no spells today, good, but I missed it, those always get a good story for the staff room." he remembered a few years ago, when similar rows took place, he just hoped these had a happier conclusion for all parts.

As Harry took Tracey by the arm, he didn't notice the look of dawning realization on her face.

*** Cont.

Over the next few days, the words Harry said to Daphne spread throughout the school, some embellished, other dismissed them, but many noticed how quiet things got regarding Daphne's ground and the Golden Trio(and Tracey) remained the same, though Tracey seemed to be around Harry more, Daphne was seen talking seriously with the Twins, and writing home more too.

It was a week later, when Daphne approached Harry in the common room, Ron tensed, but Harry only narrowed his eyes, her gait was different, less like a peacock strutting around and more like a...lioness stalking in the savanah, there was a even a subtle /sway/ he hadn't noticed it before. He kinda of liked it.

Daphne apparently noticed, because she smiled, and this wasn't the arrogant grin, but a more natural one, pretty, even.

Hermione's eyebrows raised, she glanced between the two before grabbing Ron and leaving, shushing his protests about helping his friend, he wouldn't need their help.

Daphne sat down in the chair in front of him and spoke before Harry could.

"I am sorry."

Almost all conversation stopped, and all the heads turned in their direction, before Hermione glared at them an waved her wand, blurring their images and muffling the sound, completely returning the glares she received from the rest of the common room.

Harry was flabbergasted, Daphne Greengrass apologizing, he almost started using those techiniques Uncle Remus taught him to escape Sirius' when she continued.

"I know, I have been a...bitch these last three years Harry, it's just," she looked around, noticing the privacy spell and nodding at Hermione, who looked on impassively.

"I don't, I don't know what to do sometimes, it's no excuse but," she blushed and Harry recognized her expression from when he was still recently "rescued" by Sirius and had no idea what to do in normal situations as a kid.

Daphne powered on "I don't know how to act like a, a /normal/ girl, ok? I was raised to act like the 'heiress' of House Greengrass" Harry snorted at her airquotes, and Daphne smiled a little "and that doesn't include making friends or" she looked at Harry and blushed hard, but closed her eyes and whispered "/courting/ boys."

Harry's eyes widened, and he blushed just as hard, every lesson Sirius had given him on girls was forgotten at this moment and he gaped.

"Cour-courting?" He said faintly.

"Dating! I mean dating!" Daphne took a deep breath, her anxiety was getting the best of her but she wouldn't lose the glimmer of hope she saw a week ago, "And so, I didn't know what to do, and then I started acting like that, to prove myself, or to call attention, I don't know."

Harry had a good suspicion of /whose/ attention.

"And then I began, and I guess I didn't know how to stop, how to be different in certain," she looked at him again, far shyer than normal "situations."

Harry nodded "So the real you is..."

Daphne jumped at the chance "It's Daphne, the one you spoke about last week! I do like to laugh with my friends, and they are my real friends, Susan and me go way back, Padma I met in the train and Luna..." she smiled.

"Luna is Luna," Harry smiled back in that fond way people who were friends with Luna did, " she's Ron's neighbor and the only reason I paid attention to try and see the 'real' you."

Daphne made a note to buy Luna the biggest box of chocolates she could find, or radishes, whatever she wanted.

"So, you were saying..." he gestured for her to continue.

"Ok, so, my friends, they stand by me, even when I am an arrogant asshole peacock, and I love them, and I..."

Harry raised an eyebrow and Daphne continued, "I don't want to be that person anymore, the.../bully,/ I don't want to become her and I want." she looked at Harry again and gathering all her Gryffindor courage grabbed his hand, making them both blush fiercely, "I want you to know me Harry, the real me, and I want to know you too, the real Harry Potter, not the one I brought out by being an asshole."

Harry grinned at her, feeling her soft hands and unknowingly turning on the 'Potter Charm' that Sirius said would bring many an irate father to their doorstep, he squeezed her hand softly, massaging the back of it with his thumb, making Daphne blush redder than she had before.

"Well, Daphne, I like this idea," he said, looking her in the eyes "but," her face began to fall when he continued "you will have to show to me, I think you are very beautiful," he hesitated a little before kissing the back of her hand, unknowingly setting off a round of gasps around the room and even the exchange of currency, "smart and even kind," he frowned at her, "but you have tormented Tracey, and she's my friend, so you'll have to apologize to her."

Daphne's eyes widened and she had to resist the urge to pull her hand back "Apologize, to /her?/ But she'll never-"

Harry stopped her protest with a raised hand, before returning it to holding her hand, much to her appreciation, "I know there's some bad blood between you two, and I don't expect you to reconcile and become best friends overnight." he squeezed her hand and fixed her with a stare that reminded her he had been raised by the Head of House Black, "but you must be the one to extend the olive branch, Daphne, you began this, and you must be the one to try to end it," he sighed "if Tracey accepts it or not it's her decision, but you will have done your part."

Daphne gulped "And if she tries to curse me?"

"She won't, believe me."

And Daphne did.

"And I will stop playing tricks on the Slytherins too."

Harry nodded with a smile, that Daphne returned.

"But we may do it to Malfoy if he doesn't leave my sister alone."

Harry chuckled "I never heard you saying that, Daphne."

Daphne laughed(and how Harry liked her real laugh) and held his hand, they both knew it wouldn't be so easy, that many wouldn't believe, but Harry chose to take a page out of Professor Dumbledore's books and believe people could change, not knowing he had given the same counsel to his mother decades ago.

When he signaled Hermione and she ended the privacy spell with a suspicious look, Harry smiled at her and turned to Daphne, speaking in a low tone.

"I would like to know more about this Daphne, and this weekend is a Hogsmeade one..."

Hermione groaned as they finalized their plans, this would spread and the drama, and when Tracey found out.

Lee Jordan however smiled, and strutted towards a group of older years with a large smile, "Oi, mates, would look at the date, oh, just /before/, the first Hogsmead weekend, which means...everyone here owes me money!"

**** Cont 3(mods is there anyway you can blend all this, I am really sorry about the size, but I can't help myself)

The news that Harry Potter would take Daphne Greengrass on a date spread like fiendfyre through the school by the other day everyone knew, and many bets were won and lost, among the staff, the winner was neither Minerva nor Albus, but Pomona, who explained in the staff meeting.

"Girls mature faster than boys, and boys are much more tolerant to some things, not to mention, James was much worse."

Not all was hapiness and fun, for one Tracey Davis, her heart was shattered, she should've known it was a matter of time, Daphne was taller, prettier, richer, when she wanted she was even charming, and Harry was a /boy,/ of course when the girl finally tried she would get him.

It didn't stop her tears though, Harry had always been oblivious to her feeling at least she hoped so, it was too painful to think she was in Hermione territory, of being thought off as a sister.

So she was crying at the Astronomy Tower, she guessed they would start dating now, and Harry would fall in love with her and...is this what she got for being his friend? Perhaps Malfoy was right and she was just a loser half-blood who was good at Transfiguration and would never amount to nothing, certainly not good enough to be 'Mrs. Potter'.

"Miss Davis"

Tracey jumped at the voice of her Head of House, she turned expecting to see his disgust at her weakness, but stopped at the look on his eyes, she had never see them so expressive before, pain, regret, anger even loneliness was there.

Tracey hiccuped and tried to dry her tears uselessly, but she didn't care now, what was he going to do, 'detention for crying'? McGonagall would jump his throat.

"Miss Davis, I am only going to say this once, so listen well."

There was a weight to his words, a reality and regret that were palpable, so she did her best to listen.

"I know, what you are feeling, this betrayal, this pain," he shuderred and Tracey didn't know how to reconcile her stoic and sarcastic Head of House with this one full of regret "I know you must be feeling anger, at Mr...Potter now, and at Miss Greengrass, perhaps event at yourself."

Tracey nodded without thinking, she certainly wanted to go and scream at them, what, she did not know.

"I am going to tell you, to try and control this anger, ir hurts, but if you lash out now, you may do and...say things you'll regret."

She was about to lash out, to scream at him, his post be damned, what he knew of what she was feeling. He apparently could read her because he said in harder tone, his eyes darker than normal.

"Tell me, Miss Davis, how would your life be without Mr. Potter? Imagine it."

She did, and she almost curled into a ball, she loved Harry, there, now she admited it, he was her best friend, even if she wasn't his, and she was always afraid of telling him because she feared he would reject her, that it would hurt their friendship. And now where had that left her? But without him, she would be, less, the world would lose a bit of it's color without his laugh there, his encouraging words, his good jokes, his bad potion jokes, the little funny spells he always showed her first when he managed to do it. Her world without Harry would be, horrible.

"I see you've gotten my point." Snape said, "If you lash out now, against either of them, there's a good chance you will irreparably damage your friendship and I can /guarantee/ you, that you will regret that eternally."

Tracey nodded, the weight with which he said that was clear, he was speaking from experience. But she didn't want to give up.

"So I should just accept it!?Let her win"

A deep frown came upon Snape's face and now he was looking past her,"It will be hard, you may suffer in the beginning, they will become close, and if you keep antagonising her and she doesn't return it, you will be seen as the agressor, she will come to ask for your forgiveness, and you may or may not give it to her, do not howeve,r attack her, it will hurt for a time, but,"and now he almost smiled, "no one knows the future, /teenagers/," he sneered, "can be fickle, and you are /Slytherin/, bid your time."

Had Professor /Snape/ just given her /relationship advice/ what was the world coming to? But she couldn't stop the spark of hope from surging in her heart, it was dim, but she would feed it.

"Do not hang entirely on this though, for all you know they may even /marry/," he looked beyond her again, "but if you lash out now, you may lose him entirely, if you do not, you may keep him as a friend, or maybe more, the choice is yours, Miss Davies, all I can say you is that if you surrender into your anger, you /will/ regret this."

He looked at her for a moment, his eyes coming back to the present, before he nodded, and with whisp of cloth, was gone, as suddenly as he had arrived.

And Tracey Davis was left with a lot to think about.

---So with a more stable political enviroment, less emotional and angstry teenagers, will history repeat itself, or will the Slytherin half-blood play their cards right?

I don't rightly know, this practically wrote itself, sorry for the grammar, my Grammarly is not working on Chrome.
