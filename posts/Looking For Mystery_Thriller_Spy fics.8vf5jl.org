Hey y'all,

So I'm very partial to spy fiction ranging from the “Martini flavored” (James Bond) to the “Stale Beer” (John Le Carre) type. I was a big fan of Midnight Blues by Zeitgeitst84 (which is sadly abandoned). There are a couple of others which fit but I can't think of them at the moment. I prefer longer stories, doesn't have to be completed, but I would prefer ones which have not been abandoned. The story can focus on aurors, unspeakables, spies, spy networks, investigations, etc. It can be more James Bond-esque, funny like Archer, or serious and focused on the more “tedious” elements of spy work. If y'all know of anything please recommend! Thanks in advance.


** A a few fics from my FFN favorites that might fit:

linkffn(Invisible Circus by sceneii) has Ron pretending to be a Death Eater sympathizer, even in front of Harry, Hermione, and his family. It's been a while since I read it, but I remember it's not memorably dark and pretty okay plot-wise.

ffn(Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy by Mad Maudlin) is Draco/Ron slash. It's ridiculously fun from what I remember. Again, it's been a while.

ffn(The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5), you've probably already heard about.

ffn(Spitfire by Windschild8178) isn't /quite/ abandoned -- yet -- but its last update did end in a huge and very unsatisfying cliffhanger. It's darker than The Dark Lord Never Died IMO.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Harry Potter is hearing voices, well, one voice; Ron Weasley. His 'maybe' dead ex-best friend who might have betrayed him to his greatest enemy. With such uncertainty in the case file of Ron Weasley, the wizarding world see fit to condemn and move on, but when Ron reappears after two years of absence events are set in motion that will reveal the depths of human endurance and love.

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_general_election,_2018][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] takes place in a non-magical sci-fi universe. Hogwarts is an elite spy school; Purebloods are European aristocracy; Weasleys become the Wellesleys; and James Potter was the 007 of his time. Many canon stations are rehashed, although details can differ greatly. Years 6 and 7 take about half of the total story length.

*** *Ontario general election, 2018*

The Ontario general election of 2018 was held on June 7, 2018, to elect the 124 members of the 42nd Parliament of Ontario. The Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, led by Doug Ford, won a majority government with 76 of the 124 seats in the legislature. The Ontario New Democratic Party, led by Andrea Horwath, formed the Official Opposition. The Ontario Liberal Party, led by incumbent Premier Kathleen Wynne, lost official party status in recording both the worst result in the party's 161-year history and the worst result for any incumbent governing party in Ontario.

** I like stories where Percy ended up helping a lot of people from inside the Ministry, like espionage work. It redeems him as a character and a person. Plus, it makes his involvement in the war a lot more tangible.
