Hey guys! I'm looking for more fics similar to “Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise”. I'm really interested in stories where Harry is not the chosen one, and his parent/s are dark wizards and death eaters. Thank you for recommendations!!

** Just a tip: recommendation is when you recommend a story you like, when you are asking for recommendations the correct flair is request. Not really a problem, happens all the time and petty much no one really cares at this point, just FYI.
