** I'm playing with a 'wrong boy who lived idea' where Lily and James aren't abusive asses and no one think's Harry is 'dark'

​

This is mostly because no one knows Harry is alive.

​

In this story, Peter didn't become a DE, and is in fact babysitting Harry and his twin when Tom comes visiting. Peter tries to fight, but Tom easily overpowers him and decides that he's going to make Peter watch as he kills the boys, because Tom has never read the Evil Overlord list and does stupid shit like that.

​

One killing curse is cast, and it bounces off Harry's head, in a rather destructive manner, just as in canon. Both Tom and Peter are killed by the reflected curse. Peter, still being the secret keeper, dying inside the Fidelus causes the spell to change, collapsing into Harry, making him both the focus of the Fidelus and his own secret keeper.

​

So, all knowledge of Harry's existence evaporates. The boys, both conscious, are sitting in the rubble of their room, and Harry without knowing what he was doing, tells his twin who he is, becoming for all practical purposes, his brother's imaginary friend.

​

*** I'm not much of a WBL type, but this story seems so cool? How do you explain Harry surviving, since it's not through Lily's sacrifice ? (In fact, I have a lot of questions, so I'll just wait patiently until you, hopefully, start publishing it haha).

** I have two and even though i wrote other stories before, these are my first two HP fanfiction works so hopefully they will turn out good.

One is a OC story where a group of people three years younger than Tom Riddle struggle through Hogwarts and the First War. This is more focused on characters and slightly on world building with a plot to move characters along their journey.

The other is a female-Slytherin-Harry story where Voldemort chooses the boy over the girl and Lestranges go after the Potters. Lily is murdered because she is a Muggleborn and James ends up in the Janus Thickey Ward. This kind of a mental exercise of mine for "what if she was a girl" and starts in third year when a prisoner named Peter Pettigrew escapes Azkaban.

** I have two fics I'm working on right now, neither of which is released.

The first is untitled, so far. It has Tri-Wizard tournament go differently because they bring in an OC enchanter as a contractor to with the third task. He has an apprentice who offers to tutor Harry so he can survive the tournament. It's fairly OC and AU-worldbuilding heavy, especially around magical beings. I'm trying really hard to not write yet-another-GoF rehash, as well.

The other, almost certainly better written fic is called Carrion Flower. Sirius Black, after leaving Hogwarts at the end of PoA discovers and awakens an undead Lily Potter in an old safe-house that she and James set up. At least, she seems to be Lily.

Also, paying for college means I more or less get home from my job, shower eat and go sleep in bed.

** I have, against my better judgement, started drafting plot outlines for what I want to do after my current work is complete. I've got two stories I'm thinking about,

One is Harry as an Auror being sent to Norway to investigate weird rumours about the Norse pantheon resurfacing after centuries of silence.

The other is a Avengers-style team-up of Masters of Death from different timelines, brought together by Death to face a threat greater than all of them.

** I have been working for the last two years on the novel about the change of heart of Petunia Evans (she divorced Vernon) living in Czechia and studying at Budeč (that's the Czech magical school, the real place). All written in Czech, but lately I had to make some radical cuts and I am now preparing out takes translated into English to be published. Very much draft and unfinished version is [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/outtakes.html][on my web]].

** In November of 1981, Sirius is surprised to find himself rescued from Azkaban by a couple of red-haired brothers who claim to be from Kazakhstan, which explains why no one in magical Britain knows them. They look almost like twins, but the more-insane one looks older than the less-insane one. They adopt Sirius as a brother and turn him into a ginger with potions.

Whenever I share bits of this story, readers scream for more, but I don't have a good enough plot to support all the Weasley twin + Marauder zaniness. I don't want it to be just another horcrux scavenger hunt speed run.

** I'm working on an OC centric story where the canon characters are mostly background. The OC has her own drama going on.

It's set during the books but I'm only writing starting from GoF or OoTP (still tryna figure out the right spot to start). She's in the twins' year. Love interest? Perhaps. I'm trying to be organic with it.

But it's story a focused on exploring the magical world from a different perspective at the same time as canon. Lots of character work, decent world building, hopefully good plot (plot is tough for me).

I'm so excited about it. I love my character, she's flawed and normal and deals with being a kid in a time when the world is going berserk around her.

I want to explore femininity, identity, belonging, desperation, love, betrayal and all the grey areas in these concepts.

Also, Oliver Wood cause you never really get over your childhood crush, do you? Not really.

Honestly, I never intended on posting but being in this sub has encouraged me somewhat. Also, discouraged me somewhat cause it seems OC's aren't the best liked. Still, it's been a blast to write.

** A few Game of Thrones related ideas (those are almost finished), a "Hufflepuff Harry" story with (unplanned) magical adoption (that one will be a tad cracky), various Harry/Background character one-shots which go for alternate characterisations for those characters than what is considered fanon.

Also, a Hermione dropped into Game of Thrones with book knowledge where she abuses the hell out of magic (those self insert stories where the SI has to work years to build x? One wave of the wand and you have a car in front of you.) I originally intended it to be Harry/Hermione, but realised that Harry in GoT does not really work since he would be neither interested nor capable of playing the game unless you go with a drastically altered characterisation for him.

**** Yes, and no. The SIs require to be a noble in order to work, and even then most are completely unrealistic because the authors rarely know how many steps are needed to produce X or Y. And one person carrying that effort in even a decade is completely unrealistic unless they have magic. I mean, you'd need a hundred thousand tons of steel to build a railroad from Moat Cailin to Last Heart, nevermind the supporting infrastructure and industries. That is simply unfeasible for one person to carry (figuratively).

Also, Hermione's magic bag can carry a whole library, so you don't have to waste years on rediscovering basics you can find in the encyclopaedia Britannica.

****** Yes, but what most SIs don't understand is that in order for most industries to exist, you need some place which builds the machines they use. That most products of the industrialisation require quite a lot of tooling, and that it took a century to go from the steam engine to the industrial age because it took a lot of time not only to invent stuff but also to produce those things in significant quantities (power tools for construction, billions of bricks for all the new buildings, thousands of tons of steel). I began to outline an industrialisation story but realised that it was simply impossible to do without magic.

And I've read A Farmer's tale, I can't say that it was very engaging because the protagonist has almost no drive to achieve anything beyond his daily life. Compare that to Hermione, especially once she learns of Slavers Bay.

All she needs to do is find a decent Lord (Stark, Manderly, Maege Mormont) and become Court Witch for them. And knowing that the ice zombie apocalypse is coming would be a good motivation to prepare them for a war against the dead (which Hermione would make pretty one sided tbh).
