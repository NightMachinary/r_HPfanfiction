Whether he resist her or give in to her because of the built up tension doesnt matter. Although Harry being Single is a possibility, i would have him be in a Relationship. It not important with who.

** Whomever posted hope I question whether or not you have ever read it. Gabrielle does nothing of the sort in that story. She tests her allure on him, which is as close as it gets. She actually forces Harry to wait until he is in love with her before taking her, not just to save her. Smh, how is that relevant?
