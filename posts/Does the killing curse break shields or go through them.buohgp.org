** It must be that it passes through, or else a single spell would be sufficient to take down any magical protections.

** I always think of it as going through magical shields, and destroying physical ones.

*** I could be wrong but I think walls, statues, and thick physical objects can block them? Not sure about transfigured items though, since that would be magical in nature.

**** Sorry yes, I should have clarified: AK passes through magic shields as if they don't exist, but stops when it hits a solid object, although the object will be either cracked or shattered depending on its size and material.

***** We see the AK react in different ways to the same material in book 5.

- /But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from it's plinth, and landed on the floor with a crash between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms, protecting Harry./
- /“Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces . . . .”/ (OP36)

​

And with another type of material.

- /“He sent another killing curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security desk, which burst into flame.”/ (OP36)

****** So the difference is 'glanced off' vs. 'took the blast.' It seems that it's almost like a water balloon of death - if it doesn't get a clean enough hit, it just bounces off, but if it hits, it triggers. We know that it kills humans without a mark, and yet here it is shattering stone and bursting desks into flame.

Theories: the jet of green light wasn't a Killing Curse. The security desk might not have been one, either - Harry doesn't capitalize it, meaning it might just be a curse that's lethal, rather than Avada Kedavra. Alternately, when not given a heart to stop or a soul to eject or whatever it is that happens when the curse hits you, it builds up force or friction inside an object, causing it to burst into flame if flammable, or else shatter if it is inflammable.

******* Could very well be. My personal guess is that since most of these were done silently the power behind them varied. And the amount of material that can be destroyed changes.

​

Maybe the angle of the spell also matters. Who really knows.

​

But what is important here is that the statue that was not destroyed continued to function after. It seems the magic that was used to make it move was not affected by the Curse. Or at least not to such an extend that it could not move while not having been shattered like the one armed statue was.

****** Yeah, because Rowling can't even keep her own rather dull and unimaginative magic straight.

I mean really, a killing curse? Can you think of anything more /boring/? (I can: the greatest villain and post powerful curse defeated by a mediocre student using a disarming spell).

The hell is the point of any other basic-bitch projectile spell (like 99.99% of spells in HP) if this one kills all the time?

It's like having an armed force that can use guns and bullets, but instead you have them use BB guns and pellets.

** I've always thought that it depends. I always imagined a magical shield to sort of be a competition, where you pit your defensive magic against their incoming spell. The shield charm is just really efficient at utilizing that magic, which allows you to defend against spells that are much more powerful than your shield. However, sufficiently strong spells will be able to shatter your shield. I imagine the killing curse to just be a /very/ high-energy spell, which cannot be defended normally. If you manage to give your shield another power source that can overwhelming the curse, that's another story. Also helps me explain why wards collapse (the energy is overwhelmed.)

** We know that the AK does not remove an animation charm on a statue if the statue is not completely destroyed.

(From Book 5, in the Dumbledore vs. Voldemort fight)

​

This makes me think that it ignores shields as well and do not take them down.
