I've recently developed a taste for fics where Harry finds out he's not the biological son of James and/or Lily but sadly my search skills leave much to be desired and I'm having trouble finding more. I prefer ones where his real parent/s are a Death Eater (Especially Bellatrix), but as long as it's not Snape (shudder) or Remus I'm not too fussed. Crossovers are fine, as long as I don't need to know the source material to understand it. Please no slash or Fem!Harry though.


** Try linkffn(Without Thorn the Rose). It isn't a /great/ story, but it is pretty solid, and it has what you're looking for. The identity of Harry's father is a major plotline of the story.

  A bittersweet coming-of-age story for fans of good writing. Lily died, and left James to raise a stranger's son alone. In the shadows of Azkaban, Harry learns from Dementors and Death Eaters, while in the caverns of the sea a mysterious power awaits the chance to steal his soul. Warnings inside.
