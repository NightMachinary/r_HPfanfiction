** I would also really enjoy a Harry who doesn't gain the ability to turn into a dragon until Hogwarts time, but has read stories like The Hobbit, so he acts like a high fantasy dragon because "that's how dragons act", even though it's not exactly what they do in the HP world. Especially if his main focus is gathering a hoard of treasure and sitting on it.

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

*** I've read that one, it's alright but him being a dragon doesn't really have any kind of impact on the story. With him being human-sized, and perfectly capable of using magic and all, and even flying a broom. It felt to me more like a visual change then anything, all it did was make everyone do a double take when they saw him

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** It's hard to find really any non-human Harry fics that don't drop the entire premise after the 1st chapter and basically have him enter school like a normal child. I read one once which had really well done how a dragon would interact, but it took an odd turn, abandoned, then deleted. If anybody ever thought about writing this I'd be very interested in it as well

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, everyone expected Harry Potter to become an auror. Harry himself expected it, right up until the moment came to apply to the academy. He takes up a hobby instead, and it leads him to a whole new world.
