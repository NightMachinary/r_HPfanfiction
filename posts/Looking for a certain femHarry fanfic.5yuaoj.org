I think Malfoy does something to hurt Harry, it turns him female as he fights it off and the energy rebounds and does the same to Voldemort. Once she wakes up he is quite independent. She claims the title of slytherin, which is done by goning to the Chanber of Secrets and watching all the times she beat Voldemort. I remember that during the Halloween attack Voldemort complains about Grey Wizards because they don't follow the rules and that once he got to the house James attacks him with his wand and a gun. Once Harry finishes watching all her victories, Slytherins' statue announces it to the school.

Thanks in advance
