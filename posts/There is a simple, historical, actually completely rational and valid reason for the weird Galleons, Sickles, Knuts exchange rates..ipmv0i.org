  Not even gold seems very useful in canon as galleons only seem valuable due to the magic in them. They're fat and heavy and yet a thousand of them can be carried in a pocket. It seems that it's the goblin magic that provides weightlessness and value to the coin, which explains why the serial number refers to goblin who casted the coin. It seems that gold would have to be turned into galleons by goblins, where ministry oversight can easily control the process.

Quoting my previous comments on coinage in the wizarding world, I think that the exchange rate was fixed by the ministry. It might be arbitrary and it might have been chosen because of some magical meaning to the numbers. However, I think it's important to note that I don't think that the economy would tank if the market was flooded with silver or gold. Though the value of gold and silver might decrease, the value of currency stems from the magic and minted nature of the coins. The ministry definitely oversees the process of minting (they're called goblin rebellions for a reason/goblins aren't allowed wands) and can therefore control the economy.

** This is fun, but I think a simpler explanation is that it's just based on British currency pre-decimalisation, like how wizarding Britain uses old-fashioned weights and measurements.

Although, I've no idea what pre-decimalisation currency was based on, it could well be the weight of metals!
