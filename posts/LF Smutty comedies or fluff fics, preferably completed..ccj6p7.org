Looking for some fun comedic stories that involve smut like Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor by Cloneserpents. Doesn't have to be explicitly smutty (A Black Comedy comes to mind) either. Fluffy smut is good as well.

Preferably completed.

As to abide by the subreddit rules (and verified by a mod) please don't give actual links (or use ffnbot to link it) for any smut involving underage characters. You can type out the title/author though, like I did with Sword of Gryffindor.

******* Rorschach's Blot (the author of LL&L) likes to take the set ups for pwp stories and then write crack stories based on this. So despite the massive amount of implied sex (mostly Ron) there is nothing more explicated than say, a James Bond movie. On the Fluff front, he is (IMHO) the best at writing characters just hanging out so the scenes of Harry and Hermione (and Luna later on) are very good to read. Also worth reading on that front (though it takes awhile to get there) is Lord of Caer Azkaban. linkffn(Lord of Caer Azkaban)
