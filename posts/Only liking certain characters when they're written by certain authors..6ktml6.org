I was wondering if it was just me. I know some people hate certain characters and won't read fics because of it, but would they read a fic if that character was written well? For me it's Ginny. I am mostly not a fan, but when an author does a really nice job of making her sarcastic, independent, confident and witty, I pray that they have written more stories with her in it. Anyone feel the same for characters they usually never want mentioned in a story? (Feel free to list characters, stories and authors) Thanks!


** Truthfully, it's mostly the opposite for me. There's some authors that have written a character so badly, that I try to avoid all other stories that author his written using that character. This is most prevalent with Daphne Greengrass, but also happens with Fleur, Tonks and Luna.

**** ^ This. I hate it when people make Luna normal, or her weirdness due to something, or a seer, or all of the above.

I'm a little more moderate than you as I don't mind if it's not crack, but I /love/ it when Luna is weird for the sake of being weird, and doesn't have any prophetic comments about the current situation, or isn't unusually perceptive, or whatever. I like it when people just kind of humour her because she's totally wacko and they don't know how to deal with it.

***** I like perceptive!Luna, it makes the character more interesting. I like crazy awesome if it's done right. I mostly agree with the rest.\\
Making her a seer is very lazy. Explaining her weirdness could certainly be done well, but it's not usually the case.\\
Canon Luna is weird but functional (mostly...).\\
I like when she's smart as well as weird.

I like it when it later turns out that she's not totally wacko but scary smart despite her ridiculous beliefs.

** I'm pretty open to liking any character so long as they're well written. One thing that bothers me is a lot of the 'wackier' characters like Luna, Sirius, and Fred and George fall into irritating tropes and patterns. For example, if Fred and George exclusively finish each other's sentences or Luna only says absurd things. It seems people often struggle to find a balance between humor and actual characterization.

*** Luna is very complex and difficult to write. I like her when she's talking about stuff like nargles, but really hinting at something else, like her bullies or somebody else's mood. Luna was raised by a conspiracy theorist. She's dreamy, she's not schizophrenic or teh penguin of doom.

With Marauder fics, people often ignore Peter and turn Sirius into Joey from Friends. And Remus is always obsessed with chocolate, to the point where it's a bigger problem than lycantropy. I'm pretty sure he only had that on him on the train because he was warned about the dementors. In the book, chocolate actually does help with that.

I like it when the Marauders are regular 70's British lads. They should be a bit more rough around the edges and more mature. There's also screaming Lily. She only screamed that one time, when a bully was undressing her best friend in public.

I agree, Luna's a smart kid with issues. It doesn't make her completely nuts.

I would love to see a fic doing that literally. Luna using a penguin animagus form in battle.

** I really like Sirius when he's more important than in canon (where there weren't really any Sirius-Harry bonding stuff), and Ginny when she's like you describe in the OP. (Misplaced Moony did those characters well in my opinion.)

The opposite would be said about Lily in Marauder fics when she's exactly like Hermione, or even worse, when Pandora's present and is a carbon copy of the worst kind of wacky "seer" Luna. Especially when Luna seems to take after her father, and there are more "evidence" of Ron being a seer in canon.

** There aren't really any characters I dislike with the possible exception of Umbridge. And, she can be interesting in a grotesque, banality of evil sort of way.

With that said, I can definitely feel indifferent toward characters. Although, most fics where they show up or are a main character end up emphasizing all the reasons why I couldn't care less about them (see harem and/or romance fics). Rarely do I come across an exception that temporarily peaks my interest (see Tonks in Nymphadora Tonks in the Liquor of Jacmel), and the impact isn't enough to make me read anything else by the author for that character, specifically.

Like Lord_Anarchy, I'm more likely to do the opposite: avoid authors or drop stories that portray certain characters in certain ways.

Closest I come to what the OP experiences is when I'll eagerly await updates from authors who portray minor characters I love whose portrayal in the vast majority of fics is unsatisfying. Speaking as both a Percy fan and a Scrimgeour fan, it is a rare and beautiful thing when it happens. Especially, the latter as such fics are much harder to find, and I do love Percy even when he's being an absolute swot.

So everything you hate about the character is written in the way that made you hate them in the first place? Ron abandons his friends during the Horcrux Hunt when they need him most, in canon, then he had the gall to ask Hermione to leave with him; he wanted to leave his best friend of seven years, alone, fighting the most dangerous Wizard of all time. He's a cunt and no amount of characterization by a different author will change that because the only way to do so is by making him OOC, therefore not Ron.
