I also somehow included the weirdest subplot ever while trying to create a harem for Harry, so, uh, there's that.

I'm also writing a sequel!

linkffn(The Most Cliche HP Fic Ever)

Enjoy?


** This would have been perfect, except for one thing.

You have broken clich√© fic tradition by having him actually USE a power discovered by the goblins.

** What the fuck did I just read

That was NOT the most cliche harry potter fic ever, that title is still held by linkffn(king of magic)

BUT you do own the title for the biggest clusterfuck of a fic ever like holy shit

Btw that hotel thing was funny

I think you were the first person I ever saw that made Harry capable of controlling the universe.

I can see that it's wettien like tjis but it dosny mayter so whatever

** I very much appreciate that Harry somehow imperioed and killed the Dursleys and Mrs. Figg; made 12 horcruxes; performed tracking charms, transfiguration, accio, and a killing spell; killed all of the Dark Lord's followers; and freed Sirius from Azkaban...before he found out he was a wizard.
