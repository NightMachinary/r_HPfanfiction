** So, [[http://fukari.deviantart.com/][Fukari]] is one of the accounts on DA I follow more closely. I checked today and found this little gem of a jpg.

We know that McGonagall is a bit annoyed by Trelawney in the time of HP. She thinks divination is hogwash. However, she does care on some level for Sybill.

As I said in the title, that gave me a few ideas. From fun ones where both never really quit their friendship, to more tragic ones where Sybill couldn't stomach her abilities and descended into drug abuse.

Anyway, maybe someone has a spark and writes a bit about it. Hell, maybe we spawn another "Red Headed Stepchild" :P

*** I'd think it's a combination of the two. They are still friends but McGonagall publicly has to disapprove of the drug use. In private they still meet once a day for tea and talking.

*** I'm sure there are cushioning charms on broomsticks made to protect a lady's charms. Sitting directly on a broom does not a comfortable person make.

Also, she's leaning onto her hands, Trelawney's weight likely balancing her out.

Oh, and magic.

** I'm not seeing it. How does them having been friends before open up any new plotlines or anything, Trelawney is just kind of a write off. She really only does one thing of import in the whole story, and I suppose you could change things to make her competent or just a good divination teacher, but I don't see any tragic ideas that would come of it.

On another note, this reminds me. In canon why does Dumbledore even bother to move her to Hogwarts considering how awful she is at teaching. Sure she is a real seer, but that doesn't seem to have helped her at all with her teaching. I know he said it was to keep her protected or the prophecy safe or something but that makes no sense. She doesn't remember giving the prophecy so nobody would be able to force her to tell it, even with occlumency or the imperius curse.

And I suppose Voldemort could have known she told the prophecy, but Dumbledore really handicaps a whole generation in terms of divination because she is such an awful teacher. Actually, maybe he doesn't care about that because he thinks Divination is garbage except for seer's who don't need training at all.

*** The tragic idea would be for two girls meeting each other, becoming best friends, giggling over boys, helping each other in class and planning for their lifes after Hogwarts. Then Minerva has to witness how being a seer slowly changes Sybill. She becomes a bit weird at first and Minerva brushes it off. Sybill starts taking potions and drugs and Minerva brushes it off as her being just rebellious - even indulges herself a few times. Then Hogwarts ends and while Minerva becomes a rising star in the Transfiguration community, Sybill falls deeper and deeper into a hole made of visions, prophecies and way too much alcohol, drugs and potions to make herself forget. Minerva tries to help her, but there is nothing she can really do. It ends with Sybill giving the prophecy, and when Dumbledore brings her to Hogwarts, Minerva finds nothing more than a shell of her best friend.

I always imagined Sybill Trelawney as a hidden, tragic character. I have a bit of a headcanon for her, so maybe imaging something with her comes easier for me. Next to the stuff we know, I imagine that she suffers from madness due to her visions and her inability to remember them. Shes technically not a seer, but an Oracle, as she needs to be in trance to see the glimpses of the future. She knows that she made prophecies, even though she can't remember them and that drives her crazy. She tries to force them by over and over repeating what she thinks are trigger words in front of important people. She suffers from severe depression and the occasional panic attack after normal slips of the mind, because she fears that she, once again, made a prophecy without remembering. Due to her complete inability to actually force visions through techniques of Divination, she has developed a great, private hate against her heritage from the talented great-great-grandmother Cassandra. She also has the pressure of her family on her, and is thought a failure due to her inability to See from tea-leafs and the like.

A friendship between them wouldn't change much in canon, I'd guess. For all we know they could be friends and meet every night for a bit of a talk. It wouldn't be against canon.

**** I suppose you could write it that way, I never considered it since she was so one dimensional in canon. More of a plot device than an actual character IMO. The thing that doesn't really fit though is that I thought all people who spoke prophecies (I didn't know there was a distinction between seer and oracles in HP) did not have any control over them or remember speaking them. So it seemed as though Trelawney did not know she had ever spoken a prophecy either before or after she spoke of the prophecy about Harry/Neville.

***** Well... /Disclaimer:/ the second part of my comment is headcanon galore.

In canon she is definitely only there to A) foreshadow some stuff (Sirius, for example) and B) be a plot device, as you said.

No, its canon that they don't remember. But that doesn't mean people can't tell them. I just imagined that this would drive me insane - to be used as Fate's mouthpiece and I can't remember. Especially when I suck at "active" divination. I'd feel used. Also, I think even if people don't tell her, Sybill may put two and two together and figure out herself that she spoke a prophecy, given that she's supposedly from a line of seers.

The distinction between a seer and an oracle isn't HP canon. Its more of a general distinction between the real life versions of future tellers. Seer, Oracles, Prophets,... they all have some kind of definition. Oracles are in trance to be used by higher forces to speak to the mortals (like the Pythia in the Oracle of Delphi). Seer actively search for signs of the future (Reading thrown bones, tea-leafs, the flight of the ravens,...). Prophets are given the information by a higher being and spread the message on their own terms.

****** On a side note, Dumbledore and Grindelwald would be really interesting as prophets who were told the same things by the same deity with life bringing them to have different views on those statements.

I myself have now added prophet to my classification of dumbledore alongside mad scientist, super gay stereotype, pope wannabe, Jedi, ninja, hipster, hardass, lacking all common sense, and having a both a god complex and an inferiority complex.

This is the same school that employs Binns and Snape.

#+end_quote

Given Dumbledore is a planner, this could be deliberate, either on his own part or as a Ministry-mandated idea. There's a lot of fuel there. After all, if you ran the country (badly) or held a monopoly on lots of powerful positions, would you really want to enable a generation of young bright potential seers who might be able to challenge or legitimately criticize you in a way you couldn't discredit?
