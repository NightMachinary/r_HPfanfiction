I admit I never read a fic where Master of Death has any merit to it other than being a simple legend about people who possess all three Hallows. Even in the books, Harry survives due to other circumstances than because he is the Master of Death. So do you know of any fics that discuss what other powers the title offers than being purely symbolic? Or do you have any theories with regards to this?


** In canon, we don't know for certain, although it's fairly strongly implied to be meaningless. At most, it would indicate that the person no longer fears death and is at peace with it. I personally subscribe to this theory, along with the idea that the Hallows themselves are just very powerful artifacts made by the Peverells as opposed to literal gifts from Death.

In fanon, it often ends up meaning anything from "you're immortal" to "you're literally Death" to "you're literally Death's boss," often with a side order of the Hallows magically appearing whenever needed or convenient.

*** How would the Master of Death part have even become part of the legend? If the legend is true and Death gave the Hallows to the brothers, it seems unlikely that he would tell them anything about becoming a Master of Death. Unless maybe he was trying to tempt them to kill each other, but that still means it was probably a lie.

If the brothers created the Hallows themselves and made up the story, then the Master of Death part is definitely fake. Maybe they could have added some special enchantment that only works when all three are together, but it probably wouldn't be anything more than another power boost or cool ability. I suppose it's possible that it could make you immortal (since the Philosopher's Stone exists, induced immortality is cannon), but it probably wouldn't turn you into an actual avatar of Death or anything like that.

And if the Master of Death part was added to the legend later on, then it is definitely not true.

So basically, it is almost certainly a meaningless title, as you said.

** It means whatever you want it to mean. In canon, no one has ever united the Hallows, so all we have is Dumbledore's speculation (but he wouldn't know, as again - no one ever united them).

****** Perhaps it was more of a prophecy, in the sense that it predicted that the uniter of hallows will have this unique experience? The one who (kind of) gets all the deathly hallows, will also master death. In the sense that Harry was then the foremost expert (mastery in the academic sense) on dying, in the whole world.

** Could go with a fun quasi-bureacratic take on it: being Master of Death makes him responsible for training Apprentices of Death and for hiring Journeymen of Death working towards their own Mastery of Death...

** Canon never specifies what it means, but based on the rest of the characters and how they use magic I think it's a metaphor. In fanon master of death usually means the most powerful form of immortality you can imagine (never aging, immune to killing curse, regenerates any body part including head, ect.), with a new affinity for soul magic. I prefer the metaphor because honestly magic is already enough of a power fantasy. My favorite fanon version was a story where it slowly corrupted the users magic until they absorbed the hallows and then the user was stuck immortal forever (and more than a little crazy).

** Well in canon, it seems pretty much useless. The title is never utilised, and nothing happens because of it.

In fanon, it usually means something like 'you're Death's boss' or 'you're Death's contemporary', usually with the side effects of 'stopped aging at 25', 'immortal', and 'Hallows appear when needed much to Harry's chagrin because he hates them'.

** As people have said it means whatever you want it to mean. I think that unless it is intended to be used as a major plot point, it should be left ambiguous and irrelevant as in canon. It doesn't actually do anything because the Hallows are just magical devices, not gifts from death.

If you are going to make something of it, I am partial to the idea of it meaning Harry can never die. It's a bitter irony for Harry that has a lot of room for exploration. The idea that by choosing to go back and finish off Voldemort, Harry passed up on his only chance of ever moving on and being with his family, and that eventually he will lose all his loved ones and not be able to see them except through the stone.

** In my opinion, these items must accept you as their owner. Reading the Deathly Hallows, I got the impression that they were all very conscious, the Resurrection Stone showed the people you miss the most, if not aware it would at best show some random soul, the Wand needs to know who disarmed / killed her previous Master to serve him, and the Cloak -Invisibility ...

Honestly, I don't know, she hid everyone who had one, but I like to think that she wouldn't let anyone wear it without the express permission of any Potter.

So the Master of Death must be chosen by the Insignia as its rightful owner. I think the role itself would be important, but not like most would realize. No, he didn't talk to Death, he didn't oversee every death in the world.

Instead, I think he would be a pillar, admittedly unconscious, holding the entire universe together. Life and Death would have to be based on it, and as long as the Master of Death is alive, no one could take the Elder Wand, Cloak, or Stone, for they would not recognize them as their lord. However, after death, the wand and the stone would not feel loyal to anyone, and the Potters would still have their invisibility.

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.
