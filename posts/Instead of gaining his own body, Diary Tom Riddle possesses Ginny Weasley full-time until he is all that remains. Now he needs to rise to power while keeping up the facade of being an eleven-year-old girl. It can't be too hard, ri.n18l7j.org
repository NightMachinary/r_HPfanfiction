#+TITLE: Instead of gaining his own body, Diary Tom Riddle possesses Ginny Weasley full-time until he is all that remains. Now he needs to rise to power while keeping up the facade of being an eleven-year-old girl. It can't be too hard, right?

******** I was actually talking about If Wishes Were Ponies, where the Equestrians open diplomtic relations with the Muggle British government before learning the Wizarding world is even a thing. From there they start trading "special technology" and goods with the much more advanced Muggles, including passing on knowledge of Wizard magic to them. Britain is already leading the space race because of that. And then there are other plots like Starlight Glimmer combating the wizarding world's systemic racism from the inside, and they're all much more interesting than the main plot, which is just weird Harry and CMC harem stuff. It did get significantly more interesting when Sunset Shimmer brings in the Harry Potter books and movies, though.
