Do you think there are unquantifiable things in certain stories that you've read that other people just don't seem to get?


** I really appreciate stories that let their main characters make bad decisions with consequences. Not necessarily a stupid decision or a cheap, shocking one--I hate 'gritty = realism'--but something that evokes an emotional betrayal, where I can see the awfulness of their decision but also understand why it makes sense for them.

Then I know the author doesn't prioritize their protagonist being "likable."

**** GubraithianFire is great at them. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327575][Devilish Delights, Wicked Ends]], which I've been pushing to people, commits to this wholeheartedly, and is the best intrigue story I've read and one of the best ensembles. The protagonists are not the heroes.

The rest of these fics do this in more lowkey ways. I can elaborate on specific examples, but it would go into spoilery bits. This quality isn't often an overwhelming part of the fic. Seeing the willingness to paint the protagonists in a bad light just lets me know that it's not a mere good guys vs bad kind of story, where we're supposed to definitely cheer one side on or agree with everything the protagonist does.

Another fic of GubraithianFire's, on a light romance of sorts - more like a long running ambiguous relationship - [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290281][Napoleon's Complex]].

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288707][With the Devil]] by celticbard is a historical drama set in Salem.

** Intangibles are hard to quantify! That sounds flippant, but I really do have a tough time pinning down what separates a fine story from one that leaves me glowing with a sense that my fic-reading dreams have come true.

Last night I was re-reading a favorite story by a favorite author for, oh, the fourth or fifth time, and I'm /still/ blown away by the subtlety, the little quirks of characterization and implied history, the low-key but perfect word choices, the expertly handled themes, the unsentimental tangle of emotions. These are all skills that other writers have, and of course I love them too. But somehow the grace and moral temperance and ability to build up characters brushstroke by brushstroke with details that are plausible and heartbreaking and perceptive and often chilling until the viewpoint effortlessly becomes a living, breathing headcanon for me - well, just look at that sentence, look how many words I wasted trying to define something indefinable. A whole world unfolds in one relatively short fic, and it's so elegant and coherent - and I don't know how the writer does it. It's enormously satisfying to me and somehow beautiful, and no, I can't identify the magic that takes so many familiar elements (flawed characters, conflicting loyalties, backstory echoes, sexual initiation) and elevates them in a way that speaks directly to my personal taste.

Other people /do/ notice these intangibles and agree with me on the writer's brilliance, but a lot of people don't, or else they recognize the brilliance but don't quite share the same aesthetic thrill.

Part of it is that the writer and I share an interpretation, but the facets she adds to the depth of field wouldn't have occurred to me. They resonate so much and so perfectly enrich and enlarge how I perceive my favorite characters that it makes me love them all the more. It takes them beyond canon and yet keeps them in character.

Yeah, so that's a lot of words to say, "I know it when I see it but I don't know exactly what it is." I'm not even sure what I've just typed makes sense.* But there are indeed intangibles, and what speaks to one reader may fly completely past another. Or simply not matter to them.

*In fact some of it didn't, so I edited a bit. I shouldn't try being thoughtful when I'm too tired to think straight.

*** I love this comment. It makes perfect sense, despite what you may think, and I know *exactly* what you're talking about when you refer to a fic being "enormously satisfying" or having "aesthetic brilliance". There are a very few fics that do it for me, and it's so hard to quantify what does it. Your comment is probably the best comment of this thread.

**** Oh. Yeah, that looks unintentionally evasive. I was just trying to sketch out how tricky it is to identify and articulate something you know is special or that sets a fic apart.

Also, I think my taste doesn't line up very well with most users here. But here's the fic, if you'd like to take a look. It's set after Snape's first year as a teacher, so he's very young, still grieving, still thinking like a Death Eater and like a boy who was deprived of love, money, and social graces. The pairings are Snape/McGonagall and Snape/Moody, and (as the title points out) play off the idea of the Freudian family romance, because it's clear Snape has daddy /and/ mommy issues.

I left Delphi a long, infatuated comment on this fic, and we ended up discussing it. She remarked that this is a story in which Snape violates the expectations placed on all fictional characters: by the end, he hasn't changed. And that, at least in the context of the fic, is his tragedy.

** The ability to say more with less. I love it when I need to be actively paying attention to a story or else I'll miss subtle clues that add context and depth. I love it when authors get creative with their language and write vulgar, disgusting scenes without using vulgar disgusting language and I love it when an author portrays complex and terrible things with simple, clear language.

Good examples of this are most often found in [[http://www.warpoetry.co.uk/owen1.html][poetry]] but the ocassional fanfic like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8766329/4/A-Promise-From-Her-Boy][A Promise From Her Boy]] with passages like this.

#+begin_quote
  And suddenly her boy came back from the Tournament that has taken lives with a body, and he was crying in her arms, crying like he hadn't cried in years, splayed on the floor of the abandoned classroom held by the fragile and comforting arms of a witch who was more of an owl. She did not know the full story of what happened until much later, and then it was collected from fragments and whispers and overheard conversations. From his muttering on the floor, she could only gather that something was lost to him, and that he would never get it back. He lay sprawled across her lap, soaking her Muggle jeans with tears she did not know where for Cedric, and his parents, and an old man he had met only in a dream.

Passages like that, the ones that paint a picture of emotions and sensation but never become pornographic (for lack of a better word). Passages like that are the ones I live for.

*** Posting an out-of-context excerpt inevitably fails to convey the impact a passage has, when read without the prior build-up and emotional investment of the story already behind you. I'm wary of posting selections by my favorite writers, for whom I will go to the mat in defense of their talent, because I know posting in a vacuum tends to invite ridicule.

But I'll second your love of subtlety and distillation, although it's not an exclusive love for me. I also, frankly, love reading and writing vulgar scenes (I'm not sure how you define 'disgusting') using colorful, explicit language. To be blunt, I'm fond of vulgarity. (When it's done well, that is. But that applies to everything.) I relish well-written smut and emotional revelation, lush or spare. Because I'm also a fan of sumptuous language. It all depends on the fic and what it's trying to do.

But yes, nuance and restraint and suggestiveness can be absolutely sublime in the right hands.

Well, comparing poetry and prose is always dicey, because poetry (generally speaking) relies on compression and associative clusters of imagery to convey whole realms of meaning. It encapsulates. Prose isn't required to do that, and usually (but not always) involves plot, characterization, and story-specific elements such as dialogue, scene-setting, and narrative structure. Poetry is liberated from those expectations, although it has other rigors and demands.

Anyway, I disagree, although only in specific instances. There are a handful of authors - not chroniclers of war, so already the comparison diverges - who impress me just as favorably as Owen does, even though they mine incompatible genres. The rewards are different, but my astonishment at the brilliance displayed by the writer isn't.
