** I don't think I have ever read any full length stories but I know I have come across a couple of shorts/drabbles that contain this story line (most are veela draco oriented).

Well you can try one of the shorts/drabbles in little Bits of Randomness by Redbayly.

linkffn(10319919)

You can also check out one of the Odd Ideas by Rorschach's Blot (I think the story you want is one of the first few chapters in the collection of shorts/drabbles.

linkffn(2565609)

You can also try Harry Does Different by joemjackson

linkffn(12416998)

Don't forget to check out the other shorts/drabbles in the collection

  My collection of one-shots, drabbles, and ideas that could go somewhere in the future. I have been reading the same kind of collections by Roschach's Blot and Clell and figured I should do one of my own because those two are my fanfiction idols. Rated for safety, please enjoy.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10027124/1/Playmate][Playmate]] definitely comes to mind.

Not a creature fic but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16138103][you've got the antidote for me]] has Harry (unintentionally) rejecting his soul bond with Draco so it's a similar concept to a destined mate.

** 99% of these sort of stories involve (IMHO, terribly contrived) slash, but aside from Playmate, which [[/u/sailingg]] already linked, I can't think of any others.

I mean, I think the closest you can get are the stories where he has a soul-bond trope with another witch, like (and most commonly) Hermione or Ginny, that could go either way depending on how they react in each individual story, but creatures? Drawing a bit of a blank.

Which is kind-of sad, since the existential, body, and/or psychological horror of such a plot would be /immense/.

Imaging knowing that your mind and very personality are being slowly warped or changed by this /parasite/ forced on you, and knowing that soon you won't even care or may even 'love' the idea of being this bitch's mate, or husband, or plaything... and the only 'out' is death, since killing her would result in a face /worse than death for yourself./

It could even be more tragic if the bond was like this on /both/ ends, making both parties victims: to use a first thought of character, say Fleur.

This curse is slowly raping both your minds and personalities to be comfortable with, compatible with, and eventually love one another, and while it's happening all thoughts of trying to break it are slowly dulled or suppressed.

Neither has any choice in the matter: their free-wills are being irrecoverably eroded.

So, death for yourself (if the bond even /allows/ you to think of suicide or murder/suicide) or being twisted.

Christ, that'd be fucking dark.

**** Yup.

Unless he has his mind and personality magically raped (or he's given a radically different backstory in a fic to the point where he's HINO), do you really think Harry, as we know him in canon, would accept being some sort of bizarre, submissive, unequal slave or toy in such a "relationship"?

Playmate, with Gabrielle naively forcing a bond on him, is the sort-of realistic direction I'd see such an attempt heading in.

Same deal if (unfortunately, most commonly male) the other part of such a 'pairing' was Malfoy, or Snape, or even Voldemort was the 'submissive' half.
