  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** It's not complete. It still needs an epilogue.

Such an amazing story, but the shadow of being sans-epilogue haunts it for me. Out of all of the incomplete stories I have read, this one has undoubtedly affected me most, despite the fact it is, for all intents, complete.

EDIT - I now realize my previous statement was far off the mark. That title goes to either The Son of Lord Voldemort, or one of Athey's stories.

**** The parts about Durmstrang itself are fire. Everything else, not so much. Of course, the slash is a deal breaker. When I first read the fic, I didn't even realize it was slash until about a third of the way through where it just randomly happened, and noped right out. It was very random.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.
