Hermione, Ginny and Luna

Lavender and Parvati

Pansy, Daphne and Tracey. (Or just Daphne and Tracey)

Susan and Hannah.

Can be other friendships as well, not mentioned.

Can be canon friends or fanon friendships, doesn't overly matter.

Just been wanting some more focus on female friendships.

Bonus if it's Order members or Ministry workers or teachers we focus on with female friendships as well.

Can be on any site, in any era. Anyone can be the main character.

The friendship I would like to be shown more, but it can be a minor thing, as long as it's shown more than in canon (If that makes sense).

Not looking for femslash exactly, just friendship. Though I'm perfectly fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Not looking for character bashing. Characters disliking or hating each other is perfectly fine, but an author going out of the way to bash a character is usually a no go.

Not looking or want overpowered Harry, over intelligent Harry, Harem Harry or Lord Harry. Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful than in canon is fine, but would rather it be believable.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** Linkffn(Flutter) is a perfect fit. It's a slight AU where Ginny, Luna, and Hermione get closer during the PoA year. Awesome look at the reasons each of them are good friends with each other.

  The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.

  Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.
