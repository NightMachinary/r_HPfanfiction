I'm looking for any good Marauders fanfiction. I'm down for Wolfstar, I just need some good marauders fics. I've searched ao3, but sometimes I think the search doesn't help me very much. Thanks!

  It's 1975 and Muggle-born Lily Evans is certain her best friend has been recruited by the Death Eaters. She's less certain about her future in Wizarding Britain. And she has absolutely no idea how to handle the dark-haired, outrageously privileged, obnoxiously talented toerag named James Potter. A canon-compliant account of the 1st Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12540852][They're Hiding Inside Me]] by TheDivineComedian) is a good one, and [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian][TheDivineComedian]] has a lot of fantastic marauder fics. Another is linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13281801][The Age of Lies]] by TheDivineComedian)

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/84554][The Years of the Rat]] by kaydeefalls) is one that focuses on Peter and it's really interesting.

#+begin_quote
  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

  Peter had learned from an early age that magic was about intent first and foremost, and if he wanted something badly enough, he could make it happen.

  [Marauders Era Year Five] It's 1975 and Hogwarts students are trying to focus on their schooling, but with fellow students practicing dark magic and friendships being tested, it's hard to ignore that their parents' war will soon be theirs. And yet, they still try, forcing light in the darkness and daring to laugh when others want to cry. After all, they aren't dead yet.
