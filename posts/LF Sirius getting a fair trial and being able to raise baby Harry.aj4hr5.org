If there aren't that many, maybe someone would be interested in writing it?

I'd love to see how a Harry who was loved from the beginning and knew about the Wizarding World would be. That in turn would change a lot of the actual plot points that came about, I feel.

No Bashing! Please, it just seems to take away from the story, for me.

No Harry/Hermione or Hermione/Draco

Other than that I'm pretty open to how the plot will change.

That's the trick, isn't it? There are tons of Sirius raised Harry fics, but most of them end up regurgitating canon plots. So disappointing!

So far the only one I know of, that has an original plot, no Harry/Hermione pairing, Harry growing up in the magical world, and been completed, is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116), also has Sirius raising Harry, but it's a postwar adventure, and hardly anything is known about Harry's interaction with Sirius.

*** I mean, to be fair, a lot of the shit that happens is entirely out of Harry's control.

In fact, the entire franchise is about the bad guys doing something and the good guys reacting.

Sure, you can argue that they would react different, and a lot of time they do. I remember some Sirius fics where some events are skipped altogether or someone else escapes Azkaban on year 3 and causes some havoc.

**** True: But he could not do the polyjuice potion, he could not blame Draco or Severus when every single bad thing happens.

He might be more kinder and so might be sorted into Hufflepuff, might be more interested in classes so he might be sorted into Ravenclaw.

How would Sirius react to Harry being sorted into Slytherin, the house that Sirius has always despised? I'm sure he would still love Harry, but it would be a hurdle to get past.

What if he has more friends than just Ron and Hermione? What if he's friends with Luna and Neville sooner? What if he befriends Susan Bones?

If Harry was raised differently, than whose to say that the major stuff would play out like it does in canon? Especially with a Harry who is loved from the get go?

*** Yeah, you'd think him being raised by Sirius, him being loved and knowing about the Wizarding World, would change things more and diverge itself from canon.

Maybe people are too afraid of straying too far from canon, in that instance? Maybe they think of the idea, but aren't sure how to go about it? Or something?

Thanks for the recs, I'll check them out.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** linkffn(4062601) The Wise One: Book One: Becoming is this in reverse - Sirius takes baby Harry from the Dursleys and raises him. He doesn't get a trial until book two, if I recall correctly. There are three books in total.

I really like book one. It takes a look at magic in different countries and has a very mature Harry. Book two becomes a fairly standard Harry at Hogwarts story and book three rather loses it for me. But the first one stands alone and is a decent read.

** It's only a start, really, and Sirius never gave Harry to Hagrid, so no confrontation with Pettigrew and no Azkaban, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Penultimate Straw by Ravenwood240) is pretty good.

linkffn(Harry Black by notsoancientmariner) also has Sirius taking Harry from Godric's Hollow.

linkffn(Sirius' Savior by Silverfawkes) is another good story with Sirius taking Harry from Hagrid and running off with him.

linkffn(The Last of the Peverells by Arcturus Peverell) also has Sirius taking Harry from Godric's Hollow, and no confrontation with Pettigrew.

linkffn(The Son of Prongs and the Snitch and Stone) has Harry brought up by Sirius and Remus under a Fidelius because Sirius was framed.
