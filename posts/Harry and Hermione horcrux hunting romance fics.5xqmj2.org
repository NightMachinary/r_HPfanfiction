** Harry Potter and the Hallows of Death

Harry Potter and the Futures Past to a small extent. It's also incomplete unfortunately, but Harry and Hermione do help Dumbledore find the ring. They also get the locket and diadem. It's set in their fifth year however.

** Actually, I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), qualifies. Although they were not officially a couple in this story, it wouldn't take much for them to become one by the end.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/5/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spygirl][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]], linkffn(10959290), also has them hunt horcruxes together after Year 5.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

  Harry had noticed a lot of things that didn't add up around him. He did something about it. When Ron left the tent during the hunt for the horcruxes, he finally manages to get the true Hermione back. With a better plan they start the hunt anew.

** I think this is a trope waiting for a good story.

The two examples given are both awful. In one, it's the standard "we both loved each other all along" thing, and the other is "we were both potioned". Utter trash.

Tbh, the best thing I've read on this topic is a throwaway scene in Vitam Paramus where Harry tells Gabrielle about him sleeping with Hermione. It's almost irrelevant to the story but still gives a better reason for it happening than these two stories dedicated to the topic!
