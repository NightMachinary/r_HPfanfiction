*** Let's sort kids at young age into a group based on personality traits that will affect their whole lives and may not fit them while shunning individuality. It definateky makes more sense than the naruto crossovers that exist because either they are both shonen series or ninja = wizard which is bullshit. It also makes more sense than the Fma crossovers because Harry Potter = fuck equivalent exchange while fma = equivalence is literally god. You then have the whole revolution of the opresssed a fighting the system thing that hen done right in Harry Potter fics turns out awesome. Hell you can pull a veil where harry is one of the peasants on the streets or a mod!harry where he is some random orphan or you could integrate where wizards learn to magic in ways specific to their group such as amnesty leatning potions or healing while eurdire learn runes and charms that help with acedemics. You could also separate but imitate or make an extra group. Divergent is one of those series where even the mist godlike MoD!harry still has to try and can't just magic out of everything like an uchiha uses their eyes.

Tldr: magic is not overpowered. Makes sense. Is badass. La da da da da I'm the motherfucking D O double G, La da da da da I be mobbin the The D R E.
