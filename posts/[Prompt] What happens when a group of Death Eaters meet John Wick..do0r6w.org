** Well it was a dark stormy night, many Death Eaters had fled the UK to enter the US, New York to be precise. They were at a pub getting piss poor drunk when a Male came in, wearing an expensive tailored suit.

"Babyaga!" Travers yelled and a knife appeared inbetweeners his eyes. He dropped dead and as the others reached for his wand this man was as quick as lightning, he stole Lucius's wand and was taking them down one by one, no chill.

Eventually a wand was sticking out of Nott's eyes as the man sat down and ordered a drink. Shortly after his dog trailed in dodging the dead bodies like the plague.

** It's not exactly the prompt, but I played with this a while ago with Winston and Charon (and an off-screen John Wick) training George Weasley to be a master assassin. He then has a roaring rampage of revenge against the death eaters.

#+begin_quote
  After the war ends, George Weasley grows angrier and angrier as the former Death Eaters continue to kill with impunity. A chance encounter in London gives him the tools to respond in kind, and he becomes a man of focus and commitment in his pursuit of justice. Then, everything changes when a young witch buys the shop next to his.
