I am looking for a story that serves many of the usual clich√©s. Harry leaves Hogwarts. Or he does not return for his 5th year. He learns that, as so often, he was cheated by many around him.

One point is stuck. He has something against Susan Bones and some of the other female classmates. These are mad at Harry and they hex him sometimes, or berate him.

At some point Harry reacts by selling / giving them away to Malfoy. Somehow he had the opportunity.

Later it comes out that Ron lied to the classmates and told them a lot of lies. That Harry would later share them with him, etc. Nothing nice. And that's why they reacted that way. Harry does not know anything about it.
