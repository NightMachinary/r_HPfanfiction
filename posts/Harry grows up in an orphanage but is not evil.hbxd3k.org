** I don't know if this was abandoned, or if the author just didn't mark it complete. It ends at a good spot so doesn't feel unfinished (although I'd love to see it continued). The Switch by Bearbone linkffn(11769956)

  In 1981 Harry Potter was abandoned outside of a London orphanage. In 1989 a tragic accident left Seamus Finnigan orphaned in muggle London. Armed with Harry's fame and Seamus's magical knowledge, the boys come up with a harmless yet devious plan to get back at the world that left them behind.

** Perils of Innocence: linkffn(8429437)

Harry, Hermione and a few other future Hogwarts students grow up in the same institute. Harry's very much a good kid, and the description says it's "eventual Harry/Hermione" so no worries about slash-pairing.

The story was on hiatus for a while, but got an update back in April so I have hopes that it'll pick back up.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  The note pinned to his collar read 'Harry J Potter - please accept'. The Dursleys had left him with nothing else but a pillow sack with half a sleeve of McVities biscuits, a mealy apple, and ten pounds.
