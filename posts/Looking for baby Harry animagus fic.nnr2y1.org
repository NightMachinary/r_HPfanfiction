Baby Harry turns into a kitten or puppy (can't remember which one) and somehow goes to hogwarts where he pretty much grows up with mrs Norris and no one knows it's him until he doesn't turn up to be sorted and Fred & George see/show his name on the marauders map. It was only a short fic that I've read a couple times but I just can't seem to find it now
