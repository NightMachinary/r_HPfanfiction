** A Long Journey Home has ~650 reviews, which is better than it had last year but still way out of sync with its quality.

Taure's The One He Feared has a review count in the 300's, which is a little more understandable given the handicap of it being relatively short combined with unfinished.

I think the most egregious one I can name, though, is linkffn(4798208) An Interview With Justin Finch-Fletchley, which has only *57* reviews despite being in the top 1% of fanfic.

** Linkffn(What You Leave Behind), imo the best fanfic published in the last two years. One of my favorite things about it is the structure - it's kind of a cousin to OTWTG. School years go by relatively quickly, but there's still enough words dedicated to each that [[/u/Lane_Anasazi][u/Lane_Anasazi]] can flesh out the characters and plot. Each chapter has a clear theme, which is another aspect I very much enjoy. Like, each chapter dips a bit into its specific theme, but there's always the impression that the overarching story keeps moving. It's not filler, it's flavor.

** Holy shit, don't *most* fan fictions (even the good ones) have less than 1000 reviews? The only ones that get that have like 40+ chapters (whether they need them or not) or have been around for /years/.

I'd have nowhere to start with this.

Edit: You got me looking at FF.Net out of curiosity (I mostly read at AO3 now), and I'm amazed at the number of stories that /do/ have 1k+ reviews. When looking at the filter there was more than 50 /pages/ of them. I changed it to complete only and I've been looking at the word counts and chapters, though. Only one of them looked reasonable so far (but I'm only on page one - so plenty more to look at).

Seriously, I don't think I've read anything that had 1k+ reviews before without it having been posted /years/ prior to me reading it. The one I opened was written 2009 - so I'll have to see how this goes.

These are good ones with probably fairly broad appeal:

Really, really excellent characterization of both Snape and Luna (NOT romance) linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11923164/1/I-Know-Not-and-I-Cannot-Know-Yet-I-Live-and-I-Love]])

Really interesting mood to it. Quite AU. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9097983/1/Without-Thorn-the-Rose]])

Very unique, a very fun read: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9993319/1/The-Young-Adventurer-s-Club]])

Postwar. Political, but not in the lame teenage Lord everything way: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5538558/1/In-Which-the-Princess-Rescues-the-Dragon]])

Percy centric. An interesting take on the Ministry in DH. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5715586/1/Proving-Them-Wrong]])

There's bunches more, but a lot of the others in my favorites list are more shippy or otherwise more niche (unusual ships tend to have underappreciated fics)

******** When a story I'm going to abandon has reviews. Asking to continue, I explain why I won't in private messages. Maybe this author has done that too. Some authors may start something impulsively and later realize that it was a mistake (a habit I try to break myself). But yeah, it's super lousy towards the fans, I agree. Maybe you can try a pm asking the author if he/she wants to continue, although that personality probably left the site. But I know what you mean, I get frustrated from abandoned stories too , everyone

******* Depends on how long the story is. It's rare I read a story with 1k+ and it's a /good/ story. Normally is just a /long/ story. I take a few things into mind before I read them. Comments are one, but then is it just really long? Does it have really short chapters so it's on chapter 40 when it's at 50k, but then the whole story is like 300k?

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

  Harry's life up to his eleventh birthday was painful and harsh. Dumped in an abusive home by dead parents, running away from that home to take his life into his own hands and then surviving by his wits and his feet. Then a letter came, and opened a whole new world... An AU fiction with hopefully enough action and comedy to entertain.
