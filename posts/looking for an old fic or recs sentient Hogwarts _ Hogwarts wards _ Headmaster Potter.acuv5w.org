Hi everyone,

I've been reading some fic that reminded me of a scene I read years ago but have no idea what fic it involved, wherein Harry was doing either time or dimensional travel and had been the Headmaster of Hogwarts in another life, so because of that connection he could modify the wards/make Hogwarts listen to him over Dumbledore.

Would be eternally grateful if someone could find that for me again, but also would be really happy to have some recs along a similar vein where Hogwarts (or its wards) listens to Harry for some reason (he's a time traveler/heir of the Founders/powerful/Hogwarts just likes him/etc.).

thanks in advance!


** Although I wouldn't really recommend it, this fic seemed similar to what you described: Calculation

linkffn(7619993)

It's a one chapter story in which Harry is sorted as headmaster when he gets to Hogwarts.

  Young Harry liked numbers, he liked using numbers and working out the value of things. When he found out that he was a wizard and had a big pile of gold... well, he had something new to calculate. oneshot, complete, don't own.

  Harry awakens transported back in time over 500 years. Hogwarts is still being built and, amid the bustle, Harry finds the warm, nurturing parental figure missing in his life, in none other than Rowena Ravenclaw. Will Harry ever go home? Will he want to?
