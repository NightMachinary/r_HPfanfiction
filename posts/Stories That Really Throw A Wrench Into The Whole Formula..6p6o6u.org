** Because making characters completely different to what they used to be kind of defeats the purpose of using that character. Why would I want to read a story where the only similar things are names? You might as well just remove the references and make it your own original fiction.

** Well, try [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]]. The world has no magic, Hogwarts is a school for James Bond-like spies, the Weasleys are the Wellesleys, rich aristocracts. The plot roughly follows canon, but with a lot of subtle and not so subtle changes. Hermione's relationship to the other girls in her year is very different, too. Lots of new characters as well - or changed ones.

*** Hermione is actually very much into the posh aristocratic "pureblood" culture in this story. Taking classes in spy tradecraft definitely helps.

**** I'd say that she's very much the product of the still rather class-conscious society of England in that time. She can pass as a posh aristocrat, but she doesn't feel like she is part of that class. She even has a bit of a complex about it.

  She's a muggleborn who's parents are dentist in every single story that I have ever come across.

There is a metric ton of stories where she is actually a pureblood, or at least discovers that she's actually a pureblood adopted by Muggles. Usually, her character is unrecognizable and the whole thing leads to her being 'shipped with Draco, but yes, there are plenty of fics like that.

But, yes, decent fics that subvert the dominant paradigm are rare. There aren't many authors with the courage to say "F*** it, we're going off the canon rails!" in a serious fic (as opposed to crack).

*** Exactly, I've read quite a few "Hermione was really a Black/Lestrange" fics. They are all terrible.

** Twilight is set in the real world, so yeah, what most authors remix is the characters & plot, not the overall world. I've never read a twilight fic where Alice averted 9/11, for example.

In contrast, the huge draw to HP is the brand new wizarding world and the overall shape of it- blood prejudice and wandlore and witchcraft classes. That's why Hogwarts AUs without any canon characters are so popular. And a lot of the characters are archetypes specifically created to illustrate different parts of the wizarding world. The Malfoys and Blacks represent moneyed bigoted purebloods, the Weasleys nonbigoted purebloods, Hermione the muggleborn entering the world, etc. Shift those characters around and the reader loses a vital perspective on different parts of the wizarding world. For example, stories that turn Hermione into a secret pureblood lose the perspective of muggleborns entering the world. If the Weasleys become rich purebloods, how will readers see what lower-class families look like in the wizarding world without creating poor OCs to fill that need? Etc. pulling characters from one perspective to another- like Hermione being a vampire, or Harry being a hitman- causes those perspectives to vanish & reader's knowledge of the wizarding world to shrink unless the gap is filled by OC characters. Just a few thoughts.
