Say Harry gets bitten in 3rd year by Lupin and gets infected. I think it would be interesting to see how that would effect the story and maybe that could the power Voldy doesn't know.


** Sadly unfinished, but well-written and really worth looking at:

** */A Werewolf and a Veela Walk Into a Pub/* linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11279476/1/A-Werewolf-and-a-Veela-Walk-Into-a-Pub]]) Harry is bitten when trying to protect Hermione from a transformed Remus. Harry/Hermione

*/The Beast Within/* linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9527368/1/The-Beast-Within]]) In this one, Harry is bitten by Greyback on Halloween 1981 (Just after Voldemort is defeated). He is raised by Remus. There is some angst (especially once Ginny, his friend and the girl he took a liking to learned about his condition and Hermione figuring it out and trying to get proof of it by giving him pieces of silver.) but it's a good read. Harry/Ginny

There was a third one I would have recommended but I can't find the link. (Nor do I remember the name.) It was basically Harry being bitten by Remus that night in PoA and Ginny overheard him telling that fact to Dumbledore and Ginny decide to become an Animagus for him. It's a very fluffy fic from what I remember but it's a good read. I just wish I could find it...

  On October 31, 1981 two pivotal events changed Harry Potter's life forever. NOTE: Some liberties have been taken with the werewolf aspect in the HP universe. I've changed it a bit to better suit the story I want to write. And, yes, I use some werewolf cliches. The sequel Unity in Diversity has begun to be posted.

  Hermione has fought inequality her whole life but some prejudices run so deep that even defeating Voldemort is not enough to overcome them. The final battle has left Harry and Hermione facing the greatest challenge of their lives, one that tests love and friendships to the limit. This is a slow burn H/Hr story set Post Book Seven, ignoring epilogue.

** This is a post-war Werewolf Harry fic. I realized as I read the rest of your post you are looking for something else but I'll just add it here in case you change your mind!

  What happens when you're forced to become the very thing you despise? Ex-Auror Harry Potter, tossed out of the Ministry for something he had no control over, has been looking for a way back to his former life. When he comes across Draco Malfoy in the criminal underbelly of Wizarding London and in need of protection, Harry figures bringing him in to face the Ministry's justice is his ticket back to everything he's lost. But nothing is exactly as it seems. Not even Harry himself. And as he gets drawn further and further into Malfoy's world of honour and deception he finds himself questioning everything he thought he knew---about his childhood nemesis, the Ministry job he misses so much, and most of all, about himself. What happens when you're forced to see that you were wrong?

  A Harry Potter who has tried to take control of his destiny from second year on finds himself in need of a fresh start due to his marital status changing abruptly. Armed with some abilities beyond the norm, a Mastery of Defense and a muggle-style teacher's license, Harry takes his daughter Lily Luna and takes a job offer at Kuoh Academy. Pairings undecided save Harry/Rias/many?
