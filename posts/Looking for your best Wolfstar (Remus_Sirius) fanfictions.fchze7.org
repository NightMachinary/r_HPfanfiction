I found a thread from a long time ago but was hoping some wonderful people would have some recommendations for me!


** A couple of recent favourites:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22256608/chapters/53146252][Be With Me Always]] - post-OotP, Remus searches for a way to bring Sirius back from beyond the veil. Explicit, check the tags before reading. linkao3(22256608)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15809817/chapters/36799368][One to Speak, Another to Hear]] - post-DH, Remus and Sirius both survive and learn to deal with the aftermath of war. linkao3(15809817)

  Harry's words spiraled out through Remus' mind in dangerous fractals. What exactly did ‘gone' even mean? He had thought Peter was gone for a dozen years, only to find that he was alive. The entire Wizarding World had thought Voldemort gone until he had returned! Why should he assume the permanence of Sirius' death when that line was blurred, when that line was as fragile as the flutter of a Veil? Could fabric not be torn?    In which Remus Lupin must come to terms with third chances coming at a very dear price.

  The Wizarding Wars are over, but the work of recovery has only begun. Remus Lupin is trying to find his place in an ever-changing world, and when he is invited to serve on a truth and reconciliation commission, he has to confront the truth that lives there---in the past and within himself.

** Linkao3(Howl by shiftylinguini) A brilliant series. Includes smut but the characterizations are so good. Please take a look at it. My favorite Wolfstar. A bit angsty but hopeful ending. Topic: What if Sirius was spat out by the veil?

  “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.
