Okay I'm looking for any fics which feature anyone (although I prefer Harry or Hermione) receiving future knowledge. I vaguely remember one where Harry sends a projection of his older self and trains his younger self and Hermione. And like Kick in the arse of the Wizarding World by Alrissa linkffn ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5724097/1/]]) where Hermione receives a book. I know there's a few out there... Hopefully

You should be able to find plenty if you simply search time travel on the sub, it's a common request.

  Headmaster Harry Potter has spent his whole life trying to make things better. At the end of his life, he is finally ready. He goes back in time and gives his 11 year old self a very special book.
