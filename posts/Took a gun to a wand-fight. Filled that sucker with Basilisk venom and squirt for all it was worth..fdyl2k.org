A total Rando sneaks up on Voldy and Harry with a water gun. Harry Potter might have vanquished the Horcruxes, but Random Muggleborn is the one who makes Ol' Mouldy Warts squeal like Elphaba's helium-addicted twin.

***** Who said it was silver? It could be goblin steel for all we know and for all we know that may not soak basilisk venom but be able to keep it

*** Didn't Gryffindor's sword absorb the venom because it was goblin silver or was it due to the enchantments on it?

****** Hmm dunno. I was thinking the bullets have goblin venom soaked separately from the mainframe. That way the gun itself won't be absorbing the venom because the venom was already in the bullet
