This is the weirdest title I have typed in my time on Reddit. It's part Shower Thought, part HP Fanfiction, part Aphantasia.

Now I'm sure most of you who don't know what Aphantasia exactly is are wondering what does this have to do with Legilimency. We'll get to that.

First, let's discuss what Legilimency is in canon and fanon.

[[https://youtu.be/BWET244zbu0]]

In the movie scene, it appears that Alan Rickman ever so perfectly says "Legilimens" and voila, he can view and experience memories of one Harry Potter. He can SEE( foreshadowing) what our Emerald-Eyed protagonist saw.

According to the HP wiki, Legilimency is the act of magically navigating through the many layers of a person's mind and correctly interpreting one's findings. A person who practises this art is known as a Legilimens. Muggles might call this "mind-reading," but practitioners disdain the term as naive. 

Almost everybody on this subreddit already knows this I'm sure.

Now, I want you to do something a bit weird.

Close your eyes and imagine a beach.

Done?

What'd you see? Golden sand, beach balls, azure blue water, palm trees, females in bikinis, something like that?

Thing is, I can't do that. Because (drumroll please) I, and a many other people across the world, have a thing called Aphantasia.

Now you can watch this video to have a pretty good understanding of what Aphantasia really is ( [[https://youtu.be/ewsGmhAjjjI]] )but to summarize it extremely succinctly, Wikipedia says

Aphantasia is the suggested name for a condition where one does not possess a functioning mind's eye and cannot voluntarily visualize imagery.

It's barely been researched at all and the first proper study by the University of Exeter happened very recently in 2005.

Now some of you may see where I am going. I can't see stuff in my mind. It's all black.

So suppose Queenie Goldstein comes upto me and with innocent intentions decided to Legilimens me. She's expecting a memory or a visual thought as is the case for most if not all people she's tried it on. She sees black. She might have audio but no video.

That's why I'm a Natural Occlumens. You Know Who can't see my thoughts because, well, I can't see my thoughts. If he decides to send me a false vision of the Hall of Prophecies, I'd actually be kinda thankful and hope he sends something cooler next time. Because that image of the Hall of Prophecies would be the first image I would have ever seen in my mind's eye. Ever.

To fellow Aphantasia suffering people, we kinda have a leg up on this Occlumens thing I feel. To people who might have just realized that other people can actually see images in their head and that is normal rather than what they experience in their heads, its not all bad at all.

You're an Occlumens, fellow Fanfic reader.


** Legilimency is not limited to seeing images (and indeed, I would hesitate to say that is its primary use). For example, in the Harry vs Snape duel at the end of HBP, Snape states that he knows via legilimency what incantation Harry is going to use before he uses it.

Not only is an incantation not an image, it would also be extremely distracting to Snape if he was seeing a load of images from Harry's mind while simultaneously duelling.

Another example is that Voldemort always knows when someone is lying via legilimency.

*** My answer is kinda weird I guess. How do you think? A visual thinker who hypothetically has Aphantasia is pretty immune I imagine. But I feel that argument can be countered easily by someone smarter than me.

If I concede that thoughts of a person at that particular moment are accessible to Legilimancers(?), then how about memories. A Legilimens surely can't access the memories of a person with Aphantasia.

If Snape had Aphantasia then Harry surely wouldn't have been able to see the whole bullying incident.

Actually, on further thinking a Pensieve is entirely useless for someone with Aphantasia.

Sidenote, I'm a big fan.

**** While I'm by no means an expert in aphantasia, I think you need to be careful in distinguishing memories from visualisation.

As I understand it, you still see things and remember what you have seen. It's just that you can't visualise the memory. For example, I can ask you what colour the sky was yesterday and you would be able to respond "blue" or "grey". You wouldn't be able to see the colour in your "mind's eye" but you would know the colour as a fact. So the visual information is still part of your episodic memory. The problem is not in the storage of information but rather in the representation of it. But with legilimency and pensieves, the subject's mind is not doing the representation work. The legilimens/pensieve are going directly to the memory and reading that using their own representation apparatus.

Indeed, pensieves contain information which isn't in your memory anyway so I think they would definitely work. And I suspect legilimency would still be able to access visual information, even though the subject themselves couldn't visualise it. So long as the /legilimens/ doesn't have aphantasia, they should still be able to see it using their own mind's eye.

In any event, like I say, there's far more in a person's head than images. There's your semantic memory (knowledge of facts etc.) as well as non-visual episodic memory (memories of sounds, smells, etc. as well as factual "summary" recollections of information which was originally visual). All that is still open to a legilimens even if they can't access visual info.

***** I totally get your argument. My only point of disagreement is whether the Legilimens/Pensieve would be able to access a memory in a form which isn't available to the subject himself.

From personal experience, I can describe my memories but I can't see them. I personally don't think that a Legilimens or Pensieve would be able to convert a memory into a format which it doesn't exist in for the subject with Aphantasia but that's depends on your interpretation I feel.

****** I think the pensieve issue is more clear cut. In OotP, Harry wanders a considerable distance away from Snape to observe the Marauders' conversation, which Snape was not privy to and could not possibly have overheard. The magic of the pensieve is such that you can explore a memory beyond the limits of what the subject originally perceived: it shows you what actually happened in a place and time, not simply the perception of an individual whose memory you are in.

As for legilimency, I think the subject witnessing the memories being viewed is just a common side-effect of the process, not the mechanism of how legilimency works. To see why this must be the case, consider Voldemort's ability to detect lies via legilimency. Snape explains this ability in OotP:

#+begin_quote
  The Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to him. Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie, and so can utter falsehoods in his presence without detection.
#+end_quote

So memories are still being read by Voldemort when he detects a lie. And yet when Voldemort uses this ability on Harry in OotP, Harry has no inner "film reel" of memories:

#+begin_quote
  Tall, thin and black-hooded, his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt, his scarlet, slit-pupilled eyes staring... Lord Voldemort had appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand pointing at Harry who stood frozen, quite unable to move.

  “So, you smashed my prophecy?” said Voldemort softly, staring at Harry with those pitiless red eyes. “No, Bella, he is not lying... I see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind... months of preparation, months of effort... and my Death Eaters have let Harry Potter thwart me again”
#+end_quote

Voldemort is reading Harry's memories but Harry is not viewing them at the same time. This shows that legilimency does not depend on the victim visualising the memories being watched. The fact that this happened in Snape's classes is perhaps a result of Snape trying to teach Harry so making his attempts obvious.

******* Right for the Pensieve, you say that

The magic of the pensieve is such that you can explore a memory beyond the limits of what the subject originally perceived: it shows you what actually happened in a place and time, not simply the perception of an individual whose memory you are in.

1) If it shows you what actually happened in a place or time, then what is the need for the memory extracted from someone's mind in the first place. Surely I couldn't take the memory of someone in Australia on 9/11 and then somehow reach the World Trade Center to experience what is happening there.

The Pensieve must have some limits( time and/or space) and those limits have to revolve around the victim whose memories are used.

2) Suppose a Pensieve allows you to perceive a 1000% of what the subject perceived his memory as. If he had Aphantasia and his perception was 0, then obviously the Pensieve would be unable to perceive anything.

As for the Legilimancer, I feel like a Legilimancer of enough quality would be able to read the mind of Harry without him being aware given he is useless at it. So I don't get that argument completely. The fact that Harry doesn't have an inner film reel doesn't mean that Voldemort doesn't see it.

****** I feel like there's a contradiction in your argument with this post, specifically this part:

#+begin_quote
  My only disagreement is whether the Legilimens/Pensieve would be able to access a memory in a form which isn't available to the subject himself.
#+end_quote

I think that even if we accept this frase 100% then it doesn't matter because there is a lot more in your mind than just images (which if I'm understanding aphantasia correctly are the only thing you can't... mentalize? Imagine? I can't think of the correct word hahahaha) like Taure mentions above, but you don't address that point (unless that's what you meant by "I totally get your argument"), so I don't think you could reasonably state that having aphantasia makes you a natural occlumens/immune to legilimency.

​

The only situation I could think of it being... hmmm useful to the plot I guess is if the character was in a room with someone they didn't know, a legilimens wouldn't be able to identify this person based on what they know since they would only have the facts in your head (I imagine that by searching for a specific memory they would instead get the hard facts about the situation that you mentioned below).

​

P.S. While I was typing this I also thought of several questions that I can't find an answer I trust due to their being very little research on this, do you mind if I pm them to you? They're mostly about the scope of what you can and can't imagine/remember.

******* Right so what I was trying to say (badly) was that a Legilimancer would not be able to access a memory in image form if the person with Aphantasia didn't have the memory in visual form in the first place.

So, as I've personally realized, the restriction on Legilimency is purely visual in nature for a person with Aphantasia. Ofc, as I've stated I get my memories in the form of hard facts.

However that's not the only form of memory retention for Aphantasia apparently. I was talking with another person on this thread who realized he might have Aphantasia after reading this and he said that his memory was emotional in nature i.e. when he remembers an embarrassing memory he remembers the feeling of embarrassment rather than the actual memory along with it.

Yeah sure go ahead and PM me no problem.

** I do not have aphantasia, but that doesn't mean I visualise all my memories. I feel like it would be pretty weird if I would have to do that, it'd take a lot of time to always have a picture to be able to remember a random fact.

In fact most times I just "hear" a voice in my head that just "tells" me what I want to remember. I use quotes because it isn't because I'm crazy, just the same as visualising, but hearing it instead.

My -theory-, would therefore be that all manners of memories can be understood by a legilimens, but you have to do it in the medium the recipient of your spell. That's why he would be able to "read" the mind in a duel, he hears the name of spell before it is cast.

If so, you would probably be somewhat protected from legilimency.

Wait, when other people imagine things they can *literally* see them when they close their eyes?! Could I have Aphantasia? I had no idea this is even a thing. I've always had trouble visualizing faces as well... when I don't have them in front of me.

This is so weird... I'm freaking out right now. Maybe I can see some kind of abstraction, so I might be on a 1 or 2 on that scale. I always thought "close your eyes and imagine X in your mind's eye" was just a newagey way to say "it's easier to concentrate on the thing you are thinking about this way". It isn't supposed to be mostly black?

Edit: Also when imagining the characters or locations of a book I don't have any concrete visualizations. Is that part of it? I can only tell you after watching a movie adaption whether the depiction fits or is wrong to how I would have imagined it. Before that characters are not really... well defined... besides through the words.

No, not literally in the sense of "indistinguishable from vision". It's still in your head -- people don't see a mental image with their eyes.

Right. But I wouldn't compare thinking about the taste or imagining the taste of something to tasting. Maybe I'm completely messed up though? I'm not tasting anything when I do that...

But from what I gather there's supposed to be actual imagery when imagining something visual. So, when I think about / imagine a footballer tackling another guy, I don't think there's a functional difference for me whether I do that with open eyes or closed. But I get the impression that for most other people there's supposed to be a little movie playing out in their head? Do you just pick the color of their outfits at random and stuff.. or is your brain just doing that for you? Like in a dream? This is fascinating...

PS: Am I supposed to have a mind's ear too?! I listen to a *lot* of music, but I only ever hear music when I'm listening to it or when singing/whistling. This shit is so confusing.

***** *TL/DR: I think you don't have aphantasia because you didn't instantly recognize that this is the way your brain works. Also there's a third level of reading you might not know about.*

I think the easiest way for you to see if this is you actually having aphantasia (which keep in mind we know super little about) is to compare it to something else that might be easier to grasp.

​

So there's this thing called sub-vocalization, which has to do with reading. Theoretically you learn to read first by reading out loud, then you learn how to keep your mouth shut and "say" the words in your head via your stream of consciousness. There's a "third level" which some people never get to, when you reach this level you just look at a word and your brain understands what the word is, without having to "say it" inside you're head.

Someone did an experiment and the people who never reach the third level are still moving their vocal chords, even though they're not talking and you can't really hear anything, they're still vocalizing the words they read but you can't hear it so, sub-vocalization.

Now the thing that's *relevant to this conversation* is that in my experience when you ask someone if they're a subvocalizer (mostly by asking do you always have a voice in your head when you read) they either instantly say "Yes, how do you read without the little voice", or they waffle a bit and get lost in the metaness of the question "Do I do that? I'm not sure".

​

So it might be helpful to think of aphantasia the same way. The other people I've seen commenting here and on other places about the same topic seem to be either "Today I learned", ""Wait do I have this? Like I don't see things when I close my eyes." or instant belief "Wow I didn't even know I had this". Just like with sub-vocalizing I would guess that the only people who actually have it are the people who instantly realize that they've had it all their lives, since it's an experience that you can't prove/quantify (at least in a regular setting in regards to sub-vocalizing, and maybe aphantasia in the future), but you would instantly recognize a description of how your brain works.

** Nice try.

Legilimency is the art of reading thoughts and memories, not mental pictures. Unless you're retarded and can't think, you'd be susceptible to legilimency.

It's described as images because Harry associates his memories as images and flashing scenes - if he had this condition Aphantasia that you spoke of, he'd associate thoughts and memories with something else and Snape would get the information regardless.

Quick personal question though, what do you associate your memories with? Say the memory of your first paycheck or graduation? What goes through you when you think of that moment?

*** I'll answer the personal question first I guess.

I know facts about what happened on the day I graduated. I know that I was wearing an ugly af cap. I just can't see it. I can describe it. Just can't remember it.

So for the Legilimency, how else do other people see memories besides as images. If I mention the TARDIS to you, I'm pretty sure from what I've observed that the first thing in your head will be the photo of the blue police box as you remember it from the show.

As far as I interpreted Legilimency you read thoughts and memories by looking at the images. If there are no images how do you read them?

**** You've answered your own query there. You, someone who has this condition, associate memories and thoughts with hard facts.

A legilimens breaking into your mind gets those hard facts from your mind. Whether his mind processes the information just like that, as hard fact, or gives them some preconceived images based on his imagination is up for grabs.

***** I get where you're coming from. I guess I see it more like a different medium which the other wouldn't be able to understand as he simply doesn't use it.

Take language as an analogy. If Padma Patil thinks in Hindi then wouldn't You Know Who, who knows just English as a way of thinking, have a pretty huge problem in reading her mind simply because he does not understand the medium in which her thoughts are expressed.

****** Languages are a mere medium. We may fool ourselves into thinking that we think in the language, but those are just a fraction of our conscious thoughts - an actual spontaneous thought won't be in any language. Besides, Voldemort is an exceptional legilimens - if he were to actually use focussed legilimency on someone who knows Hindi, he'd learn the language along the way.

**** We see people use Legilimency to read current non-visual thoughts, such as lies or incantations. Therefore, lack of visual memory would not make you immune to Legilimency.

Also, how do you know visual memories aren't stored in your head, and that you're simply unable to access them? You don't have to be actively thinking of something for a Legilimens to see it, after all.

***** I agree with your first point on this. I have aphantasia and I've got a running dialogue in my head which Snape or Voldemort would have no problem listening to. They might even enjoy it because there wouldn't be a visual component included to distract them. Just because there are no pictures in my brain doesn't mean that there isn't anything going on up there for them to pick up on.

For the second part, I feel like you would be a good researcher! Memory for aphantasia isn't understood very well, in fact, only within the last 15 years or so has there been any research on the matter. I don't think we know if aphants are able to encode a visual component for a memory or if we just can't access it. For instance, I know my dad has brown eyes, crooked teeth, and tan skin, but I can't bring a picture up in my mind. Do I have a picture floating around in my noggin? Perhaps! Or perhaps I don't. I'd love to see more research done on the matter. I think it would be quite interesting!

**** I am not an expert, per se, but I did study memory and similar conditions extensively. The best way I know how to explain something is with a metaphor or story. What I say below is not meant to judge or cast opinion.

​

Metaphor time:

You and your friend both have the same TV, the same console on which you play movies, all the way down to the same batteries for the remote. You both go to the same store where he purchases the movie and agrees to watch it and give it to you to watch the next day, after which, you will meet up to discuss it. When you do, your friend is describing the scenes and recalling how impressive the visuals were and asking if you remember that one part where the hero does something amazing. You can, and you can't. Your memory of the movie is more focused on the associated information (facts, figures, etc.). How can this be? You both have the exact same setup at home to watch the movie. You both watched the same movie. You both used the same exact disc. Why the disconnect?

The one difference is in the setting of your TV. His is factory default. Your's is set to "Aphantasia" mode. See where I'm going with this?

​

On memory:

Memory is just chemicals. Seriously, look it up. Whatever someone remembers is legitimately a chemical reaction to spur the pictures, words, and information of said memory. How it is interpreted is dependent on the user. And yes, stronger memories are tied to strong feelings of emotion. This is because emotions are also chemical reactions in the brain. Not everyone has strong feelings of emotion in the same way. I may feel an enormous amount of joy with my first pay check, where someone else may feel that the receipt of their first paycheck is perfunctory (boring). This influences the strength of memories strictly on emotion. Long term memory is also different than short term memory, but I have not read enough lately to speak intelligently to that, so I will leave it alone.

​

Let's take my example of TVs before and call You Person A, and your friend Person B. If instead of a movie, we instead substitute a chemical memory, the way that person A remembers it differs from Person B. Where person B can easily recall and visualize in their mind's eye, whereas person A is able to recall the facts and information without the visualization.

​

Knowing this and tying it all together with the assumption that Harry had Aphantasia, I would say that Snape would still be able to use Legilimency on Harry effectively. Ultimately, Snape is extracting the chemical memory from Harry and viewing it on his own unaffected hardware. It would be like in the TV metaphor above. Snape is merely taking the disc (raw data) from Harry and playing it on his own TV (Mind's Eye). He would, in fact, be viewing the memories for the first time since their creation in this format. This would make Harry more prone to being at risk to Legilimency used on him since he wouldn't think that his memories could be viewed since he couldn't view them (hubris).

** I watched the video you linked to the aphantasia, I'm like 1-2 on her scale and I always skipped that part of the instructions that said "close your eyes and imagine...", to know that it's a legit condition... To be honest I don't know what to do with this knowledge, but now I finally understand that this is the thing that people can do

I hate naive generalizations like that. Snape disdains the term as naive.

Lots of literary analysis of HP in the wikis or elsewhere in the fandom is on a really stupid level like this: A character says/claims something... fandom: "IT MUST BE GENERALLY TRUE THEN AND APPLY TO EVERYONE AND EVERYWHERE"
