It's been awhile since I've indulged in Drarry (Draco/Harry). I prefer novel length, not too smutty, in the Hogwarts school year, Drarry fics - any recommendations? ETA: WITH Slash

  It seems 95% of H/D writers feel compelled to write a “Harry And Draco Are Forced To Be Together By Something Beyond Their Control And Then Unlikely Stuff Happens That Leads To Twoo Wuv” story.

  /This is the only forced magical bond fic I've ever read so I don't know how it holds up against many others, but I enjoyed it./

*** I know there's lots but I've already racked most of the fanfiction sites I know of and read pretty much all the ones I like - I've been reading/writing Drarry for a decade now and I don't know if maybe there's a site I don't know of, or something new I've overlooked.
