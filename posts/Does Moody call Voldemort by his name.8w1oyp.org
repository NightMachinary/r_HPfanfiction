I know that Harry, Sirius, Remus and Dumbledore call Voldemort by his name and some others did too later, like Hermione. But my question is did Alastor Moody call Voldemort by his name or did he never speak his name like the other wizards?


** I'm struggling to find multiple examples, but in the one example I could find, he doesn't.

From Deathly Hallows, Chapter 4: The Seven Potters

#+begin_quote
  ‘All right, all right, we'll have time for a cosy catch-up later!' roared Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen. Moody dropped the sacks at his feet and turned to Harry. ‘As Dedalus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He's made it an imprisonable offence to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here or Apparate in or out. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you. Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother's charm does that already. What he's really done is to stop you getting out of here safely. ... So this time, when you leave, there'll be no going back, and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range. We're choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen.'

EDIT: In this chapter, Moody also delivers the semi-famous line, 'Our only chance is to use decoys. Even You-Know-Who can't split himself into seven.'

EDIT2: OK, I just found an example in Half-Blood Prince where Moody calls him 'Voldemort'. When Moody is showing Harry the photograph of the original Order, he says, 'That's Dorcas Meadows, Voldemort killed her personally.' So JKR may have had Moody saying 'You-Know-Who' in Deathly Hallows so that there wasn't a plot-hole, i.e. 'If the name was jinxed, why didn't Death Eaters immediately appear when Mad-Eye used the name?'

*** This helps a lot. But I also think, now that Dumbledore is gone and Voldemort is out in the open, Moody might become more paranoid that Voldemort could have enforced the Taboo. Is there any evidence of him referring to Voldemort before DH?

EDIT: Well, I found this in OotP.

  “That's Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth, only time I ever met him, strange bloke . . . That's Dorcas Meadowes, Voldemort killed her personally . . . Sirius, when he still had short hair . . . and . . . there you go, thought that would interest you!”

**** Ha, we literally found the OotP reference at the same time (see my edit2)! Except I incorrectly said it was in HBP, whoops. I came to pretty much the same conclusion as you, though it was more from the plot logistics standpoint than a character-mindset standpoint.

***** Haha! True. Thanks for this! I already wrote my chapters where Mad-Eye says just Voldemort, because that's what I say. Now, I don't have to change it back :)

** If I recall correctly, he actually said "Voldy".

My theory is that he doesn't want to give in to the cowardice of avoiding the name, but his paranoia and knowledge of dark magic meant he never quite ruled out a Taboo Curse even before Voldemort himself put it in place, so he chose "Voldy" as an alternative that still showed his courage /while/ avoiding any ill effects.

*** That's a very interesting theory. But seeing as my story features Mad-Eye prominently speaking to Order members, I can't really expect him to keep saying 'Voldy' again and again as it becomes quite laughable and does not lend seriousness to what he says. Somehow, I vaguely remember he refers to him as 'Dark Lord'. Not the impersonator Crouch Jr., but the real Moody. Or should I just let him call him "Voldemort"?

**** If he were to know it I think he would call him Tom. But if he's talking to him he will clearly use "bastard" X) But I seem to also remember him using "Dark Lord".

*** I think this might be a headcanon of yours (albeit a delightful one). Not to be, well, /Hermione-ish/, but I did a search for 'Voldy' in my Kindle versions of the books, and the only one who called him Voldy was Peeves.

**** Ah, okay. Funny. But as I said I could be wrong --- been a while since I read the last few books. Could you perhaps search for "Vold/ie/", though?

***** Nothing for 'Vodie' either, but it's possible the search just isn't picking it up.
