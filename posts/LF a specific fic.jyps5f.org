A few years back I came across a fic that really got me into HP fics, and since then, I've not been able to find it.

I believe it was called "Rise of the Dark Lords", but I may be wrong. Harry and Hermione were twins to Bellatrix and Voldemort, and the Azkaban breakout happened during year 4.

Any viable links, I do believe it was an unfinished fic.
