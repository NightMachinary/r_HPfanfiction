** You mean something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=3&r=10]] (ordered by reviews)? It is very clear demonstration that popularity doesn't mean quality, in my opinion.

*** I remember #3 (linkffn(5554780)) being pretty good.

There are others I recognise as having read but don't remember exactly how good they were; to shape and change, make a wish, put your galleons where your mouth is, delenda est, blindness, wind shear, stepping back, 0800 rent a hero, and allure immune Harry.

Huh. There's way more Harry/Bellatrix than I thought there'd be.

#+end_quote

We have... very different definitions of the word good. The story /completely/ eviscerates Dumbledore's character and is... not badly written /per se/, but the writing is rather pedestrian.

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin (linkffn(11191235)), on the other hand, is very good.

***** While I agree that this fic is one of the best (or least worst?) of the list, I'm not sure I would go as far as calling it "very good". There is a big pacing problem (1M words, year 3), and from what I remember is also fall in the "kid master politicians" trope.

But it's still a readable fic, even an enjoyable one, something I can't say for most of the list.

I realize that may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I actually enjoy the pacing. The fic goes into much greater detail and weaves many complex plotlines together (quite a few argue /too/ many different plotlines), and I really enjoy complexity. That's down to personal preference, however.

#+end_quote

A fair argument, and I /do/ find those portions to drag on. At the same time, it seems mostly centered around Harry's machinations and there is an implied reason for Harry's hypercompetence in that area.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
