OK so I was looking through the subreddit's past discussions to entertain myself, and a lot of arguments I encounter against basically Sirius's character, is him not being able to reconcile with Regulus before he died, or not rescuing him from home or something along these lines. Is there any reason behind that? I haven't read the books in a while so maybe I don't remember but maybe I vaguely recall a part where Regulus approached Sirius and he shut him out/shoved him? Maybe that's why. Can somebody confirm. If it didn't happen, why is the blame always put on Sirius and not Regulus, unless I missed something important in the books.


** Why would have Sirius wanted to save Regulus when Regulus didn't want to be saved? I mean Regulus was a proper Black and Sirius was the rebellious brother. Besides Regulus and Sirius had vastly different views of the world and were on opposing sides of the war. Until DH no one other than Kreacher knew that he had turned against Voldemort.

This /never/ happened in the books or movies at all. Sirius only mentions to Harry that Regulus joined the Death Eaters, got in too deep and was killed because he tried to back out. That's all he knew about it. Sirius ran away from home when he was sixteen.

According to Kreacher, Regulus joined the Death Eaters when he was sixteen (and still at Hogwarts!) and was /proud and happy to serve/ Voldemort and help him bring wizards out of hiding to rule over the muggles and muggleborns.

We don't know exactly what caused him to turn against Voldemort, maybe because he learned that Voldemort created a horcrux or that he meant to kill Kreacher, and neither do we know if he ever disavowed pureblood supremacy.

A lot of people have a bad boy/girl fetish great enough that they think that bigoted terrorists and murderers like Voldemort, the Malfoys, Snape, and Regulus Black would be redeemed if everyone else bends over backwards for them. And that it's entirely the fault of Harry/Sirius/James/Lily/(insert any other good character) that they were "forced" to be evil.

*** Voldemort is not like the other three. Snape and Regulus aren't like the Malfoy's, and Snape isn't like Regulus. Of those four, while the only good person is Snape, there is still a difference between Regulus and the Malfoy's, and between the Malfoy's and Voldemort. A huge difference. Grouping them together is completely asinine.

**** Ah, a Snape apologist.

Anyway, let's look at all 5 characters.

Voldemort: Hateful man intent on ruling over Wizarding Britain and killing Harry. Loves to kill people.

Regulus: A teenage racist who, for whatever reason, defied Voldemort at the cost of his life.

Draco: Teenage racist bigmouth who couldn't directly kill someone but had multiple plans that almost killed people

Lucius: Racist who could be discreet about it, but is fine killing a preteen

Snape: Dude who joined a racist hate group that routinely killed people, but left when his obsession was targeted. Then spent 6 years of the obsession's kid's life tormenting him, and just being a spiteful bastard. However, he does protect the kid from fatalities, does the dangerous job of spying on racist hate group, and then shields (to whatever degree) the children of Hogwarts from the worst of not!Nazi hate group's government.

Fairly easy to group them together. Just because Snape had good actions doesn't mean that he was a good person. He was very obviously not a good person.

******** If you can't see how the Death Eaters <1 year of power is a speed up version of how the Nazi's worked, I honestly don't know what to tell you. It took literal years for the Nazis to have concentration camps, and to start killing their hated groups. Death Eaters set that up in less then 9 months. But you are right, they didn't have all the evils of the Nazis, but that's only because they were stopped. If the Nazis had been stopped at 1 year, we wouldn't be comparing hate groups to Nazis in the first place....

All we see is him try and destroy a horcrux which according to all wizards is an absolutely foul creation.

For all we actually know, he could have been one of voldemort most bigoted followers. Which would make sense given who his family were. He could have willingly taken up the mantle and been a bigger blood purists than anyone.

The only good thing we see him do is try and destroy a horcrux, which in my mind had nothing to do with the genocide that the death eaters tried to implement.

I'm not sure about that. The note he leaves says something like he's destroying the proper Horcrux "in the hope that when you [Voldemort] meet your match you will be /mortal once more./" That very much sounds like he wants Voldemort to be defeated and killed.

Of course, deciding that a crazed half-blood who's messing with soul magic isn't the one to follow and is probably best off destroyed doesn't necessarily indicate that Regulus became anything other than a blood purist, just a blood purist that realised he had followed the wrong lunatic. It could even have been the realisation that, by messing with such stuff, Voldemort doesn't actually respect wizarding tradition and wizarding culture. Like Sirius says in (I think) Phoenix- the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. Not every person who looks down on Muggle Borns is a death eater. Very much like in the real world- not all racists are in the EDL or the Klan. Plenty of people are quietly bigoted without going out and committing crimes about it, and that's probably the category Regulus would have fallen into- there's a line, but everything up to that line is still fine by him.

That's not to mention, he made it so much more difficult for the locket to be found and destroyed. It's not clear if he knew how to destroy a horcrux but he certainly didn't tell Kreacher; and neither did he ask the elf to approach Dumbledore for help.

Regulus could have not foreseen that twenty years from now Dumbledore or Harry would be searching for Horcruxes. And in any case, Dumbledore, even though he may appear as such sometimes, is not a Deus Ex Machina who can sort all the world's problems. He is very smart and powerful but still subject to the limitations of humans. I doubt his reputation was very good with the Blacks.

** It's very much a fanon thing, but I think it just stems from the nature of the information we have about Regulus.

Regulus is set up to be a tragic figure -- someone who found out what Voldemort was doing and died to stop it. A Death Eater who changed his mind without any former crushes being involved is compelling. We know Sirius was antagonistic as a teen (see all Marauders related incidents). We know Walburga was an absolute piece of work. We know he still cared about Kreacher, and this series very much leans into the "how you treat your houseself reflects you as a person" (which is used to make it seem like Sirius low key deserved to die). In the spectrum of all Black drama, which goes from Bellatrix being evil to Andromeda being defiant against prejudice, Regulus is the middle, the morally grey person that we don't know all that much about prior to his best moment.

And then fancast him as Timothee Chalamet and you've created a fandom. It's like the Daphne thing, but there's a better foundation to go wild with the worldbuilding.

Also, some people just love to hate Sirius. There are so many fics that are like, well, Sirius left Harry to suffer for 12 years so he deserved his time in Azkaban. Uh? A 21 y/o saw his dead friends, realized his other friend was the cause, and made a poor decision to give a baby to a trusted ally. People have done a ton more for a lot less.

They make up stuff about him, or run with the worst possible interpretation of all of his actions, even the good ones (like he was nice to Ron and Hermione only because he liked Harry), to make him seem as bad as is possible with what we have. Or explain away some of his demonstrable intelligence with 'just luck' . Especially for some Snape fans, Sirius isn't allowed to exist in a morally grey medium.

  Harry's 5th year was probably the worst year of his life. First Voldemort happened, then Umbridge, then Voldemort AGAIN, and then Sirius died. Harry doesn't even have the time to properly mourn Sirius before he's shipped back to the Dursley's for the summer. He can't even think straight and with each passing day since losing Sirius, Harry feels more and more exhausted. By the time his 16th birthday rolls around, Uncle Vernon has to literally beat Harry just to wake him up. After a rather brutal beating given to him by his uncle on the eve of his birthday, Harry wakes to find something he had never thought possible. He wakes up to find a long snake tail instead of his legs. A few days later, his family abandons him in some random forest. What a wonderful way to start his 16th year of life after the worst year of his life.* Do not post to another site * Do not translate without permission *

Personally, I always found this argument really unfair. Sirius hated Kreacher, but this had nothing to do with the fact that he was an House Elf. He hated him because he was a part of everything he hated in his childhood, a bigoted monster paroting the same old prejudice and praising the "Pure blood" while living in trashes.

Considering the circumstances, I even think that Sirius treated Kreacher quite well. Despite his clear hatred, he never killed him or ordered him to punish himself.

I mean, it's Sirius' own argument. If a person has that much power over someone else, it is their duty to not abuse it and treat their lesser like trash. Just because it may have had nothing to do with Kreacher being a House Elf (which I doubt, since I can't imagine Sirius treating a human slave like that) doesn't mean that it's not morally disgusting and reflects extremely poorly on Sirius' character.

I'm actually surprised. You hold him to such low standards that a good number of real life slave-owners would also be considered to be treating their slaves "quite well". Maybe it's just me, but murder and torture are not my limits to what counts as treating someone quite well.

***** Obviously hes gonna hate Kreacher. Kreacher is a symbol of his abuse as a child. Abuse he probably had to relive from dementors during his 13 years in azkaban. Its not like Kreacher is pleading with him to be nice to him, begging him to stop. Kreacher's insulting him back. And Sirius never orders Kreacher to hurt himself or anything like that. He's just insulting a fully grown house elf and the house elf is insulting him back. Is he just supposed to not do anything when Kreacher insults all of his friends and calls them mudbloods and half-breeds and bigoted shit like that? Obviously he shouldn't be insulting him in the first place, but I can give him a pass, because if Kreacher existed in real life, I would probably hate him as well, and considering what Kreacher did to Sirius before(albeit on the orders of his mother), I would definetely not be polite or nice to Kreacher at all.

** In canon, I get the impression that Sirius cared about Regulus (my idiot brother, as any older sibling would attest, is frequently a term of endearment), but the two couldn't reconcile for whatever reason.

In the story I'm working on, Sirius was too broken to help Regulus when they lived together, and Regulus was too proud/"independent" to reach out to Sirius for help, and they both loved each other but thought they had more time. I don't think Sirius thought Regulus would die so young.

The fact that Regulus was happily following a terrorist in his quest for genocide may have played a small role in that.

Seriously, in Canon Regulus change of mind happened litteraly minutes (hours at best) before his death, it's not like he had the time to reconcile with anyone. And we don't even know if he truly had a "change of heart". For all we know Regulus may still have been completely ok with purging the mudbloods, and just draw the line at Horcruxe and/or murdering House Elves.

** In my personal opinion that's just being a big sibling. I don't personally have any siblings but I have 2 cousins who I would die for. As the older one you just always want to protect them. I think authors list it as a flaw on Sirius' part because it is possible that he himself thinks of it as a regret or mistake. Because no matter how prejudiced or insane Sirius might have thought he was, Regulus was still his little brother. And sometimes, that's just how it is.

** It was both of their faults, but I feel like as the older brother, it was Sirius's responsibility to at least try. We really don't know whether he did or not, but I'd imagine that as soon as Regulus was put in Slytherin, Sirius gave up on him because he thought he'd become a Death Eater. I'm sure Regulus did push him away as well, but I think Sirius pushed him away first.

** Well, Sirius was a judgmental fucker until the day he died. Granted, he was still only 20-21 when he was sent to prison, when so many still see the world in black and white, but that doesn't justify his treatment of Kreacher or his continued attempts to bully Snape. (A grown man calling somebody "Snivellous" is just pathetically immature.)

He ran away from an abusive home, but left his little brother behind with no plans to try to rescue him. Seemed to hate his brother for being his mother's favorite (understandable, but still). Essentially wrote off his brother as evil simply for being a Slytherin, even before he became a Death Eater, from his smug perch as "not evil" because he'd managed to get into Gryffindor instead of Slytherin like the rest of his family.

But mostly, I think it's because all we "see" in canon about Regulus is that he cared about Kreacher, and turned against the Dark Lord to the point of essentially going on a suicide mission wherein he valued Kreacher's life over his own. In other words, we only see his "noble" parts, whereas we see plenty of Sirius's flaws.

That's more Crouch than Sirius, even Dumbledore says that he was kind to house elves in general. While Kreacher was a special case, but I don't think that that means his treatment of him was in any way justified. I just feel like it's a different situation from Winky in regards to how they view their house elves. From Sirius it was more like hatred of Kreacher himself, and from crouch and Malfoys outright bigotry towards house elves in general.

What you've cited doesn't prove this. His hatred for his parents was justified since they were probably abusive, or at least implied to be. And the not my family part was in reference to the Lestranges and Malfoys IIRC, not regulus. I'd hate Bellatrix too, if she were my cousin.
