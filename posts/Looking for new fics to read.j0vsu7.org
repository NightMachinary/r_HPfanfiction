Hi all. It's been a while since I've found any fic worth investing time into, so, maybe you guys can help me out.

/What I am looking for:/

*Pairings:* anything F/M or F/F is fair play.

*MC/POV:* preferably Harry or fem!Harry, can also be someone else if written well.

*Theme/Tone:* preferably serious and dark.

*Timeframe:* during Hogwarts years and at least pre OotP.

*Release Date:* preferably not more than one to two years ago, otherwise the same old fics will end up being linked.

/What I don't want:/

*MC/POV:* I hate a gazillion POV jumps, especially during a single chapter. "XY POV" after scene breaks don't make it better. Please only link fics that don't do this.

*Tropes:* Please no harem, no Chad-Harry, no overly blatant in-your-face bashing, no Lord Hadrian with 100 Titles...you get it.

*Grammar/Spelling/Punctuation:* Preferably fics that are well-edited and don't use periods after questions and don't confuse their/they're/there.

That's it, I think. I know it's all super specific, but I hope I can at least get a few suggestions. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Thanks in advance!


** I recently read [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1588111][Red Hair and Grass Blades]] which I very much enjoyed. Neville and Harry's roles are switched resulting in interesting changes, especially after she finds her mother's journals (no wandless magical mastery though, just some potions that can be made with muggle herbs).

It meets most of your requirements except perhaps the bashing one. It is an Evil Dumbledore story and Ron may be a sociopath. However, those elements have so far been minimal and the bashed characters have been competent. Most importantly, they aren't put down to make Harry look good, rather it's for them to be actual antagonists. For example, Dumbledore has control of Harry's vaults, but she isn't able to suddenly get control back as an 11 year old. She is powerless and alone which is a main driver in the story.

The tone is particularly interesting with interjections about other potential universes by the narrator. The first year is complete. If you decide to try it, I hope you enjoy it.

** 1)Metamorphosis by Lojuba

Harry falls back through time, in the beginning of her fifth year at Hogwarts. She's determined to get back without disrupting the timeline. But after she runs into a young Tom Riddle in Diagon Alley, she realizes that there's only so much hiding she can do, especially when she meets him again later, at the orphanage that took her in.

The characterization is well written and the date is was Published is: 2019-11-17

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21467518/chapters/51159757]]

2) When Harry Met Tom by The_Carnivorous_Muffin

Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. Again the characterization of Harry is superbly written and everything written by this auhtor is absolute gold in my opinion. Published:2018-08-13 [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15676317/chapters/36419703]]

3)1k+The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks ¬ª Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else remembers her. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks]]

This story was Published in: Aug 16, 2010, but it still fits all the requirements which is pre ootp, serious, and well written so Hopefully you haven't read it yet and maybe will give it a chance. The story is gen

4) The Mind Arts ¬ª What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.] Daphne/Harry story published: Nov 28, 2017, Fits with all the requirements except the year it was published [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts]]

5) Stranger Than Fiction ¬ª Harry receives a mysterious set of storybooks his 9th birthday. The summer he turns 11 Harry discovers not only does he share the main character's name - he IS the main character. The books tell the future! Now, what would a fairly clever child with no adult supervision do with this knowledge? Oh dear.

May 5 published: Jan 7, 2018,

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12790215/1/Stranger-Than-Fiction]]

**6)The Eyes ¬ª Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/The-Eyes]]

Very dark very serious and very well written starting before ootp the only problem is that it's published in 2013 so I'm going to take a gamble and hopefully you haven't read it yet.

It was kind of hard trying to find things that fit your requirements so hopefully I didn't disappoint too much!

** 1.Brilliant, but scary by free range snallygaster [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13413604/37/]] Hermione Granger is special. She has always known it, really, even before she received her letter. It was too bad that she had never met anyone as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to Hogwarts. And she wasn't wrong, because the moment she laid eyes on Harry Potter she just knew he was very special indeed. Obsessive!Hr, Slytherin!HHr

2.Reclamation of black magic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12058516/4/]] Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Updated Sporadically

1. Harry potter and the lady thief by starfox5 [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief]] AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge(this is a slow burn like there are some other ships between Harry and Hermione but essentially they get together after 45 ish chapters) I copy pasted the summaries. Also all of them are HHr Also none are fem harry

These are not coherent dark but have elements and ...... Well we can call it grey

Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path by Temporal Knight

10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore(fairly old, Harem)

I know quite some more but they are mostly HHr You can ask me if you wish

** LF74's Blood and Water (2019) and Soul and Body (2020) are both very good fics with tight writing and adept weaving around tropes. Both in progress, although Blood and Water has been on hiatus for a short while.

Subversion (2018) by Myricle is super technically impressive and very creative, so give it a try. Abandoned for the moment but what's out there is very good. It's WBWL, but purposely weaves around the established tropes of the genre.

Victoria Potter (2017) is impressively written, probably slightly more maturely paced than the above two. Great MC and amazing tweaks to the world. My favorite fic that's regularly updating.

The Imposter [sic] Complex (2019) - ignore the spelling error in the title, the writing is actually very good. A really brilliant idea that has some amazing OCs as well.

Also, if you haven't read Alexandra Quick, I highly recommend it. Doesn't fit some of your criteria but I think you might like it. It has a lot of quality and is just a great story and world.. The fifth book also released last year.

  What if Petunia wasn't so poisoned by jealousy her sister's magic, and when her orphaned nephew appeared on her doorstep chose to treat him as family rather than a burden? Sorted into Hufflepuff, how will the Wizarding World react when their saviour finally returns? And is being fair and loyal really as good as people say?

  Everyone knows that wizarding children often take on an aspect of magic during their childhood. Innate specialties. Children of quidditch players might be able to fly without a broom for a time, those raised by fisherman might be able to manipulate water with great ease. Harry Potter comes to Hogwarts able to heal from any injury. At least he's got Tom keeping him company.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life.
