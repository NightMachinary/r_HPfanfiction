:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A fic I read a while ago that I liked.

Something went wrong, and Dumbledore did some ritual to get a hero to solve his problems, hoping for a better Harry Potter, instead got Tom Riddle, moderately sociopathic but definitely not evil respected professor, who seems to think he's one of Dumbledore's best friends.


** Sounds similar to Rectifier linkffn(2595818) although it's Tom Riddle who travels dimensions on his own, not Dumbledore.

  In one world, the war against Lord Voldemort is raging. In another, a Hogwarts professor named Tom Riddle decides to put his theory on alternate worlds to test and embarks on a trip that quickly turns into a disaster. AU sixth year. DH compliant.

** You know...that gives me an idea. With all the dimension travelling fanfics, what if Voldemort sent one (or more) of his horcruxes to a parallel dimension, to stop it from being destroyed?\\
When the heroes destroy all the horcruxes and confront Voldemort, they find that one of the ones they destroyed was a horcrux belonging to an alternate dimension Voldemort, and /their/ Voldemort's last horcrux is in an alternate dimension itself.

...I wonder if that /has/ been done.

**** Probably just as well. If fragmented souls remained linked between dimensions, then that would imply that the souls of the same person throughout all parallel dimensions and timelines are linked, and therefore that anything that afflicts the soul of one dimension's iteration of that person would affect all iterations (or at least, the ones nearby in a cosmic sense).

Could you imagine that? If all of a sudden wizards and witches and muggles and magical creatures of all kinds started dropping into vegetative states, because of a dementor pandemic a few dimensions over?

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

  Born of a drunken one night stand rather than a love potion, Tom Riddle grew up a little differently. Family. Job. And absolutely no insane take-over-the-world attempts. Which all changes when he gets thrown into a world where apparently he grew up to be some sort of mad Dark Lord with a complex and he doesn't have any hair... Or a nose...
