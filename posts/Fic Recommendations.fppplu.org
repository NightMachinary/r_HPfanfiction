#+begin_quote
  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** This is the only fic I found in my bookmarks which is over 200k words amd includes a powerful/smart Harry. (The second work in the series is 200k. Can be read as standalone but the prequel is 30k and also good though I prefer the 2nd one) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/260551]])

A bit shorter. Really good with a twist at the end. Bout 140k I think. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11244426]])

A brilliant fic. 180k Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]])

Also bout 200k Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/979182]])

  In limbo, Harry doesn't choose to go back to the Forbidden Forest to face Voldemort. He makes another decision and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them?This is Tom Riddle's entire life, as close to canon as possible, if he shared his body with Harry Potter (and fell in love with him).

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.
