I'm looking for Brave New World and can't seem to find it. As far as I remember it is about harry going to school in America. Can anyone link me to it or have a copy of it? I'd appreciate it


** Doesn't seem to be on FFN anymore.

** Would that be the story by bellerophon30? 40 chapters, 890k long, summary: "A sixth and seventh year story, totally AU. Harry decides that his life expectancy will be greatly enhanced if leaves Dumbledore and Voldemort behind. Destination: The US."

** I honestly think it wasn't that good at all. Outside of the blatant non-HP and Weasley twins bashing and contrived romance, the only decent part of it was the fight scenes which are spread apart by weird filler of the author trying to show off his/her knowledge of NA Google Maps. Also, if you really think about it, Harry's solution to fighting Voldemort was dumb, like really dumb.
