******* Ah, that reminds me of a fic where Aberforth got expelled from Hogwarts for making a goat homunculus with alchemy or something so he could fuck it. I think Dumbledore was evil too. Probably was Partially Kissed Hero, no other author manages to write such weirdly convoluted characters and utter absurdity while being serious.
