I realize that Harry Potter is a book for children, but I feel like a lot of the time the plot depends on the characters being stupid and/or oblivious. In fanfiction it means that if you want to have your story follow the stations of canon, you have to leave the characters incompetent and I hate that.

For example the canon first year supply list includes a copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them, which since JK made a real version of it we know contains a page for both Cerberus and Basilisks. Which means that the problems of both first and second year could have been solved if only they actually read their school books. They agonized over the dumb Cerberus for months, and it is explicitly stated that the information about the basilisk was torn out of a library book. Since Hermione canonically memorizes all her schoolbooks I find it really hard to write my way around the fact that she should have known the way around both of those things before even boarding the train first year. Not to mention that Quirrell had to ask Hagrid about the Cerberus while in disguise just to find out about music being calming--a fact that is in one of the first year textbooks.

IDK, it's just really hard for me as a writer to get around plot-holes like that, and I feel like the books are full of them. I love Harry Potter, but I'm also a firm believer in having at least some characters be competent. At the very least I'd like the villain to be that way, but Quirrelmort's need to spend an entire year researching traps a first year could get around leaves a lot to be desired. Places where the characters end up looking blatantly stupid because of JK's poor planning and excessive retconning are my least favorite thing to write excuses for.


** It's easy to get around such plot holes - change canon to fit your needs. Or, if you start a story after these events, ignore them.

*** This. The best part of fanfiction is playing with the canon, just do whatever man. Also, it's not like the real version is a one to one copy of the book first years get in the novels. Chamber of Secrets obviously predates the real version of Fantastic Beasts, and if you're releasing a real bestiary of creatures and animals found in the Harry Potter franchise, you're gonna put most or all the creatures found in the Harry Potter franchise up to that point. The Basilisk is a rare and dangerous creature, with Salazar Slytherin's being the only one we know of in the entire series. It makes perfect sense that information on one wouldn't be readily available to first or second year students. Same with the Cerberus I imagine. The likelihood of most people encountering one is probably pretty low.

** I'm already at a loss, wondering why you'd want to follow canon.

You're correct of course; Rowling's universe isn't extremely consistent or coherent. If you want to get over something, change it. Just don't bore the reader with pages of explanations. There's hardly anything as annoying as an author who's trying to look good by making Rowling look bad.

After all, it's always easier to criticise a pretty extensive work like HP in hindsight.\\
In my opinion, many authors ask the wrong kind of questions. If they think something's strange, they ask 'Why isn't it like this?'. Instead, they should be asking 'Why is it the way it is?'

You can easily change whatever irks you the most, obviously (Basilisks, Fawks, Hallows, Prophecies, Time-travel -- whatever), but the more interesting approach, in my opinion, is to elegantly explore why things might be the way they are. You'll still arrive somewhere differently than Rowling, but at least you've done something constructive with the universe of Harry Potter.

*** Because "it's a children's book" is not a suitable explanation in universe. So if you introduce someone competent (and you better do, otherwise your character will be an idiot as well), they will ask Harry questions about his life and they should find at least some things questionable (eg Dumbledore in books 1 and 2).

Basically, either you make your characters idiots, or you end up dragging other characters' flaws into the light. Stuff like the midnight monster hunting detention, no one doing anything about the Basilisk and so on.

I agree that you can't excuse your story's plot by meta-narrative reasoning (i.e. canon's target-group). But the fact of the matter is that a) canon is done b) the first few books were intended for children. If you want to change that fairytale-style, change it. I don't see the problem.

***** Let's use Dumbledore as an example. If you change canon so that he is even remotely competent, he will resolve the first three books within days each. A capable Dumbledore removes Harry's role in the plot. Therefore just changing canon does not work because while you now have competent adults, Harry is useless (for the plot).

******* Dumbledore, as a headmaster, has one job, and that's ensuring the best possible learning environment, which includes NOT getting petrified by a giant snake or crushed by the troll Voldemort let in. Or by the supposed mass murderer. Him being unaware of the Basilisk, especially since he was around the first time and knew of Hagrid's innocence, is simply proof of his incompetence. If you make him competent, Harry has nothing to do. Same for years 1, 3, 5 and 6.

A competent Dumbledore would have stopped Umbridge and Malfoy, by force if he is unable to do otherwise (eg arranging an accident in the Acromentula nest). A competent Dumbledore would not have sent Harry and Hermione back through time but either have gone with them or cleared Sirius using his vast influence. And he would have certainly not been bested by Fudge in a PR war.

********* True. But then I'd argue that you've spent too much time on one story already. It'll never feel organic if it takes you three years to finish 150k words (exaggeration). Of course you evolve as an author. If you've produced a storyboard and took the time to write out crucial dialogue or scenes upon which the story hinge, there shouldn't be any such issues when you write it all down to begin with. But most just have an idea, start writing, and roll with it.

That being said, I know that -- as a hobby -- it rarely works out like it maybe could.

** I don't disagree about plot requiring them to be stupid, but which book is the Cerberus in? From my recollection, it isn't in the original Fantastic Beasts and the only info about the basilisk's gaze is that one suffers instant death.

Quirrell had been the Muggle Studies professor before his sabbatical, something that does not require extensive knowledge on Cerberus and it would have been super suspicious for him to be in the library researching it with Snape on his back. Also, Quirrell was researching one trap and trying to get Dumbledore out of the school.

** IMO, the best stories are the ones where canon is warped and twisted into a new, better shape. Going through the stations of canon like clockwork is /boring/! You get your

- "someone comes and gets him from the Dursleys" scene.

- The shopping scene

- the sorting scene

- the halloween scene

- the first cerberus scene

- the trials which are always the same, seriously, I haven't once read a story where the trials were a little bit harder.

- the "quirell destroys harry" scene

- the second train scene

- the first petrefication scene

and so on. Sprinkle in some quidditch and a weird love story that reads like it was written by an alien and you've got the average fanfic.

I like stories which don't just try to rewrite the books. But I think re-do fics where most things /STILL/ happen as they did in canon are the worst.

It really doesn't. You're assuming Rowling was planning to write Fantastic Beasts and/ or make it a movie when she was just writing Philosopher's Stone. I don't think even she could have planned *that* far ahead. Or imagined being so successful as to write spin-off textbooks and get multiple movie deals.

Plus you're trying to bring logic to it, and I'm not entirely convinced good writing has a lot to do with logic. It's just for fun.

In the later books she made some callbacks to the initial stuff, but it still felt like you could just change the names of characters and settings for each book and they'd still make sense as individual novels.

I hate to tell you this, but basilisks don't petrify things. A fact which the book likely contains. Literally the only reason Hermione figured it out and not Dumbledore is because she knew Harry was hearing voices in the walls.

I also hate to be the one to break it to you that people overlook and miss things /all the fucking time in real life, including "competent" people. We aren't super-perfect demi-gods but flawed./ People overlooking something isn't a plot hole, it's realistic.

** This bothers me A LOT too. I have been obsessed with reading a fanfic this week, that features Hermione as the main character, only she's a math genius. Her logic extends to many other situations as well. And when she doesn't realize a thing its not just to obfuscate the reader; it makes logical sense. It's a bit of a slow start, but Hermione becomes a very power arithmancer who crafts her own spells and finds extremely unique solutions to problems of the latter years. Check it out on FFA: The Arithmancer and the sequel Lady Archimedes.

#+begin_quote
  Since Hermione canonically memorizes all her schoolbooks I find it really hard to write my way around the fact that she should have known the way around both of those things before even boarding the train first year.
#+end_quote

Hermione didn't even memorize Hogwarts: A History (seemingly her favourite book) in her second year, so why would she have memorized less-important books? We know this because she noticed she was unable to find the book at the library because so many people had been taking that book out because they wanted to research Hogwarts. If canon Hermione was the perfect fanon goddess everyone thinks she was she wouldn't have needed to go to the library like she did in the books.

I feel like people have forgotten what canon Hermione was actually like. Yes, she was smart, but she was only human and more importantly, she was just a second year. She wasn't flawless in canon; movie/fanon Hermione on the otherhand was a straight-up Mary Sue. Hermione not being perfect isn't a plot hole or even bashing; it makes her human and makes her a more-fleshed out character (same goes with canon Dumbledore to a far greater extent).

I just feel like people use the term "plot hole" to describe any scenario where a smart character doesn't exhibit literal omniscience. Dumbledore knows everything? The standard manipulative Dumbledore trope. Dumbledore makes a few notable missteps in canon? Apparently a plot hole since, for some reason, Dumbledore is apparently meant to be a god-like figure who can't possibly make mistakes. Fanon Hermione knows everything? Apparently canon since people forgot that book Hermione was never movie/fanon Hermione. Hermione written like she was in the books? Apparently bashing since she's not perfect. The same applies with other characters to far, far lesser extents.

Now an actual plot hole would be Crouch Jr's entire subplot in GoF, and why he and the rest of said subplot is almost never mentioned post-GoF. Crouch Jr is never mentioned despite his massive importance in GoF (and his involvement with the torture of the Longbottoms), Crouch Sr is also never mentioned either despite the climax of GoF basically being his fault, and Winky was non-existent in HBP and DH; I don't even think she was in OotP either and if she did, it was probably one line of her backtalking Hermione about SPEW, or Dobby about being free.

*TL;DR: Hermione not being omniscient in canon, let alone PS and CoS, isn't a plot hole; she was never a flawless, omniscient goddess. Same thing goes for Dumbledore. Also, Goblet of Fire was a massive clusterfuck of a book given the plot holes in that book from what I recall.*

The Horcruxes aren't super powerful and nigh unbreakable. They're just objects. The object has to be destroyed to release the Horcrux.

It's Voldemort's /protections/ which make them devilishly difficult to do so.

Basilisk Venom isn't some inherent Horcrux killer where, when introduced to the equation, results in a destroyed Horcrux. It just happens to be extremely destructive enough to bypass Voldemort's protections.

So when Harry is bitten by the Basilisk, if he had died, he would have been destroyed, and the Horcrux with it. But he didn't. He was saved. So the Horcrux survived.
