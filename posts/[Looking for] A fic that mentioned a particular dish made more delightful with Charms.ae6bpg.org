It was a bird stuffed inside a bird, stuffed inside another bird (i.e. turkey stuffed with chicken stuffed with quail) but in reverse so that the larger bird was stuffed inside the smaller bird because of magic.

By the way, I just mentioned the birds above as examples but I can't remember what they really were. Also, this is the only detail I remember from that story.
