Fics where the mc uses super duper evil black magic.

Fusing your soul with a phoenix's to gain immortality.

Replacing your bones with diamond and your skin with dragon hide to become more resilient.

Mass human sacrifice to power rituals.

Everything icky and nasty. Context is pretty irrelevant; if they think to themselves 'oh light wizards are so boring there's nothing wrong with using the brains of the unborn as lip balm' or if they know that what they are doing is wrong, or if they do something wrong in service to some greater good, whatever.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][I am Lord Voldemort?]]- SI is stuck in Riddle's body immediately after killing James. He has basically no moral compunctions because failing to live up to the image of Voldemort means death anyway.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]] - Will never not recommend; Harry is very 'practical' and doesn't flinch from evil.


** This is the most fucked-up Dark Magic one-shot I've ever read. It's incredibly well-written. NSFL. linkffn(12692794)

*** I love this, but it is essentially just pulling at pure shock factor. The whole core of the fic is to make you gasp. Sadly, I have been ruined by horror and nothing makes me unsettled anymore.

Seriously, this would have been better as a series.

Instead of making another post, trying to remember the fic where the Ministry makes a building and uses bones of people as obelisks and such. That was quite nuts. I loved it.

**** It's in its fourth book which I'm pretty sure is the last if I remember right and it's probably 1-3 chapters at most from being finished so probably within a couple months at most. If I remember the updates it seems like 2-3 weeks is an average update schedule sometimes getting up to a month. Most recent update was a few days ago.
