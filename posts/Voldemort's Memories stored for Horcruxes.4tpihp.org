Is it plausible that Voldemort made physical copies of his memories and stored them at secret locations, just so that if he died and his horcruxes ever became active in the future, they would be able easily be able to use those memories and continue Voldemort's crusade where he left off?


** My read would be that Tom would never make something like that in the first place regardless if it were possible or not. Voldemort values himself above all else. I don't think he could concieve of a 'back up' plan for something that he felt wasn't directly 'him'.

If Tom RIddle from the Diary had returned to life, than I am sure both Diary Tom and Voldemort would have quickly come to blows.

The Diary was only left as a demonstration of how important he thought he was. */His/* diary was to Tom, a relic of importance that rivalled the Cup, the Locket or the Stone.

*** You say that, but doesn't the very existence of /seven/ horcruxes contradict that. He wasn't satisfied with ensuring his immortality by just one horcrux, so he made a back up horcrux, then another back up horcrux, then another, and another and so on. Doesn't that reek of sheer paranoia?

**** No I don't think it does. We need to distinguish between Tom wanting to preserve himself to wanting to preserve his legacy.

When I say Tom values himself above all else, I mean what he considers his 'true self', the body and mind that he has grown up in. That's what is most precious to him. That is what he makes the Horcruxes to protect.

He makes *SIX*, giving him a seven part soul, because he feels it will make him stronger. He likely already had his first Horcruxe made when he asks Slughorn about making more than one. He is willing to repeatedly maim his soul to make his 'true self' more powerful.

So he is functionally immortal by the time he leaves Hogwarts, believing himself supremely powerful and unbeatable. Plus he is already on the way to making 5 more, why would he possibly ever need to make a back up?

** that depends on your headcanon for memory extraction whether it copies or removes(which is what Dumbledore made it sound like the memory extraction did).

edit: Also, I don't think Riddle realized that the diary and potentially the other horcruxes could turn into new Riddles with the right circumstances as he expected them to bind him to the world only. Other Riddles would just be nearly as knowledgeable rivals for power.

** You can write a Voldemort like that. That Voldemort would be more cautious and less arrogant than canon Voldemort. That's fine, but (1) you need to keep that caution consistently and (2) that makes Voldemort stronger, so you need to offset that strength if he's your protagonist.

The memories would need much stronger protections than the horcruxes.

He also needs to know exactly how his horcruxes would work -- that they possess a person and eventually overwrite their personality with his, that they produce copies of his mind at the time of creating the horcrux.

Consuming the memories might take a prohibitive amount of time. Storing them would definitely take some time, repeatedly. This is not a habit that Voldemort would simply give up.

Voldemort would have needed to supply protections that his sixteen-year-old self could get through. He'd need to store the memories in the same place for forty years.

There's no guarantee that 1943 Tom Riddle would view Voldemort's memories up to 1981 and then become the same as Voldemort. With the change of perspective, he might choose to act quite differently.
