Dumbledore, tired from the battle with Voldemort in the department of mysteries, changes the way he words things when explaining the prophecy to Harry. Instead of mentioning about how Harry's capability for love is the advantage...

"The Power of Love is the way to defeat Voldemort. It might just save your life" explained Dumbledore.

Harry clued in, having heard the song in the car on the Radio before, but was confused as to why a Muggle Song might beat Voldemort, but this was Dumbledore, he'd give Harry any advantage he could.
