I've had this idea in my head for a secret organization infiltrating the magical world and pulling strings in the background, like Hydra in Captain America Winter Soldier. I don't have time to sit and write a story, but would love to read one if anybody knows of anything along those lines.


** How would you expect such a story to differ from what the Death Eaters did in the books? Voldemort started gaining power in the middle of the 20th century and was defeated decades later - most of that in secret (e.g., many murders were committed in his name before the vast wizarding public was reading about it in the news). Hydra lasted, what, 20 years longer than Team Voldemort?

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.
