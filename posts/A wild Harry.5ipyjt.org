Harry is literally wild in that he lives in the forest, believes he is an elf and doesn't want a wand as he can already do wandless magic.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them! Harry is captured by wizards and brought to a castle. The wizards are obnoxious, but there's a lovely wood nearby which is quaintly named the "Forbidden" Forest. Harry thinks that's adorable.

  Running away from the Dursleys at a young age was a turning point of his destiny. Now he lives alone in the wilderness of a land long forgotten by the passage of time. And this is the story of his discovery in the lost world beneath. Slow updates, sorry.

  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

*** I love the evolution of this fic. It started out as standard, tropey, if slightly humorous "Harry grows up slightly different" AU and then over time just turned into a madhouse.

I still like it but i hope it's not going to be too over the top in an attempt to be funny. I thought it was quite hilarious before the author decided that Harry needed to have the ridiculous Quidditch game in the last chapter.

His few interactions with Daphne are so ridiculously adorable and funny. I want more of that and less of the over the top "hilarious luck Harry".

**** Yeah the last chapter was a bit waff but I enjoyed the quidditch scene more than the typical: Harry flies, Hary executes Wonski Feint, other seeker gets back on, Harry either snatches snitch from under their nose with cunning or outflies them from the other side of the pitch.

  Not a lot of things could affect Harry's mundane life in the house of his abusive relatives. But then, you don't need extraordinary things to obtain extraordinary results. A seemingly simple step pitched his life into a direction no one had ever expected. Harry Potter, the Jack of all trades and Master of Misdirection. Intelligent! Harry.
