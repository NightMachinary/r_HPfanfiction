It's something I've been thinking about recently.

​

In canon Veela are the personification of JKR's fear of attractive women. That under that attractive exterior they are vicious, fireball throwing, bird-like creatures. That they entrance men, just for their own benefit etc. (Also Fleur is not a Veela and has never been shown to be a Veela, she's just pretty).

​

What are Veela in your minds? Are they the fanon version (sex... sex.... and more sex)? Are they the canon version (sirens basically)?

​

I find Veela to be more the second definition, therefore siren-like creatures who entrap men, for whatever reason. Why otherwise would they be fireball-throwing, bird-like monstrosities that can camouflage as beautiful women?

Uh no. They're based on a real piece of folklore.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samodiva_(folklore)]]

As for procreation, I don't think they do. As spirit-like beings, Veela would come into existence rather than reproducing sexually. The latter only occurs if they reproduce with a human, producing part-Veela offspring.

Odd way of thinking. Yes, the mythical Vilas are fae and spirit-like, but then, so were the original Goblins, Leprechauns and Pixies, yet their HP counterpart are very much solid, fleshy, organic beings who reproduce 'normally'. Even Dementors, who are vastly more spirit-like than Veelas as far as HP sentient species go, reproduce (although they do so in eldrtich fungus fashion rather than in mammal-like fashion).

Considering Veelas specifically, I consider that they are simultaneously known to Muggles the mythival Vilas, Harpies and Sirens, with none of the related legends as we know them being quite right. Scandinavian Muggles thinking of them as spirit-like beings is no different from the legends of "the Fair Folk" which I think were just concerned with wizards and witches. And since they're the bird-people, I'm partial to the idea that Veela babies hatch from big golden eggs.

** In my mind Veelas are just one more sentient humanoid species that exists in the /Harry Potter/ universe --- likely an offshoot of early wizardkind, just like Goblins & Co. Their magic evolved to give them two alternate survival strategies: either make themselves charming and agreeable to an almost debilitating degree; or, if that fails, fearsome powers for a fight.

I don't think Veelas particularly /try/ to entrap people, siren-style; that would, in my opinion, be a stereotype spun by wizardkind, and supported by a few particularly morally-corrupt individuals in Veelakind. Think werewolves --- yes, there are Fenrirs Greyback who own up to the stereotypes and relish in them, but for every Fenrir there's ten poor Remuses Lupin who are just regular people who happen to be werewolves.

I also dislike the idea that they're a one-gender species. Yes, all the Veelas we see in canon are females, but it's not like we see many Veelas at all, is it? May I remind you lot that until /Fantastic Beasts/, we never saw any female Goblins --- and yet you don't see anyone arguing that Goblins are only ever male! No, there are definitely male Veelas, in my opinion, though it is possible they are fewer in number for whatever reason.

Their attitude to sexuality... considering their seem to mostly hail from France I like the idea that it is alike to 18th-century French libertinage --- many play the "games of love" and it's unspokenly okay in their society, but they still usually wouldn't talk about sex in public, and always mix sappy romance/flirting in their games of seduction even if neither party intends to start a long-lasting relationship.

*** Good point about the goblins.

But the canon point, and the point I was trying to make, was that veela were deceivers by nature. They appear beautiful, but in truth are monstrous.

As to the werewolf analogy, it would make sense, if it was a disease, but it's apparently a race. So that analogy doesn't hold true.

From what you presented, I just don't see veela as being anything else rather than a failed attempt at showing the shallowness of physical beauty from the author.

Also, just to remind you. I still don't see how veela procreate. Since the daughters and even granddaughters of a veela seem to just be witches.

Very simple. A male Veela and female Veela do the deed, the Veela woman lays a golden egg or whatever, and nine months later, boom, baby Veelas.

Veelas can crossbreed with humans, like most other humanoids; Fleur is no different from Flitwick --- someone with some nonhuman ancestry who retains /some/ vestigial traits of the other species, but too little to matter, so that they are still, overall, considered to be wizardkind.

***** In a way, sure. But you all know that this is about some weird abilities from being a part-human hybrid that this is all about, plus if two species can breed with each other then from the genetic stand-point you can only get how much of a hybrid someone is by comparing the characteristic parts of their genome to those of the species that they are a hybrid of and because of how things are inherited you don't really have a guarantee that those traits will remain, nor that they'll disappear.

Sure, when you look at the family tree, she's a quarter and that's it. But genetically, I have doubts that there's enough stuff there to actually count her as a hybrid. I may be wrong, obviously, and I don't have problems with accepting it when someone writes her as a hybrid (for as long as they don't go overboard with it) ... and granted, wizards likely don't care about genetics when thinking about this stuff, but I feel that in a post that's about /what/ Veela in general are this is still a valid viewpoint, especially when so many authors (sure, most of them not too good, but still ...) do things with Veela as a plot element that are frankly nonsense.

** According to Pottermore, Veela are "semi-human" magical beings, almost certainly based off of the Slavic "Vila". They're not sirens and the only resemblance to them is that they are unnaturally beautiful supernatural women (maybe there are male veela, who knows). They can entice men, but there's no real reason to a compare them to sirens, as there's no suggestion that the main use of that ability is to catch men. After all, they are considered to be "Beings" legally and capturing men to cook them alive is, I'm sure, illegal. :)

I'd agree that Veelas don't trap men, but they would have the ability to do so, and so my theory is that it's a stereotype Wizardkind has about them, no different from their incorrect beliefs about Goblins or Elves.

They are a very open/sex-positive community but definitely not the fanon, sex-obsessed version. No village-wide orgies or stuff like that. They simply embrace the beauty of sex and all things pleasurable with few taboos but generally settle down into a steadier lifestyle as they age.

Magic. Like, conception through magic. No need for futa stuff. They use magic to generate the "missing" part of the DNA for the egg with the aid of the partner's DNA. They can have sex for pleasure, but not to get pregnant.

I am more likely to accept, as I said, parthenogenesis as a viable veela reproductive method. It doesn't require rape or any other insane scheme. Just magic to keep away infections and diseases.

** I see two possible origins for Veela. Either they are some sort of co-evolved parasitic subspecies of human, or they were intentionally created by some ancient dark mage (perhaps for a harem or for spying/sowing discord). Given the example of the basilisk, a known experimentally-bred magical creature whose creation involves two distantly-related animals (chicken egg incubated by toad), the bird transformation makes me lean toward the intentional creation hypothesis.

In any case, the most /important/ answer to, "What are Veela?" is, "extraordinarily dangerous." Downgrade that to, "dangerous," if there's some commonly-used magical means to negate their allure.

**** To breed with and to produce fertile offspring implies that they are the same species.

***** The magical definition of "species" has to be something different. Skrewts are crossbreeds of fire-crabs and manticores (manticores being mammal-like, sentient chimaera-things of lion and human with a scoripon's stinger, while firecrabs are... crabs), and I really think if you seriously suggest that /they/'re the same species you'll be laughed out of the room.

Besides, even without factoring in the apparent ability to use magic to crossbreed anything with anything as demonstrated by the Skrewts, Homo Sapiens could interbreed with Neanderthal, couldn't he? This might be a similar situation. The magical hominids are different enough to be their own species but close enough that fertile hybrid offspring is possible.

****** Well the definition of species can get pretty wishy-washy (even without looking at things like virus' and prions which defy modern attempts to understand what it means to be alive) instead just looking at things cladistically and looking at things which reproduce asexually and we're pretty fucked when it comes to trying to classify nature. That's before we factor in magic.

That said lets try anyways.

So all these species can crossbreed and, I assume, produce fertile offspring* but so what? Imagine a circle which contains all of the members of a species and another that contains all the members of another. Is there overlap? Like a venn diagram? Members within the overlap can breed with members of both circles, but those on the edge can't and we're left with a kind of proto speciation, which is reasonable under the punctuated equilibrium model where speciation is the main driver of evolutionary change.

We can see this all the time with dog breeds, ring species, and with humans (and our dozens of cousin subspecies/species). This is the basics of cladistics. If we counted the number of traits of reasonable size** and compared them we could probably create a family tree where we could see which subspecies/races*** fit where and how.

I could do all that, or, I could just say that they could crossbreed and be done with it.

If you have a different definition of species and would like to work with that I would love to work with you. You can see how my attempts at classification have fallen through here so I would love to hear another definition. But it has to be measurable in some way and it has to be true in all cases.

*Can Hagrid have kids? And if so with Giants or Humans or both? How about all possible half giants? Can Giants have kids with a muggle, or is magic inherently required? How about any of the others? You can see how we are fucked.

Giants are hard to classify under this approach. Animals which are similarly sized either live in water, where weight is less punishing, or you can look at Elephants which had to evolve pneumatized bones over millions of years. Sure, perhaps this is an extreme case of Cope's rule on some serious steroids, but the capybara can't breed with a rat yet a giant can breed with a human.

And I haven't even gotten started of Veela yet, because by god having both avian and mammalian traits simultaneously is a fucking thing.

**What the hell counts as reasonable is entirely up for debate, even amongst evolutionary biologists.

***Now we get to the core of the problem. We go about dividing organisms into categories and try to fit them into nice boxes like 'Kingdom' and 'Species' when the only real difference between them if their traits which separate them into clades, from then on all species on one side of this border share that trait with all species on that side and only on that side because only that clade has that particular phylogeny.

Even if a snake grew legs it wouldn't be a lizard because lizards and snakes have already diverged. So the closer we look at this the more we seen no valuable information.

TL;DR

Classification of organisms is hard, classification of fictional magical organisms is harder.

Achille. :o I have that as a partial explanation for how interspecies sex can make totally normal children with characteristics of both parent species/the parents themselves. :) My explanation is that by all rights they SHOULDN'T be able to even breed, and even if they COULD they'd have made horrific monsters that are inside out or have merged eyeballs or something, BUT magic is there, so magic actually is what smooths over the DNA and fixes all the would-be genetic errors. :)

I mean if magic can turn a freaking desk into a pig without any biological messups or issues in the organs or neuron stuff, then it's like super easy to imagine it'd do the same thing for interspecies kids that come into existence. :)

So yes in my story muggles couldn't have kids with any nonhumans because it needs magic from both parents to make it work right. :)
