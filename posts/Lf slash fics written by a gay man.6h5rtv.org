Hey guys, all is in the title. While I love a good slash fic, it's almost always written by a woman and therefore may lack a realistic look on gay relationships.

Will even take any good fic written by a man as a bonus.

P.S. no offence to female writers whatsoever.

That's why I generally don't read male slash fics. Those Drarry and Snarry nonsense written by Tom Felton and Alan Rickman fangirls are especially unrealistic, OOC, and bad.

On the other hand, female slash fics seem to be written by far more women authors, such as the case with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/Here-And-There][Here and There]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(7525570;10099028).

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** As a female reader and writer I take no offense. I've held off on writing a fic I've been thinking about specifically because I don't want to turn it into something painfully unrealistic. It's like when I read het sex scenes so clearly written by a straight man only interested in wish fulfillment and who has absolutely no idea what it's like to experience sex as a women. /Shudders/ Actually, now I think about it, endless overuse of the word skullfuck and other ridiculousness is part of what drove me to slash. So maybe that's part of why there are so many women in slash, apart from your run of the mill actor fantasizing.

Anyway, the point of my comment is that you should also ask over in [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]. I imagine you'll get more answers.

**** It's a tag.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Skull%20Fucking/works]]

Granted, there are only 151 fics tagged with this, but I've seen it in fics where it's not tagged. Why can't people just tag it blow job or oral sex?

There was one day when I was looking for a het PWP and came across several fics on the first page of results that used that term. Not a single one was sexy to me. I also suspect it might be used more frequently by teenage boys since a number of them were written poorly and just read like a bad porno.

** I'm not 100% sure that abaddon/nothingbutfic identifies as gay, but most of his pairing preferences are slash. He hasn't transferred all of his HP fic from LiveJournal to AO3, but you can find a few stories [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/nothingbutfic/pseuds/nothingbutfic/works?fandom_id=136512][here]].

  "'So, Neville Longbottom has come to Hogwarts. I'm Malfoy. And this is Potter, Crabbe, and Goyle.' Malfoy sounded a bit like a shopkeeper with a sales pitch. A boy with red hair, who'd been standing behind Longbottom, snorted at Malfoy's introductions.'Think my name is funny, do you? No need to guess yours. Red hair, ratty clothes, you must be a Weasley. You wouldn't want to go making friends with his sort, Longbottom. I can help you there.' Malfoy stuck his hand out.Longbottom, who seemed very nervous, took a big breath, and, as though puffing his chest out would make him seem more intimidating, tried sneering at Malfoy's hand. 'I have my own ideas about who I should be making friends with, Malfoy.'Harry wondered what exactly everyone was so impressed with. Longbottom was rather pathetic, really. And more than a little rude. "Harry Potter, a normal half-blood, living with his abusive muggle relatives, has, without Dumbledore's influences, no positive experiences with muggles. Upon learning he's a wizard, he runs away and makes his own way to school. And oh, what a thirst to prove himself.
