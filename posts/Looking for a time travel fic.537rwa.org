Harry goes back in time to Godric's Hollow and tells James what will happen in the future. Harry tells James that the future can't be changed drastically but stays behind to create a way to survive the killing curse.

Some other things to note is that Harry sends an anonymous owl asking permission to come in and tell his story. And only James is able to hear the conversation.Sirius and the others just watch them talk. That's all I can really remember about the fic. If you know the name I'd really appreciate it.


** Those has elements from Linkffn(the alchemist's apprentice). Not sure if that's the fic though.
