I read a Hermione/Percy fic a few years ago that I simply cannot find again and I'm hoping one of you lovely people has heard of it.

The fic consisted of Percy accompanying Hermione to Australia to find her parents after the war's end and them getting closer together through many sleepless nights in various hotels. Does that sound familiar?
