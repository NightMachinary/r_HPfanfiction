At least in the first actual book, it sounded like they could've gone either way. When Harry asks to be brought to platform 9 3/4, Vernon actually engaged Harry in conversation about he would have expected magic carpets. He wasn't screaming or hitting him or anything, actually considering how the magic world could work. Are there any that continued that train of though (no pun intended)?


** The Dursleys are reasonable in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871).

Petunia actually works for Gringotts as a tomb raiding archeologist in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802). Her partner is one Bill Weasley.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

I have only read up until the second year in this but at least Vernon becomes more tolerable and even sympathetic.

** I don't know if it will interest you but linkffn(2531438)

It's a bit old maybe and before DH was released. Basically Vernon tries to be a better man from the beginning.
