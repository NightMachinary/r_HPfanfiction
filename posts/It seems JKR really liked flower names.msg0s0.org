We all know that Lily and Petunia have a flower theme going on, but I've noticed that alot of the other characters are named after flowers too. Off the top of of my head there's Rose, Daphne, Poppy, Fleur, Lavender, Pansy, Myrtle, Susan, Lupin, and Narsissa. there might be more but thats what I can think of.


** To be fair Lupin was a wolf reference, Narcissa was a constellation/narcissism reference, and Susan is just a really common name.

*** Sorry to be such a know-it-all, but i read an interview a few days ago from 2004.

Quote Q: "I noticed in the Black Family tree that everyone is named after a constellation. Is this intentional? Does this have any bearing on the plot?" Quote A: "It's just one of those family traditions, although Narcissa breaks the trend. I had always thought of her as 'Narcissa' so I decided not to change her to match the others when I came up with their names. There's been a lot of speculation that she is in some way linked to Lily and Petunia, because of the flower theme, but I can put that rumour to rest here: she isn't related to them."

** On the one hand, you're right, but on the other hand, I feel the need to point out that his name is not a flower reference. Remus Lupin literally means "Wolf Wolf." The guy named wolf wolf got bitten by a werewolf as a child, and his entire future personality and station in life would then become defined by his uncontrollable transformations into a wolf. Look out everyone, wolf wolf is wolfing out into a wolf again. Better run away before he wolfs you.

Which is almost as incredible a coincidence as the family of chronically backstabbing assholes being named bad faith.

Fate seems to be a very cruel and jilted bitch with a drinking problem in the Harry Potter universe.

At least we can reasonably assume that Riddle knew what he was doing when he took on the moniker Flees From Death when he began his quest for immortality.

**** That damn prophecy. Everything always goes back to that damn prophecy. That's the only thing that stopped it.

Even Riddle turned his name into an anagram riddle before he graduated school.

I think he meant it to mean that /death flees from him/ but his French sucks.

** They're common names in the UK, but she does have a quirk with using them, yeah.

I'm not sure about Daphne, though: originally she was supposed to be Queenie, and her sister's name fits in with the Malfoy naming scheme (like with Narcissa IIRC being a play on narcissist and Narcissus and a star called that, and by extension the Blacks' since Draco and Scorpius are star-related), so it makes me wonder if it's a reference to the Daphne myth in Greek mythology.

Well, whatever her original plans were, none for Daphne came to fruition.

Susan, although a common British name, is actually from Hebrew: "gift from God" or something. But, I doubt that context played a role.

*** Well on that note, Theodor also means 'god-given' in Greek so I think a lot of names that we use nowadays have some sort of meaning.

**** Yeah: a lot of them have lost their context, though. When a parent names their son, for example, Christopher, it's not after the actual Christian saint, despite it being rooted from Christianity.

My name, for example, is Michael, and it comes from the Abrahamic religions' arch-angel: my family and I are completely atheist, lol.

** Rose is named after Ron. Ron and Hermione named their kids after themselves. Hugo for Hermione (male name starting with H that was not Harry) and Rose for Ron, ie female name starting with R.

Poppy is named for the milk of poppy, which is the base for opium, a strong painkiller.

*** Plot twist: Rose is Harry's kid after Hermione and Harry had one too many firewhisky shots one Halloween.

Hermione named their daughter Rose to carry on the tradition of girls in Harry's family being named after flowers, not that anyone noticed.
