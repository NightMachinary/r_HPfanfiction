I was reading a comment earlier that it took the kid four years to find out what the cult that killed his parents was called, and that got me thinking about something similar. Did he ever make some inquiries about his own family? At least the Potters, since the Evans were Muggles. And no, some random drivel about how he has his mom's eyes and his dad's Quidditch skills doesnt count. I mean actually learning about them. They were an old and rich family too, its not like they were random Joes.


** Harry, for some inexplicable reason, seemingly dropped pretty much any and all interest in the magical world and the history of his family (save for a few plot-related/convenient moments) as soon as book one ended. I mean, he didn't even know what /Death Eaters/ were until book four (!), let alone what his grandparents names' were.

As for who he could ask; McGonagall, his Head of House? Dumbledore, his Headmaster and (for some reason) guardian? Hagrid, Lupin through letters and during third year, perhaps even pick up a book in the library...

Where did you get that from? The Dursleys are pretty clearly considered to be Harry's guardians.

** JK Rowling told us all a great story. She built a horrible world with more plot holes than there were holes in the book Holes.

Harry never looked into his family as it wasn't part of his story. Unless she needed to use it in some way.

An author builds a world, they look for inconsistencies and plot holes. A story teller plows ahead and just keeps building. So what if new information contradicts old? That part of the story is over, just keep telling the new parts.

Looking through the lenses of her being a story teller and most of the story issues make more sense.

**** Cool, glad I could help. Storytelling is the family trade on my father's side, it ended professionally with my grandfather sadly. Still we always have jibber-jabbers when we all get together. Just sitting around telling bullshit stories with twists and turns no one else can guess.

It made working on an English degree, before running off to join the Army, both easy and hard. Short stories, song lyrics and poems are easily generated. Sticking to rules of writing was a pain.

Storytellers focused on gossip, learning tales, folklore and whatever was popular at the time. It's more public speaking than writing.

A well educated crowd will expect a story told well with dictation and eloquence. The common man wanted less rich tapestry and more a painting in words. One is woven with thousands of threads, the other through various sized strokes of color.

That's changed somewhat over the years but the core is still there. Rowling's used broad strokes and cleaned up the edges some with a finer brush. The broad strokes were still there though in her books.

Boy with troubled childhood gets saved by a giant who transports him to a world of magic. There he learns magic and makes two true friends. They have to overcome a great evil saving the magic world. This tests their skills and the knowledge they have gained so far. Harry and friends prove themselves true heroes who have grown this school year. Harry must return to the world of mortals at the end of school until next year.

I tell stories along those lines nightly to my kids. That was her story, she just had to fill in the details with broad strokes.

She told a great story, really she did. She just never wrote a book series, she wrote a series of stories she told. Maybe got off track, maybe it helped more, not sure, just needed to let it all out. Hope it helped again and glad the first post did!

** Who would he even ask? Probably Sirius shared some stories when Harry stayed at Grimmauld, but nobody before him was very forthcoming with information about Harry's parents, let alone grandparents. Even Lupin didn't reveal that he was James's friends until pressed.

*** There have to be ways though. McGonagall surely must have known his grandparents, regardless of what year you consider for her birth. Same for Slughorn. And there is no way there aren't books about Wizarding families, given how obsessed with heritage they are. /The Sacred 28/ cant be the only one, and even that one, I dont think Harry ever read it, right? The Ministry archives would have also been a possible trail to follow, he is The Boy Who Lived, no way they wouldnt help him. Heck, even Gringotts has to have had some financial records and such. Not to mention his parents lived next door to the most renowned historian in Britain, for gods' sake.

There have to be ways to piece together some info on his family, no way they would have completely vanished within a single generation.

**** Even if there was no information and Voldemort burned down all the registries and record archives, that doesn't mean he wouldn't at least ask. He did come from the Muggle World, after all, where that information exists in abundance so the automatic thought of knowing the information isn't available wouldn't be there. Even asking and getting a 'no, that information can only be found in the family grimoire that burned down when wherever it was your family lived burned down' would be more emotionally-validating to a kid that's supposedly desperate to know his parents than never asking anyone anything ever unless someone is about twenty minutes from death.

I think realistically, the answer is simply Rowling's abominable worldbuilding coming into play again. "No questions! I haven't written the answers yet!"

**** The Potters apparently had James late in life, so I can see them being a decade older than McGonagall and never crossing paths in any substantial way. Slughorn must have known Fleamont at least, but Harry avoided talking to him at all cost.

As for archives and Gringotts paper trail, no way a kid fresh out of cupboard uder the stairs is going to go asking for those. But I can see Harry post-Hogwarts piecing together his family history.

**** Hagrid worked at the school when James and Lily were students and then they were in the Order together, so he knew them and knew who their friends were. How would he know James's parents?

As for Hermione, that's putting too much stock into children. She's resourceful enough that she could have done that, and I would read some AU exploring this idea, but it's totally believable that the thought just never crossed her mind.

****** Fleamont was in and out of Hogwarts before Hagrid ever got there, if the wiki dates are to be believed. It says he was born in 1909 or prior, so he'd get his letter in 1920 at the latest. Hagrid was there in the 40s, so it's not likely they met in school. With Euphemia it's possible since I can't find when she was born, though I doubt he would have gotten to know her well since he was expelled 3rd year.

I doubt many people alive have much info on Harry's paternal grandparents. They seem to have lead a quiet life and died peacefully.

******** Which is an interesting fact, but doesn't say much about the man as a person other than being a skilled potioneer. It's fairly impersonal, a fact off a list. I gotta question if most people even know he did it, given no named character to my knowledge has ever brought it up (could be wrong, it has been a while since I read the books).

** JK thought it would be easier to tell the story if Harry was a moron. The only reason she had Harry not know what Death Eaters were was because she wanted to give exposition. Because a group of masked, cloaked evil men who tortured muggles, muggleborns and used Voldemort's mark needs exposition in regards to who they are.
