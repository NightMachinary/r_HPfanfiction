Sorry about the delay. In the past month I've moved into a new apartment, was sick for a week, was out of state for a week, etc. It's been a bit hectic.

The next fic will be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6663972/1/Secret-Steps][Secret Steps]].

#+begin_quote
  Extreme AU. In a world where contact between muggles and wizards is strictly forbidden, where love blinds, and power is corrupt... an orphaned Hermione Granger struggles to make things right with the help of some unlikely allies. HG,SS.
#+end_quote

What did y'all think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]]?

#+begin_quote
  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** This is in my top 10 and probably my top 5 stories in the fandom. I've pretty much covered my thoughts on it in my write-up of my [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gjpJsBshvv5sSTHsbHQ269e3DW2ZReBH20AT7NufJYw/edit][20 top fics]]. Quoting from the relevant section:

#+begin_quote
  This isn't everyone's cup of tea - fem!Harry is a deal breaker right up front for many, and many others will get impatient at the beginning (it takes its time setting the hook). But those who jump ship early, or pass this one up without giving it a chance are missing out. It's intricately, lovingly constructed, there's room to endlessly expand, and the characters are rich and full of life. The origin of Merlin arc, just by itself, would probably make this list as a short story. And the September, 1964 section with Dumbledore trying to track down Morgana is just... beautiful. Speaking of tough characters to write... a good, cheerfully meddlesome, inscrutable, good-intentioned Dumbledore is hard to write, and Rakeesh hit it out of the park in this one. I found myself wanting more at the end, and that may or may not happen, but this one is good enough that you're just happy there's as much as there is. We're getting into can't-miss territory here.
#+end_quote

This is one of only a handful of fics that I feel personal connection to - the writing style, humor, and characterization just make my socks roll up and down.

If you've been waffling on reading this because it sounds odd, or if you tried the first chapter and didn't like it, give it a chance. There are things in the beginning that would make novice readers say "huh?" and veteran readers start seeing cliche red flags, but keep going. Give it a chance. This one sneaks up on you and gets really, really good.

I pretty much read this only because you added this little suggestion at the end of your post. As a vet reader, I would definitely have turned away based on red flags, so thanks for giving me the heads up to push through!

PS edit, I'm totally taking advantage of your top 20 fic-list. I think it warrants a post (or repost) devoted to it! Such a great write-up of quality fiction would be really appreciated in this sub, especially by new readers.

** Rahkesh's Myrddin quickly became on of my favorite characters in the fandom. I loved that part of the story arc.

I also thought he handled the reintegration into Weasley family dynamics very well, and his dumbledore was absolutely perfect. Caring, kind, and we'll intentioned, however curious beyond anything else. Perfect.

** It took me a couple of tries to read this. I didn't like the first chapter at all, and I had (and still have) certain misgivings about the story. My primary issue with the fic is the interactions between Jasmine and her old friends.

In chapter one you've got Jasmine acting overtly and deliberately mysterious, in a completely unnecessary way. This brings to mind all those arsehole indy!Harry fics where he just goes around with a massively inflated head trying to look awesome and instead just looks like a dick.

Later chapters show that Jasmine isn't a dick, but there's still a lingering problem in her interactions with Ron and Hermione. On the one hand, you find it unbelievable that she would even really care to associate with them after thousands of years of life experience, especially as she's lost all her memories of them. And conversely, assuming we take her desire to interact with them as a given, she begins to revert to chapter 1 arseholeishness when she's around them, constantly name-dropping and place-dropping in what seems like a transparent and concerted effort to look impressive and cool. Somehow, I just don't buy that someone who has lived for thousands of years, is super-rich and phenomenally powerful still cares about looking cool.

With all of that said, I absolutely love the fic lol. Jasmine's character, when not around her old friends, is absolutely fascinating. I especially enjoy the way she regularly changes identity, adopting that life completely, including taking up new speech patterns and trying out new experiences. I like that she never seems to get bored with life, even after thousands of years: the world is a huge place, full of amazing people and places and things to learn, and even with thousands of years there's still plenty for Jasmine to do. The Dumbledore and Flamel interactions were the high points of the story.

I also enjoy the historical explorations. I'm not quite as enthusiastic about the Merlin sequence as many readers, probably because I'm a bit "meh" about Arthurian legend in general, but it was without a doubt engaging, well paced, and nicely detailed.

The humour in the fic is amazing, not least because it's the type of humour that's hardest to write. It's easy to write absurdist humour, where events and characters act in crackish ways. Most fanfiction takes this route, including many of my own attempts at humour. But this fic manages to achieve a much wittier form of humour that doesn't exaggerate situations or stretch realistic. The characters just say the right things at the right times to make us laugh, with dry observations on events, understated put-downs, surprising honesty and bluntness, etc.

Aside from the interactions with Jasmine's old friends, my only real complain about the fic is the magic, which I feel lacks the HP charm, drifting instead towards a more Dungeons and Dragons type feel. Jasmine and Merlin's powers were just too "big" in terms of scale, too flashy compared to the relatively subtle nature of powerful HP magic. It also lacks the eccentric charm of the HP magic system, where beetles are easy to transfigure into buttons because their names are similar.

Nonetheless, a hugely enjoyable fic.

*** It's been quite a while since I read the parts you're talking about, but I feel like she's been building up this moment in her mind for /thousands of years/, but when it finally comes she has no idea how to act around or relate to these people who once were so important to her and after thousands of years she's not used to being unsure of herself.

**** I think this is how Jasmine justified her reactions and interactions, but I felt like this was a point the author pushed and pushed in an unconvincing way. Most of the historic parts of the story were really good a showing us how and why Jasmine was reacting. But I felt the author took a "telling" tone for the present-day Ron/Hermione interactions that make them less than authentic for me.

** A lot of people have commented on things that I also found wonderful about this fic - the Myrddin arc, the handling of Dumbledore, etc - so I'll keep my comments there to a minimum.

Certain smaller things I liked were how Jasmine let her basis in modern times influence her actions all through history. I love the idea of her missing being able to drink tea, and developing herbs and leave to steep 1000s of years before the real discovery of tea. I love how she kept The Hovel clean per modern standards. I enjoyed the idea of her memories of modern magic guiding her as she broke the magics down in order to understand and teach them.

My hope for the fic is that she is finally able to age, now that she's back in her own time. I think she deserves to be reunited with Myrddin.

** I am loving "A Long Journey Home". I don't read femHarry or immortalHarry as I feel that it is stretching the source material too far - even for fanfiction - but this has opened my mind. The author has a way with words that is better than some hardbook authors out there. I'm rooting for Jasmine Potter, hope this story doesn't get abandoned.

** This actually wasn't one of my favorites. All the "in the past" parts were great- which, to be fair, is like 90%+ of the fic. But all the parts where this 3000+ year old woman is hanging out with her mostly-forgotten friends that she knew for a few years in childhood just feel completely off to me. I just keep expecting there to be some dissonance where Jasmine realizes that "oh yeah, I'm not an 18-year-old anymore, and don't really know how to relate to my former friends because I'm an entirely different person now", but it never comes. She reacts just the same as she would if she had just gone on a 5-year trip. I wouldn't expect an 80-year-old to easily slot back into the lives if her 18-year-old friends, so why would a 3000-year-old?

Also, as much as I love the backstory, I really want to see the "now what". For her entire lifespan (-18 years) she can't really do anything super-crazy, because she can't affect the timeline beyond just existing and getting steered by fate into almost-forgotten history. But now, she's caught up, so she can do whatever she wants- so what does she want to do?

It's been a while since I read it, but I didn't get that at all. To me the disconnect seemed obvious and that she was having a hard time playing the part of the person they knew.

** Everyone seems to enjoy this story, but personally I couldn't get into it. It is also quite.. boring. And slow.

It was very hard to get into, and while it had a great plot/hook, I feel like it didn't utilize it as well as it could have.

If I were to review it unbiasedly, I'd probably give it a 3/5. The writing is solid, the plot is original and the characters are handled well. However, its incredibly slow, overly angsty and.. nothing happens. The future parts are just.. droll.

** I didn't like it. It's hard to put my finger on why I didn't. It seems like a wish fulfillment story with a Mary Sue lead. Powerful, ancient, created the magical world, rich as hell, cultured, clever, beautiful. I don't think the author created a suitable disconnect between Jasmine and her childhood friends. I don't "buy" Jasmine's feelings of being out of place and out of time.

It would have been much more interesting to me, if Jasmine lived a long life, but not so long that she ever made it back to her childhood years.

** I have great affection for this story, but it has a rough start. The first chapter suffers from changes of perspective, indistinct dialog cues and a sort of 'promise one thing- deliver another' let-down. It kicks off in Indiana Jones mode but the story isn't about plot developments and action-suspense shenanigans. It's a story exploring character in the extraordinary situation of being the cause of history while trying to live life out of the way of events until she can return to her starting point.

I love the character, I love the 'history' despite disruptive anachronisms. My main criticisms would be:

- that the writer has a gift for plot situations but doesn't do much more than tempt us about adventures not told; and

- that there isn't more of it.

** This particular fic holds a special spot for me. Reading this fic, and enjoying the masterfully woven tale of Myrddin that Rakeesh has written, spurred me on to write some original fiction of my own. As a result, I've read this fic numerous times and it is my top five of all fanfiction, period.

That said, it has it's issues, and I am of the opinion that most of the story that takes place in the 'present day' is rather dull and uninteresting beyond the examination in character development and psychology that we are treated to.

However, most of the complaints I've seen are directed towards the first two chapters and chapter nine. At first glance and without the context of the rest of the story, the initial chapters depict a character that is a common cliche in the fandom: Arrogant, self-possessed and nearly godlike in power. I genuinely dislike reading fics where this trope is present without a logical reason and I fully understand why this initial chapter puts people off.

That said, I'm not sure anyone has tried this, but read the story in actual chronological order. Ignoring the new piece that takes place in Mesopotamia, start with the Merlin arc and go forward. When read like this, the Jasmine we see in chapter one is a logical extension of everything that came before. She is terrified that everything she believed about who she was and the people she has idealized will turn out to be false, and covers that with an arrogance and self possession that was apparently developed over thousands of years in the Egyptian court.

All analysis aside, still a 5/5 for me.

But on the other hand it has sort of seperate arcs or smaller stories so you still get satisfaction even if the fic itself isn't finished yet. Actually this one inspired me to begin writing my similar story. It's only 5k until one and that's only the intro, but still :D

** Genuinely a brilliant fic. The way that Harry Potter canon is slotted into Arthurian legend is nothing short of fantastic (I think there was a parallel drawn between Uther Pendragon's use of "Polyjuice" and Merope Gaunt's use of love potion, although I'll have to reread it to verify) and it certainly has a great deal of potential for more. The modern day sections, I admit, I skimmed a little- not that they weren't well-written, but they lacked the ingenuity of the past sections. Curse those sporadic updates!
