Looking for a fic might not have been truly great but I found it quite good.

Unfortunately the detail I remember most clearly is that Harry decided to go travelling during the summer and got into trouble (as usual) so that he ended up late back to hogwarts (as in he got back just in time for christmas I think, not sure of the date he got back but it was very late) and he learned a lot of stuff, magical and non-magical while away.
