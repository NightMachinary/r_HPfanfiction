So ..basically Master of death Harry goes to marauders era PROBABLY teaches convinces Dumbledore to be pro active the most distinct part of the fabrication I remember is Harry vs Dumbledore training duel I guess NOTE: NOT AS ENEMIES . Where he basically tells the elder wand to not change allegiance if he won the duel.

Can't find it. Saw many Harry time travels back to marauders but no MOD Harry
