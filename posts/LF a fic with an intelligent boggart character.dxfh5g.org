:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A few years ago, I read a fic that had one of those mysterious and powerful mentor characters helping Harry. I don't remember much else (and to be honest, I'm not 100% sure it was about Harry), but at the end, this character revealed that they were once a boggart, but had been exposed to someone whose greatest fear was a boggart permanently gaining sentience and magical power, which was why they could do things other wizards couldn't. Sadly, I can't remember enough to Google it. Does it sound familiar to anyone?


** The Parselmouth of Gryffindor linkffn(12682621) has an intelligent boggart, but I don't think it is what you are looking for.

*** No, I'm definitely thinking of an older fic. 2015 at the latest and probably before 2013 when I first got into fanfic.

Interesting, though. I never managed to get very far into this story.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth and arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this. ON HIATUS

** Okay, I'm pretty late coming back to this, but I did find the story. It's called /Siren/, linkffn(8414430). It's a Hermione time travel story facilitated by the former Boggart (revealed at the beginning, not the end).

  Hermione has traveled back to the end of 2nd year to change to past and save lives. Certain Weasley and Dumbledore bashing. Response to VSEWHGHP Harry/Hermione Challenge. Harry/Hermione Sirius/OC(flirting only) Neville/Luna. This story has been ABANDONED but a full plot summary of what would have happened is in the final Chapter. Sorry for any disappointment or confusion caused.
