Hello!

I am looking for fanfics for Snape and Hermione.

-Longer fics

-Slow burn

-Angst

-Snape stays true to his character (I dont like nice/lovey Snape)

**If you have ANY Snamoine fanfic that does not have a "happy ending," I want it! Please :)

To have an idea of what I like, here are some I LOVED reading.

-Tattered Man

-When a Lioness Fights

-Camerado

-Give You All My Futures

-The Devils Tears

For the people who want to comment because they are upset that im on this ship; I like what I like and you could have just kept scrolling.
