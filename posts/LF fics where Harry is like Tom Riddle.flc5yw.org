I would like to see Harry being ruthless and smart, I dont really care what house he's in or what the pairing is (though I would prefer Slytherin as his house I won't compain.) All recs are appreciated, thanks in advance

Edit - I've read the souls touch au and rise of a dark lord.

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore watched two visionaries start as driven, powerful, brilliant young men, and become monsters. He has no heir, no protege of equal power to step in should another one rise, and he is old. So when he hears of a Chosen One with power the Dark Lord knows not, he thinks maybe he doesn't want this boy prophesied to defeat Lord Voldemort to grow up in the Wizarding world. He thinks of the bonds of family, and the opportunity he has to shape his world's politics, and of a corrupt magical elite who've signed on with two Dark Lords over hatred of Muggles. He thinks Harry Potter should grow up loved by his family, and Voldemort be destroyed so there is no need for Harry to ever realize his power, and he acts to make both of those things happen. Because he's Dumbledore and what he wants, he gets. Usually. When you dabble with improvised ritual magic, you should be aware there might be unforeseen consequences. For example: souls touch.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/][A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned]]

500k+ words, 103 chapters, complete.

Summary: /"The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU."/

After nine years reading fanfiction, this remains to this day my favourite fanfic of all time.
