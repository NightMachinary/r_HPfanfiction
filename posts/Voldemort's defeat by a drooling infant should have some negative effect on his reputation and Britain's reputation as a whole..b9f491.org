Look at the epic battle between Grindelwald and Dumbledore to explain the former's defeat then look at how Voldemort was originally defeated. It should have had some effect on how people view him and British wizards in general, especially outside of Wizarding Britain. I still find the whole idea hilarious without looking at the context of Lily's protection. The most powerful British Dark Lord in centuries is defeated by a toddler. It's why I'm a bit confused when I see fics set outside of Britain where everyone thinks of Voldemort with the same level of fear as Grindelwald. He was a mostly British problem and was ended in such an embarrassing way and yet he can call on aid across all of Europe. We as the readers know he's powerful, but all the people outside of Britain would see a failure that couldn't even kill a child. What do you think?


** That was a massive outlier to everyone, and no (smart) people thought less of Voldemort for it.

It's pretty obvious to Wizarding Britain that Voldemort could have killed almost any of them if he so wished, except Dumbledore. He was almost certainly well known globally, and would have become a major worldwide problem of Dumbledore had died (e.g. from Voldemort, or old age).

Nobody doubted Voldemort's power or skills, so when they heard that he had been defeated by a toddler, they instead assumed that this toddler was a mega powerful Mary Sue. They thought of Harry as the Boy who Lived, remembered him for over a decade despite him not appearing once during that time, and thought that he was somehow special.

Further reinforced when the truth of the graveyard and later Ministry came out. There's something special about this kid. He survived Voldemort as a toddler and then again as a teenager--twice!

***** Church of Potter has two factions: one which venerates the Holy Harry and defends "the truth" with the fierceness of 12 inquisitions and one which believes basically the same, except that the Holy Harry still lives to this day since 5* killing curses couldn't kill him. The second group is a small fringe group that is looked upon poorly by the majority of people.

Muggleborns are still treated like crap because they haven't grown up with the Potter mythos and look upon it with skepticism. Ironic.

*Yeah they got it wrong. Fanatics. Go figure.

/Edit:/ Plot twist: Immortal Harry in disguise is the biggest public opponent of the fringe Harry Lives! group and writes frequent op-eds in the /Prophet/ and makes appearances on the Wireless denouncing them. Double plot twist: He's also the fringe group's biggest financial backer. Because if you're immortal, you get your kicks wherever you can.

No way. Ron would definitely be remembered as some sort of royalty due to the "Weasly is our king" song. Sort of like the three wise men to Jesus.

******* Triple plot twist: in the story, no one ever mentioned the year. It's only 2070. Harry isn't immortal, he's just still alive. He's only 89 years old, which isn't that old for wizards. He faked his death somewhere around 2050 because no one would leave him alone.

** I mean... “powerful lord of darkness set low by an innocent babe” is a pretty common narrative I think? In a world like Harry Potter, where magic often does follow fairly intuitive patterns, I could absolutely see it being something that comes off as fairly believable.

** If the fanon descriptions of dark magic are accurate regarding "Fiendfyre can consume the caster." and "Don't do dark arts, because a bad ritual can kill you". And just in general "If you're not protected by plot armor, don't do dark arts"... then the most likely reason for Voldemort's first downfall is that he tried a dark spell and it killed him.

Harry shouldn't be hailed as a hero, just the last intended victim before Voldemort's Dark Arts caught up with him.

I would still be afraid of him if I thought he had a backup plan. As in, "Voldemort is willing to use Dark Arts which could kill him because he can't truly die." would be terrifying.

Otherwise, I'd probably live my life pretty normally and caution my children not to do Dark Arts, because even strong scary wizards like Voldemort can foul them up in the end.

  A roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moment's warning. He turned and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle towards them.

  "Like it hot, scum?" roared Crabbe as he ran.

  But he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames of abnormal size were pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their touch.

*** The thing is, dark magic are not "so" dangerous. Of course, it is a magic solely mad for combat and destruction and should not be used in a civilized place (as well as the little "corruption" problem it may create), but a wizard dying because he failed a spell in not reserved to the Dark Art.

In canon, we see a girl spend weeks in the infirmary because she tried to charm her pimps away, we hear story about how some witches and wizards failed to control their transfiguration into animal and loose all human feelings and memories, dying as beats, St Mungos has a special ward for spell accident.

Magic is dangerous, the dark art a little more so but in the end, but in the end, the only limitation of a spell caster is its talent and the way he control its spells.

I also feel like the reason behind Voldemort's fear wasn't just his strength but because the war was a terrorist war not a full blown one. Voldemort and other death eaters could appear anywhere kill or destroy anything they could then leave.

** Voldemort was so scary that people were too afraid to say his name. Downplaying him for losing to Harry would be downplaying the person that killed several of your friends and family. You don't downplay someone like that. Also, surviving the killing curse was a never before seen feat of magic so you can't blame Voldemort for that.

I agree that Voldemort is a very British problems though. The KKK was probably really scary in the 1920s, but I don't think people in Estonia thought much about them at all.
