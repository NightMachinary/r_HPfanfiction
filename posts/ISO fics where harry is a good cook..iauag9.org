Any premise or length is ok as long as it is decently well written, and his being a good cook isnt just one line but actually somewhat relevant to the story.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
