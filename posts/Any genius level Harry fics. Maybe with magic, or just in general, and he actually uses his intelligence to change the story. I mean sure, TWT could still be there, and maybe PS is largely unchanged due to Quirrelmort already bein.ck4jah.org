** I can't remember if this is the name, but you might enjoy linkffn (in the mind of a scientist). Super genius, mad scientist Harry who's fairly OP and I think well written. That first story is just Harry Potter. Then there's Madness at the Gate, a sequel crossover with that Harry and Stargate. Then a third crossover called Madness Effect, which is a Mass Effect crossover.

It's also full of references to a whole lot of other sci-fi and fantasy books, which are fun little Easter eggs, but you don't have to get all the references to enjoy it.

Many readers hate this Harry because he's an insufferable know-it-all, and consider him a ridiculously overpowered author insert, but he's written like that intentionally. Even Hermione considers him an insufferable know-it-all. It's all from his POV, and he's very overconfident, so all we directly see is how great he thinks he is, but his flaws lead him to make some really major mistakes.

References could be annoying, though. When you don't understand a reference, you might keep worndering what it could mean because you cannot judge whether it's safe to skip or it's something that will be relevant/explained later in the story.

**** HPMoR is the biggest genius!Harry story of them all. It's very controversial because it does some things /really/ good and completely fails at other aspects (realistic characters). Basically, Harry is a super genius who teaches genetics to Malfoy, discovers breakthroughs in Transfiguration and chemistry with Hermione, invents a rocket powered broom on the fly while adventuring with Quirrel and so on. There's lots of science, creative plot and ridiculous humor, but characters are somewhat unrealistic (11 year olds messing around with upper level magic) because it's all in first year because Quirrel is a really important character. There's also a lot of interesting philosophy, but many who fundamentally disagree with the author's views really hate the story because of it. Keep in mind that the first few chapters are /very/ different from the rest.

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.

**** Harry "My cock is huge" Potter pretty much starts banging anything that moves once he hits like 12 in this fic, although the author tries to get around it using some weird rune powered puberty stuff.

It's a pretty blatant self insert that isn't the worst thing ever until the author starts dropping in his super racist views on other nationalities using Harry as a mouthpiece, then it goes into cringy territory pretty quick.
