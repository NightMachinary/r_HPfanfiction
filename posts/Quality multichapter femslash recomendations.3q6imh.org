  Little by little, in her own unusual way, Luna Lovegood begins to romance Hermione Granger.

  #+begin_example
      The title of this fic comes from the song lyrics of Fly Me Away by Goldfrapp\. Specifically the lyric, "The crazy little things that you do are magical\." Something that I think perfectly suits Luna\. The band itself has a very ethereal and mysterious quality that reminds me of Luna\.

  Curiosity killed the cat, they say. But satisfaction brought it back. A few years after the war Hermione is a widely respected academic about to start her latest research project. To see its completion, however, she will truly have to venture into the unknown. Cissy/Hermione pairing in due time. Might turn M in later chapters.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

  Lily Luna Potter years 3-7. Why is she stuck with a Little Malfoy tag-along? What do the coming years hold for them and everyone else? How will they change and grow, what will happen as they do, & who will end up with whom? Eventual femslash. Multiple pairings. Lily/OC. Also stars Scorpius Malfoy's OC little sister. Not T until Chap 29, really not until Chap 32 & nothing too major.

Bellamione done right. Mainly because it's an AU where Bellatrix isn't an insane Death Eater, that usually helps.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.
