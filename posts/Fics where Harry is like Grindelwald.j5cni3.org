We've all seen the typical fics where Harry has the exact same personality as Tom Riddle and Dumbledore almost had a heart attack the first time he met him (the plot from there boils down to: the hat sends him to Slytherin before touching his head, he becomes head of Slytherin in two days, forms his own cult, rules the world, etc). I say enough, instead of reading about a little psychopath (that any person, animal, or entity within two miles would realize he just wants to set the world on fire), I want to read about a charismatic and manipulative leader, who can care about people, who feels empathy and love for others, but who is willing to make great sacrifices for his cause (and please, make it a meaningful cause; that his very existence does not contradict each of his beliefs).

In hindsight, I want a Harry who is much more like Grindelwald, that no one can tell that something is wrong with him until it all explodes in their faces. I'd also like to see Dumbledore's reaction to seeing that the story essentially repeated itself (which already happens in the Tom Riddle!Harry fics, but in this case it would have much more force, because Grindelwald and the war against him were much more personal to Albus, not to mention that, from what can be seen, Grindelwald was a much greater threat than Voldemort).


** i would love to read a story where he is very aware of what would happen if the muggles discovered wizards and he is full for being the one who struck first so that he and his friends are safe from the percived threat

****** It's stupid to be that concerned over spoiler tags, if you're going to be that paranoid... might as well not be on the internet at all. Or alternatively, do like what I did below, using a simple cypher. /Because if you know it's about an manga/anime, and theres an manga/anime you're trying to stay spoiler free, if you're stupid enough to decode a cypher that is also in spoilers, it's on you./

I think even using a cypher is overkill, but eh... The amount of reddit users who're using applications that don't support Reddit's spoiler tags is minuscule, I guess someone could accidentally click on one, but still... There is the argument to make sure those who're using outdated apps remain spoiler free, but reddit isn't windows, if you're using something significantly outdated you should be fine with the fact that certain features aren't available to you, like spoiler tags, and in the process that you yourself might get spoiled.

Regardless, are you talking of nbg? (ROT13 - if needed, rot13.com) That's the closest I could think of that I know of. In which case, I guess... But other than the whole preemptive strike, I don't really see them being similar at all.

******* hmm, alright yeah. I suppose because the fandom is super notorious about spoilers and they get upset easily. I've already pmed everyone who's asked but, sure. I'm talking about the manga of =aot= . At the latest chapter that was released the synopsis that the op describes matches exactly with the current plot.

******** I guess, yeah. It's more of an opinion thing of mine. I suppose being more safe then sorry is good, but... eh... I feel at times it can be taken too far, but I guess if you don't take it far enough there are those who'll get rather... Vocal about it.

And yeah, that's what I was thinking of, but I don't feel they're exactly similar, while both are going for preemptive strikes, aot is focusing more on him doing it for freedom, while in the synopsis of op, it's for the defense of his friends, if that makes any sense.

I guess they're quite similar, when I think about it some more... It's just their motivation for doing it varies significantly, I think. For example, I think Harry in the story OP proposes would do everything he could to avoid the death of his friends, even if it goes against their will, but as you see in the latest chapter of AoT, Eren does not force his friends to follow along with his plan, granting them the freedom to choose whether to work with or against him, even though if they oppose him it could result in their deaths.

It has the plot that Harry goes Dark for a worthy cause - and he pretty much walks the thin line between revolutionary and serial killer. "More Grindelwald than Voldemort" is even a line of the fanfiction.\\
Only thing that doesn't fit your request: Dumbledore is dead already in that fic - it starts after Hogwarts. But he talks with Albus' portrait.

**** [[/u/Katherien0Corazon][u/Katherien0Corazon]] Oh dear, I never saw the reply I got!

But: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3762636/1/The-Black-Heir][The Black Heir]] basically took over my life for a few intense days. It's Harry/Voldemort, and Harry/ a few others (but I found it believable and was actually secretly rooting for it). The writing is something you need to get a bit used to, but it's still quite amazing considering that English is like the author's 3rd language. I don't want to spoil it too much, but The Black Heir, at almost 900k, is only part 1. Harry is immensely powerful, pretty much on the same side as Voldemort in the sense that he wants the Dark to be back in its rightful place, not hidden. The author's world-building is honestly some next-level stuff; it just goes beyond what you might expect.

And Grindelwald has a prominent role in it, but a bit further in the story. Honestly, this fic just constantly surprised me with the plot twists and how well it was layered.

The second part is a WIP but already at 700k+ words, so you'll have lots and lots of reading pleasure.

---

Some of the other fics I've read that kinda matched your search are mostly on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]], which is truly a betch to find anything, really.

You might enjoy [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18316175][Son of Magic]] -- Harry/Tom Riddle - MoD Harry goes back in time to hopefully save the magical world from the muggles. He's super powerful and starts worming his way into politics early on to do it right. It's still a WIP but I'm soooo down for the intrigue.

Fair warning tho, this Harry is rather... apathetic. If his 'follower' cares, then he cares. But beyond that? Nope. Couldn't give a toss. He IS a lot closer to Grindelwald than Riddle at any rate.

Finally... lots of that author's stuff is great: Potter Rage, Choices and Princeps are three more series' that are worth checking out off the top of my head.

*** I don't know if you got my post right, but I'll explain it anyway. I do not want a Harry who is the reincarnation of Hitler, but one who has the same character and methodology of Grindelwald, but not necessarily the same cause. There are many ways to do this well without incurring fascist ideas, for example, there is The Sum of Their Parts, which shows revolutionary Harry's fight to demolish a ministry ruled by racism and corruption, all in order to create a better future for his godson. Or maybe, "With the Strength of Steel Wings" Which shows a Harry who wants to bring both worlds together, but has no desire to subjugate Muggles. Anyway, I would not mind reading a fic where he have the same ideas and intentions as Grindelwald, as long as it makes sense and is well written
