** I'm only a casual fan of Severitus because I'm not particularly interested in kidfic. But Snape is my favorite character precisely because he's an interesting mix of bitterness, grief, self-loathing, intelligence, emotional neglect, drama queening, courage, cruelty, guilt, and spite. He's the /last/ character in the wizarding world, after Voldemort, who should be a father. He hates kids. Evidence suggests he hated /being/ a kid. (Little did he know, life wouldn't improve with adulthood.) Teaching has cemented all his worst feelings about children because he's stuck with them underfoot most of the year, and the emotional claustrophobia at Hogwarts exacerbates his immaturity. He fulfills his promise to Dumbledore but feels no compunction about spreading the misery around. He will die for Harry if he has to, but he won't both to refrain from belittling, sabotaging, or threatening him.

Okay, now give this man a child. A child he never wanted. The very child who represents everything he lost, everything he never had, everything he fucked up in his own life. This is a /great/ premise for a fic, because by God Snape is not going to magically (well, unless you force a potion down his throat that changes his personality) stop hating Harry, and he's not going to suddenly find hidden wells of compassion and fatherly love deep down in his soul.

A good writer can make a fascinating story out of the development of their relationship, the coming to terms with reality, the difficulties it creates for Harry, the eventual grudging shifts in understanding. Plus I imagine Snape would be a possessive parent, with a sense of ownership and even more license to boss Harry around. But he'd also resent having to sacrifice something that 'belongs' to him for the wizarding world, even if it's something/someone he purports to hate. He might be less inclined to cooperate with Dumbledore. He might be furious at Harry's "saving people" thing.

Granted, a lot of writers prefer to be sentimental about the father/son bond, but Snape and Harry are both stubborn, sarcastic, emotionally deprived people in a terrible position, and exploring that, both on a character and plot level, makes a lot of sense to me. If you just want to see Harry as the triumphant hero, then you probably won't care. If you don't like Snape, it wouldn't appeal to you because the story is going to be loaded with Snape content.

But on a dramatic level - well, come on, this is the stuff of fiction. Of course people - people who already enjoy the characters - are going to find it compelling, and even emotionally cathartic. It may not be the kind of fic you want to read, and that's perfectly fine, but surely you can see why other readers might see it as catnip.

(I realize this is the exact opposite view to the one described by [[/u/4sleeveraincoat][u/4sleeveraincoat]]. It depends on how much you're willing to soften up Snape and whether or not you believe "arsehole" is an indelible mark of his personality. I'm in the latter camp, although I allow for varying degrees of arsehole behavior.)

*** I totally see where you're coming from and I like the development of the "eventual grudging shifts of understanding", as you put it so well. I don't mind seeing either (or both) side softening slightly, but the way their dynamic shifts as they learn about each other is part of what I find interesting. I don't think either side has to be changed completely to work; in fact I find a total 180 on either side to be wildly unrealistic. But I also love the moments where Snape realizes that Harry might be an unrepentant rule breaker for a good cause, but damn it he is Snape's unrepentant rule breaker for a good cause and that does eventually mean something to him. Conversely, Snape might be an utter berk, but he is Harry's utter berk, because family, real family,vis important. And the best Severitus stories make them see that about each other without completely changing their personalities, and it's great.

Yes, this is what draws me to the Severitus stories I do read. There's also the fact that, as far as we know, no one but Lily ever loved Snape. If Harry, even under duress, starts to care, it contains a potential seed of change. Snape's like a bristling, vicious feral cat who associates an outstretched hand with poison bait or a violent fist and is suspicious of affection. But he might eventually be coaxed into accepting a truce. I think the shift would come once he stopped seeing James in Harry and truly understood that Harry was a part of himself (still dicey, since Snape does after all hate himself, too).

Anyway, I'm with you 100%, and I can see Snape become the sort of horrible, controlling parent who's so determined to prevent Harry from making the same mistakes he did (without realizing that Harry's never, ever going to fall into the pureblood and Dark Arts trap) that they'd fight constantly just so Harry can have a life without Snape criticizing every move he makes. Also, I can imagine Snape freaking out eventually over the possibility of Harry being hurt. Snape's never had much in his life, and if he ever did accept Harry as his son, I can see him getting protective to the point of obsession. Because he knows what it's like to lose the most important person in his life, and by now obsessiveness is second nature to him.

** For me these stories, when well-written, are a very good look into a very painful place called "what might've been." There are so many similarities between Harry and Severus that, without all the tears of hold grudges and bitterness, the pair could have been so very good for each other. We never get to explore it in canon because (regardless of the eleven-year-old boy's reaction) Snape's initial behavior toward young Harry meant they would never see eye to eye. A well-written Severitus means we get to see how both of them might have been able to flourish with some sort of strong and potentially unconditional support.

** In the words of Tolstoy, /All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way/.

Which is to say, terrible people and complicated relationships can make for compelling stories. In the case of Severitus, taking two characters who genuinely despise each other and forcing them into a situation where they're forced to reevaluate the other is an interesting starting point. Especially since, while Harry's feelings are completely understandable, Snape's are almost entirely based on James and his own bitterness.

** I agree with the other commenters. A couple more points to add:

Canonically, Harry was so desperate to escape from the Dursleys, he latched on to Sirius Black almost immediately - and Black was a near-stranger. Snape was just as good of a friend to Lily for many years as Black was to James Potter, so it could very easily be flipped if Harry found out that Snape was his mother's childhood best friend.

And the same goes for Snape - if he sees more of Lily in Harry, then he could see the boy as his last connection to his friend, and Lily's legacy. And I'm also persuaded by some fics that have Snape being a good Dad to Harry out of pure spite to James, like making Harry "his" son is the ultimate winning move over James.

*** I agree with you on everything here. They have a lot to offer each other, and it's so interesting to watch them come to an understanding, and Snape realizing just how much more like Lily than James Harry is. It's especially interesting when the premise is set after fifth year, when Harry is grieving over Sirius and in desperate need of an anchor. Got any recommendations? I'm always looking for new fics to read. Thank you!

** I really like Severitus/mentor/guardian fics not because I think Snape is a great guy or would make a good parent- canonically, he's terrible and abusive. But I really love to see how good writers manage to subtly change and develop his character realistically as a result of different circumstances, making him into a better person, and even a decent parent, while retaining his true character. Not many fics get it right, but the ones that do are totally worth the read, at least to me.

*** Yes, this is a huge selling point for me; realistic character growth. We don't see a lot of that for Snape in canon. By the time of the story he's so set in his ways that it would take divine intervention to change him. He has no interest. But give Severus Snape a real, honest chance to have something better out of life? Something that doesn't come with the attached strings of a sadistic madman or a well-intentioned but imperfect chessmaster? I think if he really understood what he could have had, he would move mountains to achieve it. Just look at what he was willing to do to keep Lily's boy alive DESPITE a petty, bitter grudge against a dead man.

** You might as well as the question: Why do people like certain pairings? Why do some people prefer to read Harry/Ginny over Ginny/Draco or Harry/Hermione?

The answer is easy - people have different outlooks on love and romance. I once read a brilliant essay on the topic on LJ, I wish I had saved it. The one thing that stuck with me is that those who like Harry/Draco (and Draco/Ginny) are hopelessly romantic with a strong cynical side. Thin line between love and hate and all that shit.

Why is this relevant? I've found that there is a significant overlap between those who read (and write) Severitus fics between the demographic that likes Harry/Snape and Harry/Draco fics. My best guess at the reason is the above mentioned "hopelessly romantic with a strong dose of cynicism" unites these people.

*** I asked about Severitus and not the others because I wanted answers specific to Severitus. I'm not really interested in the psychological reasons behind why people like certain pairings, I am interested in the surface level reasons that Severitus appeals to certain people. Your comment was very interesting though, and I do know that peoples tendencies and personalities are reflected in their romantic preferences.

Also, I have to point out, the two characters you mentioned- Draco and Snape; both of the, are characters that were originally "bad" and then redeemed. Isn't it possible that some people, maybe those who have also made a huge mistake in life or those pressured by their parents, relate to them, and then use pairings to redeem them further. I'm not saying that they don't believe there was any romantic potential between them, just that this might have been part of the reason. When a regular person, who doesn't ship them, reads HP, they don't see any clues for HP/SS. It's just not there. I suppose you could say that Harry's hate for Draco was fueled by a burning love, and it's easy to fall into the Drarry FanArt section, but Draco and Ginny never even interacted! I guess you could also just see two people with two very different sets of traits, think, hey, you would do well together, and write about them....

My point is that maybe it's not "hopelessly romantic with a dose of cynicism, or at the very least, maybe there's more than that: maybe it's the redemption arc the unites them.

I'd love to read the article though, your explanation was fascinating.

** Movies, I think. That's the best guess I have.

Or that to some, Snape was the "Nice Guy" who truly loved Lily, and James was the douchebag who got the girl because girls choose douchebags. But then, she really loved Snape and bla bla bla.
