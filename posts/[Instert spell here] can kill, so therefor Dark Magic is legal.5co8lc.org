This has always annoyed me.

The argument "This spell can kill just as easily as Dark Magic, so magic shouldn't be dark." is so utterly stupid it makes me want to hit something.

Now, here me out before you crucify me.

The argument is literally the same argument as "A screwdriver can kill, so let's make machine guns legal."

Just because something can kill doesn't make it legal. Dark Magic, like a machine gun, is made specifically to kill. "Light magic" is made specifically for a purpose without the death of others in mind, like a screwdriver.


** The best explanation why dark magic shouldn't be used under any circumstances that I found is that it makes you used to very dark emotions in order to be cast properly. For example, you need to really want to hurt a person to cast a successful Cruciatus, and it can't be righteous anger (as evidenced by OotP when Harry wanted to Crucio Bella). Regularly invoking such dark emotions to use dark magic makes you desensitized to other people's hurts. And that's literally the definition of corrupting your own soul.

Tripping jinks can kill a person, if they stay at the top of the stairs, but the main intention behind the casting would be "to trip" (as well as to kill probably, but it won't help to cast the spell). Therefore people can safely use it for fun in non-lethal circumstances.

That is to say, the only times I've seen this justification in fanfiction, it was used by Voldemort to make Harry go dark and join his side. It is a flimsy defence, but little kids can be impressionable, especially those who don't know a lot about magic or never thought about how different emotions would affect a person, so can't recognize it as a lie.

It can be a good argument if you are trying to convince an 11-year old, but not an older person.

No one is disputing that those three curses constitute a grouping known as "the unforgiveable curses". The issue in question is what the legal status of unforgiveable curses is. And the only information on that legal status is apparently that use on a human is illegal.

  It isn't stated, but I think there is plenty to suggest it. We only know of three spells that are illegal, but they aren't just illegal they have a special classification. With there being precedent for banning magic I doubt they'd stop at 3 spells when we know things like fiendfyre exist.

It's never stated in the books but I would assume (and I have no evidence to the contrary) that killing with anything would be a life sentece, but casting Avada Kedavra literally can't be used for anything else (on a human anyway), so it's taken as the same as if you succeeded.

#+end_quote

The Cruciatus disables one person for the duration of the casting. It goes through all shields. That is a valuable spell to have on hand in a combat situation, especially in groups: the first person uses the Cruciatus to break the person's shields, and the second uses a stunner to disable them. It should be an option whenever you have a combatant that you might need to capture alive, and you should by default want to capture all combatants alive.

I would be much happier with Aurors who painfully disable combative people than Aurors who kill them. For one thing, if the people they use those spells on live through it, they can testify in court about what happened, so if Aurors overreach, there's a better chance they'll be caught and punished.

So back to the case at hand, Draco is panicking about his service to the Dark Lord -- certain that he'd fail, certain that the Dark Lord would kill him. For a hero, this would have been a perfect time to extend an offer of protection. Harry attacks Draco instead. Draco attempts a nonlethal spell, albeit a highly illegal one. Harry responds with a spell whose function he doesn't know and whose effect would have been lethal had Severus Snape not been on hand to counter it.

They should probably both have been expelled. I'm not sure I would trust someone with magic if they're testing out unknown spells on live humans, and had Draco completed his incantation, the law says he would have gotten a life sentence to Azkaban.

But Draco's response makes sense in context, and it's not a context of "Draco is e-ville!" It's not a /smart/ response, granted, but he was panicking.

As for the gun analogy -- wands are not like guns. Wands can do almost anything. They can block spells. They can create water. They can cause nuisance effects on other students. A person with a wand looking at you in school is nowhere near as threatening as a person with a gun looking at you in school. If you shot first, you would be attacking another student unprovoked.

I mean, in order to know whether “Light” magic is actually a thing, we'd have to know what is the exact way of classifying a spell as “Dark”, or as a hex, jinx, curse, charm, or whatever. Because it may be that the answer lie there, or it may be that there is no answer whatsoever.

I mean, we know that the classification is not based exclusively on the feelings required to cast, as Sectumsempra does not seem to have that component and yet it's dark as ... something dark.

**** And as for canon, yes for the latter, a tentative yes for the former although people generally don't use the word “Light” to talk about them.

Honestly though, I'm of the belief that for as long as it's consistent and makes sense within the story, any author is free to classify spells however they want; just don't aspire to canon-compliance if you do and it's all fine. Because with much of the lore of the HP world being based on the fact that there's a gaping hole that anyone chooses to fill in a way that makes sense for them, well, AU is probably the way to go (and it is easier to avoid repeating the stations of the canon verbatim if you go AU, since you can instead focus on the different mechanics of magic).

** This reminds me of Harry in my dark Harry fic. He initially jumped on the wagon that anything could kill and therefore Dark Magic is a farce, but he's growing now. (he's pretty much talking about the unforgivables, but same deal) In the future, he's gonna explain it like this:

“Studying and performing the Dark Arts is borderline illegal. Killing with a dark curse or a ‘light' curse has the same effect, but the ‘light' curse could have consequences that we don't see. Maybe it was a Cutting Curse gone astray, maybe it was self-defence. In order to cast the Dark Arts, you have to hate. If I want to kill you, I want to envision you dead -- I have to want to dance on your grave after digging it up and defiling it. Do you understand my point? Death by the Dark Arts instantly convicts you because you cannot fake hatred. In order to cast the Imperius Curse, you must want to control your victim, make them submit to you. To cast the Cruciatus Curse, you must want them to suffer, to scream, and thrash about. To cast the Killing Curse, you must want them dead. None of this can be done half-assed. You must want. Them. Dead.”

  The argument is literally the same argument as "A screwdriver can kill, so let's make machine guns legal."
#+end_quote

Actually, the argument is "Why does it matter if someone was killed by a screwdriver or by a machine gun?". The end result is the same. Similarly, why would it make a difference is someone was murdered by being stabbed with a pen or by being stabbed with a knife? Murder is murder, after all. *The fanfiction argument of "X can kill, so Dark Magic is legal" is so common because its objectively true within canon in literally any situation that doesn't involve the Unforgivables.*

Whether a murder was committed by Fiendfyre or by Incendio is irrelevant. Whether it was Sectumsempra or Diffindo is irrelevant. Whether it is Stupefy or the purple spell Dolohov used in OOTP on Hermione is irrelevant. In canon, all that matters is the end result (the Unforgivable Curses are an exception to the rule). We even see this when Hermione reminds Harry and Ron (and the reader) that Levicorpus was used in GoF to humiliate and horrify muggles. The fact that Levicorpus can be used benevolently doesn't change the fact that the Death Eaters used it maliciously. Scourgify being a regular cleaning spell doesn't change the fact that it was used maliciously against Snape in SWM. Petrificus Totalus (Full Body-Bind Curse) is considered a curse (a term reserved for the worst types of Dark Magic, by JKR's own words), yet when Hermione used it in PS it isn't considered a dark spell but when Draco used it in HBP it is used maliciously. The Ministry uses Obliviate to uphold the Statute of Secrecy yet it doesn't change the fact that Lockhart used it to commit fraud and almost used maliciously against Harry and Ron. If Voldemort killed people using Stupefy (Madam Pomprey was surprised McGonagall was still alive after being hit with several Stupefy so we know it can kill if enough are used or if one Stupefy is strong enough) instead of the Killing Curse, it wouldn't make the murders any less dark.

In fact, the only reason that the three Unforgivable Curses are considered Unforgivable is because they are the ONLY Dark Magic that is outright illegal to use against a human being regardless of the context. There are only three Unforgivable Curses because there are only three spells that are illegal. Fiendfyre and Sectumsempra are not illegal because they are not Unforgivable. Committing murder with Fiendfyre and Sectumsempra is illegal because murder is illegal (and is easily the worst crime both in the HP verse and in reality). If Incendio and Diffindo were used to commit those murders, it would be equally as illegal. Dark Magic is not illegal, however they are (usually) the most efficient tool to commit crimes.

The reason that the Unforgivable Curses are illegal to use against a human being (but are perfectly legal to use against non-humans of decent intelligence like Goblins and Centaurs, as well as being legal to use against any animal or inanimate object) is because in order to cast an Unforgivable, you cannot use righteous emotions. Crucio requires the caster to not just want to hurt the victim, but to take pleasure in making them suffer. Following how the Cruciatus Curse worked, Imperio would require the caster to want to brainwash/enslave the victim while Avada Kedavra would requires the caster to want to commit murder. You can't argue "self-defense" when an Unforgivable Curse is used against another person because in order to cast the spell, the caster must have wanted to torturing, enslaving, murder. You can't accidentally perform a successful casting of an Unforgivable Curse, just like you can't accidentally perform a Patronus.

Horcruxes aren't Unforgivable simply because they are ALREADY illegal. I must emphasize that Horcruxes being illegal is NOT the same as "some Dark Magic is illegal" because in order to even have a Horcrux, the creator needed to murder someone and intentionally create it. So making Horcruxes illegal is literally redundant since murder is already illegal. Murder being illegal basically makes Horcruxes illegal.

Fiendfyre and Sectumsempra aren't illegal because you can use them without requiring dark motives and they can be used in self-defense. Making Fiendfyre an Unforgivable but not every single other fire-based spell too would be hypocritical.

*TL;DR: The three Unforgivable Curses are the ONLY Dark Magic in canon that are illegal. Horcruxes aren't illegal for being Dark Magic, they are illegal because they cannot exist without the creator having murdered someone. All other Dark Magic in canon aside from the Unforgivables are perfectly legal to use in any non-criminal context (i.e. using Incendio to kill someone is murder and thus a crime, but using Incendio to light a fire to cook food is perfectly acceptable).*

*** I agree with everything except that murder is the worst crime... there are worse things than death. Its why I think the Imperious curse is worse than even the Cruciatus or AK. Imagine, I imperio you to rape your family. Then I imperio you to murder everyone who says a certain phrase. If I am caught, you will have to live with the fact that your family will never want to be around you. You will live with the fact that you murdered hundreds, if not thousands. All because my imperious was strong enough to force you do these things.

It is this I think of when I comprehend Dumbledore's words "There are things worse than death Tom" in OOTP. I can't think of anything worse than what I described... nothing.

** I'm still fond of the idea that magic is all about intent. in linkffn(Amalgum) Harry/Lockhart explain that you could fling an Avada Kedavra at someone, but if you don't want them dead, nothings gonna happen. Same with a Stupor, which can kill if you really want it to (as seen in the Battle of Hogwarts). I really liked that idea.

Therefore a classification for dark magic could be "magic that does nothing if one doesn't intent to do harm". Crucio works only if you hate enough. Being able to cast it effectively is defacto evidence of deep-rooted hatred for a person. One could go along that lane and say that being able to cast an Avada Kedavra (even if it misses) is defacto evidence of your wish to see the person dead.

On the same vein I once looked at Sectumsempra. What exactly is different with this spell compared to a normal Cutter? I fanon-ed that Snape made this curse specifically for his service under the Dark Lord. He didn't really have the wish to kill, so whenever he would try to do so with a Cutter or other spell, he would fail. He knew that and designed a spell that works without intent - which would make Sectumsempra from a simple Cutting Curse into a stroke of genius.

*** Sectumpsempra for me, was created because Snape wanted a spell that did not need intent but was empowered by it, something that could counter the transfiguration of James Potter, something that if enough intent was pushed into the spell, it would cut through anything. I have a scene in my work, that is Harry reading a journal from James who admits to firing Fiendfyre at Snape, who cuts it in half with a Sectumpsempra.

I think of the Sectumsempra as more than a cutter. In Naruto the Chidori when overcharged can pierce much of anything. Yet the Raikiri is still better. Why? its the same concept. Sectumsempra is capable of doing EVERYTHING that a cutter can, but does it better.

** Not really and yes, a knife can also kill - yet we allow those (everybody owns at least kitchen knives!)...so yeah, legalize machine guns (it's not like the US had more problems with crime when everybody could buy one!)!

Same for the magic, I can bash someone's head in by levitating them and smashing their head into stuff (don't tell me I don't have to hate them to do it because yes: You have to hate somebody to kill them...unless it's an accident or you are forced to do it!) like the floor or pointy objects....hell you can transfigure somebody into a fish and immobilize them (they would die from drying out and that's worse than Avada Kedavra!)...none of that is dark magic, so yeah legalize it (and teach it to everybody, so that knowing it doesn't give anybody an advantage!)
