Bonus points if it's some wise old master type of character who completely derails the canon plot by going off and doing their own thing.


** I'd never given much thought to how I would die /-/ though I'd had reason enough in the last few months. But even if I had, I would not have imagined it like this. I would not have imagined waking up afterward in this tiny (infinitesimal really), spider-filled cupboard. I would not have imagined the rainy, suburban neighborhood, neatly lined with brown brick houses and tile shingles. And I certainly would not have imagined the family that shared the space with me and seemed to, for some reason, very strongly dislike me.

I found myself cooking breakfast for them nonetheless, thinking about how Charlie never complained if I burned his bacon. And despite my inner confusion and turmoil, about three things I was absolutely certain.

1. I was inhabiting the body of an eleven year old British boy.
2. This was, amazingly, more strange than anything that had happened to me in Forks.
3. That Hufflepuff third year I met on the train to school was going to be unsurpassedly good looking in a few years.

** I think Pug of Midkemia would be cool, he was a very powerful two hundred+ year old magician who fought other magic users, aliens, demons and gods. I'd love to see him interact with the potterverse.

Also, I'd like to see Phantom Menace era Anakin take Harry's place, just to see if he'd mess up or not.

*** Now THIS is broom racing! I would looooove to see Anakin as Harry. But I think I would like it even more if it was post-Mustafar Anakin. I think he'd be convinced he was being forced (intentional word choice) to serve some sort of penance for what he had done: having to spend the next seven years with a bunch of younglings, being the chosen one again, trying and failing to get the rank of master from the order.

*** Well correct me if I'm wrong but the Potterverse power levels are fairly similar to someone who had mastered the ‚ÄúLesser Path‚Äù in the rift war saga

** I kind of want to see Bruce Banner as Harry.

On the other hand Aizawa? I can kinda see this. Hermione would be Midnight and Ron would be Present Mic.

On the note of Anime Old Coach Ukai? He would take no ones bullshit

** Albus knew something was wrong with the boy. Harry's demeanor was twisted from the very moment Hargid met up with him. Harry's hair had grown long, his skin pale, and his mouth silent. More importantly, Harry developed... odd capabilities. He seemed to apparate silently, often seen in the corner of one's eye yet never there when they turned to look. He somehow hid /inside the paintings/. Such a thing shouldn't be possible as even the people inside weren't living souls.

The worst part was that people started disappearing. Significant numbers of Slytherin House had vanished, its head of house included. The boy was immediately under Albus's unspoken scrutiny.

He went to interrogate Petunia for answers. The townspeople he met with said no one lived in that area for years, they'd all disappeared. Hagrid could be forgiven for forgetting such a detail if what he'd told Albus of his first meeting with the boy had any measure of truth. Albus knew then that he would not find the answers he was looking for, but he went to Petunia's house anyway. He wished he hadn't.

Albus immediately began searching for ways to either fix the boy or /deal with him/ before he became more of a problem. Two dark lords in a single lifetime was already far too many. The only fact about the boy he thought might be useful against him was the video tape he always had with him, but it seemed to be a red herring.

Albus finally decided the best he could do was confront the boy head-on. He grabbed the map that was confiscated from the Weasley twins and looked for the boy's name. Distressingly, Harry Potter was nowhere to be found; however, /most/ interesting was the fact that there were two names in his office. His own was obvious, but who on earth was Samara Morgan...
