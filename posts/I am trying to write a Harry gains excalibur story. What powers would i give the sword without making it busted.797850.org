So i want to write a harry potter fic where harry receives king arthurs sword, excalibur. What powers if any should i give the sword without being cliched or op?


** Does this make him the Once and Future King? If so you should definitely try to incorporate heavy Arthurian myth. Some powers to consider:

From the name /Caledfwlch/ (the Cornish/Welsh name for Excalibur), you get the translation of hard cleft, so the blade may be indestructible. The blade is said to cut iron or steel like wood, so it may be able to cut very easily through most anything, or perhaps everything. Or perhaps it is simply never dull, always wickedly sharp. From Wikipedia, they have a short section of the Mabinogion translated:

#+begin_quote
  Then they heard Cadwr Earl of Cornwall being summoned, and saw him rise with Arthur's sword in his hand, with a design of two chimeras on the golden hilt; when the sword was unsheathed what was seen from the mouths of the two chimeras was like two flames of fire, so dreadful that it was not easy for anyone to look. At that the host settled and the commotion subsided, and the earl returned to his tent.

  --- From The Mabinogion, translated by Jeffrey Gantz.
#+end_quote

This might establish an aura of fear or awe.

Other powers included preventing wounds of the scabbard-bearer (not the sword) from bleeding out, the sword itself blinding the wielder's foes, and perhaps any powers you may want to borrow from great swords of legend, including the similarly named, but probably not closely related, /Caladbolg/.

All of these powers are great, and a fair amount of them allow the wielder to contend with a variety of spells. An indestructible blade can be used to deflect or block many spells, including /Avada Kedavra/. A blade that can cut through anything makes a handy mage-, dragon-, or some other magical creature slayer. It can also destroy Horcruxes and perhaps can even cut right through magic, or perhaps just enchantments. An aura of fear or awe is good for inspiring followers, especially if he is to be king. The ability to not bleed out from wounds is remarkably useful for surviving many otherwise lethal spells, including the Entrail-Expelling curse. Blinding one's foes is extremely useful for preventing an enemy from successfully hitting you with most spells. For /Caladbolg's/ abilities, it was known for slaughtering entire armies and slicing off the tops of mountains, which is rather scary, since it suggests that the blade is able to cut extended from itself for perhaps a good hundred yards or more.

**** You might want to look at my comment again, for more information on how the various powers of Excalibur could be used (I updated). But for some more information, you might want to look into Arthurian myth, from the poetry of Lord Tennyson, to the various cycles of Arthurian literature, and perhaps almost required reading would be Geoffrey of Monmouth's the /History of the Kings of Britain/. Other than that, Arthurian romances are great for learning about the characters that made up his court and the Round-Table.

**** On top of what the other guy said, I suggest you have a listen to the Arthurian episodes of the Myths and Legends podcast for ideas about the general setting the sword comes from, without all the pointless guff in some of the tales (like seriously there's a lot of unecessary detail in some accounts because it was intended as historical fanfiction afaik)

** Null Magic - The sword is immune to magic that is not its own. No force shields are going to block this bad boy. Also good for beating down magically reinforced doors and intercepting projectile spells.

Self Maintenance - Excalibur is always sharp, shiny, and clean. If broken the blade will shatter into pieces that are relatively simple to place back together. Once all pieces are placed back together the sword will reform completely. When broken each piece seeks to rejoin the others and fate is manipulated in tiny but unceasing ways to see that the sword is eventually whole once again.

Aura of Authority - While wearing or wielding the sword people will unconsciously give proper respect to the wearer for any position or office he holds if said people are within the lands the position or office is held in. Only works when speaking on behalf of said office or position.

Just Cause - Anyone killed by Excalibur for a just cause will see their magics related to that cause die as well. I.E. if you curse the Queen and the King kills you for it the curse on the Queen will end. Also works for normally incurable magics such as lycanthropy.

** I don't know if you've read The Iron Druid series by Kevin Hearne, but there are a couple of faerie swords in that series. Wounds from one of them, Moralltach, are always fatal sort of like the basilisk venom-imbued Sword of Gryffindor. The other one, Fragarach, could pierce any armor. Those are both interesting abilities for the sword of a king or warlord to have. Compelling people in its presence to tell the truth could also come in handy as would glamour-dispelling.

*** Just adding onto this comment.

Fragarach can cut through absolutely anything with ease, yes, but there's more.

It gives its wielder some control over wind.

Last and most certainly not least, if the wielder holds Fragarach to the neck of someone, that person is immobilized and is compelled to speak the truth - this is completely irresistible.

** As fun as adapting myth to modern storytelling can be, I would avoid as much of the extreme powers others have listed here. Excalibur should be a powerful weapon, but don't give it absolute power over anything, or else the story becomes about the sword and not about the hero.

Awe-inducing effect? Absolutely. Able to cleave through armor, troll hide, even dragon scale - now that's something even a wizard can appreciate.

Able to force the truth from people? That's a power that destroys dramatic tension. I can believe someone would report that they felt incapable of lying with that thing held at their neck, but it wasn't a divine power of cleaving truth from lies; just the power of self-preservation overriding their sense of creativity.

Basically, make it worthy of the name without providing abilities beyond the needs of the story.

It can be done, if it compels truthfunless rather than the truth. The Wheel of Time does a good job of showing the difference between telling the truth and not lying.

You could easily rachet up the dramatic tension if Harry doesn't realize the difference and that the truth he heard was not necessarily the truth they said.
