So. Recently, I've realized that HPMOR seems to have a rather large hate base. Personally, I read it, I liked it, and rather enjoyed the musings of Harry himself. Why does people hate it so much?

Also, is this post Meta, or Discussion?


** Well

- the science is either wrong or explained in such a way as to be useless for anything except showing how smart the author is

- the author's arrogance bleeds into the character so much that people have started calling him Hariezer

- the author has no sense of comedy or pacing, and the story suffers greatly under family guy style jokes

- the magic system is shit

- characters are not characters; a teacher, scholar and academic is struck speechless by an eleven year old who hasn't cracked open his schoolbooks. It's the definition of the dunning-kruger effect.

- statements and actions don't matter; one character makes a rape threat, this is never brought up again

But I think the worst thing is that MoR does not contain actual rationality, or science. It contains a religious notion of their likeness - a worship of what they represent.

A truly rationally thinking person would not enter a world where the rules are different and attempt to work with the wrong set out of spite, for instance.

They would not lecture others on how smart they are, because that's completely useless in achieving anything.

They would not attempt to force magic into a system that it is clearly not meant to be contained within by fudging the variables like some game theory sensationalist - they would, you know, apply the scientific method; evidence, data, theories. Not rants about how the evidence contradicts what you thought you knew before. Because that makes you the exact opposite of a rational person - namely, a fool.

*** Harry's character I believe is not necessarily an actual scientist who uses the Scientific Method, he's just a very smart eleven year old who reads more than others do, he places a little much faith in the things he reads about, so he's confused when what he sees contradicts what he reads.

** I mean, I definately gave up reading before any plot happened. I think I got to like the 4/5th chapter before getting bored?

Maybe it's because I have a science degree and my career is in science? I started reading it going "hey this might be funny" since it combined two of my things, Potter and Physics. But it ended up just being really boring?

Partly because some of the justifications are... Not necessarily wrong but certainly flawed... Which makes it difficult for me to read. I just got mad at it. (and thats a personal problem from my history in Astrophysics, I get mad at basically every sci-fi movie now it's very annoying). Hearing people/books trying to explain metaphysical concepts to the general public will always be fustrating to a physicist because they're always wrong. Simply because it's impossible to be right as a layman doesn't have the knowledge to understand the truth. No fault to either party.

But also because it turns out I hate when you try to apply normal people logic to fantasy worlds. I read Fantasy to escape the logic I usually live in. So it didn't appeal to me.

I don't hate MoR. It's just not my thing but a lot of things aren't my thing. I get why people like it though it's funny in an obscure way.

That doesn't necessarily follow, you know. The writer is not the characters. If you examine the story closely, you'll find that it recognises that Harry is making mistakes, and those mistakes come back to haunt him.

My understanding is that Harry was supposed to simulate the author /as he was at a much younger age/, so in some ways the author does sympathise with him, and in other ways the author would be exasperated by him.

** Discussion. Meta is talking specifically about the sub itself (eg. Why does HPFanfiction do this thing that I don't like/understand?). Discussion is talking about fanfic stuff.

And to answer your main question - personally, I just find the Harry in it to be a smug, intolerable twat. He seems like the kind of person who'd smarm a "Well, actually, I think you'll find that I'm technically right, which you'd know if you'd read all the books I have." in the conversation that you got trapped in because everyone else at the party was more successful in avoiding him. Whether it's intentional or not, he's just such a turn-off that I can't like the fic.

I like likeable characters, even if they're monsters, and I actually do enjoy characters that discuss the functional, philosophical, and moral implications and characteristics of things (even if I disagree, it's still interesting to read). But if a character irritates me, I'm not going to want to spend time with them (ie. reading the story) in the same way I probably wouldn't want to spend time with a real person that irritated me.

I have no particular opinion on anything else about the story - the science, the plot, the premise, the other characters, the setting, etc - because I never got to read it. Harry is just so fundamentally dislikeable for me that I couldn't read more than a couple of chapters in.

** I tried to enjoy it and gave up a little way in, while Harry tried to prove some point that broke magic's laws - and confused the reader - and for what reason?

As a story, I don't think it works. The writing isn't high quality, the plot is poorly paced (it's extremely bloated) and the characterisations are flat/weak - it didn't make me feel much of anything. The characters - Harry especially - spend so much time trying to be right that they appear to have the emotional depth of a teaspoon.

To me, it was on far with those action fics that just seem to loop and loop similar-but-different examples just to flaunt the fact they have.

That said, some people like those sorts of things. They don't want emotions clogging a story.

As far as I can tell, it's meant to make you think, more than make you feel. There are a lot of discussions that I found interesting, about the nature of good and evil, what it means to be a hero, being able to set aside ego to achieve your goals, and a variety of other topics. But I didn't connect to the characters as much as some other stories. For me, it was worth reading.

** So I generally enjoyed my time reading HPMOR, but it is a really flawed work. I'm not going to add spoiler tags, so be warned.

The basic premise I was sold on was that it would be a realistic take on Harry Potter where the MC would use science to investigate the world.

Instead, we get an arrogant twat who simply refuses to accept that magic and therefore the metaphysical invalidates a lot of what he should think he knows. For instance, he goes on a long rant about how the animagus transformation should be impossible due to the conservation of mass. Despite knowing jack shit about magic.

Pretty much the "science" in the story can be broken into three categories:

1. Harry spouting off some research as gospel truth. Which ironically there's now doubts about the physiological research due to the replication crisis and where the author didn't spend time checking whether what's put in the story matches the science.
2. Harry thinking hard about something magical using only his mundane knowledge and somehow making a massive discovery of magic.
3. One or two semi experiments where the scientific method is vaguely followed.

Most this doesn't make it far into the story anyway and we're left with the rest of the story, which has a number of massive flaws.

In particular,

1. None of the adults punish Harry severely for his lack of respect.
2. Harry never really faces any personal consequences for his dumb mistakes and hubris until the very end where he's literally forced at gunpoint to take an unbreakable vow to actually think things through.
3. The story spends way too much time trying to keep up the fact that Harry doesn't realize Quirrel is Voldemort.

What we're left with is an arrogant character that doesn't really exemplify how one should grow and learn using rationality, but rather an OP power wank where "rationality" and a superficial understanding of science gives you lots of power beyond other mages.

That said there are a lot of interesting ideas in the story, but there's a lot wrong too.

****** It sounds like we aren't actually disagreeing here that the only impact of Hermione's death is for Harry to feel bad about it. In the grand scheme of the fic, Hermione's skills, abilities, decisions, or even availability as a resource had practically no impact. It wasn't an actual /setback/. Heck, it got him out of a debt.

In fact, does Harry ever actually reflect on the fact that Hermione's death is a consequence of his own foolish behaviour or draw any conclusions about how he could act or treat other people? All I remember is that he laments that he wasn't clever enough in the moment and rants at McGonagall about how /she/ is oh-so-authoritarian and---as is traditional for a Gary Stu fic---she meekly acquiesces and promises to change.

Murder of Harry's parents' has a far greater impact than the loss of an inconsequential character towards whom the protagonist has some friendly affection, and you know it.

Other than that, the story employs a very cliché trope where if used muggle-discovered Laws of Physics on magic, a humongous breakthrough can be conceived. It's very common, though I'm not sure if it was so when the fic was written, so there's that.

I saw someone complain about the part that mentions that this Harry never played D&D because he didn't have any friends, but he did memorize the rulebooks. I thought that was a hilarious description of a character who was clearly intentionally written to be unlikable, but apparently for a lot of readers an unlikable main character is a deal-breaker. I enjoy the contrast between this Harry's extreme arrogance and foolishness.

** Considering the fic's a decade old at this point, and that it's a few years since my last re-read, I still have fond memories of it if I also consider that it was one of the first fics I ever read.

Since then, I've read a whole lot more, firmly determined my likes and dislikes, gained some irrational limitations like "won't read if not complete and 100k+ words etc..", and even entered the wold of crossovers. HP cross of course. <- mind blown with the possibilities. And finally frustrated that "the cross i want" doesnt exist or isn't good, or some other arbitrary, self-imposed, subjective restriction.

That said, if i'm jonesing, i peek at reddit for any recommandations, irrespective of my stated restrictions. <- so less of a total snob and more of privileged teen brat throwing a tantrum.

So take it with a grain of salt when I say: I enjoyed parts of it, i disliked parts of it, but never did i stop reading it. I'm a little better than ambivalent about the work as a whole. I've read other works that were much more painful to their completion and felt aweful afterwards. And some works were completely amazing and then ruin it with a twist ending.

I don't recall the name, but there's one where hedwig is a horcrux, and like everyone dies at the end. <- or maybe i'm remembering it wrong, and everone BUT Harry survives.

HPMoR is not that story. I rate HPMoR average in my book. Even with the Hermione thing. <- If i was going to stop, it would have been right there.

The whole author talking (teaching/preaching) to the reader thing is a bit unusual, i grant, but it gave the story for some much needed context. I interpreted it as an experiment of sorts, where the protagonist is an amplified version of the author. Canon-bashing is canon-bashing. Enough fics do it that i just don't care. And the whole end game was highly contrived. BUT i understood it to be intentionally highly contrived so as to arrive at that specific scenario. <- which is contrary to the author's premise of "what would happen if the characters were more logical".

Now I take off my analysis hat, and put on my tin foil one.

I suspect that the author initially tried to follow his own rules for writing the story. About 1/2 to 3/4 of the way in he realized that if the characters were truly logical, none of the exciting stuff would conceivably (by our human, non-fantasy standards) happen. So he had no choice but to start coercing the story so he could have the "only one way out" scenario at the end.

Removes tin foil.

That said, this is the same debate that MHA and naruto fans have. It can get pretty toxic. Clearly HPMoR has something for everyone, otherwise it wouldn't have the following that it does.

Objective criticism, backed by examples of your expectations are an author's best friend and helps ever so slightly improve the number and quality of fics that will be available in future. I see it as an investment in MY personal future so that I may have more and better fics to consume.

I don't feel I have the creative potential to pen a fic, so never have. I am thankful for Less Wrong and all of the other authors I have consumed over the years, irrespective of my personal opinions of each individual work. I will never recommend someone to NOT read a particular fic, I will happily discuss any fic, but I will never discuss a fic I have not read to its completion. (Count on one hand)

** For me, HPMOR devolves from a Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay humour fic with that kind of energy... but based on the reasoning that Harry is a Rationalist and That's Okay... into a more Lord Potter Black Peverell, Ruler of the Known Universe style fic. It's also got this very strange "immortality is desirable" thing set in a nominally Harry Potter world which, famously, has the opposite message.

That being said, I really like the chapters about the replacement quidditch thing and I wish someone knew what they are because I honestly wouldn't mind re-reading them... but only them.

** I think that people hate it because they find it insulting. It shows a world which pretends to be the Potter world, but is completely different. It has characters who we are told have flaws, and told that they realize their flaws, and then... nothing. It's an exercise in I'm better than Rowling written by someone so fundamentally stupid that the very concept of rationality being included in their title offends on a personal level. Characters are what I read fan fiction for, so when I see something like this, I want to read it, but MOR doesn't care about characters, all it cares about is trying to show they can make a better world than Rowling by creating a self contradictory system of rules that make its MC look stupid. Recommendation for something similar, Rorschach's Blot wrote two versions of a story called Better Living Through Chemistry. It's in his Odd Ideas fanfic

** We did indeed discuss this a few days ago. This is what I said then:

I tried the first few chapters, but had to give up. I'd heard a lot of good things about it, but it just wasn't for me.

I thought that the "Harry" in the fic was a very blatant self-insert, and the whole thing seemed like an exercise in pointing out all of the logic fails of canon, attacking suspension of disbelief, and generally mocking people who actually enjoy the story.

I get the feeling that I was supposed to read through it and be amazed and impressed at how smart the author is, but I just...wasn't.

Harry was completely unlikeable, which makes me assume that the author is too. Acting that superior/smug/I'm-smarter-than-you-and-don't-forget-it in the real world will most likely result in people either ignoring you, or if you become too insufferable, punching you in the face.

*** I would like to point out that a character being annoying does not necessarily mean that the author is annoying. I for example, frequently write characters that are depressed and self-deprecating, just to lift them out. Now, I'd admit that I'm not sure it's realistic or not, but that's not the point. The point is that the personality of the character does not equal the character of the author.

***** I don't deny that. He's practically a husk of his original self, with almost nothing in common. They don't even have the background similarity! But sometimes, an author may write a character with almost nothing in common with canon because they are attached to a character or the fandom itself, they have an idea that's tethered to the fandom, or just purely because they don't want to take the time to invent their own setting. These are all valid reasons.

** I wrote something as a sort of response to the whole idea of MoR: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27034639/chapters/66000553]]

Essentially, if you took the actions of the characters of MoR and had characters like, say, Rick and Morty be the ones doing them... well, if at the actions of a supposed "rational" character could be plausibly done by Rick or Morty then how rational is that character, really?

And that really doesn't matter for a fun fanfiction, but if a fanfiction claims that it can teach you how to be rational, then the rationality of the characters themselves does matter.

** It was the first HP fanfic I read, so I personally liked it.

That being said later half of the story had a lot of philosophical talk, that seems totally out of place, considering our protag is an 11 year old boy. People can understand harry being smart but in this he's like this generation Socrates.

The fic also had /interesting/ characterization for characters like Draco and Snape, this is sub has an aversion to that. Plus there's the weird non-relationship between Harry/Hermione. I can see 11-12 year olds having crushes and imagining their life together, but the relationship seemed almost like one between young adults.

** It's not for everyone. It's got its strong points - but Hpmor Harry is fairly unlikeable, and what the plot develops into is a pretty far cry from the initial premise imo (that is, I saw it as 'scientific Harry exploring the magical world')

The author making harry a self insert also adds in a bunch of weird aspects - with his odd version of 'rationality', his being scared about AI (in a weird thought experiment that got him terrified), etc.

It's competently written and complete, and certainly has a lot of fans - I recommend everyone try it, to see if they enjoy it, but not to keep at it if (like me) they find it not to their taste

** I also feel like it's taken very seriously by canon purists. Especially glaring while stuff like A Black Comedy or Firebird gets a pass for being much more imo canon in name only.

In my view it's a fascinating story that takes some characters up to 11, has some OOC moments, and has some characters the author obviously doesn't like. And that...could apply equally to a *lot* of fanfics.

I've privately also wondered before if it's also less popular with some because it features to an extent a super!Harry but who is too young for pairings/sex/comedy that those characters usually get embroiled in.

Ultimately I have no issue with it as a fic. It sets out with an initial premise - Harry is very smart - and proceeds from that point in a logically consistent way. Not all fics even manage that!

*** I suspect that part of the issue is also the fact that the author had an agenda in writing it - he wanted to produce a tutorial on rational thinking - and being a Harry Potter story was a vehicle for that goal, rather than an end in itself. That could contribute to the "this isn't a proper HP story" vibe that some people get, even though objectively it isn't even all that divergent compared to some stories.

** Most haters are annoyed by Harry being an arrogant sort of person and the inclusion of science and rationality in a fantasy world. I personally like HPMOR very much, and I think many of the haters stopped reading it before the virtues of the story become apparent. For example, it is a story of character development, and you can't make Harry improve as a person if he is not obnoxious at the beginning. Maybe one other reason to dislike it is the quite intellectual parts. The average teenage reader who is mainly interested in romance gets annoyed when Harry and Dumbledore have a long and thorough discussion about philosophical things like whether immortality is a good or a bad thing.

I think there's a kernel of truth in that. One of the key ideas of the philosophy community that MoR belongs to is that you start to learn about rational thinking, which allows you to recognise and discuss a laundry list of mistakes you've been making - and yet you keep making them, and keep making them, and maybe you manage to fix one or two here and there, but having the language to describe your mistakes isn't an overnight fix. So yes, there's a lot of talk about doing better, with a much smaller proportion of actual behavioral change.
