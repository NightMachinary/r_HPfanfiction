So he can take Cedric place as Cho's date. Everything was fine except they filled the potion in empty firewhiskey bottle. Twins decided to drug everyone's drinks with firewhiskey, so suddenly lots of Cedric Diggories at the Yule ball.

Or

Used same type flask as Fake Mad-Eye and their flasks mixed up so... you know the rest.


** Why would Harry and Hermione ever do this? That's so creepy.

*** Do you think it's creepy? Looks like you never ventured into depths of hp fanon world.

And they are stupid teenagers with powerful tools, ofcourse they'll do stuid things. Are you honestly thinking students at Hogwarts never used polyjuice for entertainment.

**** I like to believe that people aren't that fucking creepy, or that they may think it through the next day (polyjuice takes a lot of time) and realize "oh wow, that is pretty fucked up. Also, what am I gonna do with cedric?"

Also, I find it hard to believe that there aren't any laws against polyjuice, or even just taking materials compatible with it and various other pieces of magic. Your appearance and wand are pretty much the only means of identification, and not having a punishment for stealing either is ridiculous. We punish identity theft irl, and we can't make ourselves look /exactly/ like the guy we're impersonating.

And like apart from that, it's just fucking creepy. It's stalker behavior.
