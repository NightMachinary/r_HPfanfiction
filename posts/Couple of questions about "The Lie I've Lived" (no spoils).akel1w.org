1. Do the tenses straighten up? I've read the first two chapters and #2 was better than #1, but I still can't suffer another 215k of mixed tenses, even if it's meant to be a stylistic thing to mark between Harry and James.

2. How prominent is the Sorting Hat? I'm not digging its characterisation; I'll read through a few chapters, but if it's a major character through the whole story then I'd rather not.


** 1) not really 2) Very prominent. It's pretty much the main reason most people like the fic.

**** Don't worry to much about it, it's one of the more overrated fics.

***** That was mainly the point. Doing a challenge, need to read a popular fic. This one was on a list linked in the sidebar and already on my To Read list, but there's only so much I'm willing to force myself through for the sake of a challenge. If it was less than 100k I might've pushed through, but I'll just find something else.

** I think the tenses god slightly better, in the beginning it's mostly because Harry and james are really 2 personalities that got mixed so it can be a bit confusing in the beginning. The sorting hat is there a lot and is the most seen Nessie's Harry.
