:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where James Potter died but Lilly didn't. She eventually remarried Snape and Snape treated Harry shittily, not abusive but y'know. At 11 Snape managed to convince McGonagall that he was gonna be like his father. I believe that Harry went to Drumstrange instead and McGonagall realized he probably wouldn't of been like that as soon has he didn't enroll. In the end it is revealed through a paper that Snape is Harry's real father.

tbh the ending felt kinda shitty but it's still a good read so i recommend it.


** Lily seems like a real bastard from your summary. Cheats on her husband allows her son to be abused for 11 years by her next husband who was her partner in her affair
