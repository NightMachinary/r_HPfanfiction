** There should be a list "Best author notes ever" or something like that.

** This could be expanded upon in a few different ways:

Do people like to admit when they're wrong?

In fanfiction, is following canon a virtue or a hindrance?

Do authors that engage in bashing tend to listen to criticism about characterizations?

Any of these would make excellent lead-ins for a discussion.

My own personal feeling is that there won't be many fics like the ones you're describing for one simple reason: HBP was incredibly divisive.

Anyone who wanted to write an HBP centered fic probably did so right after finishing the book. There was a /two year gap/ between publishing of HBP in July 2005 and DH in July 2007.

If you're so eager for schadenfreude I'd suggest looking for long, abandoned fics started between those dates (probably closer to 2007). One of them may have the A/N you're looking for. To be quite honest, HBP is my least favourite book of the series but /has/ inspired some of the best fanfiction from this community.

Rather curious, but there you are.

I've always thought it was funny how the quality of the source material doesn't always correlate to the quality of the available fanfic.

** Deathly Hallows just made me hate Snape even more, so I don't see why any author would do this, unless they were trying to stay faithful to canon in some way.

** Not completely what you're asking, but I remember reading a Marauder fic that was written shortly before OP came out, in which the characters were spending the summer at Sirius's house with his loving/indulgent/sweet mother.

Book 5 came out and the next chapter had a note that said something like "Okay, so I screwed that up."

Also, I swear to god that I remember reading a fic in which Harry's kids were named James/Lily/Severus/Molly. I thought it was weird that the author would switch out Dumbledore's name like that, until I realized that the fic had been written in 2006, and there were all of these flame-y reviews from 2006 saying that Harry would NEVER name his kid after Snape.

** How would that even happen? People bash Snape because he's a arsehole, not because he kills Dumbledore (another popular target of unrestrained bashing). Snape never stops being an arsehole, so why would anybody even have to “slink back”?

** Does /Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows/ itself count? The entire tone of that twist (if not the actual twist itself) was because JKR loved Alan Rickman's snarky, dark, /attractive/ Snape and afterward found the character so much more likable herself. She wrote the last book with such a loving heel-turn to give Alan Rickman a great death scene, not because it fit at all well with the previously written characterization of Snape.

I'm not saying he wasn't a complicated character from the start, but he really kicked the dog hard throughout the series. I don't buy a single act (with hand-waved back story) weighing up well against that sort of abuse. Certainly not enough to excuse the terrible epilogue name.
