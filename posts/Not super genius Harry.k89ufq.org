I love stories where Harry uses his brain. Most of seem to be Slytherin Harry or Manipulative Dumbledore and that's fine I love those but I've also notice a lot tend to make Harry a freaking genius!!

where he solves all the issues in like his 11th year. Like he's super observant and overly skilled, even in magic and its just so over the top and I normally finds myself closing the fic and moving on. Even if its well written.

I don't mind smart harry, love it in fact, but I want smart, not I've got an eidetic memory, speak 6 languages, and have all powerful wandless magic.

So please if you know realistic smart Harry (independent) where he likes to learn (because he was so excited about magic, I can see him wanting to learn everything he can), where he doesn't just shut down possible friendships right off the bat (kinda always bugged me that he only had Ron/Her as friends), rec them!

This I'd loved Harry not just doing what Dumbledore wants or says. Maybe him telling Snape to grow up and that he's not his father. Idk, I'm in the mood for stories where he actually tries. where he see the wizarding world as his chance to be better and do whatever he wants. lol.

Always a fan of dark/gray stories, slash (no Ron/Harry), bad Dumbledore.

It's a work in progress, but it's been updated recently.

Harry has red hair and that prompts him to think of his mother as his role model, and not his father. This might be the most Slytherin-like Gryffindor Harry I've ever read, and it's all for the sake of his friendship with Draco.

Harry's no Hermione in this one, he is not exactly average but not the best either, pretty much like in canon, with the one exception being Transfiguration where he simply peaks. He does show genuine interest in this subject and applies himself so much to the point where McGonagall tells him to slow down.

A very entertaining read for the way Harry tries to better himself, because his attitude towards learning is very different from canon.

Slash and bad Dumbledore, so I think you're gonna like it.

  Around the time most young children's do, Harry's hair goes from his father's dark locks to his mother's bright, most-likely-magical red hair. It changes everything about who Harry identifies with, who he wants to grow up to be, and who he thinks he is. Instead of having James Potter as his idol, Lily Potter turns out to be a much better influence. So instead of seeing a scruffy, most-likely-a-muggleborn boy standing beside him in Madam Malkin's before their first year, Draco only has eyes for the scarlet haired, green-eyed creature who just walked into his life and instead of an enemy, he finds a reason to be better than he'd been raised to be. Not that Harry will ever notice, given he's trying to simply survive at Hogwarts.And Severus might not make it to see these boys graduate when his heart kept giving out seeing his very-Slytherin godson repeat his own history and go chasing after a green-eyed, red-haired Gryffindor. Turns out the Malfoys aren't that bad and Dumbledore definitely is. Remus is at his wit's end and Sirius gets a chance to actually live up to his title as Harry's dogfather. Tom Riddle is not prepared for any of this.

**** Not sure that this is quite what you are looking for but it is a simple concept. Harry and Hermione work together to build a time machine with basic rune knowledge. They continually go back in time over and over again picking up more and more knowledge along the way. I think this is a more believable method for them to attain knowledge because it happens slowly over time and you see them actively learn things as opposed to be naturals at everything.

The story is Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon, I think it is fairly popular. Warning as far as I am aware it is incomplete.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
