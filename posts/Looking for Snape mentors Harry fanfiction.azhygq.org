Hi there! Lately I was trying to find old fanfiction. I think I read it a couple of years ago. So a lot of facts may not be accurate. Or the fanfic may even not be that great. But I would really like to read it again.

​

So from what I remember:

-starts before first year;

-Harry for some reason is spending time in diagonal alley;

-Harry was using some kind of glamour;

-Harry was helping in apothecary, he was good at potions;

-There was a scene were an owner of apothecary invited Snape and introduced him to Harry (under disguice)

-And Harry was very exited to meet Snape in Hogwarts without disguice, but Snape beheved in Snape fashion and Harry was hurt.

​

I think it was the last chapter (with Harry going to Hogwart) at that time. But as I said it was some time ago. It was most probably on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] or ao3. I will be greatfull for any help.
