Hey!

I've started a fanfic and I could use a beta. I need help with general editing, obviously, but also just a sounding board. I've already posted a couple of chapters here:

Thanks!


** This looks promising so far. Sadly I'm not good enough with the English language to be of much help. Just one thing I noticed: the beginning of the first chapter is a little ruff and kinda doesn't flow well. Later on when the story picks up I was to engrossed to notice grammar much so yeah. Keep up the good work!

** Unfortunately I can't do beta but, what you have written is good as far as I can see.

** I'm sorry, It's very late and I can't do much right now (I'm half asleep). "Disinteresting" is not the same as "uninteresting" and it doesn't fit there (you should use uninteresting or not interesting), also it sounds incedibly awkward.
