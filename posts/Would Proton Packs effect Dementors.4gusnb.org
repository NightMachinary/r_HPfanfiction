So, I know Dementors can open doors, but otherwise, they seem intangible. I mean, if they weren't shouldn't you be able to use a stunning spell on them, not just a Patronus? And Proton Packs were designed to be used on things that couldn't be touched...is it reasonable to think that maybe the Packs could be used to capture Dementors? And I know that it wouldn't be easy since they have the emotional manipulation powers, I'm just wondering here if there could be more than one way to bring them down.


** If I were writing a crossover to Ghostbusters, I'd insist that the boys' paratechnology would work on all spirits including Dementors, poltergeists, ghosts and boggarts.

The real problem is that Dementors tend to swarm, and Egon's ghost traps usually fit only one spirit at a time...

EDIT: the other problem is that as muggles, they wouldn't know where to aim, but in the Ghostbuster world they're able to detect and eventually see the ghosts. I'd probably add in some paratech goggles.

** It's an out of scope question; you won't find an answer in either of the works, unless you modify them to use the same underlying logic.

If you, as an author, want them to, then sure. It would be easy to justify - they're spirits, and proton packs are designed to capture spirits. The patronus isn't the only defense against them, but it serves the dual purpose of protecting those nearby and (when corporeal) repelling dementors.

If you, as an author, don't want them to, then sure. It would be easy to justify - they're manifestations of depression and fear, not ghosts or spirits in the traditional sense. Proton packs wouldn't capture a genius loci or an emotion.
