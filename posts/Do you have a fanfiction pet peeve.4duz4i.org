I know we all hate grammar mistakes and such things... I mean other things. Mine is when Harry ends up with Ginny in fanfiction cuz "Rowling did it". I dont care if Harry and Ginny end up together, however there better be story to go with it.


** Mine would be Harry and Hermione immediately becoming friends.

No. Just stop. Just because they're your OTP doesn't mean you can justify a Racist!Dark!RAISED BY FUCKING VOLDEMORT!Harry forming a friendship with Hermione, especially not when he discovers her blood status.

And if you want to make her secretly a Pure Blood all along...then just make an OC.

** - Pranks in fanfiction. Especially when it's crack!humour or the pranks are blown way out of proportion. Often time, they're just dying something pink or forcing someone to embarrass themselves and they're just cringe-worthy.

- Female characters that are just pretty arm candy for their male love interest (usually Harry). Hermione or Daphne or whoever are /oh so clever and talented/ but they never actually /do/ anything clever or talented. You might as well replace them with a lamp... and in Hermione's case you can even keep the Brightest Lamp of Her Age line that people repeatedly use like it's a title...

- Which leads into when The Brightest Witch of Her Age is used like it's some sort of title, with capital letters and all. Remus was just saying she's smart and I always took it to mean that she's smarter than her peers at 13/14 (of /her/ age). It's definitely not a title that deserves to be capitalized or repeatedly mentioned in every single chapter.

- Rehasing the same story to every new character we meet. So Harry will sit down and tell Sirius and Remus about his first two years at Hogwarts in detail. We get their reactions. Then they sit down and tell Amelia Bones. We get her reactions. Then she make them tell the Minister or the Head Auror or someone. We get their reactions. It just wastes a lot of time with information we already know from reading the first two books.

*** The "brightest witch of her age" bit REALLY annoys me because it's not even the correct quote! Unless I'm very much mistaken, in the PoA book, Remus says that she's the /cleverest/ witch of her age he's ever met. Maybe brightest is what he says in the movie?

**** "You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.' - Remus

and since I was looking "Cleverest" is used twice more (brightest not at all)....

"Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school," - Remus

Hermione is better than Lily confirmed (fight, fight, fight). But then Remus also ignores Snape (understandably, but biased) and Barty Crouch Jr. (twelve OWLS). Also quite possibly Amelia Bones, Frank and Alice Longbottom, Marlene McKinnon, Andromeda Black/Tonks, and others.

So we all know she's clever, but after looking at it I think the often used quote should be replaced with the third quote from PoA

#+begin_quote
  "Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry's year" - Harry's POV
#+end_quote

It just seems logical that (whether named or not) there should be other witches that are in with a shout. Just as she wasn't better than Snape (as a student or Lily?) at potions I am sure there were witches better at practical DADA or Transfiguration and so on.

***** I totally agree, it's supposed to be that Hermione's astoundingly clever /for her age/ or /compared to her peers./ Certainly not like, the smartest person ever - she had fewer OWLs than Barty Crouch Jr. did! (she had 11 IIRC). Remus (nor Hagrid, nor whoever else calls her smart) isn't comparing her to every witch or every wizard he's ever met: just her peers.

Side note on the Lily thing - Lily was supposed to be 'bright' and great at potions and charms, but I don't think she was ever at the level of genius of Snape (making his own spells) or James (transfiguration whiz, spearheads illegal Animagus transformations x3) or even Sirius (less canonical evidence, but was very adept at charms and probably did most of the map tbh). I usually equate Lily's intelligence to Harry's - good (but not astounding) student, bright (getting mostly E's in OWLs), particularly gifted in some area (probably Potions for Lily, DADA obvs for Harry), but not extremely talented in everything they do. But that's just my interpretation; others can feel free to make her into some Hermione level genius if they so desire (side eye at fanfics that make Lily into a Hermione/Petunia cross)

****** Lily was Head Girl, which traditionally in British boarding schools is given to a student who:

a) Has top academic results in all their subjects.

b) Is socially active and involved in extra-curricular activities.

So I've always imagined her as getting straight Os. But that isn't a huge stretch - there are plenty of students who get straight Os so it's not like it means you're the second coming of Dumbledore.

To be honest I think Hermione is a good comparison: achieves mastery of all magic they learn (i.e. gets an O in all subjects) but isn't noted as being particularly creative or inventive, so wouldn't make it into the pantheon of "great" wizards. All of the best wizards are singled out as having created magic of their own: Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, the Marauders. In addition to academic prowess, creativity is highly correlated with magical ability.

If I were to tier magic, the first tiers would be something like this:

Tier One: BAMFS. Dumbledore, Voldemort.

Tier Two: Pioneers. Straight O students who also show creativity and inventiveness. Snape, James, Sirius.

Tier Three: Competent generalists. Straight O students. Hermione, Remus, Percy, Lily. Probably most Aurors.

Tier Four: Competent specialists. Os in their specialism, decent grades in the others. Harry, Draco, Arthur Weasley.

Aside from teaching one year at Hogwarts and being a teen himself 20 years before, he hasn't exactly been around a lot of teenagers to compare. If someone like McGonagall or Flit wick said it, it would carry so much more weight because they've being teaching for decades.

** - Muggle wank. Both in terms of presenting Muggles as more powerful than wizards, and in terms of fetishising Muggle social institutions (e.g. HealthAndSafety!Harry).

- Bashing, and in particular poor Dumbledore characterisation. If you absolutely must make him a villain, he should be an extremely serious threat.

- Simple magic (including but not limited to magical cores, wish magic, and dictionary magic).

- Inconsistency in the protagonist's abilities or temperament to artificially create conflict (can't count the number of times I've seen a supposedly war-hardened Harry have an emotional breakdown at an inopportune moment).

- Taking rare magic and presenting it as common. E.g. having occlumency as a standard skill rather than an obscure discipline that most wizards have never even heard of.

- Shipping of any kind. Note: not the same thing as a pairing. Shipping is when you use your fanfic to put forward arguments for why a pairing is correct. E.g. all the H/Hr fics where they get together by listing all the arguments for why they should be a couple.

- Kids who act like adults. Writers need to learn to separate out intelligence and maturity.

- Adults humouring kids who act like adults instead of just laughing them off.

- Ranty or preachy Harry.

- Friendly Goblins.

- Any version of the international wizarding world where Voldemort and Dumbledore are trivialised.

- Fics that act like canon Harry was a complete idiot who knew nothing. He's been at magical school for years and gets pretty good grades. He must have a relatively good understanding of how magic works. We should not be seeing post-OotP fics where Harry is learning the basics of magic.

- Any kind of pre-Hogwarts friendship between Harry and characters who he will later meet at Hogwarts. Especially guilty: the coincidental pre-Hogwarts meeting with Hermione.

- Overblown abuse storylines. Two forms: firstly, exaggerating the Dursley's level of abuse; secondly, exaggerating its emotional impact on Harry's psyche.

- Any story which changes canon circumstances but doesn't change characters actions accordingly, which then purports to criticise that character's actions. For example, having Voldemort able to access Privet Drive after GoF (not canon) but not changing Dumbledore's view of the safety of Privet Drive, and then criticising Dumbledore on that basis.

So obviously we can abandon that plot but if we explore it how are we supposed write it versus canon? And sure authors have taken it too far but if you're gonna use it you have to do better than JKR did.

**** I think the problem with Harry's abuse in stories is the same as the problem with rape. It's rarely handled well, usually it comes out in one big dramatic reveal, everyone freaks out and then cuddles Harry and then it's never mentioned again.

Plus I always find Harry's very OOC in them. His way of dealing with the emotional neglect throughout the books is being flippant or snarky about the Dursleys. Most people seem to miss that and I think it's a really interesting and valid copping mechanism.

Stories that deal with Harry's abuse and keep Harry in character or show how it would have affected him can be well done, but it's a rare exception.

#+end_quote

Basically, it's neglect with any unpleasantness being reactionary (it wasn't right, but it was reactionary). The result of it is that Harry strives to be “normal” but at the same time he wants to be acknowledged; that is why he said the bit about having a dream about a flying motorcycle to Vernon in the first book, for example: at that time what he wanted was to get approval, and that was the effect their “abuse” (which admittedly was emotional abuse and is proven to be bad for kids, but is not even close to what many fan fiction authors try to make it out to be) had on him. Harry not really being into studying, for example, wasn't because they were beating him but rather because neither the teachers at school nor the Dursleys ever acknowledged any of his efforts so he simply ... stopped caring and thus stopped trying. On the other hand, Hagrid got his interest and became Harry's friend almost instantaneously because he came /for/ Harry, he talked to Harry /about/ Harry, because he got angry at the Dursleys /for Harry's sake/; because he acknowledged Harry.

Neglect and reactionary unpleasantness can result in many outcomes, but the one that seems to be most popular in fan fiction is very very unlikely.

It just bothers me that people want to...or it at least feels like...pretend that it didn't happen at all (and lord knows JKR did basically pretend it didn't happen even though her writing implies a few things at the least).

The Magicals went into hiding because they were afraid of the Muggles of 1692. Now that Muggles had 300 more years of rapid technology advances and huge population growth, the balance of power should have tipped even more toward Muggles. Even as we speak, the pace of Muggle power increase continues unabated, while the Wizarding World basically stagnates. What would happen the balance of power, let's say, in another 30 years?

Well, kind of. I think they probably still need /some/ land, it's just that with magic they can get good enough yields that they need much less of it than muggles do and so they can hide it without it being an issue, and with either house elves or spells for it or both or even something else entirely they probably don't even have to think about it but just leave it be and reap the benefits in the form of food.

I mean, well, it wouldn't surprise me if at least some wizards were actually stealing food and stuff from muggles, and overall I do agree with you, I just wanted to add my own take on the quoted bit.

  "So Harry," Hermione interrupted, speaking loudly. "What were you doing all alone with Ginny?"

  Though about as subtle as a niffler in a Gringotts' vault, Hermione's attempt to steer the conversation was a huge success: both Tonks and Remus stopped mid-sentence and swiveled to face Harry, the glint of curiosity in their eyes.

  "Yes, Harry," said Fred, who had apparently been listening. "What exactly were you doing with our sister?"

  "Not besmirching her virtue, I hope," said George, coming to rest his hands on the back of Harry's chair. Harry's cheeks tinged pink and he glared daggers at Hermione, who at least had the grace to look vaguely apologetic.

  Tonks /cackled/. Apparently it ran in the Black family. "Getting a special birthday present, Harry?" she asked, grinning widely.

  "Now, now," said Remus, his own mirth barely hidden. "I'm sure they were just talking."

  "About what?" said Hermione, "the colour of Ginny's underwear?"

  "All right," said Harry, trying to calm them, "I think that's-"

  "Ginny!" cried Fred, just as she emerged from the stairs. He waved a doughy spoon in the air like a wand. "What've you been doing to poor Harry?"

  George laid a protective hand on Harry's shoulder. "Not been besmirching his virtue, have you?"

  Remus snorted; Harry had to resist the urge to obliviate everyone, instead sending Ginny a look that he hoped said "help me!"

  Ginny smirked. "Only a little," she said, sending Tonks off laughing again. "And he wasn't complaining much." Harry began to feel ganged up on.

  "Only a little?" said George, looking shocked. "Don't tell me you left him hanging?"

  "How many times have we told you?" added Fred, who was clearly enjoying himself. "Once you Wingardium-"

I disagree. Going by canon, Hermione has been romantically involved with three guys (Viktor, Cormac and Ron), the same number as Ginny (Michael, Dean and Harry). Hermione is an only child, so you won't really see this in H/Hr fanfiction. To me, when this happens, it's just people seizing on a few canon moments of overprotectiveness and making all of the Weasley brothers the "protectors of morality". I don't think this trope is as common as you're making it sound like.

Most of the "overprotectiveness" I've seen is more plot-oriented as I said in my previous comment, by combining it with other tropes regarding Manipulative!Dumbledore.

By the way, I saw your interview yesterday, congrats :) I'm really hoping that your fic becomes the go-to DH story. It's definitely one of the best stories I've ever read, you really managed to capture the sombre atmosphere perfectly, as well as all the characters, especially Ginny :)

But seriously, I find this to be rather irritating to read, and I feel like the author is perhaps struggling to model how Fred and George would act. So they resort to choosing something that they view as uniquely Fred and George, and expand it so that the twins can speak no other way. If I remember correctly, Fred and George did this only a few times in canon, so it's not as if they're just following Rowling's lead.

Or maybe the goal is to be funny. And that's fine for a couple of scenes, but after a while it gets tiring.

- The overbearing/overprotective father cliche. It's not funny. It's boring and always the same. "What are your intentions toward my princess?" Not to mention it's a really dumb move to scare a suitor into compliance if you want to judge his character (is this an American thing? I don't know how it is in Britain...).

- Magical marriages and oaths that can be entered by accident or unintentionally. Magic is supposed to be intent-based. You can't swear an oath to something you can't/don't understand. If the wording is ambiguous the vow will either not work or follow your intent. Magic is not that dumb, don't turn it into a cheap plot device.

- Soul bonds that define a relationship instead of the other way around. It's fine to allow for some kind of magical component to relationships, but don't just Deus ex machina relationships into existence.

- Redundancy of all kinds pisses me off. Don't treat canon as a checklist that needs to be walked through (most prevalent with Horcrux hunt). Just skip it. Don't have characters solve puzzles in incredible detail when we already know the solution (*). I don't care how clever you think your writing is. Don't waste my time.

(*) I've recently been reading "The needs of the one" and there's almost a whole chapter where the other characters figure out that Hermione is involved in some kind of time travel. It's all completely pointless (we already know exactly what happened) and could be wrapped up in 1 paragraph.

-Bashing, especially Dumbledore and Weasley bashing. If it is mentioned in the summary, I don't even bother with the story. Dumbledore bashers completely ignore how complex a character he is. Ever since his encounter with Grindelwald, he knows that he has to be wary of positions of power, but at the same time, his prodigious magical skill keeps putting him into a position where he is expected to save the wizarding world.

And the Weasleys, every one of them has their faults, but that's what makes them realistic people. They're just a kind family, who welcome Harry into their family, just like the Potters did with Sirius. They aren't evil master manipulators.

-Marriage Laws: Well, this is just stupid. Mostly used as a lazy plot device to justify contrived pairings, writers who use this device ignore that it would be large-scale governement-enforced rape. So writers should stay away from this unless it is their intention to literally turn the Ministry into the Khmer Rouge.

As I wrote in another response, "complexity" isn't inherently good. On the contrary, too complex can be a detriment.

Most secondary characters, for example, need to be simple - if you give them all huge, complex backstories, you detract from the story itself. So you make them simple. You make them recognizable. Arthur and Molly Weasley were fairly simple examples of standard parental characters for the most part. They weren't given "complex" stories, motives, goals, etc. They were only what the main story needed them to be, and readers filled in the rest from their own assumptions, experiences, expectations, etc.

A "complex" magic system might be enjoyable to think about, but it doesn't necessarily make a story better. It certainly won't rescue a story with poor writing, poor characters, etc.

A magical core /can be/ simpler than the canon system, but need not be. And whether it's simpler or not doesn't automatically determine whether the story is better or worse.

What matters is how well it drives the plot. What matters is how the characters use and react to it. Your complaint says more about the overall quality of inexperienced fanfic writers than about magical cores. You might as well complain about the use of magic generally as a plot device.

**** Being different from canon isn't the problem. Being /worse/ than canon is. The problem with magical cores is that they are simplistic, reducing all the beautiful complexity and variety of magical power down to a single quantifiable value. It's perfectly possible for a writer to make a great AU fic using some kind of idea of a magical core... if they made it complex, like a kind of magical biology equally complex to human physiology.

The magical world revolves around magical law like the Muggle world revolves around natural law. Imagine if instead of a brain you just had a "thinking core" - a single, simple object with only one component. The world is suddenly a lot less interesting. Instead of marvelling at the complexity and cleverness of nature, the human condition can now be summed up in a single sentence.

So, the problem with magical cores /isn't/ that they differ from canon. The problem with magical cores /isn't/ that they are inherently simplistic. The "problem" is that they /can be/ simplistic... just like /everything/ can be simplistic, which means that there's nothing special or unique about them. They're just one of dozens and dozens of things that can be done simplistically.

Which, you know, is probably to be expected in fanfic stories written by inexperienced, amature authors. And which makes singling them out rather suspect.

And even so, I'm still going to disagree with this being a problem.

Magic is a /plot device/. It's not the /point/ of the story, it's simply a vehicle for moving along the plot and getting the characters to do things. Simple plot devices are not inherently worse than complex ones; indeed, they can be better.

Was the movie /The Maltese Falcon/ made inferior because we don't know much about the falcon statuette? No. Quite the opposite - a lot of time spent on the falcon itself would have detracted from what made the movie great. The falcon was no more complex than it /needed/ to be in order to move the plot along and get reactions from the characters. What complexity it had came from the reactions of the characters - it was simple, but the audience imagined it to be more because of how characters reacted to it.

Same with any magical "system" in a story. It should be as "complex" or "simple" as it needs to be in order to move the story. Too simple and the story will flounder. Too complex and it will detract from the story, or create unnecessary problems.

So, even if a story uses a simplistic magical core system rather than a complex magical core system, that /still/ doesn't mean that it will be a worse story. It will only be worse if it's too simply for the plot. A complex magical system, with or without a magical core, won't improve a story with poor dialog, poor pacing, poor characterizations, etc.

***** Well, to be fair, one could make “magical cores” interesting if they really wanted. It's just that this requires not making them the primary magical organ of a wizard or witch, which is something that most people reaching for the “magical core” fanon without thinking about it are too lazy to do.

So yeah, I think the problem with “magical cores” doesn't come from the concept itself but rather from how it is executed. I mean, it's basically D&D's “mana pool”, if you think about it, and yet this system, as well as many other systems, has elements added to it to make it better (like spell reagents, for some stuff) so clearly it's possible to take the idea and build on it rather than just leave it as a boring ... thing.

Overly convenient timing. Once is fine. But constantly is horrendous.\\
Good Snape/Draco. Especially where they are just misunderstood. I don't mind it conceptually, but usually its "shame on you for not understanding how tragic they are."\\
Shopping.\\
Ancient and Most Noble yadda-yadda, especially with old dueling by laws and marriage contracts etc. I do enjoy this to some degrees in Princess of the Blacks, but that has a lot of things I normally hate yet still like that fic.\\
No real threat to the protagonists. I don't mind Harry getting OP, just so long as Voldemort is there too.

*** Agree with most of your points. Snape is a hero, but he is not a good person. His work towards destroying Voldemort is admirable, but in his daily life, he is just awful.

Draco Malfoy is a spoilt child, a bully and a coward. However, I love how the final two books add depth to his character. He is a boy who was raised to believe all the pureblood propaganda bullshit, and when he joins the Death Eaters, he initially thinks it is an honour and a priviledge.

And then, he realizes that the reality of it is nothing like his imagination. And while he loves bullying and having power over others, he is not up to actually kill and torture others.

I like to think that his war experiences made him a better person. Still a pretty flawed one, but a better one. I imagine he will always retain some subconscious prejudice against muggles and muggle-borns, but he will grow more accepting of them.

"Noble and Most Ancient" is just a title the Blacks came up with, and it's just showing their arrogance. It's ridiculous when every pureblood family starts to refer to themselves in that way, because if it was common, the Malfoys would surely do that.

*** to be fair, 90% of all HP crossovers suck. for Various reasons. The most major in my opinion is how Harry Potter was written. JK only elaborated on how the world worked close to Harry. We have no idea if all of the Wizarding World does things as Britain does. While most other series they expand the WHOLE world. Example: Naruto. Naruto created a whole planet, multiple cultures, different religions, and then told a story about a boy (much the same age as harry) and his life.

I honestly think that this is one reason I dislike AQ. In my mind it is not Harry Potter fanfiction. its a seperate story, that molds its characters around Harry Potter. Its also why I dislike Cassandra Clare's work. It is a cheap rip-off the Dark Hunter Series.

And I'd found “Magic, as opposed to Magic” (linkffn(6822698)) which is ... well, not crack but close enough as it's still a humour fic, and not perfect either, but it's a good enough read. I hadn't read the ones you mentioned before, so that's maybe something to try.

That being said, when a writer makes a poll for the readers to decide what an already-established character's core personality will be, it is my personal opinion that likely there no longer is anything to salvage and it's time to move on.

Edit: Yeah, and I gave the one with the pool in question a try; Tom is OOC, the timeline is out of whack, what kind of name in all insanity even is “Jaime”, and I am out because the author had failed to keep me in.

Also, and this is a general pet peeve in all sorts of writing cause it just scream "No education" for me, writing voilà as walla or V`walla or something similar.

For actual fanfic stuff, bar many of the things mentioned here the whole lord potter, or lord potter-black and so on really annoys me, it has gotten to the point where if harry enters Gringotts in the first 5 or 10 chapters of a fanfic, gets a private conversation with a goblin and then suddenly is the super wealthy lord xyz of houses whatever i just close it.

Bashing in general, and bashing of the weasleys in particular, i get if you dont like ron and want HHR to happen and i can tolerate some ron bashing, but the whole Molly is the super manipulative bitch and Dumbledore paid them to befriend harry so ginny could marry him to get his gold is just bad imo.

"glowing emerald eyes" - this phrase being used

Others have said it before, but the whole prank thing is just cringeworthy. AS is the whole Marauders thing in general - really not a fan of those.

What really annoys me is the amount of abusive relationships in non smut fics, especially anything with Tom riddle JR or voldemort, or even Draco. If he beats you, curses you and thinks you not worth anything - walk away and dont ever trust him. And if the only reason he spends time with you is "cause he loves you so much it hurts", then walk away even faster. Its just a horrible relationship waiting to happen.

Strong female characters becoming cowering cowards when stuff actually happens - i dont know why but especially female writers seem to think that a girl that actually shows some backbone and feistiness should never be written and the spineless pretty damsel in distress is so interesting.

Powers being introduced cause they are cool but then they are never used again, if harry becomes a animagus or gets a really cool magical animal as a familiar/companion - make it be relevant for the story, to often he gets something and then its almost never mentioned again, that is really annoying to read.

Authors who write pages upon pages of thanks and similar stuff at the start of each chapter, pm the reviers or something, and dont articifally increase the world count by thanking and aswering every review in the chapter itself.

** So many. I've been reading Fanfiction for under a decade (something that's only become clear to me just now) and so I've gathered a general idea as well as dropped some of them after maturing a bit, and I'm an accidental user of some on a bad day of writing.

- Spelling characters names wrong: Delores, Zambini (that was bloody popular for a while), etc.

- Massive paragraphs with heavy exposition: When I discover there's no real point to reading a chunky paragraph, I skim and then see if it's worth sticking around reading the next chapter. I'm a uni student, so I want to read something that's more quick to the point after getting cross eyed at the paragraph per page scholarly articles I have to read.

- Certain words (seemingly tiny but huge for me)

- "MOM!": It's set in Britain with British children. No one calls their Mum "Mom". You can hear the O in that and it's specific to an accent that isn't British. It's a very tiny and considerably insignificant detail for many, but for me, it usually takes me out of the fic after being immersed for some time. (The only exception to this is the obvious. The character is American/any other accent that commonly uses that pronunciation.)

- "Ya": As in yeah? Why are you saying it like that? Can't imagine Hermione suddenly putting on a voice to go "Ya" or "Yah" like she's a different kind of European than we once believed or is a young girl who prefers it over the option of "Yeah."

- "Anyways": This is a recent one, but I've seen it cropping up more often and it's commonly used when Dumbledore/McGonagall/Voldemort/Amelia Bones/any adult is talking and trying to continue their recount of a tale (that probably doesn't need to be retold because we just watched the whole thing happen last chapter or read it in the source material). I don't picture Albus rolling his eyes and going "Anyways" although that would be hilariously OOC if it were canon.

- Couples who don't actually get along except for their undying love for one another. Otherwise they don't have much in common and don't really understand each other beyond "emotions".

- Flames. I think they're pretty much non-existent now to majority of fanfiction, but if someone sent a scathing review to a young writer with no actual constructive criticism just because "I wasted 5 minutes of my life reading this so now I'm going to make you feel like dirt" then you need to sort out your priorities. Don't like it and have nothing useful to say? GTFO and move on.

- Young kids getting it on: I've been particularly scarred by a fic mentioned on here, I don't remember what it's called but Hermione should not be doing those things at her age, to an eleven year old Harry. No.

- Students and Teachers/obvious Adults out of Hogwarts for some time getting it on: "Age is just a number" isn't always a great argument and I think as it is mostly illegal in the Muggle world depending on the age of consent, it would be in the Wizarding world too.

Those are the only few I could think of that stick with me. Ships are ships, I'll read if the story is too good to stop just because I don't commonly read a certain ship involved. I stick mostly with canon but I occasionally see what's going on in other ships when I'm particularly bored.

** This might be canon and I might very well just be stupid, but the first one that comes to mind is when we find out that animagus forms are already set and you just have to find them. I'm sorry, but the Marauder's forms seem far too convenient for what they wanted to do to be random. The same with Rita's.

My biggest pet peeve however, is when people write a story about female!Harry and her name is...Harry. Or Harriet, so they can have her be called Harry for short. Look, if you have a cis male Harry get turned into a female, that's fine. Heck, if it's a MtF Harry that's fine. But when she's born a cis female, put some creativity into it dammit! I don't care if you call her Daisy or Rose because of the Evans' flower themed name thing. I don't care if you call her Jamie, because fine, I can see James naming his daughter after himself. Just name her something other than Harry!

** Also, Tonks having a 'base form' and showing it being a big act of trust. Teddy was shifting from the moment he was born, I'm pretty sure Metamorphamagus don't have a 'base form'.

** Veela being bird-morphing, fireball throwers.

I see those traits mentioned on the Harry Potter Wikia, but I don't trust that site. Does JK actually reference this bird/fire thing in the books?
