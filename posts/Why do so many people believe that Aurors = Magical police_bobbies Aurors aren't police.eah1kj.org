Aurors =/= Police!

I don't know how many times this shows up in fanfics, but the Aurors are [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/ministry-of-magic/department-of-magical-law-enforcement/auror-headquarters/aurors/][an elite group of witches and wizards who battle the Dark Arts. They operate in some ways as soldiers but more often as intelligence agents, seeking out Dark wizards and defeating them, often in fierce wizard duels]].

The Magical Law Enforcement Patrol is closer to ordinary police. It's [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Magical_Law_Enforcement_Patrol][comprised of a team of wizards and witches tasked with general law enforcement]]. Somehow they are rarely, if ever mentioned.


** The books are extremely vague. Aurors are described as dark wizard catchers that work for the ministry, which implies some kind of law enforcement. The only other force I can remember being mentioned is by Fudge, stating only a fully trained hit wizard would stand a chance against Sirius Black.

From it's context, I always took hit wizards to be a wizard SWAT team. With Aurors being roughly the same as FBI, primarily investigators but trained to throw down as good as hit wizards if needed.

*** there is also fudge being escorted by aurors and the muggle prime minister being protected by an auror. So Aurors are dark wizard catchers, who also are assigned to protect fudge and the muggle prime minister.

there are three known enforcement groups in canon hitwizards the magical law enforcement patrol and the Aurors

and none of been expanded that much. the Hit-wizards disappeared from the later books.

The magical law enforcement are the most obvious, they deal with typical police work, patrols and petty crime

the hard part is working out where Aurors and hitwizards differ Fudge mentioned only a Fully trained hitwizard could take on sirus black and yet in later books he took aurors with him for protection.

Maybe the Aurors are a mixture of FBI,Detectives and the Secret service While the Hitwizards are both swat and the army.

Maybe before the first wizarding war, the difference between the two groups was greater with aurors tracking down the criminals and then a hitwizard squad would be called in to take them into custody.

** I don't think it's quite accurate to say the MLEP is equivalent to Muggle police. From the way they are said to patrol Diagon Alley, it sounds like the MLEP have the same role as beat cops, but there's so much more to police work than walking the beat.

Overall, law enforcement in the wizarding world appears to take a much more specialised form, to the point that I honestly do not believe that there is any general law enforcement group like the police. Rather there are a multitude of officers like Arthur Weasley and Amos Diggory who have authority to enforce the law in specific domains (Muggle artefacts and magical creatures respectively).

Unlike the Muggle world, where the division is between administration (civil service) and enforcement (police), the magical world looks like it prefers to divide things up by subject matter, such that in a given area of law, the same individuals are responsible for administration and enforcement. Arthur drafts laws, and then he goes on raids to enforce those same laws.

This is a very interesting approach, a fascinating difference to the Muggle world, and flows quite logically from the fact that all wizards are in effect heavily armed.

Unfortunately most fanfic authors prefer to destroy this interesting element of the magical world in favour of making things more like the Muggle one. Just another symptom of the laziness of fanfic writers.

**** The thing is, this actually still fits what [[/u/taure][u/taure]] is saying. There's a logical flow here from Department to Department. Presumably this note came from an Obliviation squad, who have their own means of tracking and managing magical incursions into the muggle world. They see that it was caused by muggle-baiting, so they hand it off to Arthur to investigate. Once he's able to sort out who did it, he can delegate the actual arrest of the wizards responsible to the MLEP. It's possible that the MLEP are on hand to support the actions of the various Departments, without a special category of their own, or maybe they're just the ones who manage incarceration of petty criminals waiting for a trial, like DOC.

** Folks are forgetting that the wizarding world (specifically in Britain) is coming out of a very dark age with lots of death. And most likely lots of deaths amongst law enforcement against death eaters. So if I had to theorize, more Aurors survived the "war" than typical law enforcement due to training. As such Aurors kinda became more important and prominent than before during Harry Potters "era".

In all likelihood, at one point Magical Law enforcement was likely one big organization with various levels. Your regular beat cops in the patrol section. Your swat teams in the hit wizards, and your FBI in Aurors. But in a wizarding world that is smaller than folks realize, lines between them were likely blurred some, and so there was crossover work. Especially in a world recovering from, and then being attacked again by, Voldemort.

+Meanwhile literal school children and Harry's parents (who are talented but not immortal super beings) manage to defy Voldemort many times.+

+It's no surprise that many readers think that Aurors are glorified bobbies, if the only way you can find out that they are supposed to be super bad-ass is by asking the author instead of reading the book. But maybe I'm misremembering canon and countless scenes where Aurors are behind the scenes fighting Voldemort and tracking down his inner circle, initiating awesome Wizard's duels, etc. It's kinda interesting though how Magical Britain seems to be teeming with Dark Wizards in hiding, who toss out Unforgiveables like candy, while there supposedly exist an elite force that seeks them out 24/7.+

** Mostly laziness or fanon/fanfiction habits coming through, I'd imagine. Plus, like you said, the patrolmen are rarely mentioned so it's not in the mind enough to come up while people are writing.

At a guess for a canon reason that fits with British culture, it's just slang. Like calling any member of the police force a 'Bobby' no matter whether they're K9, Uniformed officers, firearm specialists, detectives, etc. We don't really have terribly evocative names for law enforcement categories in England like FBI or SWAT, so our names for police tend to be broad (like 'The Fuzz'), stolen from America (like 'Cops' or 'Pigs'), or historical (like 'Bobbies' or 'Peelers').

The DMLE's name doesn't really lend itself to smooth slang, same with their category-subsets, and the magical world doesn't appear to have had a Peel-type to name the police after, so the slang draws from the most visible element of Law Enforcement - the Aurors. Might sound confusing, but a lot of our slang (and humour) in Britain is very reliant on context and subtext, so we'd more than likely pick up whether that actually meant the Aurors specifically or the patrol-peeps.

Sure that isn't true... but you can call FBI, Marshalls, Detectives...all "a Cop". So why not "call the Aurors"? They can take a report and redirect it to the lesser Enforcers if its something minor, or take the case themselves if its something bigger.

If it were military... then the regular MLE forces would be enlisted, and the Aurors are Officers who can direct the MLE to do the small stuff while they worry about the bigger picture. An Auror might be assigned an MLE squad for an investigation or takedown.
