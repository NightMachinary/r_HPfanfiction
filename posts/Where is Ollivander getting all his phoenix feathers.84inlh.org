So we know that Ollivander got 2 from Fawkes, but according to the wiki Prof. Kettleburn and Celestina Warbeck also had feathers not from Fawkes, and Ollivander showed at least one phoenix wand that wasn't the Holly one. Then there's the fact that phoenix feathers are listed as one of the three only cores Ollivander uses, so he /probably/ has more than just 4 phoenix feather suppliers...

So where are all these phoenixes that Ollivander is getting his feathers from? (Wait, using only one core from each creature is canon right? As in, HP and LV's wands having cores from the same creature was pretty much a one of a kind thing with Ollivander's wands.)


** I sorta got the impression that Harry and Tom getting wands with cores from the same bird was the kind of spooky coincidence that Ollivander never would have noticed if Tom hadn't turned out to be a genocidal maniac who went after infant Harry. It seems infeasible for each core to have come from a single creature (not that that matters when it comes to magic). But if material from a single creature is used to make more than one wand, then the special thing about Harry's and Tom's wands would have been that Dumbledore's pet /only/ had two wands made from its feathers.

Perhaps there's a phoenix farm somewhere that sells feathers to Ollivander, but Dumbledore gave him two feathers from his own pet as a thank you for a favor or as a trade or something like that. It doesn't seem fitting that Dumbledore would have sold two feathers for money, especially if he actually needed the money for some reason (at 10G/wand I think he could only have sold them for 5G/feather at the very most).

If most wand cores come from anonymous animals, then Ollivander usually doesn't know who is getting chosen by sibling wands. Alternatively, if he does usually know which wands are siblings, it's almost never of any consequence because most wizards don't grow up to be Lord Voldemort or Grindelwald or Dumbledore, etc.

*** There being a phoenix farm seems wrong, somehow. Also imo the twin wand thing wouldn't be regarded as so weird, since it would happen all the time in like practice duels and things, if he regularly used duplicate cores.

**** There was more to that than the wands being siblings, though. It was heavily implied that the second wand chose Harry (while no other would) because Harry was Tom's horcrux.

Also, there's a dragon farm and somebody brought those unicorns to Hogwarts for class. It's silly to think that there is any creature so special that humans won't keep it captive.

***** I don't think you could keep phoenixes captive though. Otherwise Dumbledore would never be able to use Fawkes to move around. And even if people could, the backlash from the magical community (assuming we're not dealing with mass idiot ball), would be immense. I reckon that it's more likely that phoenixes care about magic as a whole enough to occasionally donate feathers to wandmakers for use and allow some amicable relationship to be cultivated. According to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (the book), phoenixes are rarely domesticated, and the only two phoenixes that we do know are domesticated are Fawkes and Sparky, the mascot of a Quidditch team.

** I always took Ollivander as saying, "It just so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather resides in your wand gave another feather... just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother... gave you that scar." Meant that most Phoenix's gave many feathers, but that it was particularly curious that Fawkes specifically only gave /two/ and that the brother wand had belonged to Voldemort. I don't think brother/sister wands are all that rare. Of course, this is just my headcanon.

** Read one fanfiction, can't remember which- where Ollivander knew of this sort of hidden forest pond where tons and tons of phoenixes visited and hung out at- and considering the birds are immortal and pretty damned intelligent even if canon it makes sense they'd have places to gather like that.

And sometime, probably after the Hogwarts rush, presumably Olivander either closes up shop some days/weeks or has an apprentice or someone watch the shop for him and goes searching for/harvesting ingredients himself- since the wand trees need to have those bowtuckles on them and wand trees are rare, not sure if it's cannon or just [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/wand-woods][pottermore]] but either way it means that he probably can't outsource everything- he probably jealously guards the knowledge of each magical tree and wild magic creature location he finds and others do the same- so he's almost certainly going on trips to get ingredients in the first place.

Maybe there are wand ingredient hunters/farmers as well, who knows how it works for sure.

** Probably a large collection of them his family has collected over the ages they've been open. Plus there are more phoenixes than Fawkes and the one that one Quidditch team uses as a mascot.

#+end_quote

I would say no. Ollivander's has been open for a very long time, I bet many wands in the store were made by his ancestors as well. So there may be many wands which use cores from the same creatures, but maybe only one wand is "active" (read: used by a wizard) at any given moment.

Just because there may be multiple wands that use cores from the same creature, this does not mean that

A) they will choose wizards that live at the same time

B) that the wizards they choose will come into conflict so that the twin/sibling core effect is an issue

** There is no reason to think Phoenix feathers are especially rare if you know where to find them. Nesting areas or such. Fawkes probably gave Olivander the feathers to work with which makes them a bit special, especially because of where they ended up.

** It's a wand-maker secret where they get them, one which you'll only learn after you've passed your apprenticeship and taken your vows.

What's known about phoenixes is that they're immortal. What a lot of people don't know is that they don't just live forever, they live outside of linear time. They're rare yet there are so many feathers because while only two phoenixes (that are known about at least) are alive, meaning living linearly, in the time of canon, there's a lot of others that have simply dropped of a feather as needed based on a signal the phoenixes and wand-makes have known about since wands were a thing. Doesn't mean they have to bore themselves by sitting around somewhere the whole time though.

Edit: I should mention for completeness' sake that this implies they also live outside of linear space. That's how they phoenix-travel. They don't travel, they just exist somewhere else. It doesn't (literally) suck like apparition either because apparition and portkeys clumsily have to make use of the fourth dimension to skip normal space.
