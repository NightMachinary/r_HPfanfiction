I'd like to preface this by saying I'm in no way a writer. This is just an idea I had and I'd like some feedback.

Armed with the Original 7 Books and keeping with the play idea, this is a plot outline for my version of The Cursed Child. I try to stick to the same characters and the same feeling but otherwise the plot dissappears.

(Some important character notes, Ron will reveal that he wants to retire to run the Joke shop during this. Harry is newly appointed Head Auror and it's implied that the pressure is what's getting to him, Hermione is head of magical law and is leading reform on creature law. There is a romance plot between Albus and Scorpius.)

And yes this is just an outline there would be a lot more padding added.

It's been 23 years, we aren't going back to Albus's first year. We meet him as a 5th year Slytherin. He's close with Scorpius Malfoy, they probably end up together by the end of all this. To show the progress made at Hogwarts in this time, Albus and Scorpius, while not "cool" are generally fine and Albus has a good relationship with his family, at least his house is not causing any problems. With the kids, Hogwarts is just normal for now.

Meanwhile, ex Death-Eaters that have been released are turning up dead. Harry, as Head Auror is leading the investigation, showing a darker tone and turning a little towards a "wire" esque tone, we discover that all of these Death Eaters have had their dark marks burned off. There's a chase after some detective work (that brings us close to Christmas) by Harry and Harry is overpowered letting the unidentified assailant escape. This is the first time Harry has lost in 23 years.

Back at Hogwarts, it's revealed that Albus has become quite close with the Dumbledore portrait over the years and will at times listen to stories. Right before Christmas, Albus is told about the Grindelwald duel and asks about the elder wand. He is shocked to discover that it belongs to his father but sits in Dumbledores Tomb below.

Christmas at the Burrow now has what seems like hundreds of people, All the Weasleys, the kids, Hermione, Angelina, Harry, Fleur, Audrey, Ted Lupin, Scorpius Malfoy. The trio and a few of the kids are sitting up one night when Draco comes to collect Scorpius, they're all civil so he joins them for a drink. Harry talks about the case, asking Draco if he knows anything, been followed etc. Draco reveals the rumor of a young woman in St Mungo's (Draco is a healer). He was treating her and they would talk, he told war stories, she seemed very interested in how he broke into Hogwarts. And one day she vanished from the hospital. More info gets dropped at the table, Harry revealing that he lost a duel earlier in the week, claiming to be off his game. Albus, who has been sitting in with Scorpius while this takes place directly asks about wand lore and wants to know if this means that his attacker now owns the elder wand. Everyone freaks out about the person who now owns the elder wand trying to break into Hogwarts..

Train back, we follow Albus on until he passes an older student who we then begin to follow, she hides away on the train and we see a crude reimagining of the dark mark on her arm.

Scorpius sees her back at Hogwarts and alerts Albus. Albus does some snooping and then tells James in hopes of using the map which James stole, James finds Delphi Riddle on the map who he's never seen on there before (they don't know about Tom Riddle) and decides to investigate. He follows her dot out to Dumbledores Tomb and then says to sort it themselves "Dad had done this like 5 times by the time he was our age, we'll be fine". They follow her out and a duel ensues in the grounds. They get their asses kicked and as Delphi cracks the Tomb, the trio show up with Draco. Scorpius had sent word to his dad. While Draco tends to the injured kids a duel goes down. It's epic, all 3 work together and eventually she is all but overpowered when Harry stops and tells Ron to finish it. Ron does, becoming master of the elder wand (in the hope that as he's retiring, nobody is gonna duel him) They take Delphi away and end of story.


** While it's easy to say anything is better than Cursed Child, this was MUCH better than Cursed child and sounds like an interesting read.

** Please write this. I enjoy CC as a play but I need a more canon compliant version like you've outlined

** It's much better, but so think the sheer existence of Delphi makes Cursed Child feel like a bad fanfic. Even some random no-name upcoming Dark Lord would be better in my eyes. Like some kid lost his parents during the second war and is mad that reformed Death Eaters like the Malfoys are allowed to roam around and at the golden trio for allowing it. They get a small following of people that feel the same way in order to hunt down these ex-Death Eaters and reform society. This way 40yo Head Auror Harry Potter isn't overpowered by some random person, but by a group of people.
