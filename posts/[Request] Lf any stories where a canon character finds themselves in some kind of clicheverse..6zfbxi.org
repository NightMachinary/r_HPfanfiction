looking for any fics where a character finds themselves in some kind of cliche verse, or the other way around. a bit like the red knight or strange reflections.


** Well, there's always the classic linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5751435/1/Stories-of-the-Lone-Traveler]]) EDIT: And the original it was based on, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2673584/1/Harry-Potter-The-Lone-Traveller]])

I seem to recall another good fic in that same vein, but I can't recall any details off the top of my head...

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.
