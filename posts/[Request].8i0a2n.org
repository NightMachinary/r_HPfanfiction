Recently I look for one fan fiction. Maybe you read it . It about Harry and durning summer he change in creature(lamia or naga) then he run away ,accidently kills auror that follows him with his basilisk eye and found monster hotel. I know is a long shot but I look for hours and didn't find it . So please respond . It was writen on fanfiction.net . Thx :)


** *Please use in future a proper title.*

I think i can remember this fic. Does it have gods and demi-gods in it? I think Harry is a craftsman and can create (metal?) Creatures under his control, after a while he creates a pocket-dimension for his (adopted?)children.

I'll search for it in my reading history but no promises

  He was only twelve, going on thirteen. And shouldn't Madame Pomfrey been able to detect this and stop it while he'd been in the hospital wing? Because seriously? This? This thing right here? It had to have been something to do with the Basilisk having bitten him. A whole new spin on the Snake!Harry Genre with some Ancestor! thrown in.
