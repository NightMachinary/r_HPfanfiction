**** It is, although it made me want to read the Dresden Files afterwards. You don't need to have read it to enjoy the story.

** Not sure if he kills, but he pretty much thinks like Deadpool since he was raised by Deadpool in "Thinking in Little Green Boxes".

** A fic where Harry is aware of the fourth wall would be kind of surreal.

**** The 4th wall is the "wall" between reader and characters. Readers are aware of it, but only a very few characters are portrayed knowing of it. Deadpool is one of those, as he often "breaks" the fourth wall and talks directly to the reader.

**** It comes from theater because a set typically has three real walls and an imaginary "wall" that opens up to the audience.
