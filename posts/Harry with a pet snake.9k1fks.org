** Is it this one linkffn(10487644) Ron was aiming for Harry and hits his pet snake, which nearly kills the poor thing because snakes aren't meant to move like that.

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...

*** If I saw a snake and was capable of magic I would probably do the same - I'm phobic about snakes. I would apologize later, but the reaction would be instinctive.

*** I think it was the Christmas break in first year when it happened, and the snake might have been the one from the zoo trip that summer unfortunately that's really appreciate I can remember which is why I am having such a hard time finding it again.
