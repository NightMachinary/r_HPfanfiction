:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fanfiction where Snape dies and gets a second chance as a 16 year old at Hogwarts. He is actually nice and helps Moony by giving him Wolfsbane. He and Lily are together. I don't remember where I read this.


** I'm pretty sure I read that fic!

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.

  It has been Severus Snape's greatest wish to go back and fix his life with Lily. What happens when he suddenly gets the chance, remembers everything, and has changed enough to avoid Slytherin? Marauder-era, pre- and established Severus/Lily. 50/50 COMPLETE!
