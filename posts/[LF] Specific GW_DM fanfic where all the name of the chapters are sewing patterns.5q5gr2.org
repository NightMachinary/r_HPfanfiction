Or knitting patterns? I have no idea. That's definitely part of why I've lost track of it.

I believe we start the story with Ginny working at Fortescue's as a summer job when she gets kidnapped by Crabbe and Goyle because Draco off-handedly mentions that she's attractive in that general mean way people write into fanfictions and apparently they were scouting for a girl for this rapey Death Eater tradition where they set an environment and "hunt" down a girl for a boy's coming-of-age.

Snape wins because he was tipped off to her kidnapping and secures her in a safehouse. I don't really remember much else after that, but they do go into sexual abuse. Ginny's encounter with Tom Riddle is described to be sexual abuse.

I also remember odd bits like Draco really like cherry coke and there being a paragraph-long description of the feeling of drinking cherry coke.

It wasn't finished in the at least 3 years since I've read it.


** I did a quick Google search of Draco and cherry coke. This seems accurate, though there aren't knitting pattern chapter titles.

  The formatting here really bites. Sorry the chapter looks so crappy. I couldn't make the changes stick. Anywho, here is the update. I apologize for the wait. I have no excuse 'cept that I really wanted it to be good for y'all. Only two more chapters
