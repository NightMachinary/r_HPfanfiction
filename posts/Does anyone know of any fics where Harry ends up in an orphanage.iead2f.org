  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** Souls Touch, and the Future Changes by sunmoonandstars. linkao3(13893606)

Plot synopsis: Ruthless Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore took care of all the horcruxes but still abandoned Harry to Petunia, who abused him for a few years then dumped him in a Catholic orphanage where he was shunned and persecuted by the other kids. To be fair, Dumbledore thought "family" would keep Harry from becoming another Grindelwald or Voldemort, but he still knew it would be less than ideal. He also is deliberately crippling Harry's political standing, but that's been less effective than he hoped.

Ironically, the author orphaned it, which is especially strange after the last "chapter" was an author's note saying the story would never be abandoned and was already planned out through sixth year with a rough outline of the rest.

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore watched two visionaries start as driven, powerful, brilliant young men, and become monsters. He has no heir, no protege of equal power to step in should another one rise, and he is old. So when he hears of a Chosen One with power the Dark Lord knows not, he thinks maybe he doesn't want this boy prophesied to defeat Lord Voldemort to grow up in the Wizarding world. He thinks of the bonds of family, and the opportunity he has to shape his world's politics, and of a corrupt magical elite who've signed on with two Dark Lords over hatred of Muggles. He thinks Harry Potter should grow up loved by his family, and Voldemort be destroyed so there is no need for Harry to ever realize his power, and he acts to make both of those things happen. Because he's Dumbledore and what he wants, he gets. Usually. When you dabble with improvised ritual magic, you should be aware there might be unforeseen consequences. For example: souls touch.
