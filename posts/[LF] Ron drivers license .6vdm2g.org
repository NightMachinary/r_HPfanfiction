Basically harry decides too look into the whole

Ron Weasley: "Hermione couldn't believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to confund the examiner." Hermione Granger: "No, I didn't. I had complete faith in you." Ron Weasley: "As a matter of fact, I did Confund him..."

and it reveals something more sinister , i haven't read it , just gave it a skim at the time but i've searching for it pretty hard lately and i can't find it

I think it was fairly popular and i def saw it recommended it on here


** You're talking about the one where there are electronic records of him violating the SOS and the tester gets fired? I think i have that one in my faves, or at least should be able to find it shortly.

edit: in addition to the one below, here's another [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10362319/10/Bolts-from-the-Blue]]

**** linkffn(7108864) here's another one where obliviating muggles goes awry. I haven't found any other ones specifically relating to Ron's Driver's Licence though.

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.
