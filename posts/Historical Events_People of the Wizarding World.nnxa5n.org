I'm writing a fic where Harry can see the past and he learns tons of stuff about magic, dueling, politics, etc. from witnessing all these events. Got any events/people you think I should include or ideas of how to flesh out different moments of the past?


** I've always wanted to know more about prehistoric wizards. What were they doing? How were they doing it? Did they build Göbekli tepe? What for? Stuff like that. What were wizards doing during the fall of Constantinople? Etc

*** In my own canon, Gobleki Tepe was absolutely made by wizards. It was “just” a pre-agricultural settlement, because magic makes it possible for sedentary societies to emerge without first developing agriculture.

In prehistoric times, there were at least as many witches and wizards who formed magic-only societies with each other, as there were witches and wizards who remained with muggles (there's a trade-off between being King of Shit Mountain and being a regular dude in relative Utopia---some wanted power, or to stick with the people they knew, and others preferred the higher standard of living that can only come when you have a few hundred or even a thousand witches and wizards living and working together).

(Ancient societies often described the gods as beings who lived in the world and could be interacted with, but were nevertheless remote from humans, because many witches and wizards removed themselves from society. Yes, Zeus was Top God in Greece, but he spent most of his time on Olympus, not slumming it with humans and giving orders all the time.)

** I would avoid making too many very important people magical. That tends to end up defaulting to magical supremacy as the message becomes 'everything muggles though that they had achieved was actually done by us'. Maybe also include some losers, so that you have counter examples of muggles succeeding in spite of magic.

I feel a good place to look is for existing stories of 'magical' people. The most obvious cases are folklore. You might feel that King Arthur is already done to death, but maybe look at some of the older Celtic stuff. Many of the early Christian saint were basically adopted local pagan legends as well, and can get pretty wild.

You can also take more general events and just create mini stories of OC magicals in them, even if they didn't go down in History. A common example of this in fanfiction is how the obviously Saxon in origin Witengamot, adapted to the take over of William the Conqueror and presumably his own magical courtiers. Although please avoid the xenophobic pureblood wank over the Malfoys 'only being in the country for 900 years'.

One area I really want to see fleshed out is the lead up to the Statute of Secrecy. While JKR heard the phrase 'witch burnings' once and decided that was a good enough justification, if you actually look at Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, that was the least of their worries. Between the (counter-)reformation, famines, plagues, social change and the constant wars, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were all out in force and it is frankly no wonder that the magicals decided to hide themselves away. But presumably this decision wasn't easy, especially given how many would have muggle friends/family/vested financial interest, so getting the near universal agreement required to make the Statute actually enforceable must have been a saga unto itself.

*** In my canon, I tried to change things up a bit by making the European wixes into relative latecomers to the Secrecy thing---the other main “superpowers” of the day, China and Uagadou (an actual magic city-state whose “catchment area” covered much of Africa) were already isolationists, and once the European wixes got on board, the pro-Secrecy faction acquired critical mass and forced the rest of the world to go along with it.

Starfox5's explanation is that there were prophecies to the effect that “if we don't seclude ourselves, Bad Shit will happen.” I didn't really like this because it's so vague, but I've been dabbling with an AU where the Statute is broken during WWII, and it's becoming increasingly clear that magic + muggles = Bad Times, because (most) enchanted objects be used by anybody, magical and non-magical alike. The Statute of Secrecy was put into effect in the the multi-generational slaughter of the Thirty Years' War and the growing use of flintlock rifles and other firearms. Even without Seers to provide helpful prophecies, it wouldn't have been hard to imagine what could happen if a muggle army were outfitted with enchanted objects.

** Well we know that Ptolemy, Agrippa and von Rheticus (and maybe Newton although I don't remember whether that's canon of fanon) were wizards in the HP universe although they are based on historical people. Also the Black Plague I think is mentioned as one of Malfoy's curses that got out of control while trying to chase away from his land some people that would refuse to leave. Also another Malfoy is said to have cursed Queen Elisabeth I to never get married after she turned down his proposal.

Speaking of which, during the first year of the Peloponnesian War, the Athenians tried to shut down in their city while awaiting the Spartans to tire while sieging. However there was a plague outbreak within the city that forced them to get out. That could be a magical intervention. The great fire of London could be the result of a quarrel between the baker from whom the fire is said to have started and his magical neighbors.
