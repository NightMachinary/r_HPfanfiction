I'm looking for novel-length Harry/Bellatrix pairing fanfictions that are well written. Time travel is absolutely acceptable. Dark/evil harry is acceptable.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), is a really good time travel.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** I've only got three that haven't already been recommended - Passageways, Wind Shear, and Vulpem pilum mutat, non mores (Links below). Wind and Vulpem are pretty good (Wind Shear particularly is a classic), Passageways is not particularly well written, but it's tolerable and the plot is moderately interesting. All three are time-travel.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Linkffn(watching over harry) one of my absolute favorite fics. Fair warning and the writer warns at the beginning of the chapter it's in but there is a pretty brutal scene with harry and the dursleys in one of the first couple chapters but its necessary to set up the story and the relationship between harry and bella

  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.
