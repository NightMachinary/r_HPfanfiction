Hello, I'm trying to remember this old Drarry Fic I read a long time ago. I know it was at Hogwarts, it was longer, it was a secret relationship and they met like in a cabin in the woods I think. I remember a scene with gifts for Valentine's day that included flowers (Narcissa and Lily) and a poem that referenced Ginny's poem and I think Draco bought Harry some stylish robes at one point?
