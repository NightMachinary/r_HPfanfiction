Okay so I've been reading hp fanfic since 2007 and now I'm struggling to find new fics. I think I've read almost every dark/Gray!harry fic in existence. But I'm hoping some of you lovely people will be able to help.

I'm looking for any Dark/Gray!Harry fics, preferably 100k+. Also preferably where he has some intelligence, the golden trio aren't perfect (or better yet not heavily involved) and Dumbledore isn't some all seeing god (manipulative!dumbles is even better).

I prefer for the fic to at least start while Harry's in school, and pre-Hogwarts is good. I'll happily read mxm and fxf parings. And harry paired with anyone, or no pairings at all are fine.

Completed works only please.

I'm not a fan of crossovers, marauder/next gen era or Heavy AU's, such as non-magical, genderswap ect.

Thanks for reading and I hope you have some recs for me.

**** I was honestly expecting you to have come across it before, because it's got pretty much everything you want: Gray!Harry, manipulative!Dumbledore, limited appearance of Ron and Hermione, Hogwarts' era, and it's complete and lengthy. And the writing is good enough that it kept me engaged despite not usually liking those tropes.

  Dark magic, Death Eaters, politics - and in the middle of it all, Harry Potter. Tested against enemies old and new, he learns that power requires sacrifices; revenge, doubly so. Book One of Dark Triad Trilogy.

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

(I'm reading this right now, so far it seems interesting.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12021325/1/Antithesis][Antithesis]] (I didn't like this one to tell you the truth. The plot was a bit silly at times, like some things didn't even make sense, but at least the characterization was interesting so you might want to take a look. I have also seen many who liked it. )

**** Ehh, there are many things, like what was up with the Philosopher's Stone? Who wanted to steal it when there was no Quirrell ? How did Skylar save the stone? Later on , how did Barty even know where Voldemort was so that he could create a portkey when Voldemort and Barty hadn't spoken apparently.

***** Yes, there are some plot holes during the Hogwarts years where the author tried to fit the story into canon. It annoyed me too at first, but the emotions, development, and characterization was really really good.
