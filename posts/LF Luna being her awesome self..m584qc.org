Any story where Luna makes everything better just by being her usual semi confusing(but still awesome) self.

Some examples; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8975202/1/Have-Chrome-Will-Travel]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24446656]](HP and the Unexpected Mother) I suppose Harry Potter Squatter also qualifies, but she's not in it for long, so...

No Harry/Riddle. Thank you.


** There's one where she details everything before third year. Manipulative Dumbledore, pretty sure there's Weasley bashing, and after third year Harry and Luna travel Europe with Sirius alongside.

  They say that history is written by the victor. Harry finds that this is not the case, history is actually written by the manipulative old coot behind the victor, and this Harry is not going to let himself be stepped all over, unless of course Luna tells him to.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.
