  It begins as an effort to heal Goyle's injuries after a class with the Carrows. And then others start coming. Blaise does not know quite how to stop this reputation he has built for himself as a pseudo-Healer for the Slytherin House. And suddenly, it is even bigger than that. Alternatively, in which Blaise's philosophy to coast by seventh year does not quite go to plan.

** [[https://kelsfics.livejournal.com/22545.html][Incarnation]] is one of my all-time favorite fics, one-shot or no. Published ages ago on Livejournal but it is amazing. Tom/Minerva, with Marlene McKinnon.

I also love [[http://lumos.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=2598][The Two-Step of Death]], archived at the little-referenced Lumos site. Enjoy!

  “He was my childhood hero, didn't anyone think it strange that I fell in love with the same boy I wrote about in my diary for years before even meeting? Didn't anyone ask whether or not it was idol worship?” When Ginny goes to bed she's fifteen and her biggest concern is balancing quidditch and homework with enough time left over to snog her boyfriend. She wakes up in a home she has no memory of with a child she worries is being held hostage with her. The war is over. She's married to her brother's best friend. So why is it that everyone thinks she's crazy for being the one to question why everything feels a little too perfect?

  Between school, the war and its aftermath, Hermione hasn't had much time to connect with her family. A family wedding seemed a good of time as any to introduce her family to her boyfriend and her best friend. But when her parents invite her out for tea in the days that followed, Hermione is woefully unprepared for their opinions on who she's better suited for.

  Nearly every evening since just before Harry turned fifteen, he has gone to sleep and woken up basked in the glow of Voldemort's hearth. Dumbledore had theorized it was another element of their bond growing stronger; an unintended side effect of Voldemort taking Harry's blood in the graveyard. Harry theorizes that the piece of Voldemort's soul in his forehead likes to make Harry's life as difficult as possible. orHarry and Voldemort have reached a stalemate, but continue to argue anyway.

  Harry Potter is finally 17. Free to leave the Dursleys behind and start a new life as an independent wizard (if staying at Ron´s until he gets that apartment in London can be called independence, anyway), he does what any young man in possession of a good fortune would: he third-wheels and goes to a museum. It´s not really a bad plan. The Malfoys had announced they had made a big donation to the newly opened "Myths and Prophecies: Lord Voldemort´s secret collection": The Boy With The Green Eyes collection. All of it.

****** It's great for me on Android. Open a story and go to the first chapter. You should see a pair of headphones in the top row of icons. If you don't see that row, scroll up and down a bit and it should reappear.

Once you see the headphone icon, tap and the app should start playing. You can change playback speed, voice type and so on in the settings - I usually have it speak at about 125% pace.

Sometimes the headphone icon is greyed out for no obvious reason. I find force-quitting the app and reloading fixes that most of the time.

I find the app is very prone to being swapped out when memory gets low, so don't try to run too many things at once while using it because it's *very* annoying.
