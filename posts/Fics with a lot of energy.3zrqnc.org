Lens of sanity's and zeitgeist84's fics are full of energy and I've figured out why they're some of my favourite fics.


** linkffn(2412808)

Not sure if this will be to your liking, but I love Lens of Sanity's fics and this one seems a bit like that. Lots of action and a badass Harry, lots of humor.

** Generally anything by Joe has a lot of action.

linkffn(Sword of the Hero; Wastelands of Time)

Both are the first in their respective series, which are /awesome/.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** To be fair, I literally just finished reading this one. So I am still seeing it in the beautiful afterglow of having read a long, satisfying fic that feels complete even though it will forever be a WIP.

But I think linkffn(637123) will fit your requirements. Just get through the rather painful "Harry being a dumb dumb" beginning. The story gets interesting quickly, the action picks up big time in about chapter 9 or 10, and the combat is pretty interesting and original in a way that you only really see in older fics written before HBP and DH (in my opinion).
