** I think that's a great idea! Honestly, even though I'm not a fan of Snape romances, it makes far more sense that Snape/Hermione, because as an INTJ myself (like Snape) I can tell you that an INTJ does NOT want another introvert as a romantic partner. Intelligence is a must (and odd as she is, Luna is very smart), but making a relationship with another socially awkward person is very hard.

Now, I haven't seen any proper Snape/Luna romances, but there is a very sweet story of their platonic relationship. You've probably already read it. It's by billowsandsmoke and is called 'I Know Not, and I Cannot Know-- Yet I Live and Love'. It's a real tear-jerker, and for me, that's saying something.
