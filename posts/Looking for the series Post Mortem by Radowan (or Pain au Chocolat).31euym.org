I'm searching for all the books the Author Pain au Chocolat wrote about the series Post Mortem, I think there are seven or eight? If somebody is kind enough to give them to me or tell me where to find them! I would appreciate it! Thanks!


** Never read 'em before, but I did some looking. Best I can tell, the author only completed the first in the series and wrote some of the second, but it's all friendlocked on their livejournal and they're being picky about who they accept.

/But/ I did find [[http://www.docin.com/p-492519227.html][this]]. The file is in English, but the website isn't so unless you read that language or can find a way to translate the page (Google didn't give me the option) and find a download button then you'll have to make do with reading online. (I did try the orange button with the down arrow in it, which looks like it might be a download button, but it gave me a login pop up box so you may also need an account with the site to download things.)
