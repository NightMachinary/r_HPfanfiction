I post my fanfiction on fanfiction.net, but lately I've been wondering if there are certain other archives which are, generally, more respected for hosting high quality stories. What are your favorites? Or does fanfiction.net still rule the net for Harry Potter fanfic of all qualities?


** Check the sidebar for a list of [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/qyump/fanfiction_archives_forums_and_sites/][archives, forums and sites]] that host HP-related fanfic. We've been adding to it as we find new sites - it's pretty comprehensive.

*** Thank you! Now that you pointed it out to me, I see it. I'm obviously new here--I've been on the hunt for good sharing sites. Awful the kinds of newbie mistakes one makes every time one joins a forum, no matter how careful one is.

** The key to finding good stuff on harrypotterfanfiction.com is to also join the forums -- hpfanfictionforums.com. The search features in the archives are pretty hard to use, but the Story Recommendations section of the forums will lead you to a lot of really good stories, no matter what pairings you favor.

** Portkey for h/hr, siye for h/g, ficwad is okay but hasn't had admin support or upkeep for years.

For fun you can google "Lira Snape list of lists" and for Harry/Luna/Ginny search for flaming nargles. I believe both are on live journal but of course the lists are only good for reading, not publishing

** If you are looking for a specific pairing (especially the more rare ones), then I'd suggest going to the livejournal community for it. (Just google the pairing "(name x name) livejournal" and usually something will come up). I've found some really amazing fanfics that way!

Otherwise I just use the big sites that are listed in the sidebar, mostly fanfiction.net since it is so big.

If you trying to find really high quality fics, I'd look at someone's favorite fanfic recommendation list (many livejournal people do that, plus some on other sites like tumblr, etc). If you find someone with similar tastes, you can find tons of high quality stuff. Fanfiction.net also has some communities dedicated to high-quality fics. I don't think there is an entire site dedicated to only high quality fanfics though (since that would be really hard to judge of course, we all have different standards).

** I really like SIYE for Harry/Ginny. It's huge and has a nice layout with good quality fics. Harrypotterfanfiction is giant.
