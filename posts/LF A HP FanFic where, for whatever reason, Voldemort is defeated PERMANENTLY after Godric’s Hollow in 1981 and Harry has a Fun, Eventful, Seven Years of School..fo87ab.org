  What if Voldemort made a mistake with his Horcruxes? What if he had truly been vanquished that fatefull night? What if the Dursley's didnt treat Harry like crap, but rather with casual indifference? Who would Harry become and what would his world look like? Read along with a seventh year Harry as he goes through his diary of Hogwarts and experience his best and worst moments!

*** Lmao at Tom Riddle being obsessed with Immortality that he spends his life devoted to it only to be foiled by not finishing the book about it and somehow missing the dire warning at the end. Super contrived, not sure what all the extra blood magic was for in this case?

** I have a fic where Harry does end Voldemort the first time. It's a slash fic with Harry/neville where Harry gets sorted into slithering and Bc of that doesn't have many friends. It's focused around Christmas and stuff. There's also Sirius/Remus. Imo it's a good fit and is 8 chapters long and completed.

This is the summary, of your interested I can post the link! - in an alternate universe where Harry really did vanquish Voldemort as a child, Harry is sorted into slithering. Tired of trying to get along with his housemates, Harry spends his first Christmas at hogwarts with hedwig in the owlery. There he makes a friend who will stay with him for the rest of his life, and eventually become so much more.

Edit- since this got some likes imma post the link anyway :)

** *A Different Halloween* - linkffn(6439871)

Halloween happens differently, so Voldemort ends up dying on the day of the dead, which is a day Horcruxes don't mean anything. He dies permanently. Dumbledore doesn't believe it, and goes crazy trying to prove Voldemort is back.

Besides that drama, the Hogwarts years are fun.

Also, Dudley is boy who lived.

*** This one is a toss-up for me as I couldn't get through like the second chapter just because the author keeps referring to characters by first+middle name rather than just first name or last name. It's so off-putting and breaks the flow of reading that I had to put it down.

**** I haven't read the story but the author is Robst so I can make a few predictions.

- Harry and Hermione will INSTANTLY be friends/attracted to each other/betrothed.

- The goblin nation will bend over backwards for Lord Harry James Potter, supplying him with every single solution for all his problems ranging from magical credit cards to international portkeys to horcrux removal rituals.

- Hermione's dad will be a raging frothing buffoon who "just doesn't get that Harry and Hermione are soulmates" while Hermione's mom will accept Harry as her own at the first meeting.

- Dumbledore, Snape, Ron and Voldemort will be the most incompetent antagonists in the story to give a sense of "challenge" that Harry James, along with "his betrothed" will overcome within a single paragraph.

- There will probably be a class trip that takes more or less the entire Hogwarts student body to some tropical island that Harry owns.

Just your standard Robst starter pack.

***** - No horcruxes, Voldemort is dead.
- Dumbledore is the antagonist, but barely.
- Don't recall any goblins.
- Yes for instant attraction. As toddlers.
- Don't remember a trip. Could be wrong.
- I think Snape is in jail the whole fic.
- I think the dad front is concern at most.

I haven't read the fic in a while, so I could be wrong on some of these.

It's like a Robst-lite fic.

*** To be fair there is plenty of things authors could use to make it more eventful without using an outright separation of cannon. Harry is a famous child, which at best knows nothing about his world and at wrist is an anxiety-ball of abuse. And this is without using commonly used plot-lines that aren't troops, like muggle/magical war, or giving him an interesting work post-Hogwarts, like something in politics, a job that makes him travel the world like curse-breaking or even making him become a Dark Lord himself or even just a criminal (anything from a petty thief to a mob boss). Really, there are lots of possible plot-devices
