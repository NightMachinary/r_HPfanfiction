Any fics out there where Voldemort has prepared a Deadman's trigger to go off in the event of his demise?

Such as a Zombie apocalypse/etc


** I'll be on the lookout, but the thing is, this concept is anathema to Voldemort. Voldemort's whole goal is to never die, immortality, so to even think about making a dead man's switch would, to him, be as if he were accepting his mortality. But I'm sure there is one out there.
