/My theme: Writers with thousands of synonyms for green./

Verdant, his luminous leaf-like eyes shone out like glittering emeralds from underneath his shiny frames, seeming to case a grassy coloured glow directly into her soul. It made her heart thump in her chest as she saw his eyes flicker, looking for to the world like a particularly polished green bottle or a fantastic specimens of sea glass. Glaucous would be how she'd describe it if not due to the fact his eyes were so much more; they flowed in the dim light of the classroom and she basked in their viridescence. Like peas with black painted flecks on them, she watched entranced as his eyes once more came to rest on her face. She quelled a blush; how dare he have such a beautiful, nature-inspired sage-like eye colour. No, it would not do. So, fuelled with jealousy at the lover she desperately wanted, she said:

“Mr. Potter, start writing your lines now!”

Once he realised that Umbridge had his best interests at heart, she knew the dulled olive colour after one of their sessions would brighten like a flower on a sunny day. Then, she would gaze longingly into those toad green wells and they would kiss. Rose petals on her jumper with the thorns in his eyes, one day...


** Manipulative!Dumbledore:

"It's over, old man!" Harry ejaculated smugly. "I've seen through your lies, and I won't be your little pawn willing to die so you can take all the credit for defeating Tommy boy."

"Lemon drop?" Bumbledork twinkled.

Twin emerald orbs merely glared in response. No doubt the confection was laced with some foul potion.

"So let me get this straight," the manipulative old coot sighed. "You believe that I am a secret dark lord, that I've been manipulating your life since before you were born, and that I intend to have you killed for my personal gain. And your reaction to this was to confront me in my office, with no witnesses?"

Harry's wand leapt out of its charmed, invisible wand holster in response, but he had only a moment to remember that the codger was, in fact, a very powerful wizard before everything went black.

*** I appreciate the use of “ejaculated smugly”. Very trope-y.

**** I am almost certain the expression was not talking about the words, but that Harry was actually stroking his tiny wizard in the headmaster's office as he yelled at him.

Nothing says I'm pissed like wanking in someone's office without a warning.
