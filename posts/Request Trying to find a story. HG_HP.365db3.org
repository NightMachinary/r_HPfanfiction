Always been a fan of Harry potter fiction, i remember a few years ago reading a "one-shot" about Hermione Granger visiting Harry's grave with his child.

It might have later become a chapter in a novel i'm not sure but it made an impression on me at the time i'd like to find it again. Anybody out there able to point me in the right direction?

** I know it's not the fic you're looking for, but I would recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6821173/1/Her-Biggest-Mistake][Her Biggest Mistake]] as a similar fic. Sort of.
