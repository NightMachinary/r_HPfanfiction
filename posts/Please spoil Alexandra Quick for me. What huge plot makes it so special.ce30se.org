So I was trying to read Alexandra Quick and reached the part where she was taking tests to be placed at a level and so far, Alexandra is dull and all her other friends are dull as her. There hasn't been anything interesting happening since she fell from the bridge. All the girls with her are so dull thus far. What makes it that special and loved? I started reading this series expecting to be sucked in and I really wanted to be an Alexandra Quick fan, but so far, I can't.

Does the series contain an interesting plot twist or anything of the sort? What is the overarching plot of the books? What makes it so interesting? Is Alexandra still a brat by the end if the series?

I'm sorry if I came off as rude, it's just my opinion and I want to be proven wrong because I really want to be an Alexandra Quick fan.


** I liked it because it's Harry Potter style magic and nearly everything else is new.

** I only read the first two fics like ten years ago. I didn't like the MC much, she seemed too bull-headed and annoying. The special thing about her iirc was that her dad was a powerful dark wizard-type revolutionary that was against the US magical government. He had fathered several children and was covertly trying to train them / make them woke against the man. Also there was a cop that was the headmistress' sister trying to entrap Alexandra. And some other crap I don't remember.

** I remember reading all the fics in one weekend way back when. When that death happened in one of the sequels, it made me tear up. Looking back, I definitely wouldn't claim it was the best fanfic ever written.

What it's good at is building a whole new magical country and school that at the time didn't exist. It's explanation for house elves and treatment of Native American people is a whole lot better than anything on Pottermore, that's for sure. I still reckon its setting is better than the magical America we got in the FB movies. If the first book left you unmoved, I'm honestly not sure your experience would improve reading further.

** I can tell you that the second book is better than the first. Instead of outright spoiling it, I'll just show you one of the scenes that happens soon after her second year at Charmbridge begins. I think it illustrates why people like the series so much.

Alexandra begrudgingly joins a secret school society for dark magic, because she was invited and she can't suppress her curiosity. I think the idea is really well-done --- the members are overly dramatic, as kids in a dark magic society would probably be. But they're clearly tapping into something that they don't have complete control over.

#+begin_quote
  The two Mors Mortis members stepped back, careful not to disturb the line of black sand, and then the girl held out her wand.

  "/Ata'iye chindu nayake ha tepwen ata'ehi/," intoned the girl. Alexandra guessed it was an Indian language, though the girl, with pale freckled skin and long blonde hair, looked about as non-Indian as could be.

  The other three Mors Mortis Society members all began chanting now: "/Su-su na! Su-su na! Su-su na! Su-su na!/" Alexandra almost found it comical --- until she saw the painted figures on the stone wall begin moving. They squirmed and scattered out of the way, and the rock on which they were painted turned dark, as if a shadow had passed over it, and then darker still, until it was a black void, like a starless sky. As this happened, everyone heard another sound, replacing the chanting of the students as they fell silent. It was low, deep, almost subliminal, something halfway between a whisper and a moan. It issued forth from the dark space where the rock wall had been, and was joined by other voices, all of them whispering and chanting and murmuring tonelessly. Alexandra blinked and looked around, because if she didn't concentrate on it, she could almost imagine she wasn't really hearing anything. The expressions of everyone else in the room showed the same confusion and unease that she felt.

  Then something came out of the darkness.

  Darla and Angelique weren't the only ones to jump and squeal. Alexandra even saw Tomo gasp. She felt her own heart beat faster a moment, as a dark shade drifted into the room, and hovered there over the bowl, without seeming to notice it.

  Alexandra got the impression of a face and form that was human, though she couldn't precisely /see/ it. It was like looking at black smoke in the darkness. More than the human-like figure, though, she sensed something else, as its eyes --- what she supposed must be eyes, in what she supposed must be a face --- scanned the room.

  Ill will. That was the feeling Alexandra got, like a cold breeze blowing across all of them. She saw others shuddering as well and averting their gazes. Whatever entity the Mors Mortis Society had summoned, it was not friendly.

  It drifted to and fro, while the students muttered and shivered, but it seemed bounded by the line of black sand. Then the blonde girl pointed her wand.

  "/Anathema jibay/!" she declaimed, and the smoky black figure was sucked back into the void. She waved her wand again, and the blackness faded to stone gray, the wall became solid again, and the painted figures returned to their previous places.

  Everyone was quiet for a moment. Then the girl turned and smiled at them --- looking triumphant and, Alexandra thought, a little relieved.

  "They won't tell you, in Magical Theory classes or even in Advanced Thaumaturgy, that you can do things like that," she said softly. "What you just saw was a portal to the Lands Beyond. We just conjured a spirit. And I sent it back."

** There's all sorts of twists and turns and exciting developments. Alexandra's still a huge brat by book four, although she's better in some ways.

But the thing is that for me at least, and I'd bet a lot of the AQ fans, is they like the characters and world building equal to or above the plot. You don't like the characters, and don't seem to enjoy the world building and scene setting.

That's fine! You don't have to like all the things. But it's hard to recommend you keep going when from what you've posted you don't like any of the series' strengths or have any real interest or desire to continue beyond an abstract wish to be a fan.

All I could say is give the characters a chance, don't just write them off immediately. And while there are times where the plot and action comes fast and heavy, there's many moments of downtime, focused on looking at the characters, and the society they live in. (Which, I think, is essential to a lot of the later tensions and plottings, but hey).

So if that's not really your speed, hey, you gave it a shot right? I think you did like 8 or 9 chapters out of 30, that's almost a third, and that's more than a fair shake. No shame in bowing out, if you want.

** I enjoy Alexandra as a flawed protagonist. I really adore the world building and whimsical magic, similar to the main series. The plot expands far greater in the most recent two books and in the last one in particular. If you don't like it, you don't like it, just finish the first one and don't continue on if you're not enjoying it.

** I liked how she figured out way to use spells before getting her education---without incantations, but with silly little rhymes, that's a clever way of showing the character being both smart and magically talented. Aside from that I thought it was fairly /meh/, I only started reading it because I saw it had its own subreddit, which I assumed spoke to its above-average quality but in the end it didn't. I dropped the story once her true heritage was revealed. I thought she was Harry's daughter because of her physical description and talent, but once that was dispelled I lost interest lol

** I've had the exact same experience as you at the exact same time. Tried it, gave up earlier today, a few chapters into Thorn Circle. Can't bring myself to read further to understand the appeal. I'm sure it's there for many people (of course it is) but Alexandra is just too... unlikable for me. I can't stand having to read about her.

** I read all of it, the entire set, and I wish I hadn't. I, like you, had heard so many great things about it, that I slogged through; it was, quite frankly, a monumental waste of time. Now, if it had been from the POV of her father....that would have been a far better read. The best compliment I can pay the author is that she did a great job of writing from the POV of a tween/young teenager, complete with teenage angst, inanity, and highlighted by the main character always convinced/thinking her way is better and moderate talent/some small amount of creativity equates to genius. Honestly, there are many far better (better written, more interesting, more sensical, better built worlds, etc.) fanfics out there, of a similar length to spend your time reading. Prince of the Dark Kingdom is a good one (abandoned) and Out of the Night is another (also abandoned)--and despite being abandoned with no hope of completion, they are still far far far better reads and investments of time.

*** You know what, sure. I've wanted to write up a summary of the series for a while. Here's a full recap of the first four books, in all it's spoilery glory. Read as much or as little as you'd like:

(I've had to omit some stuff because it's a long series and this is only meant as a summary)

/Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle:/

#+begin_quote
  Alex is introduced to the wizarding world by Lillith Grimm, Dean of Charmbridge academy, and is offered a scholarship to attend. Alex agrees to attend the school, only to find that it's heavily rigged against muggle-borns, and that someone keeps trying to kill her. She begins to suspect that the reason someone wants her dead might have to do with the identity of her father, who left her mother when she was a baby.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  After much investigating and more than a little rule-breaking, she reaches the conclusion that her father is the dark wizard Abraham Thorn, who attempted to assassinate the Governor General of the Confederation of American Wizards, basically the wizard president, around the time Alex was born. .

  After he kidnaps one of her friends, Alex is forced to confront the man who has been trying to kill her: school caretaker and rogue member of her father's inner circle, Ben Journey. He shoots her, but she is protected by a ward her father placed on her, which kills Journey in her place. His death leads to the whole school finding out about her parentage.
#+end_quote

/Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below/:

#+begin_quote
  Now that Alex knows the identity of her father, the Confederation is very eager to get their hands on any information she has about him. To that end, Alex is introduced to the auror Diana Grimm, who is the twin sister of Charmbridge's Dean, and is assigned to tracking down Alex's father.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  Alex returns to Charmbridge to find a bunch of older exchange students from a militaristic school called the Blacksburg Magery Institute. Due to her reputation, she is invited to join an illegal dark magic club, the Mors Mortis Society, within the school. Many others are also invited, including one of her friends (Darla), and one of the BMI students (Max). During one of the society's meetings, Alex refuses to torture animals and storms out, humiliating the society's leader John Manuelito.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  After confronting and briefly being tortured by John, Alex is rescued by Max, who reveals that he is also Abraham Thorn's child. He starts teaching her how to duel, and the two of them become inseparable. He introduces her to Abraham Thorn, who has been in hiding for the last decade. Abraham attempts to bond with Alex, but she is naturally skeptical of his intentions after his long absence. Over Easter, Max takes Alex to meet his family, who Alex quickly bonds with, especially his younger sister Julia.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  During the trip, we find out that Max is working for Abraham to find a way into a secretive realm known as the Lands Below. Through her friendship with the library house elves, Alex discovers how to get into the Lands Below. After a brief fight with Darla and John, she and Max travel there together. They eventually meet the rulers of the realm, an elf like race called the Generous Ones, and try to negotiate on behalf of their father. Due to a cultural misunderstanding, Max inadvertently offers the Generous Ones a human sacrifice, which they eagerly accept. The Generous Ones attempt to sacrifice Alex, but Max finds out and is forced to take her place to save her.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  Max dies and Alex barely escapes with her life, leaving her emotionally and physically scarred. After escaping the Lands Below she is confronted by her father, who takes from her the means of controlling the portals to the Lands Below, and uses it to perform a terrorist attack against the Confederation, killing hundreds of wizards and muggles alike and crippling the Confederation's train network.
#+end_quote

/Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment:/

#+begin_quote
  The Confederation is reeling after Abraham Thorn's attack, and has passed a series of draconian laws targeting anyone suspected of being a dark wizard. Alex's friend Anna has her father arrested to prevent him from running for the wizards congress. Alex meanwhile, is heavily traumatised by Max's death, and is determined to find a way to bring him back with magic. She repeatedly gets herself into trouble in this quest, culminating in her stealing a time turner from one of her own sisters, but being caught before she could use it. After being rightfully told off by her friends and family alike, she decides to make up for some of her misdeeds by working with Diana to free Anna's father. However she doesn't give up on her quest to bring back Max.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  Darla, who was expelled for her involvement with the Mors Mortis Society, but un-expelled due to her family's connections, offers to help Alex in exchange for information about the Lands Below. She gives Alex a very illegal book about Death and the Lands Beyond (Note: the Lands Below and the Lands Beyond are two completely different places).
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  Alex succeeds in traveling to the Lands Beyond and meets with Death himself. Death offers to resurrect Max if Alex nominates someone else to die in his place. But as much as she wants to bring back Max, Alex can't bring herself to kill someone else to do so.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  After Alex returns to the land of the living, Darla uses the information Alex gave her to kidnap Innocence Prichard, one of Alex's friend's sisters, and tries to sacrifice her to the Generous Ones. Alex follows Darla, and succeeds in stopping her, but is forced to promise the Generous Ones that she will return to them and allow herself to be sacrificed in 7 years time. The Generous Ones also reveal that the Confederation sacrifices a pureblood child to them every 7 years in exchange for control over the portals to the Lands Below, the so called "Deathly Regiment", which has been going on for centuries. After returning to the over world, Darla sacrifices herself to the Lands Beyond, despite Alex's attempts to save her. We later find out that the next child to be sacrificed was going to be Darla's sister Mary.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  So after a particularly traumatic year, Alex has finally come to terms with her brothers death, and has finally come to appreciate her friends, but now she knows the Confederation's Dark secret, and has a mere seven years left to live.
#+end_quote

/Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above:/

#+begin_quote
  Alex is determined not to die in seven years. She wants to find a way to alter her fate, and for the first time, she trusts her friends enough to let them help her. Someone keeps trying to kill her again, but this time they're not afraid to put her friends at risk as well. Alex is sure it's John Manuelito from Book 2, working with Darla's younger sister Mary, who has a grudge against Alex for her sisters death. Mary attempts to attack Alex, but Alex is able to talk her down, and she confirms she has been in contact with John.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  While home on summer break, one of Alex's muggle friends is attacked, and she is forced to bring in Livia, one of her half-sisters, to save her friend. Livia reveals that Alex's mother Claudia is actually another one of her half-sisters, and that Alex has been lied to her entire life. Alex's real mother was the third sister of Lillith and Diana Grimm, who was irreversibly obliviated during a confrontation between Abraham and Diana. Furious at her parents, at John, and at the world in general, Alex runs away from home and decides to track down and stop John herself.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  Alex tracks down John to the Navajo territory, where she's involved in an extended action sequence in which she burns down John's house, accidentally attacks and auror, and is then forced to flee across the desert with a couple of muggles from a pack of werewolves. This culminates in Alex single-handedly fighting off John, his followers, and a bunch of evil spirits until a team of aurors arrive. John is able to escape, however.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  After returning to Charmbridge, Alex's friends help her in finding out about her destiny. They convene a meeting of the Parliament of Stars, another higher being similar to Death. The Stars Above reveal that Alex was destined to die even before she was born, and that Abraham Thorn knew about it, but ignored the prophecy. They offer Alex the chance to work for them after she dies in exchange for more information, but she declines.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  During her trip to the Navajo country, Alex was attacked by a nigh indestructible nemesis spirit, and now it has followed her all the way back to her school. She comes up with a plan to kill it, but in executing it she inadvertently allows John into the school. Alex succeeds in trapping the spirit in the Lands Below, but is captured by John in the process. He breaks her wand and reveals that her death was prophesised to bring down the Confederation, and that he intends to fulfill the prophecy. Alex escapes, and John is killed by Diana, but not before revealing that he wasn't the one trying to kill Alex at the start of the book. The real culprit remains unknown.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  After she recovers, Alex is immediately expelled for endangering other students, forcing her to return home to her step-father and her mother-who's-really-her-sister. Abraham offers to teach her, but she rejects and denounces him for his ongoing terrorist attacks against magical schools. Thus the book ends with Alex stuck in the the muggle world, wand-less, school-less, and with just 6 years to live.

Sorry that I can't help you answer your question, but the summaries and the first few pages convinced me over a decade ago, that I will not enjoy this. It sounded incredibly boring and nothing special at all, even back then in 2007.
