I don't like the concept of the deathly Hallows as in Canon A wand that is supposed to be unbeatable if you're descended from the three brothers and have won it from the previous owner A cloak that makes you invisible or supposed to (Moody's eye missus noris) The stone brings ghost /shades of your loved one's (given to harry so he can have a family moment before death They were introduced waaaay to late in the series and have inconsistency and 2 of the 3 are not even relevant 2 99% of the series. idk I feel they are just cheap and were not needed at all in the book harry should have killed voldamort some other way And that brings up another question was Dumbledore just powerful and experienced or was it the elder wand that made Dumbledore able to mach voldamort? Because if it was just age and experience than the flemels should be the most powerful magic user's of the age thief 665 for merlins sake they created a form of immortality they should have been able to make voldamort piss himself in fear!


** I feel like the Hallows need a bit of defending as they have always been scattered throughout the books.

Book 1 - Dumbledore had James' cloak before he died because it was a Hallow. Book 6 - The first time the Deathly Hallows are together in the series is chapter 1 and again throughout the book as Dumbledore has the stone and the wand, and tells Harry to keep the cloak with him at all times. Book 7 - Harry has the stone and the cloak with him throughout and Voldemort gets the wand. The Hallows also explain Dumbledore's and Grindlewald's past.

The fact that there are three Hallows I think is very clever. Just because we don't understand them until book 7 isn't a bad thing. It's the same with the Horcrux's, we first know about the diary in book two, but don't understand it or know it's from a set of 7 until book 6.

The Hallows aren't infallible. They were made by very intelligent wizards (not Death himself) so I think it's perfectly reasonable that Harry's cloak can be seen by Moody's eye and the Elder wand can be beaten. They are just powerful magical objects. Harry beat Voldemort due to a combination of wand ownership and the Elder wand.

If we remove the Hallows then Harry just has a cloak which is a famiy heirloom (okay fine). However, Dumbledore and Grindlewald's past then has no explanation at all. So we then have to discount why Dumbledore had to be the one to defeat Grindlewald and why Dumbledore had Harry's cloak to name a few.

Also we know Dumbledore is powerful because he beat Grindlewald in a duel. Voldemort also feared Dumbledore because Dumbledore knew his past.

Pretty sure stipulation's not cannon- it's unbeatable for anyone that properly owns it as long as they're holding it at the time and don't /want/ to lose.

  Moody's eye
#+end_quote

Also possibly Dumbledore- he spotted the trio while they were under the cloak, or seemed to, in Hagrid's shack in year 2. The popular fan theory seen in many a fanfiction is Dumbledore, wanting to keep track of Harry put a tracking charm on Harry and/or his glasses/the cloak itself (using the power of the Elder Wand to achieve it.) One theory that doesn't seem ever used is Dumbledore and moody were both a part of the goverment and could possibly piggyback off the underage wizards trace that all underage wizards and witches, or possibly their wands, have.

As to why the Flammels didn't just show up along with Voldy and wreck his shit instead of choosing to die right before the war they probably knew was coming- well, I've always enjoyed the theory that they were squibs- alchemy isn't shown in the series, who knows if it needs active magic.

Also, whose to say the flammels aren't blood bigots?

Though that brings into question why they didn't fight on either side- but we don't know exactly how the stone works- does it reduce physical age or just keep you unaging? I've seen a fic or two where the Flammels were weak with old age, the stone imperfect

*** How did Dumbledore beat grindalwald then ? He owned the wand by getting it off that Europe wandmaker yet Dumbledore beat him in 1945?

**** Same way the others beat the owner of the Elder wand- by either having beaten them before- and thus already been the true owner- plausible- especially since they fought at least once before their final fight ending in the death of Dumbledore's sister- or Dumbledore snuck in to his room while he was sleeping, or snuck behind him while he was otherwise occupied and zapped him with a stunning spell.

The wand's only unbeatable if you're it's true owner and you actually have the thing out after all- if it even is unbeatable- I've always taken it to mean it's just a really powerful wand, since, you know, the owners of it keep getting killed and beaten.

**** Dumbledore was the only one who /could/ defeat a Grindelwald armed with the Elder wand: he used his 'bedroom' face. Their epic duel has never been documented because it was a private affair.

***** Probably, Grindelwald might have hesitated because of some left over feelings and Dumbledore took advantage of that (so it's not so much an epic duel as Dumbledore taking advantage of one of the few weaknesses of Grindelwald: His connection to Dumbledore!)

** Mrs Norris is a cat. Animals rely on more of their senses than just sight. She likely smells Harry and is looking towards where the scent is coming from.

And the eye can be said to have been enchanted by the Elder Wand, making it as powerful as the cloak and therefore able to see through it.

Both incidents were likely written before the DHs were finalized.

Not gonna read the rest because stream of consciousness combined with lack of punctuation and text walls is my kryptonite.

** I agree, I'd have loved for Harry to truly have to find a way to fight Voldemort.

His sacrifice was ok kind of, but also a cheap cop-out with the wand and all (especially since Harry being a loyal fucking dog doesn't even want to keep any of the hollows except for the cloak)...

Then again I'd have loved a true hero's journey not succeeding through luck, chance, stupidity and the sacrifice of other people (I really dislike canon Harry, he's a stupid sheep lead to the slaughter (no better than the world he's sacrificing himself for, a world that puts him on a pedestal one moment and reviles/hates him the next, just because the shittiest newspaper known to men says so!) and lacks any backbone and true independent thinking what so ever, he's even more Dumbledore's man than Hagrid (and Hagrid at least has something to be thankful for, while Dumbledore IMHO ruined Harry's life by shipping him to the Dursleys like a fucking parcel!))...Harry is so much below average (in his actions, his school scores might actually be ok) that I wanted to punch him sometimes! He lets people get away with too much IMHO, he's too forgiving (for a supposed damaged child - Rowling admitted that there was more abuse than the books show us because the publisher didn't want it in the books - he's too trusting and too forgiving!)
