Hi, Y'all!

I know I have this HPff 'Favorited' or Bookmarked, either on FFN (over 1000 favs) or AO3 (ditto ;D), but I can't find it and it's driving me *crazy-er*!

What I remember: Harry manages to get to the house in Godric's Hollow and discovers that it's still livable and functional. He starts reading all his parents' old schoolbooks and begins teaching himself magic and Potions. He doesn't understand that wands are crafted, so he finds himself a likely candidate; a stick from the yard and becomes able to cast with it!

I remember that he makes a point of casting some household spells to repel all types of vermin and I think that Hedwig doesn't appreciate that he includes mice.

I think that the Goblins are friendly with him or just very helpful.

I do remember that either the original Wards or something Harry does keeps the MOB Dumbledore from entering and/or seeing the property, so he springs Sirius from Azkaban in an attempt get Harry to come out or just verify that Harry's in there.

It's a great story (I do so love to see Dumby thwarted! ;D)!

Can anybody help me find this one?

Thanks!

** This sounds familiar. Was he /really/ young, like preschool age when he found the Godrics Hollow house? Did he accidentally embarrass himself by going to Diagon alley or something and he was still wearing his toddler clothes that he had just used magic to make bigger? I think the author called them dickies or dungarees or something? It was a word that I wasn't familiar with and I had to look it up, thats why its sticking out in my memory.

*** I think you may be right about that one. I remember that he created some type of machine or process that allowed him to catalog vast amounts of data.

But all the links to the story, even "[[https://hpfanficarchive.com][hpfanficarchive.com]]" are dead ends. Sigh!

If anyone finds a link that still works I'd be most grateful!

Tks! ;D
