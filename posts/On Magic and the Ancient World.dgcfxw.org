One thing I've always been fascinated with is Ancient History; and in this instance I've been thinking about how the magic of the Wizarding World would've worked during the time of Ancient Greece, Egypt, Rome, et al. It's my theory that any recognizable form of formal magical training didn't exist outside of the multitude of religious cults (I'm using the original definition of that word here) that existed at that time, and even then it would've been greatly limited in scope. Beyond that, I believe that magical ability would've been mostly instinctual in nature, with it occasionally being expressed in the form of enchanted arms and armour (think of the various heroes seen in Greek Mythology with their exceptional feats of strength and the enchanted/blessed gear they used). As to the existence of the gods, I'm more inclined to say that they remain in the realm of metaphor, with the abilities of magical humans being explained away as divine favour.

If anyone has any similar thoughts, please feel free to share here. I would love to work out a more comprehensive view of magic and it's uses during Classical Antiquity.


** So, I actually studied magic in the Greco-Roman world as part of my degree! It's an enormous field, if you have any specific questions ask away and I'll do my best to answer or point you in the right direction at least.

There are some great witches in Greek and Roman literature - Circe, Medea, Canidia and my fave, Erichtho. Erichtho is so horrifyingly gruesome she makes Voldemort look like a puppy dog, I love her.

In a practical sense, things like curse tablets (inscribed lead that was folded, rolled, pierced and/or buried), spells invoking deities/spirits, potions, herbs and amulets were used for anything from defaming a legal opponent to attracting a lover.

As for matching the history with JKR's world, I like the idea of there being a school for witches in Thessaly - maybe like Plato's Academy, but for witchcraft. There's a tradition of 'Thessalian witches' (Erichtho was from Thessaly!), particularly in this weird practice called 'the drawing-down of the moon', the purpose of which was for erotic magic.

There were also professional (male) practitioners - mages, beggar-priests, diviners - who created curse tablets, spells, purifications for a fee. And the deliciously spooky ventriloquists, who had ghosts/demons living in their stomachs that spoke through their mouths.

I also love the idea of the various 'Mysteries' (most famously, the Eleusinian Mysteries) having something to do with magic, which is why they were kept so secret and separate.

*** As someone who loves bringing actual historical flavour to Harry Potter, especially since Rowling's historical understanding is... Flawed... I really enjoyed reading this. Any plans to write a fic that explores any of this?

I haven't heard of Erictho, why is she your favourite?

**** No plans - the thought had never crossed my mind to be honest!

Erichtho is just SO extra. She shoos ghosts away from tombs so she can sleep in them instead. Her face "exhibits a foul and wasted decay" (remind you of anyone?) and she feasts on human flesh. The gods are terrified of her; snakes burst apart when she breathes on them.

She's in Book 6 of Lucan's Pharsalia, definitely check it out if you're intrigued. Here's another lovely quote: "At the funeral of a relation the dreadful Thessalian presses herself upon his limbs, dear to her as they are, and, while fixing kisses upon them, hacks bits off his head. With her teeth she releases the mouth, frozen shut, and, biting the end of the tongue that sticks fast in the dry throat, pours mutterings between the chill lips and sends secret and criminal orders down to the Stygian ghosts."

****** Oh god. OH GOD. I need that beautiful romance to exist in this world. Maybe I'll write it in January. It feels like something that should be written in January.

I also just remembered Canidia, supposedly an ex-lover of Horace. He writes about her in his Satires and Epodes. One of his Satires makes me giggle childishly every time I read it, it's written from the point of view of a statue to the god Priapus. Basically the statue watches Canidia and her witchy pal break into an old burial ground and call up a ghost from the underworld, but the statue farts in fear, the witches freak out, and they run away so fast their false teeth and wigs fall off.

** Pretty sure I stole that from some fanfiction, but I always liked the idea that the romans were the ones to invent wands. That allowed for an easier use of magic and copy paste spells, which is why they are all latin, and enables the roman empire to so heavily expand. Not sure how religion fits into it, but I guess Zeus and friends couldâ€˜ve been simply really powerful wizards of their time with knowledge of runes or wandless magic.

** This is heavily up to your own desires/preferences in terms of fanfiction - we know there's some famous witches/wizards from that time even still ingrained in the WW's identity (some of the chocolate frog cards include Circe, Agrippa (who I refuse to believe isn't the famous Roman Agrippa), Morgana, and Merlin (the latter two being debatable in where to place them - I favor the end of the Roman presence in Britain).

The approach that I personally like to take is to imagine wanded magic as a Roman innovation - at least in Britain. Given how much the Romans loved to adapt/steal from other people, that would make it probably more of a Greek thing. I also like the appeal of having different types of magic - druidic magic using staves in the celtic areas of Europe, for instance, or steppe people using shamanic/ritual magic, and those of the middle east/Egypt having their own twist to it.

Magic itself would be less refined, less standardized - I imagine it more raw, with perhaps more potential - but also more danger.

I also enjoy them having an impact on the world - so picking and choosing real life people to slot into the role of a wizard or witch. For instance Alexander the Great being a magical conqueror of great skill wouldn't be something I'm opposed to - or perhaps having the services of the wizards/witches of Greece in his conquests. Integrating them closely with the mundane power of the era would also give some other interesting options - for instance, having the crisis of the 3rd century be aggravated by a split in the magical community of the Roman Empire, and having part of Diocletian's reforms be to do a separation between them to prevent that sort of splintering from happening.

** Honestly I'd be happy with either Canon or some fics expanding even on the modern world, as we see nothing outside of UK in books, and I don't think I've ever seen a fic that tried to show us the rest of Europe in some greater or more interesting capacity.

*** I've had some ideas for a more expanded Wizarding World / heavily AU Europe, but it's hard to figure out what kind of fic/plot would work well to showcase it.

There's a ton of potential for how to do it - in a much more interesting way than canon, which kinda ignores it entirely (even in book 4). Like my first inclination is to have Western Europe shaped by a French Revolution that had a very different impact in the WW - but people could go in a very different direction with it, too.

** If you're not slash-averse, you should check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of A Linear Circle]], a very, very long series that goes into a thorough exploration of a medieval Europe that has magic. Like, if the Wizarding World actually existed prior to the statue of secrecy going into effect in the 1700s, which essentially means that everybody knew about magic before that. Lots of legend and court intrigue, stuff like that, and very well researched and thought out.

** I had sort of a crazy idea for a fiction that gods do exist (formed from magic and belief, think American gods sort of logic) and that somehow they were put to sleep around 800-1000 years ago. Since then magic has been decaying/weakening.

A magical cult though has been sacrificing magicals to the gods to wake them again (druids? Which is why magical population has been shrinking) and manages to wake them at the time of Voldemort's attack on Harry's family. The most powerful gods begin to wake first and in their specific country's. Each god wants to choose a champion to furfill their goals and magic begins to become stronger again. Fae and all other mythologies included too.

I quite liked the idea of Morrigan taking an interest in making Harry her champion.

*** Well, I feel like the easiest explanation for most of those great feats is that with each retelling of the story they became a little bit bigger, a bit more fantastical, and a bit more exaggerated; kinda like how that fish you caught kept getting bigger each time you told that story.
