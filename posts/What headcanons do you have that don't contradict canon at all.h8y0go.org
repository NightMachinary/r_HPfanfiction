** Voldemort's jinx on DADA is strong because it's based on a perceived wrong: Voldemort was the most qualified candidate for the position and until a better candidate is chosen, no DADA professor will last more than a year.

Strong magic in general needs a weakness. The fidelius is OP because it has a major weakness: you're placing all your trust in a single person. Likewise creating an impenetrable room is hard and won't last. Create an impenetrable room where you need to fit some characteristics to enter is a lot easier and the magic would last longer and be stronger.

Magic is abstract and all forms of spell casting is basically a short ritual where wand movement + incantation is used to symbolize an effect and bring it to reality. Advance Wizards can shorten this ritual (less wand movements, nonverbal magic)

Magic does not cause physical exhaustion. It is a mentally tasking activity.

The average modern wizard would know more magic and be better at magic than the average Wizards before the founding of Hogwarts.

Magical theory is more akin to philosophy. Advance magic is hard because it requires knowledge of advance theory/philosophy and it requires great mental exertion.

Some people have an innate talent with one or more field. Something about their minds make it easier for them to learn and do magic of that particular field.

You don't really need obscure or exotic magic to be powerful. If you look at the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort, they're taking things taught in Hogwarts and dialing it up to 11.

A N.E.W.T student might spend half an hour trying to conjure a wooden shield. Voldemort can do it non verbally with a single flick of his wand. And it's both a big shield and a silver shield. An average wizard might be able to animate one statue. Dumbledore can animate multiple at the same time nonverbally and with a single flick of his wand.

Voldemort age 17 could probably out duel most aurors.

The Sorting Hat takes into account the traits you consider most important not just the traits you have.

The killing curse does not remove your soul. It flicks a binary switch where your attribute of Alive becomes Dead. The removal of a soul does not cause instant death as seen by victims of the Dementor's Kiss.

Magic progress and new things are discovered as time goes on.

There are arbitrary rules and characteristics to magic that have been discovered or theorized to exist. Nobody knows why, and there are continual philosophical debates on where these characteristics and rules come from.

This could be a fun friendship fic. Harry and Ron join the Aurors after Hogwarts and one of their first cases is the mysterious death of yet another DADA teacher. McGonagall convinces Harry and Ron and the rest of their Auror team to rotate teaching the DADA classes while they investigate so that the students don't miss any learning time. Step 3: ??? Eventually, they solve the case and its somehow revealed that the curse on the DADA position was lifted when Harry took the teaching position because the curse considered Harry a 'more qualified' candidate because Harry defeated Voldemort. Ron, well aware that Harry never graduated Hogwarts, laughs his ass off.

**** Yeah this was mainly a response to how in a lot of "time travel to the Founder eras" the magic is there is older, more powerful, more useful. I've read a couple of fics where the Founders were teaching students way to block the Killing Curse, and they all knew super wandless magic and how to cure Werewolves, but these techniques were eventually "lost" to time forever.

​

I mean yeah there might be certain magic that is useful but was lost. But I feel like a majority of modern magic is just better than older magic.

**** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21468571][Twenty-nine]] has a very similar premise to yours and InquistorCOC.

It's fantastically written and by the author of the Language of Plants series - although with a different tone, one that makes it more of a murder mystery fic than the slight mad air Harry had.

Very little of the fic has romance, so it should be readable by those who don't like slash.

- He sent a letter to Ron, praising Professor Umbridge

- He sent back his Christmas jumper, despite that being a gift freely given, with no strings attached.

- He further avoided contact with his family for two years, following Voldemort's reveal at the Department of Mysteries. It's quite apparent that it was not his idea to visit during Christmas in /Half-Blood Prince./

** Using the term Headcanon broadly, in the sense that while it as far as I am aware doesn't contradict anything in canon, but doesn't much evidence for it.

- When Dumbledore became Headmaster he placed an enchantment on the student body at Hogwarts, altering fate so no Student dies while at school, which resulted in lots of coincidences that prevented students from dying when they should have, like nobody directly meeting the gaze of the Basilisk. In function it's basically the opposite of the jinx Voldemort placed on the Defense against the Dark Arts position. This enchantment faded after Dumbledore died.
- When objects and beings are exposed to magic they increasingly start to work by rules of stories and fairy tales rather than physics, which results in stuff like animals starting to behave more like they do in fables with intelligence similar to humans and technology starts to behave in a dramatic rather than predictable way(the Weasley car for example randomly developed sentience)
- The Greek/Roman gods were wizards, but not in the sense that there would have been one powerful wizards who was worshipped as one particular god(we know that did happen with other religions to a degree, in Canon the Irish Goddess Morrigan was actually a witch), but rather that there were multiple wizards over longer periods of time who muggles ended up interpreting as a single god. This fits nicely with how. Greeks often absorbed foreign mythologies and tried to fit the various gods into their own. And also explains why they often have multiple contradicting myths and occasionally act very out of character. This He
- The point of the Seeker position is find out which people are going to be relevant in the future. Wizards assume that fate will cause important people to end up in that position, because its the only position that actually matters in quidditch. Basically, wizards are aware that their universe is to a certain extent driven by a narrative that can notice things like goodness and actively cause ironic things to happen, and this is their way to find out who to watch out for.
- It was Ginny's decision to name a child after Snape. We know from the books how bad she is at naming(see Pigwidgeon) and she had much less reason to hate Snape. Harry agreed because he got to name their first child, and it was better than her other horrible suggestions.
- The Enchantment that enslaves House-Elves also forbids them from using magic to attack wizards, as explanation why we never see a house-elves except Dobby use magic offensively against wizards and why the House-Elves during the Battle of Hogwarts ha to resort to physical attacks. This also resolves the issue of why they aren't used as assassins, despite their ability to enter houses despite enchantments preventing apparition.
- You can't us Transfiguration to create potion ingredients because while its physically the same object, it wouldn't change the magical significance of the objects, meaning a cat hair transfigured into a dog hair would still count as cat hair for the purpose of magic, despite the molecular structure being identical.
- Similarly using charms on the ingredients to increase the amount(enlarging and duplication) would leave magical traces on the ingredients(according to Dumbledore magic always leaves traces) which would render them useless for potions that require the original ingredient.

*** I really, /really/ like your "fairy tale logic" theory. Looking at technology in general, it would spark and explode and release smoke and steam, even if it couldn't actually do these things just based on its makeup. So a cellphone would crackle and spark and then go dark with a puff of smoke not because the battery chemicals reacted chemically with the air, but because the cellphone as a piece of technology reacted magically with its surroundings. It would be its own entire category, separate from chemical and physical reactions.

Perhaps a greater understanding of magic is gained over time not because do the magical equivalent of lifting weights, but because you slowly develop a sense for the fantastical; you start to guess right on what will happen in any given situation if magic were to be introduced, which can then be leveraged into strengthening a spell. Say, a statue depicts a small troll. An animation charm on it might be more effective if you cast it under a bridge and gave the troll the instruction to guard the location, compared to if you cast it on an open field.

Mayhap this could be used to create differences in magic across cultures, as well! Other cultures have completely different perceptions of mythology and folklore, which would mean that their fairy-tale logic might be different.

** That there more Magical school all around the World, they just aren't one of those great big ones, like Hogwarts that Rowling had talked about, but small ones that she has never mentioned, but still have to exists, or most of the World would have hard time learning in foreing langauge that they wouldn't know any of.. (also have a headcanon that the only boarding school in my country would be the magical school of my country).

Wizards would have taken part in both World wars, figting alongside their muggle countrymen, they also had specialty units for magical stuff, but like they also where drafted to fight in the muggle front.

Most magical goverments are under the muggle one, like British magical society has minister of magic, because Queen is still their head of state (whenever Queen has more power in magical world or herself is magical debends), America is different as they have their own president runnign along with the muggle president and are of two different entities.. (tbh I have no idea how both these work in canon if ever really mentioned that deeply, though I'm pretty sure not as deeply as i'm thinking)

Statue of secrecy didn't take place in all countries at the same time, as it happened in time when not all countries where connected and some where isolated from outside (Japan and Korea come to mind), so they would have only joined in more modern time. It also wouldn't affect say isolated tribes in modern time who live in hunter gatherer society (those few we have left) and some other small tribes/groups where people aren't really in contact that much, which is why shamanism and things like that still exists, they are done by wizards etc, maybe the statue of secrecy would also allow culturally importan magical thingas to be shown to muggles, but of course they have to be things that most muggles would believe to be just believes poeple have and not real magic etc.

** Wolfstar. It's real. My evidence?

In OotP, "Remus and Sirius" send Harry defence books for Christmas. That's a very couple thing to do, especially as Harry is Sirius's godson.

In PoA upon realising what actually happened, Remus /hugs the shit/ out of Sirius. And Sirius loves it. Men in Britain did not platonically hug very often in the 90s, and even less so in the 70s, which is when 99% of Sirius's social norms will have been internalised.

Remus is noticeably absent from GoF, and Sirius is abroad for most of it. Coincidence? I think not.

People say Remus/Tonks proves that Remus/Sirius can't be real, but firstly - bitches never heard of bisexuality? And secondly - it explains his reluctance. She's his dead lovers niece, he's used to being in the closet with both his health and his relationships...

****** Agreed. One of the best fan fiction tropes in my opinion is /friends to lovers./ (Enemies to friends to lovers is even better when done properly.) Of course people can be friends. Friendships are important and should be held in high regard. Harry and Ron's bromance is one of my favorite things about Harry Potter in general. Why couldn't two characters be something more than friends though? It's just /fan fiction./ I for one consider Seamus and Dean both best friends /and/ something more.

I can ship whatever I like. Let people ship whatever they like and if that's not for you then so be it. A lot of people ship Harry and Voldemort together. Whatever floats your boat. (Harry and Ron together is actually quite popular, but true, the most common is Harry and Draco together.) Sirius and Remus being friends and lovers makes sense to me. I don't understand these people whining about fan fiction and ships in sub about fan fiction... Shipping's integral part of fan fiction. I personally don't give a damn about what people read (and sorry to say but according to Reddit people read absolute rubbish stories) or don't read.

** Transfiguration and Transmutation are two different fields.

Transfiguration is the act of magically changing and object temporarily. Sort of like editing a photo but saving the original.

Transmutation is the act of permanently altering a substance. Like editing a photo and deleting the original copy.

This is proven by the Philosopher's Stone, an object capable of transmuting any metal into gold.

The first transfiguration lesson has them turn wooden matches into metal needles, so why would they need a red rock to turn metal into another metal. Unless of course the match into needle is temporary. Then transfiguring something into gold would be useless if it just turned back after X time.

** There's a reason why many British wizards don't have an ounce of logic.

As new spells get invented over time, the founders didn't have access to the same enchantments that modern wizards do, so their version of an Aguamenti based water supply was too complicated to fit into each faucet. Instead they built one central water-creating cistern and a complicated system of pipes.

One reason why they were so powerful was that they had access to old books containing knowledge of the wizards of Rome, who developed the foundations of the European style of magic. They also had some other roman knowledge including architecture and plumbing, using /Plumbus/ aka lead.

Basically most people who lived at Hogwarts for seven years have subtle lead poisoning. A bezoar would easily fix it but most people don't ever get into a situation where they have to use one. And since all the wizards who went to Hogwarts have it any healer would ignore the subtle symptoms as normal.

*** Yes, this. I wrote further upthread that I imagine that other schools/countries probably view Hogwarts students as extremely ill-prepared for the working world because Hogwarts essentially cuts off any exposure to socialising with adults or experience of the outside world.

I also believe that continental Europe largely reformed themselves after Grindelwald (although not immune to resurgences) whereas Britain seeing themselves as the saviours basically just let shit continue and that's why they're so slow on the Voldemort front. So, fairly inline with muggle Britain.

** The beds in Hogwarts are charmed with a "sweet dreams" charm and some form of privacy enchantment. It ensures that the kids are well rested, and reduces the amount of in-dorm conflict.

There is a simple, yet effective, contraception charm that is taught early on - its the only explanation for the lack of teenager pregnancies.

There are many fields of magic not taught at Hogwarts. We know from Dumbledore considering abolishing the Divination class that the Headmaster has a lot of control over the curriculum, so over the years different magic classes have probably been added and removed based on the Headmaster's preferences and prejudices. For a couple of hundred years necromancy was one of the most popular classes, but then it was abolished by a Headmaster who scored a T on his Necromancy OWL.

My own headcanon for this is that Hogwarts contains an enchantment that renders people infertile within Hogwarts grounds. Because you're not going to be able to stop the will of teenagers in the long run, and teenagers do stupid shit, so this is the one way that would gurantee that it wouldn't happen.

***** Yeah, I don't doubt wizards, as laid back as they are on child growth, would teach the kids Necromancy. But I doubt it would be more than a Newt level class that falls on the special interest side. Most of the classes in HP are practical ones, in that they have value in day to day life. The only one I can think of that doesn't is Astronomy and even that is on the line, and Ancient Runes but that's basically a class on history of magic instead of history of magical people.

Necromency on the other is an outlier talent that has very little day to day applications. And teenagers, by their very nature, are not so interested in things they can see no use of. Maybe orphans and such but that's about it.

Ancient Runes, as I mentioned, is a history of human's understanding and use of magic. Astronomy has many effects on magic. Wolfsbane for example.
