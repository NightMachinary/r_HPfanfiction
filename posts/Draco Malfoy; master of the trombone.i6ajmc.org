Draco malfoy was a master of the trombone ever since he laid hands on one. He played every song he ever tried perfectly. Every time anyone mentions boss music, Megalovania plays in the distance on the trombone.

He is incompetent at playing any other instrument


** Considering one of my WIPs is focused partially on Sans and Draco this post was a bit like a kick in the teeth.

(The other two mcs? Harry and Davesprite. It's... kind of a fucked up au, but at least those two aren't awful.)

**** It'll be posted on ao3 if I ever get anywhere with it, but managing WIPs is not fun when you have ADD. (My handle is knightoftimehasfallendown.)

(Be warned, it will deal with slavery, partially because I fucking love revolutions, partially because antagonistic, unhealthy character dynamics are fun as hell, and partially because I think Joanne didn't handle house elves well at all.)

** This has caused my mind to try and incision the papyrus to draco's sans.

Human! You must not go to hogwarts! I, Dobby the House Elf, will stop you.
