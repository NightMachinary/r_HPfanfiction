Is there a good Fanfiction that takes place at Hogwarts but has nothing to do with the trio or Voldemort?

Like start with a group of 1st years and follow them through their Hogwarts education. No Voldemort, no Grindelwald, no Marauders, no weird Cursed Child.

Over the course of 7 seasons get to know so many students and storylines.

Like totally new characters just going through Hogwarts like normal adolescents having interactions with teachers, ghosts, quidditch, classes, family and relationships and all that?

*Don't know if this exists but if it doesn't would you all LOVE to read it too? Or just me? Lol.*


** When you say doesn't have them. Do you mean like they are not even mentioned or just they don't feature as characters ?

**** I believe it was posted on DLP somewhere so if you wanna crawl through there and find it be my guest cuz I never read it so I wouldn't be able help with names or phrases to google but i remember reading good things about it. It's probably under general fics maybe wba. Just asking if anyone knows the fic would probably get you an answer as well.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  The sequel to 'Latet Anguis in Herba', set during HBP. The Slytherins return to Hogwarts under the shadow of the war and their own demons. But with the wizarding world embroiled in conflict, how are they supposed to cope with their seventh and final year? MASSIVELY RE-EDITED.

** I'm writing something like this, though it takes place in golden trio era and it talks a bit about the trio and later my character has a relationship with one of them.

**** That might be in a while. I'm halfway through writing the first draft for the entire series and then I'll polish it up. I hope to have at least the first book published on Wattpad by midsummer.

**** They're the closest, but not what you're looking for.

Alexandra Quick is not in Hogwarts, and What's Her Name in Hufflepuff has nothing to do with harry until later on.

** Off the top of my head, a couple close ones, maybe -

linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff) was already mentioned here - it's an SI, but it's really well-written. She doesn't befriend the Trio (actually... well, spoilers), and there's /lots/ of adorable moments with her and the other Hufflepuff girls. But the whole Voldemort thing is still going on, and she does get involved in the background.

linkffn(Seven Normal years of Harry the Hufflepuff) - Harry, but no Voldemort. I've seen it rec'd here, but it's been languishing in my ever-lengthening to-read list.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  What if Voldemort made a mistake with his Horcruxes? What if he had truly been vanquished that fatefull night? What if the Dursley's didnt treat Harry like crap, but rather with casual indifference? Who would Harry become and what would his world look like? Read along with a seventh year Harry as he goes through his diary of Hogwarts and experience his best and worst moments! AU
