**** That's a little harsh.

The concept of Harry dying via terminal disease is really sad.

The alternate ending that the author posted gets me every time. The scene with Harry clutching onto Sirius while sobbing uncontrollably about how scared he is makes me weep like a faucet.

If anything just read the alternate ending. You leave out the 200,000 words of plot and are really just left with Harry's last few weeks of life. It's depressingly sad, and is a pretty accurate account of what it's like to die to cancer.

It's my recommendation for one of the saddest fics I know.
