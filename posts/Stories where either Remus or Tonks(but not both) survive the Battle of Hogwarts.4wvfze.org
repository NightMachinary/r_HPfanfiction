If such a story exists I imagine it would be a dealing-with-grief type, a sub genre I enjoy but do not read often if I can help it


** Good topic!

I've not read much in this specific setting but here's a short story on it:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8055240/1/Parted]]

I'll edit this if I an find any more.

Edit: Okay, here's one where Tonks survives, and there isn't a Teddy Lupin.

Edit 2:

Here's a longer story for a surviving Tonks raising Teddy.

Edit 3:

One more of a surviving Tonks.

** I think this one is rather good, it's a Tonks survive story. And it really seems like we love her more.

*** Please edit your comment so that it doesn't show the last chapter as link.

I just spoilered the entire story for me, thinking it was the first chapter.
