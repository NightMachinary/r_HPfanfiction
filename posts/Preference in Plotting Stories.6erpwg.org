To those who've written a story or two, how do you like to plan the plot of your fic? Do you go in blind or do you need to list everything out?


** It really depends on the story tbh. For my funny little one-shots I'll have a vague idea but make it up as I go along. For plot heavy fics like Aurors I planned that down to tiny details and my bedroom wall was plastered with timelines and notes. For my current WIP I'm taking a more relaxed approach somewhere in the middle. I have key scenes and moments that I have planned, and I have loads of notes on characterisation and so on, but linking it all up is a little bit of making it up as I go along. It slows things down as sometimes I get stuck, but it's far less stressful than Aurors.

*** I do this, pretty much, with the exception of abusing my walls. I usually start with the general synopsis, then think of a few key scenes - they're going to be my "stations of canon" for the particular fanfic. Then I plan out arcs for the main players and think of possible subplots, if I want to include them. Finally I write out the projected chapters in bullet points: Chapter One: this, this and this happens to this and that character.

With that plan I begin typing. I look at my notes and break down the chapter into scenes. Of course, things evolve along the way. When writing my big story I sometimes came upon an idea as I was writing and just write it and then took a look back to see how it fits into the story. Sometimes I'd change big parts of the story in the process of writing because I can't predict how every detail is going to the out. Some things I leave vague in the plan on purpose.

The longest story I wrote without a plan was a 14k word oneshot. I just had the basic premise in mind.

** That depends. If it's a humor story where the whole point is gags, you don't need to plot anything out because it's all just characters bouncing off each other and terrible, terrible puns. You can also stick pretty close to the story line of the books because then you can poke fun at it so that parts taken care of.

On the other hand, if you're planning on doing literally anything else, you need to plot it out. You need to know what the end of the story will be (or as I like to think of it, what the point is) and you need to know the beginning of the story and the middle of the story and fleshing it out further from there is just a good idea. Naturally you can change things if something better comes to mind, but this will keep you from writing yourself into a corner. It's not enough to have a couple of cool set pieces unless all you're going to write is a short story with a couple of set pieces in it.

** I generally have the ending in mind, and a number of key scenes - although those can change as the story progresses, since I let the characters drive the plot, not the other way around. My notes usually cover background Information, and goals etc. for characters. I also make notes for future scenes as I write, but those can be subject to change as well.

Ex: I write a scene where someone's killed and make a note about a scene in a future chapter where a character reacts to the killing, and possible changes to the overall plot spawning from that.

** I usually go in blind, but I've realized that leads to less developed plot/characters. For the new fic I'm writing, which has a lot of world building in it, I'm planning everything out.

** I've done both: I went in blind and a 174k+ story erupted out of it, while I planned another. The current story I'm writing now was centered around a specific scene in which I envisioned the two main characters conversing within; I also had the ending as well. Most things of it are planned, though not in overly extensive detail. I have found that if I adhere to detailed notes, the story, and dialogue especially, suffers from it. Therefore, I set the parameters of each chapter, but anything that happens within it is fair game.
