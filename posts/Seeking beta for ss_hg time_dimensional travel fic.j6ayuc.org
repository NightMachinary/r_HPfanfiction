I am seeking a beta for my ss/hg fic. It will be very long and I have about 15k already written. I have already posted the first chapter and you can read it here: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13709588/1/Idem-et-Diversum]]

I know the ss/hg pairing isn't popular around here but the relationship isn't the focus of the fic at all. There are also many side pairings and I am pretty much an anything goes kind of shipper. While there are a few minor/adult and non/dubcon relationships they are not romantized or portrayed in a positive light. Quite the opposite in most cases.

I am not looking for a long term commitment or major edits. Just someone to correct my spelling and grammar mistakes.

If interested please let me know here or over on ff.net.

Thanks


** I'll take a look!
