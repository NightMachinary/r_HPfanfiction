XenonLovegood only pretends to be crazy to hide the fact that he's the best unspeakable ever. Or everything he's saying is completely true. Either way, I want a fic where Xeno Lovegood plays an important role among the unspeakables, and is a valuable asset to the war. He could even attend Order meetings in disguise. I'd love to see him dueling with secret unspeakable magic. In my head, I'm imagining some super complex version of the patronus charm that harms only people with the dark mark. That is a super hard-to-accomplish spell yet Xeno can still do it because he is that awesome.


** Yes! My Xeno is actually a really hardcore journalist in the rest of the world but all of magical Britain think he's a crazy conspiracy theorist. I like the idea of him being a spook or researcher for the DOM though.

For me Arthur Weasley is the spook who works for the DOM and MI7 or whatever, and he's secretly got a weapons cache in his shed and stuff.

** In the fourth chapter of vidicon's HP/BtVS crossover, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30253-4/vidicon+Everyday+Meetings.htm][Everyday Meetings]], Xeno Lovegood is the hereditary Warden of Azkaban and Lord High Executioner, Carnifex Maximus. His whole schtick is Crouching Moron, Hidden Monster. He knows spells that even Lord Voldemort might think are a bit excessive.

*** I'm not going to go into the specifics, but it basically means a character is super cool and awesome. If you really want to know what the acronym stands for, then google it.
