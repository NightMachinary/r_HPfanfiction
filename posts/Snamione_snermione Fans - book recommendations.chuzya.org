Those of you who are fans of Snermione fanfictions, (especially those of you who are fans of the following fics: *Pet Project, Camerado, A Tender Moment, By the Book, The Professor's Discretion*). Are there any other books (like actual books, not fanfictions) out there that you enjoy?

Not sure if this kind of post is actually allow here, so I'll be happy to take it down if that's the case, but I'm interested finding new character and stories with the same dynamic that Snape and Hermione embody in a lot of these fics. Not necessarily Romance Novels, but something with that unyielding, slowburn tension that us Snermione fans love so much!

Thanks! Other fic recommendations are also definitely welcomed!


** I'd think you'd have better luck in a community dedicated to SSHG, like Facebook, tumblr, or LJ. I'm a fan, but I don't read any actual books anymore since I've been introduced to fan fiction, so I'm no help.
