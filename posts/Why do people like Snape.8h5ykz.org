** I don't /like/ him. I find him /interesting to read about/. The two concepts are not the same thing.

He may be unpleasant, but there's a lot of complexity in his character. It takes a great deal of courage to be a spy. It takes a great deal of petty assholery to bully eleven year olds. Stories that can explore and reconcile the contradictions in his character are interesting to me.

** He's a petty, vicious man who plays an extremely high-stakes game for the betterment of all. It makes for an interesting dichotomy.

*** Yeah, he's a very gray character. He's not a good person overall, but he does some good things for questionable motives. He's interesting to read about because of that. I do like how [[/u/cavelioness]] mentions that he's aware of things. In addition Quirrel, he also seems to recognize that Lockhart is a fraud relatively early on (at least from what I recall of the movie). He's pretty intelligent (he's made some of his own spells) as well. The inner conflict over Lily vs Voldemort is interesting too.

I wouldn't want to pair him with most (if any) characters, but he would still be very fascinating to explore. Granted, a lot of fics oversimplify him and other gray-ish characters (taking Dumbledore's early belief in "the greater good" and going crazy with that 70 years later).

** Back in the nineties, saying some mean or sarcastic things to people (even if they were children) wasn't really considered abuse.

A lot of people like Snape because he seems to be the only alert and aware teacher in the school. He's like HP's version of Sherlock or House, a crabby misanthropist with a sharp mind who follows clues to piece together what's going on. Everyone else on staff just seems to be off in fucking la-la land, especially in the early books.

*** I don't think Sherlock or House would look at a Hermione's 1 foot teeth and say "I see no difference," or would consider giving Remus Lupin to the Dementors along with Sirius Black just for the heck of it, or care enough to pamper Draco in Potions classes while doing everything to make the Trio miserable. Sherlock and House are mean because they simply don't care about people, the only important thing to them is getting the mystery solved. Snape is irrationally vicious and goes out of his way to be mean, even when it's illogical to do so.

One of the things that had really annoyed me in GOF was when Harry finds Crouch Sr by the Forest and rushes to Dumbledore's office for help. He finds Snape, tells him about Crouch and asks the password, and Snape... Snape blabbers on about how the Headmaster is too busy. A senior Ministry member, who was off the grid for weeks, is found half mad at Hogwarts. Considering all the weird stuff the Crouches were involved in recently, I bet Snape knew this could be genuinely important, even possibly related to Voldemort and his return to power. But he doesn't call Dumbledore, because he is having too much fun watching Harry suffer for information. And there's absolutely nothing logical about that.

*** I think repeatedly humiliating a child in front of his peers was always considered abuse.

**** Nah, we called it being a tough teacher or being mean or unfair, but not abusive. That would be reserved for people doing far worse than anything Snape did in Harry's six years of being in class with him.

When you compare Snape to some of the shit that is customary in British boarding school books (which is really what HP is, among other things), he barely even rates.

***** He was bad enough to be Neville's boggart. Not Bellatrix "I turned your parents into vegetables and soaked my knickers" Lestrange, but Snape.

****** In third year, Neville had never seen Lestrange and we don't really know how much detail he knew about what happened to his parents, and even if he'd heard, read, and researched every bit of it at that point, why would that make him afraid? It would be more likely to make him angry at those four imprisoned death eaters (of whom Bellatrix was just one), I would think.

** IMO he's an otherwise awesome character with a crippling flaw. If he just had a bit more professionalism while doing his damn job that would remove nearly all the things people hate about him in the story. Unfortunately his lack of said professionalism reduces him to a petty chump.

*alot* is actually spelled *a lot*. You can remember it by *it is one lot, 'a lot'*.\\

** I don't /like/ him but I don't despise him. He is brave in admirable ways. That unbreakable vow to protect Draco from both Voldemort and the horror of murdering Dumbledore is farther than any other adult in the series went to protect a child really (except Lily). He is also a dick who had the Porters murdered. And if Voldemort had killed a different couple maybe he'd still be evil, who knows. But he did an enormous service in helping Harry, Hogwarts and the Order without a friend in the world, while full of anger and self-hate , because it was the right thing to do for years and years, too.

*** Yet the only reason Draco didn't murder three people is because Ron was a little eager to get drunk. So Snape wasn't really doing a good job. Same goes for Katie Bell.

**** This makes me laugh, the guy was a double agent with a mind reading psycho but â€˜he didn't do a good job' because he didn't save every person Voldemort tried to kill. He did a hell of a lot more than --- say --- Lupin. But hey, Snape is not kind, what does actual usefulness matter ?

***** For the record, I think that Lupin is one of the most overrated characters in the series. And how useful were his reports anyway? The Order kept dying like flies, Voldemort won, the only useful thing Snape did was deliver the sword, something only necessary because Dumbledore was an idiot.

****** I mean. Shape was headmaster at Hogwarts. He was a spy providing fake intel. We don't know what would have happened if it was someone else, someone actually evil, who had Voldemort's trust. But it's not logical to assume it would have played out the same way.
