It was still steaming in my giant, garish mug and I was counting on it to make this breakfast worth getting up for.Less than an hour later, Lucius Malfoy would be trying to convince me I was his long lost daughter.

**** It is fine to post a request again, especially when you have read a few stories in the theme and want something new. It is even fine to not know every single request similar posted before. But the exact same request was posted only 12 hours before this one. That isn't about being here every single day, that is not even looking at the 1st page of the sub before posting.

As for how good they are; they vary. As I said A Curse of Truth, In Bad Faith, and Magical Me, are all the top recs for a good reason. I personally enjoyed Magical Me the most- it has a good mix of humor and serious plot. I also enjoyed The Evil Overlord List when I first read it, but it suffers if you have to wait between updates because it is hard to sustain interest past the initial idea.
