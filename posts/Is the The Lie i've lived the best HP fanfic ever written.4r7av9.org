** Er, no. Objectively, once you stop being blinded by the sorting hat, it's pretty bad. So much nonsense in it.

Also, Renegade Cause has no likable characters, so while it's a decent fic, it's hard to actually like it.

**** It has shock value, because it swear constantly. So, people find it amusing and tend to ignore how weak the plot is in the story, just because of how over the top the hat is.

**** They're both rated 4 stars, and they're both old stories. The vast majority of the votes for them were done when they were first being published and when they were fresh, which was years and years ago. The DLP library is quite outdated, and if you look at many of the 3 and 4 star fics, most of them are barely passable by today's standards. Go read the actual threads on the story themselves, especially TLIL - opinion has been souring on it for years.

** It's pretty good. I'd call it first tier. Lord_Anarchy points out the plot as a weak point, and I agree. However, I could say the same of Goblet of Fire. As a TWT retelling that's focussed less on plot and more on characters and flashy magic, I have little to complain about.

It would be better with more foreshadowing and buildup for what Voldemort's up to. There was a little, but for the most part, the attack at the end was a surprise, and not a very well-placed one.
