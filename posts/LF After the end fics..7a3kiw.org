The muggles are dropping amotic bombs! The third Wizarding War became an international affair after the Dark Lord/Lady ____ attacked eastern Asia! Calamity X is happening! Or already happened!!!

So, after reading "... and the Guardian Wand" linkffn(6719282) I was left wanting more stories set after or during an apocalyptic event. I feel that this one had an interesting idea, but it went kinda nowhere with it.

If you could recommend any, I'd be very grateful.

As usual, Completed fics > updated in the last ~6 months > the rest.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341): there are multiple genocides/apocalypses/planet destroying events in this fic. [[/spoiler][Most humans on Earth were destroyed after the US government fucked up and stumbled right into Ra's stronghold]]

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

  Dumbledore's dead. On the train ride home, cars are at a standstill, the electricity is out, fires burn unchecked from Scotland to London, and chaos reigns in muggle Britain. Somehow Harry has to survive this new world while destroying Voldemort.
