I read an evil Dumbledore story a while back that had James/Lily but with Severus as they're friend. Of course they had their memories wiped and what not but I liked the closeness of the three when Severus starts to remember. And it got me wondering are there any Lily/James/Severus stories? I've seen L/S or S/J or even a few with Lily/James with a mix Remus or Sirius, but I don't think I've read any with the three of them together. I like bad/evil Dumbledore stories where Sev finds out later that he related to Harry but I'm tired of Lily cheating. Since I know this is a long shot I'm also open to Lily/James/Sirius, Lily/James/Remus, Lily/James/Siri/Remus, or any of those with Severus in the mix lol. I want a happy Lily/James with another partner (no cheating. blood adoption is ok) who is still alive later to rescues/save/love Harry.

Bonus points: if the story is long and covers Harry growing and finding love with male partner or in a poly (m/m/m or m/m/f) relationship like his parents


** Is it just me, or does anyone else find the idea of Harry having two biological dads in James and Severus interesting?
