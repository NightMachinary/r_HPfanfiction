Whether he was framed or not, what happens in Azkaban or after, any pairings (if any)... I like the idea of the savior of the wizarding world being betrayed by everyone, so please help?


** Azkaban stories were popular in the early days of the fandom. They tend to be a bit cookie-cutterish, along the lines of: Harry is imprisoned, is tortured, is released, is pissed off and angsty, is somehow in possession of mad magical skills, and is told by everyone how sorry they are that they betrayed him. I remember a few that were good (or guilty pleasures, at least):

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3595986/1/Fugitives-of-Azkaban][Fugitives of Azkaban]] by BajaB is a good, if somewhat old one; 65k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  A 'Harry goes to Azkaban' story. Convicted for releasing the Basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets, Harry is put into a cell next to the most feared wizard in the world, Sirius Black. AU 3rd year, canon pairings, no Deathly Hallows.
#+end_quote

Another is Draco664's [[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Betrayal_of_the_Best_Kind/Cold/][Betrayal of the Best Kind]] (registration required), 82k words, complete (also a complete sequel). One of the few decent Harry/Cho stories.

#+begin_quote
  When the world turns against him, leaving only one by his side, Harry finds out that life, love and truth are more complicated than they seem. Danger, suspense, heartbreak and treachery abound.
#+end_quote

Apprentice/Journeyman/Master Potter by the same author have Harry imprisoned in Azkaban at some point as well.

nonjon's first major story, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2329599/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freedom-of-Apathy][Harry Potter and the Freedom of Apathy]] is another; 34k words, complete. Sequel is complete as well.

#+begin_quote
  PostOotP. After ten years in Azkaban Harry emerges a changed man. Enlightened and respectful, he is creature of magic full of disappointment and shame in his own race. And yet wielding power that none can match.
#+end_quote

A decent one with a bit of a twist is DobbyElfLord's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4544334/1/Harry-Potter-Mercenary][Mercenary]], 27k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot.

*** Didn't notice the pairings, framed, etc. In all the above except /Mercenary/, Harry was framed. Pairings are: /Fugitives/ (none); /Betrayal/ (Harry/Cho); /Apprentice/ (Harry/fem!Blaise/Hermione); /Freedom of Apathy/ (Harry/Tonks); /Mercenary/ (Harry/Daphne).

*** Yes, I'm asking this because I read and enjoyed "Redemption" by krtshadow on FFnet: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1480438/1/Redemption]] Summary: COMPLETE! Harry Potter has spent six years in Azkaban. Now, Dumbledore, Black and Lupin are here to retrieve him, now certain of his innocence. Will they be too late to save Harry's sanity? And if so, what does this mean for the world? AU after year 4.

I also enjoyed "Betrayed" by Kateydidnt: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1291535/1/Betrayed]] Summary: In his fifth year Harry Potter was framed for murder and sentenced to Azkaban. Ten years later his innocence is proven. What will Harry do? Written PreOotP. COMPLETE!

I also read much of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2107570/1/Lord-of-Caer-Azkaban]] which is apparently quite well-know, but not really Harry being a prisonner, and that I found a bit over the top, so I stopped, although I liked some aspects of it.

*** Thanks for helping!

For those interested like me:

"Control" by anonymou58: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5866937/1/Control]] Summary: I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry WIP - hasn't been updated in a while.

"Delenda Est" by Lord Silvere: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est]] Summary: Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black. WIP- updated recently

Thanks again SeraphimNoted :)

*** Hello and thanks for contributing! I haven't read that story but it sounds good and exactly what I'm looking for.

However, I guess you're right and the correlation between good story and betrayed by all is poor. I'd probably end up with very maudling, angsty stories, especially with a character like "Angsty-pants" Harry.

  Complete, A bit angsty and over the top at times though
#+end_quote

Indeed, from my review of this story on another site, the story in a nutshell: [[/spoiler][Once upon a time, Harry was locked up. Then he was released. Harry was a god, but he was also very angry. Harry went to Hogwarts and took out his revenge on everyone. Then he lived unhappily ever after because he was an asshole. The end.]]
