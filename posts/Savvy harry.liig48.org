Any fic where harry is proactive in the use of his ressources be it fame, wealth, and/or magical basically a harry that tries to munchkin his to the best position he can be, while not being overly antagonistic like you see in most indy fics, I would like it if the other characters are not given the idiot ball at every opportunity to make him look good by comparison.

An example of this is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13140418/1/][Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament]]
