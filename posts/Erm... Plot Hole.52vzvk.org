** My interpretation is this: the Fidelus Charm conceals not a place, but a secret. For example, in OOtP the secret is /the Headquarters of the Order is located at 12 Grimmauld Place/. The existence of the house itself wasn't the secret, because until the Fidelius was applied it /wasn't/ a secret.

So for the Potters, I'm assuming the secret was something along the lines of /James, Lily and Harry are hiding at Godric's Hollow/. But once James and Lily were killed, that was no longer true, and so the Fidelius fell.

*** Upvoted because there are still people out there claiming such things as plotholes. There's a line in PoA that explains this very neatly imo. Approximate quote, because I can't be bothered to look for it.

"Voldemort could have pressed his nose against their window and wouldn't have been able to find them."

It's just one of those things that aren't explicitly spelled out. The Trace is not on the wand. The Potters' Fidelius hid the fact that /the Potters/ were hiding in the house in Godric's Hollow, not that the Potters were hiding /in this particular house in Godric's Hollow./

*** Pretty much this entire comment, I agree with. Though I figure the Fidelius on the Potters was something like "the people living at whatever house Godric's Hollow are the Potters" which is a Secret which could stop being by the number of Potters being reduced to 1 because, well, plurals and magic behaving weirdly at times.

The secret must have been something like, "The Potters live in Godric's Hollow." Once the Potters died, the secret is no longer true, as the Potters no longer live in Godric's Hollow. Hence the Fidelius breaks.

I fail to see why so many people are eager to find plot holes when most answers are either available in canon, or require a moment's thought to think of a plausible explanation.

**** That would depend on the way the secret was formulated. If the secret is something like "James and Lily and Harry live in Godric's Hollow", then any one of them dying would make the secret untrue. It's not as if they could anticipate James and Lily dying, but Harry somehow surviving.

Another plausible explanation is that infant Harry may not count as "magical" enough to be the subject of the fidelius all by himself. He wasn't old enough to have done any accidental magic, and there are instances of magical effects being different for different ages in the books, like the boat in the cave.

Whatever be the case, the Fidelius dying with Lily and James is canon, so we know that the secret was formulated in a way that Lily and James dying broke it.

******** I think they're banking on the assumption that if one of them dies, all of them are screwed anyway. I think it's very likely that the Potters barely left the house after they went into hiding. Probably just to get groceries or visit friends very rarely. The entire point of going into hiding, after all, was to avoid being killed by Voldemort who was targeting them specifically. It wouldn't really be safe or, really, smart to fight with the Order with that kind of target on your back.

So, it's probable they thought it wouldn't matter in the end. After all, if they were home all the time, the only way they could die is if they were betrayed and were attacked by Voldemort or his Death Eaters or both together. In such a scenario, it's clear that whether the Fidelius would continue to hold after one of their deaths is a rather pointless problem.

You'll also have to consider that they truly did not think Pettigrew would betray them. They wouldn't have made him Secret Keeper otherwise.

** One possibility is what [[/u/PsychoGeek][u/PsychoGeek]] wrote, that the secret became false when they died and thus it failed.

Another possibility is that it was Peter's betrayal that caused it to fail altogether. People tend to forget that for all it is used to hide things, the Fidelius charm is not a “hide stuff” thing but rather a “protect stuff [by hiding it/them] beneath a shield of loyalty” thing; this is why it is impossible to get the secret out of the secret keeper if it is not given willingly, and it might also be why the charm was not very effective with Peter throwing away what loyalty he had towards them and betraying them immediately and willingly.

** I can see two interpretations that would apply, depending on your preference.

The first is the one I've been supporting for a while- the Fidelius is only ever used to protect the location of a building, so that must be the limits of its capabilities. Once Voldemort's body had exploded and thereby destroyed part of the house, it was no longer a shelter. The Fidelius falls.

Second version, probably more fitting: the essence of the Fidelius charm is the trust granted to the secret keeper to hold back the secret from any who would do harm to the subjects of the spell. Pettigrew broke the Fidelius when he chose to break their trust and inform their enemy of the secret.

In either case, given that Dumbledore didn't know who was the secret-keeper, he probably wasn't in on the secret. I'd see Dumbledore noting from some device in his office that he could tell where the Potters lived again, concluding that the protection had fallen, but to verify it while organizing other actions, he sent Hagrid to find out if it was true. Hagrid probably didn't know the secret and so sending him near to the location would be proof enough that the charm had been broken. In case a battle was still in progress, Hagrid would be most likely to survive falling into the middle of it, and there's reason to think the Potters would trust that it was him since Polyjuice might not have been able to work correctly with his half-giantness.

Meanwhile, Sirius could've been cruising around on his cycle and when he went to visit the Potters he'd found the wreckage and realized that he had a rat to hunt down, so he handed the cycle over to Hagrid so that Harry could be evacuated without traumatizing the possibly-injured toddler by Apparating.

** The fidelius doesn't so much hide but rather entrusts a secret. That's how it can be shared, because otherwise the first person brought into confidence would break the charm. This is not what happens, as we see with Grimmauld Place.

Instead, it's the /intent/ of the placed trust that is relevant. The Potters entrusted their safety from Voldemort, and their death at his hands is the betrayal of that trust.

The spell is called "Fidelius", not "Obscurus" or something. It's the charm of faith/trust, not secret.

** Honestly, there are some pretty big plot holes involving Halloween night 1981. If you try reconstructing the timeline of the night, you'll find it doesn't make sense either.

As for this one, I agree with Starfox 5, Hagrid probably already knew the secret. Snape, though... it's possible, I suppose, that Pettigrew told the secret to Voldemort while Snape was present, although seeing as Snape didn't know Pettigrew was the traitor, it's unlikely. Unless Pettigrew was under Death Eater mask and robes, as well as glamours so Snape couldn't recognise the Death Eater and assumed it was Sirius.

The truth probably is that JK just didn't think of it and it's a plot hole. Any explanation I can think of seems a little to convoluted to be plausible.

This part implies Hagrid knew Lily and James at least well enough to still remember who they were friends with in school. Couldn't have been only Remus, and certainly couldn't have been Sirius as he was still in prison at the time.

These are all off the top of my head, but there may be more indicators in the books.

Magical travel (Apparating, Floo, maybe portkey) can be tracked/monitored is an underage wizard/witch is in the area according to /DH/ and as far as I can tell a baby Harry is definitely underage.

Not necessarily. We know from OoTP that the Secret can be written down and use that to induct someone into the Secret. One possibility: Sirius writes it down. Pettigrew traces.

Or because the house was partially destroyed its not really a home anymore. Or Hagrid knew, since people who aren't the secret keeper can't exactly share that knowledge. I know Snape was only there in the movies, Nothing like that is mentioned in the books. I don't know if the Fidelius is ever explicitly mentioned in the movies though.
