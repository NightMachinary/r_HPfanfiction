** This one is a oneshot which is written as an investigation transcript but you can figure out what happened and is happening by what's said and not said. I like the fic. linkffn(the sound of silence by birdwoman95)

  Harry's treatment at the Dursleys didn't make him -- it broke him. At Hogwarts, broken children make their way to the home of the badgers. No one protects like a badger. The outcome? Heads fly. This is the trial of Albus Dumbledore. Rating due to child abuse mentions. Format is weird.

** On this first one, the abuse becomes a case to handle. I don't remember how much Susan and Hannah are on it.\\

The Hufflepuff Chronicles is a series, I don't remember how detailed it goes on the abuse but Susan and Hannah are important.\\

  What if the Dursleys sent Harry off without him learning his own story? No one ever explained anything. And Amelia Bones is quiet upset about it. Complete for basic idea. Feel Free to Adopt.
