as someone who has only read Harry Potter whole all the books were out it's hard to even imagine a world where NO ONE knew what the end would be. The fics that come from that time feel special almost like a vintage car, i don't know, I love it though, non spring to mine right now but any suggestions of early fics would be great :)


** Oh you sweet summer child :)

I came to the fandom in...about 2001 or so? Not long after Goblet of Fire came out certainly.

There have been so many evolutions of common themes and tropes, based what new canon has just been unveiled. So many fics abandoned by authors when the next book was released and canon suddenly clashed with something they were writing or they got inspiration for a new fic.

Some fics you might be interested in would be linkffn(1657629), linkffn(979216), linkffn(3401052), linkffn(2107570), linkffn(2580283), linkffn(2856856), and linkffn(1291535)

Some of those have sequels, some aren't completed, but they're all good examples of the sorts of things that folk wrote back then.

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.

** Well, I never read fanfics back when the books were still being released (and, in any case, can barely recall the OOTP/HBP gap), but people were publishing actual books which speculated about how Book 7 would go. I remember flicking through one in a bookshop, for example.

As to the question of suggestions... I've come across a few pre-completion fics, but I don't recall any [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1881966/1/Reality][except this one]], which is an AU so it doesn't matter that the author didn't know how things were going to play out.

I've read some /after/ DH came out (years later, DH turned me off from HP for a while). It was confusing at points. Horcruxes being different, or in different locations. Places being different. Things happening differently. Things not happening at all.

I can't even remember any of the fics I read back then, it felt so long ago. Christ, it feels weird trying to remember stuff from ~15 years ago. Especially that time period, in and out of hospitals and doctors apointments? I was devouring everything I could read: mangas, light novels, fiction, fanfiction. ANYTHING.

*Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor* - linkffn(2841153) Started before Book7, finished after. Erotic. Not totally explicit. But yeah... those types of scenes are skippable.

These two have different horcruxes, horcruxes in different locations, different final battle. And a Black Comedy has a "price" for defeating a Dark Lord. They both didn't age very well.

** I read the books for the first time in 2013 and only started reading Fanfiction in 2014, so I know /exactly/ what you are talking about when it comes to that vintage feel and whatever. In fact, for me linkffn(395212) is a perfect example of this, because the story reads like one of the books and yet goes on a completely different path. Same goes for linkffn(2242606), especially because, if I remember correctly Snape is revealed to have a squib son at some point.

*** wow, that's sounds really interesting, it's crazy how long this series has been about really, i mean just today i saw a girl who looked about 9 with a hogwarts rucksack, there's generation after generation who are going to read it, and fanfiction along with that, new perspectives and fics will be written, and hopefully they appreciate a time before all the books were out

  Ginny is pregnant. The father? Harry. How will they deal with the situation and with the terrible scandal that ensues? What will their relatives, friends and teachers say? And how will Voldemort react? Find out!

** I remember reading my first fics before DH came out but after HBP - I was about 12/13. I used to read all the theories on who RAB was and all the teen or safe rated fics like a delicate flower I was. I remember writing one where Ron and Hermione kissed over Christmas break. Simpler times

** I got into Harry Potter, as well as Harry Potter fanfiction, after all of the books had been released and when only one movie was left to be released. So pretty late in the game.

I can get into some fanfiction written before all the books were out, but a lot of the time it just takes me out of the story. Having Luna's dad show up as a normal ass dude with a normal ass name is just too jarring.

** I like it, mostly because it can't copy canon. Hate fics which do that, especially when they bend their plot too far to be able to add moments which happen in the books.
