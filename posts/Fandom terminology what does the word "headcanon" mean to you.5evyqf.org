It's a not uncommon occurrence on this subreddit to see someone read an idea they like and respond to it with the words "this is my new headcanon" on the basis that they think the idea is cool.

This is not at all what I have understood "headcanon" to mean, so here's a question for you: what do you mean when you say "headcanon"? How does it differ to "fanon"?


** For me, "headcanon" has always meant "the canon in your head", that is to say, your opinion of what is canon. This would consist of two main things.

Firstly it would include explicit canon that we see in the books. An example of explicit canon would be "Sirius dies in the Department of Mysteries". This must be part of what you believe to be canon because it's explicitly stated. There's no ambiguity that it is the case within the canon HP world.

Secondly it would include implicit canon that you have deduced and so exists only in your head, but you treat as if it were canon because you believe it is supported by explicit canon so strongly that it might as well have been stated. An example of implicit canon could be "studying magic makes spells easier to cast".

Thus my confusion stated in the OP. For someone to declare an idea as part of their headcanon is to say that they believe that the idea is genuinely a part of canon, it's just that we were never told as such. But if it's just an idea that a fan has come up with, with no canon justification, then it's hard to see how that could be the case. Liking something doesn't make it a part of canon.

Ideas that are pure fan-creations which have no canon backing or justification would be what I call "fanon". Some of these ideas may be canon-compatible fanon, but that doesn't make them headcanon, because there's no reason to think they are actually a part of canon.

*** I think your definition of headcanon is a bit different to some other people's.

I think it is generally used just to say that they like an idea, maybe to the point of wishing it were part of canon. In this case something that is fanon could be someone's headcanon.

I would say that the difference between headcanon and fanon is that a headcanon belongs to one person, whereas fanon is everything that is not canon, so contains everyone's headcanons.

This may be where the confusion comes in. People can think up elaborate canon "clues" and endless justification, and one person's idea of what constitutes proper support of a theory can and will differ from the next person's.

To me, any theory is eligible to be someone's headcanon unless it is ruled out by actual canon. People can believe whatever they like about the series until they are proven wrong. Sometimes their headcanon can even overcome canon contradiction if they believe in, for instance, an unreliable narrator.

Something becomes fanon when it is featured in enough stories that it becomes a commonly known trope throughout the fanfiction community. Fanon can and does contradict canon at times.

*** I have to say that my definition is the same as yours, with the caveat that what is “implicit” is to me stuff that both makes sense and is not contradicted by explicit canon in any way but does not necessarily have to be “supported by explicit canon so strongly that it might as well have been stated”, and I'd held it to be the de facto definition of headcanon.

But I do not get the notion of using it to call anything regardless of it being contradicted by other stuff. Because really, using it for fanon that someone likes makes no sense to me as the presence of “-canon” as a part of the word would only serve to confuse people if that were the case.

** - fanon: something treated or put forward as if it is canon, but isn't. either because it isn't explicitly stated* or contradicts canon. e.g. lucius malfoy has long hair and a cane, draco has blue skin

- headcanon: something that isn't explicitly canon, doesn't technically contradict it/can fit seamlessly into the universe, and put forward as your elaboration/contextualisation of canon, as opposed to a claim that it /is/ canon. e.g. snape is an ABBA fan

- word of god: jkr's headcanon (more or less)

*- (i guess here you can substitute saying 'that's fanon' for 'that's your headcanon')

I haven't really thought about the others (fanon and WOG), but this is what I consider headcanon as well

*** Fanon seems to me to be more the equivalent of canon in the case of a fanfic.

Fanon would be the "canon" of a fanfiction, whereas canon would be the canon of the original work if you want. It seems to be used that way.

Nor sure i make sense here...

** Headcanons are typically held by a person or a smaller group; once they start becoming more pervasive they become fanon.

Relation to canon in both cases is completely irrelevant; things are not demoted from headcanon/fanon status because they contradict canon, whether they explicitly go against it or whether they get Jossed by new material.

(Interesting topic--I'd never realised that it could mean anything other than this!)

*** Agreed, headcanons become fanon when the idea becomes widely known/believed in/preferred over canon. Individuals have headcanons; large groups create fanon.

** For me it's what I think "really happened". I know this makes me sound like a lunatic, but it's part of the reason I find it hard to read AU stories. For me, HP feels as real as history, so for something to be my headcanon means I find it fitting enough to be something that would have actually happened to those characters.

** Canon: What actually happened.

Headcanon: What you think happened, based on the characters, settings, storylines and all reasonable extrapolations thereof.

Heartcanon: What you feel ought to have happened, quite divorced from rationality or sense.

Soulcanon: What you know happened, deep down in your soul, regardless of what anyone says. Including the creators of canon, themselves.

Crotchcanon: What your gonads wish had happened, or, alternatively, what turns you on.

Saw this once on tumblr and this is basically my definition now.

** In fact, I don't really see the need fo that word. To me, it means "something that may or may not be supported by canon, that I consider canon". Generally, it seems to come from personal interpretation of some canon evidence. It has to be at least a bit controversial, otherwise we would call it canon. For instance, you could consider the fact that Luna's a seer to be your headcannon, based on the fact that she talks funny and yet she seems to be often spot on, or that phoenixes are sentient beings. I think the important thing is that there's a part of interpretation.

** For me, headcanon means things that I think happened that weren't explained explicitly in the books or by JKR. Like, I have no evidence for it, but part of my headcanon is that James was Quidditch Captain his 7th year, concurrent with him being Head Boy (the latter of which is canon).

I would say that fanon is a widely accepted something but that's not confirmed in the books or by JKR. For example, I read mostly James/Lily fanfiction and I would say that it's fanon that the Head Boy and Girl have a separate dormitory and/or common room just for them. Most people in the community (at least in Jily fanfiction) accept that this is true, even though we have no solid evidence toward it. It doesn't conflict with Canon and it's more than one person's theory.

*** I think what makes it fanon is that it is actually used in the fanfiction community despite not being canon. I don't think the compatibility with canon has much of a part in it.

For instance, the nobility in wizarding Britain is fanon, although we know there's none in canon. It's not compatible with canon and yet, it's fanon. Same goes for the benevolent goblins.

** When I hear the word "Headcanon" I think of my interpretation of the Canon as is. My Headcanon is the Verse as I think of it, not necessarily as it actually is. That can be as simple as assuming spells get easier as you use them, and as complex as assuming the DH are products of experimentation by the Peverells. And that the Merror of Erisid, the Original Pensive, and the Veil came first.

But, weather or not it's Canon in the end, it may or may not be my interpretation, and therefore my Headcanon.
