Because I am bad at searching, my apologies in advance for requesting fics that have probably been requested dozens of times before.

I'm looking for fics where Harry is sorted into Slytherin or even just a non-Gryffindor house, or doesn't even attend Hogwarts, so long as it meets to following criteria:

- still winds up dating Ginny (and they end the story together)
- it's ok if the rest of the Weasleys dislike Harry for being in Slytherin, in fact that makes it more interesting if Ginny still winds up dating him. But I would also like Ron and Hermione befriending him at some point.
- No evil Harry. I'd like Harry to still be the Harry we know, at least as much as he can be given the change. Grey Harry is ok but ultimately I'd like him to be good.
- it would be cool if Harry has friends in Slytherin and winds up turning them good
- I'd prefer him to still not get along with Draco, but not a big deal if not
- I'd still like Harry to have to fight Voldemort, but not an absolute must that he even needs an epic story (could just be a story of him coming to terms with being in Slytherin)
- The story must follow Harry into the later years of school if not all the way. I don't want a story that ends with his 1-5th years.

Thanks!


** *Hail Odysseus* and *My Slytherin Harry*, linkffn(10645463;6160345): meet most of your requirements, but no, Hermione wasn't friend with them in both fics.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

** I don't know why I've held off on Hail Odysseus since I've read some other work by the author and liked it. It's time to give it a shot. My Slytherin Harry definitely seems to be what I'm looking for, though I do wish it was longer. Thanks though!

*** *Hail Odysseus* is the ultimate bash fic. When characters such as Arthur Weasley, Dora Tonks, and Pomona Sprout got bashed, you can imagine the rest.
