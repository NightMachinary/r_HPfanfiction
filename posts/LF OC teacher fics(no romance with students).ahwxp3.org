The title basically but it could also be a character from a different franchise as well.

Could be an oc teacher, an self insert taking over a teacher or something else that fits into an oc teacher.

Doesn't have to be the DADA teacher either but that seems like it would be the most likely one to get an oc teacher.

I would prefer for it to be year 4 backwards timeline wise but I'd take any at this point.

/(Also specifying the nor romance with teachers since I remember a teacher fic I was reading a few years ago getting progressively more comments as it went on)/

  Snape's away on a 'special mission' from the headmaster. When the seventh year Gryffindors take their first potions lesson with his substitute, word of a Potions Master with a pedigree for insults far worse than Snape's passes through the school. Who is this Master of the Cauldron? Gordon Ramsay, Devil of Hell's Cauldron.

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12302061/1/][Speaking in Tongues]]

By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2237626/original-star-girl-78][original-star-girl-78]]

A trader on the edge of the wizarding world is about to turn Snape's world upside down.

​

Description is a bit vague, but basically an OC teacher comes to Hogwarts to teach foreign languages and to work with Dumbledore to figure out how to speak Parseltongue. And, interestingly, it takes place during CoS year, and fits very well into canon. It's a WIP, and I'm enjoying the hell out of it right now.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
