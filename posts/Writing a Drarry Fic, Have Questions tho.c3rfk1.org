I want to write a drarry fic that's good. I plan on making Harry and Draco independent characters with lots of character growth and such. I do want to make Harry run away from the Dursleys and show his slytherin side more, but what I'm wondering is the extent of their abuse. The abuse WILL get physical but what Im asking is if Vernon should be a pedophile and abuse Harry in that aspect or if that is too over-the-top dramatic and unbelievable? Don't be shy to give me your opinions on this, and any recommendations or tips would be greatly appreciated!


** Vernon's abuse should be purely physical, pedo-Vernon is just... no.

*** that's kinda what I was thinking, I thought it might have been too much. Anything else you think would be good to add into the fic? I know where I want it to go in some aspects but I'd love to get in different takes of certain elements, like the mirror of Erised being a truly dark artifact and such.

**** I kinda like the idea of the Mirror of Erised just pulling you in because it shows you what you want, it isn't really dark, just tempting.

I don't like Drarry, or any non-canon slash ship really, so I cant offer much more there.

** No pedophilia please, verbal and physical abuse are bad enough

*** Yeah, I was thinking over those lines as well. I want Harry to be able to heal from the damage they cause and just overall become a more rounded character.

** It should only be physical. Vernon was(at the least emotionally) abusive to Harry in canon, because he feared magic. There's no reason he'd be a pedophile though. You do that, because you have fantasies of being with kids, and act on it. Pedophiles are sick, but also /sick/. While Vernon is abusive, it's out of fear. While it's not something that can be accepted, it is understandable.

*** Thanks for the feedback! I kinda had a hunch that it would be taking it too far and almost make sense. I read one where it happened when harry was much older and im not sure what exactly drove it to occur but it was an interesting read, but not something im sure I found very believable. Since the fic I want to write more relies on rising up against the abuse, I feel sexual would just be over the top and almost like a "Hey, I want more reads!" kind of situation. It briefly crossed my mind, but I was more curious as to what other's thought on the whole thing. Sorry, im kinda rambling.

** So this is late but maybe you still want responses.

You might want to do some reading into possible effects of emotional abuse as this can have great effects. Physical abuse doesn't always have the worst effects. Also, as Harry came to the Durslys at under 3, you could look into topics like "early childhood deprivation". If you want to do topics of sexual abuse, it doesent need to be Vernon, you could use someone from school or a nighboor oc. You could also use a woman, as that's something that also happens. Also, it's just my personal opinion, but you don't need to write out those scenes in detail. It's the aftermath and psychological effects that matter.
