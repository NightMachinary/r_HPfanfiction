I am looking for a lengthy and well written fic that has the Harry with Hermione pairing. I just want it to be realistic and well written, especially the characters shouldn't be well out of character.

I prefer fics that are before the fall of Voldemort IE fics that include Voldemort, and don't bash canon characters like Ron or Dumbledore.

Please help me out.


** Most of Potato19's stuff fits this request. It is generally well written and within the canon spirit, but sometimes feels a little lacking due to this. The best examples are:

  Set during OOTP. The story of how Hermione's innocent suggestion of running a Secret Santa with the DA leads to the ultimate search for the perfect presents, an unexpected change in holiday plans, late-night mistletoe-kisses and revelations of profound feelings hidden deep down. Total HHr.

  Set the summer after OOTP. Hermione gets struck by Dolohov's Curse in the Department of Mysteries and that sparks a change in the relationship between Harry and Hermione. They help each other deal with the grief, finding solace in each other and, eventually, love. Rated M for mentions of child abuse, some swearing and mild adult situations.

I went ahead and read his on-going story. Four chapters in, he has HP's 15 yo half-brother and a bunch of other guys destroy HP's wand, broomstick, clothes, and hang HP out by the lake by his ankles for 3-4 hours, causing him to almost drown.

And nothing happens to anyone.

**** Well, I haven't kept track of his recent works because most seemed to be similar to each other when it comes to characterisation and themes. I can vouch for the two I linked, and there were a few others which were decent, but no idea about the recent stuff. WBWL is not a mark of excellence and by the sound of it, the recent story follows that trend.

** Starfox tends to write H/Hr. Also tends to write epically long stories, so, YMMV.

I'm of the view, though, that one or both characters /have/ to change notably from canon to make the pairing work. Canon Harry and Hermione are great material for a friendship, but not a romance. To make each other happy, at a minimum, Harry needs to be much more studious and Hermione needs to be much more empathetic.

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.

** "For Lack of a Bezoar" has a decent length and is canon-compliant till middle of sixth book. As for realistic, YMMV, but I find the use of Unforgivable by protagonists in this fic to be realistic based on situations happening in it.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

** Well, there's a few I know of; the characters stay pretty close to canon and there's no real major OOc stuff.

His stories are really good, but if you don't want to deal with smut for smut's sake, steer clear of Hermione's Furry Little Problem and stick to the ones posted and updated in 2018.

  What happened to the Other Hermione that Harry encountered in "Shadow Walks"? As she struggles to survive, despite immense loss, in a world that no longer has a place for her, how will the reappearance of someone she'd thought she'd never see again change her life completely? Reading "Shadow Walks" first is advised. Companion piece; alternate universe.
