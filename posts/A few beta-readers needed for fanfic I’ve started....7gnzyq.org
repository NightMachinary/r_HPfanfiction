** A beta reader shouldn't be expected to read 'a very rough, unedited first draft'. Frankly, no one should. Finish the story - or at least the chapter. Edit it. Polish it to the best of your ability. when it's as good as you can make it yourself it's time to get another pair of eyes on it.

Beta-ing is sometimes tedious work, so it's a good idea to offer a reciprocal arrangement.

*** Thanks for the info. I've never had anyone read my work so not sure how this normally works.

Maybe VERY rough was a bit overkill. I've polished the first half, which I suppose would constitute as a chapter. I didn't really set “chapters” per se, but a good stopping point.

Really I am looking for, does it flow well? Does it make sense? Am I missing some detail that would clarify something? And grammar, I'm quite terrible at punctuation. Commas all over the place...lol.

**** You're going to have a very difficult time writing a story if you don't have it planned out enough to be able to differentiate between chapters.

Also twenty pages, assuming word processing with standard formatting, is around 10,000 words. The first Harry Potter book is 75,000 words. Do you think what you have is equal to fifteen percent of a book? But, as a whole, word count is typically more efficient of a judge of length than page count. Especially because some people seem to insist on typing in size twenty green font, double spaced, and in Arial.

Also, it's impossible to actually 'beta' something in any meaningful way without knowing the plot and intention of the author. Without knowing what's supposed to be there, they can't tell you if it's there or not. For example, I think Severus Snape is a terrible human being. So if I'm reading it with no thought of what you want to do, I'm going to ask you questions like, "How do you justify the fact that he's intentionally failing a student by maliciously vanishing his classwork repeatedly and expect me to sympathize for him?"

Also if you say 'does it flow well?' and then admit to knowing there's comma issues, well, the chances are that it does not flow well. It's not a beta's job to teach you grammar. That's your job. There's plenty of free resources available (Strunk and White's The Elements of Style is slightly dated, but available for free and in PDF form on the internet).

If you want someone to read it and go "OMG THIS IS AWESOME" then well, not it. If you want someone to read it, dissect it, and put as much red on the page as you do black, I'll give it a shot.

***** Again, this is all new to me so thank you for the information. I am certainly not looking for someone to pat me on the back and inflate my ego. I genuinely want honest feedback. That is the only way we improve isn't it?

As far as the chapters go, well again I've never done this. While I have breaks in the story where I intend to transition into a new “chapter”, I am looking for feedback on whether those breaks are conclusive and make sense. They make sense to me but I am only one person.

And yes, it would probably be wise for me to brush up on my grammar. It isn't fair to have someone else do all the work for me.

Again, thanks.

*** And I'm more than happy to work out an arrangement of some sort as far as swapping stories although this is all fairly new to me.

** What you are describing is an alpha reader, but pm me and I'll take a look at it and see if I can give you some helpful pointers/feedback.
