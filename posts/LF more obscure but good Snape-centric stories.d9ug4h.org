** I always like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4787853/plutoplex][Plutoplex]]. Her one-shots especially, such as "Unrequited" linkffn(12218274), but she's got a couple multi-chaps too. The time-travel one with the Weasley twins, "Crossing Lines" linkffn(11993367), is one I've been meaning to read for a while when I have the time.

There's a good chance you've read it, but "Bezoar" linkffn(8044324) is a solid two-shot with h/c in it.

I'm not sure if you'd be familiar with [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/elumish/pseuds/elumish][elumish]], they wrote a fairly popular story about Percy Weasley ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7681432][blood will tell but often it tells too much]]), but I also enjoyed her Ravenclaw!Severus AU quite well. It's called i[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14070576][n penance for his past misdeeds]].

Dunno how you'd enjoy it, it's a bit weird and definitely different, but this trans!Severus story I think is interesting [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5432306][Sugar Spice and Everything Nice]].

Then, because why not, and it might just be up your alley, I'll throw out my own [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16414979][Boy-Snape]]. It was a little indulgently written on my part, I'll admit, but it ends with a reluctant friendship between Severus and Sirius and there are a number of h/c scenes throughout.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

  The trio want an insight into what goes on at the Order meetings, but they end up gaining some new perspective about a man they never considered much beyond 'ugly, greasy git'... a few itty swear words, nothing too bad. Could be seen as AU.

** Sorry, I know this is kind of old, but if you're still interested, here's one where he wakes up about 18 months after Voldemort killed him. He gets therapy and starts his life over, trying to overcome his demons. It's in progress, but being updated twice a week. It's pretty obscure, so chances are you haven't seen it yet.

Okay, this does have M-rated romance in it, (and time-travel related) but the main storyline is Snape slowly taking over Harry's place during the rise of the Dark Lord.
