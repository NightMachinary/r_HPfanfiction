If any of you could recommend me Lovecraftian stories like the one above I would really appreciate it. Nothing too gory bu I would like it if it had cosmic horror in it were the characters simply cannot comprehend what they are witnessing.


** Some of these I have read, some of them I haven't, but this is everything I've got in my new 'HP Lovecraft' bookmark folder for researching a fic I'm planning to write. Some of them I've read, some of them I haven't, but they're all fics and snippets I've gotten from threads here that people describe as Lovecraftian or Eldritch.

Some of the comments on this thread tell interesting Lovecraftian Snippets - [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dero7u/privet_drive_is_an_eldritch_location_that_turns/]]

A lot of the comments on this are amusing-Lovecraftian - [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/f50myv/katie_the_cultist/]]

**** Sure. Always happy to spread the word of Lovecraftian Fics. Easily my favourite genre of stuff, no matter the medium. :)

And when I do get enough done to post, I'm planning a 'Self-promotion' post here and a submission on Dark Lord Potter, so you'll hopefully catch that there if I don't find the time to send it over. :)

  Some people can only be pushed so far. Luna will take a lot, but it's best not to insult her mother.
