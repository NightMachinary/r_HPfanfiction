:END:
It was in progress and in ffnet, Hermione somehow ended up in this world:

The good guys were VERY bad, they took the Slytherin purebloods as slaves and abused them. Hermione arrives there, she's head girl, adopted (I think) by Lily Potter and has Pansy Parkinson as a slave. Draco Malfoy belongs to Ron. Obviously Hermione is horrified by this. Lily is very high up in the ministry (and an evil bitch), maybe Dumbledore is the minister.

More info and HUGE SPOILERS:

Hermione somehow tricks Ron into giving her Draco. She befriends Pansy and we find out that also Harry is a human being and that he is in love with Pansy.

Any idea?

  Hermione is unexpectedly swept into a dystopian world of opposites where Dumbledore reigns as Dark Lord and Muggle technology and the Dark Arts have revolutionized Britain. A Light wizard resistance led by Tom Riddle and the Malfoys has been left to a nightmarish fate. Can Hermione, posing as her darker incarnation, help save a world more shattered than her own? HG/DM
