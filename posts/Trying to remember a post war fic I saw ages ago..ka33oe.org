:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I remember reading this one fic that was set after the war, where Harry was the owner of lots of properties, but the ministry wants to tax him more than he has... so he goes with Hermione, Ron... and I believe Draco and Daphne to explore them all? I think he ends up making one into a school or orphanage?

Any help finding this would be great! I don't even remember if I finished reading it or not but I remember enjoying it.


** I'm not sure about yours, but I have to recommend a fic called Novocaine by StardustWarrior2991.

It's along the same line, where Harry inherits wealth and property galore. He goes to get a lawyer, and finds Daphne. It really focuses on the rebuilding of Diagon Alley after the war. He founds an orphanage as well.

It's unfortunately not finished, but it's over 200k words so far. One of my favorites.

*** Yeah, I sat down and read that one in during a few shifts at work. I'm caught up with it but still find myself rereading it!

**** Is it where he also converts one of his properties into like a muggle and magic museum?

***** It might be? That sounds vaguely familiar, but I'm not sure if it's the same fic, or just another one I've seen before.
