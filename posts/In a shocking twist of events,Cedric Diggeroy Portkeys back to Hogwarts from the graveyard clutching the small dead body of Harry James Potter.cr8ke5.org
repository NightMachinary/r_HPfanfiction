** Here is my attempt. I could go longer with it but I have a two-hour drive I have to start in about 20 minutes.

____

All he had to do was grab the cup while holding on to the lifeless and cold body of his fellow classmate. He had to stay low, avoid the horde of spellfire, survive, grab the body and get the cup.

But his limbs felt heavy.

As if they were slowly turning to stone as the seconds painfully passed him.

He laid on top of the body, the one that was still and unmoving on the torched grass. Wrapping his left arm under the head of his younger friend, he accio'd the cup to his outstretched hand. It slammed painfully into his palm from overpowering the spell but he didn't mind a little pain.

At least he was still alive.

When the portkey dumped his body in front of the maze, music instantly started. Cheering filled the air, and fireworks set off by the Weasley twins exploded against the black of the sky.

He made his heart compress painfully and pushed all the air out of his lungs in a single breath. He pulled his face away from the matted and dirty hair he hid in while traveling.

He found his father's face first. It was split into a bright grin. White teeth gleamed in the night. Wrinkles surrounded his hazel eyes in a joyous manner. He was nearly bouncing in excitement as he clasped his hands to gather in front of his chest. It made bile start to rise in Cedric's chest.

Amos must have noticed something was off because the smile slowly slipped off his face. With joy gone, it appeared that years had taken place in a matter of minutes. His father rushed towards him when he saw the tear streaks formed in the caked dirt in his face.

“He,” The choked as soon as he tried to speak. The words stuck in his throat. “He-He killed him.”

Cedric's focus was on his father, missing the group of teachers and officials circling around him. Several were shouting questions at him over the roaring of instruments behind them. Others were just watching confused at the two boys on the ground.

Minerva noticed the open and dead eyes of Harry Potter first.

It was followed by a choked sob and she nearly dropped to her knees. She darted to the other side of Cedric to grab at her student. She pulled the top half of Harry into her lap trying to desperately find a pulse. Tears started to fall when she couldn't.

“What?” Amos asked staring at the dead body.

“He's dead!” Cedric roared at his father frustrated. “He used him for a ritual and then disposed of him!”

“Sprout, Flitwick, Snape,” Amelia stated sharply catching their attention, “Get the students out of here. Don't let them see him.” Once the turned to the stands she turned her attention to her Aurors. “Dawlish, Tonks, keep us hidden.”

The Aurors went to start casting privacy spells. They had erected large slabs of rough rock to hide the scene from wandering eyes. This caused the whispers to become louder. Several students try to look past the forming walls and adults to no avail.

One person was brave enough to run past teachers, Aurors and ministry officials to find out what had happened. Her efforts rewarded her with the sight of her best friend's dead body. She dropped to her knee while wet wails escaped her body. She was quickly whisked away by Sprout and Pomphrey.

“Who did this?” Fudge asked. He wanted a clear answer.

“Voldemort,” Cedric croaked out from beside Harry's body. Tonks had brought a black cloak to drape over the boy. When she had started to cover at him, Cedric shrieked and ripped the fabric away from her before tossing it away.

“Impossible!” Fudge cried, “You're just trying to get out of Azkaban!”

“Minister!” Amelia admonished behind him.

“It's true!”

“That man is dead!” The Minster words slipped between his teeth in a growl.

“Take my memories! Or better yet, talk to Lucius Malfoy who stunned him before Voldemort cast the killing curse on him.”

“Lies!”

“Minister,” Minerva hissed from her place on the ground, “Shut. Up.” The words came out cold and sent shivers down the spines of everyone who heard it. “My student is dead,” she had choked on the last word, “Another witnessed said death. Maybe now isn't the best time to be pointing fingers.”

“What Mr. Diggory is saying is the truth,” Snape slowly spoke next to the Headmaster who had turned an ashen color. He rolled the sleeve of his robes up to reveal the black mark that was surrounded by red angry skin.

Behind Amelia, Moody was cackling. This drew the eyes of everyone present. His face bubbled and morphed into that of a man thought to be dead. Once the disguise of Alastor was completely gone, he cackled even louder at their stunned faces. He stopped only for a moment to inform them that they had lost.

** Late to the party, but why not?

--------------

Cedric gasped as he hit the ground, one hand clenched tightly around the handle of the Portkey, the other gripping Harry's arm.

Harry...

Harry was dead...Voldemort and that weedy little servant of his. The Cup had been a Portkey.

They had blasted Cedric and he had hit his head on a rock. By the time he'd come to, Harry was tied to a tombstone and that slimy servant was slashing at him with a knife and then that ritual...the potion from hell...

And Voldemort...and his Death Eaters. That snake Malfoy and that bastard Macnair and Crabbe and Goyle and Nott...devils...

And Voldemort had made Harry duel him and one of Voldemort's curses had hit Cedric. And he had yelled and given away his position and Harry had fallen over him and hurt his leg even worse and Cedric accidentally grabbed Harry's wand in the confusion. And Voldemort made to "kill the spare, properly," but Harry had stepped in front of the curse...

Cedric had grabbed Harry's body and his wand and ran for the Portkey. And the Death Eaters had been right on their tails...

A thunderous noise hit his ears. Yelling. War cries. Death Eaters? Those bloody bastards had managed to follow him. How was that possible? Did it matter? No, it didn't matter...Cedric had to protect Harry's body. He wouldn't let them use his friend for anymore of those rituals from hell. He couldn't fail again...

Cedric groaned weakly as he let go of the damned Portkey and reached for his wand. Or was it Harry's? He was bruised, bloodied, and trembling from the Cruciatus Curse. But he wasn't beaten. Cedric had shown restraint before...in the maze...and the graveyard...but not anymore. They had /killed/ Harry. This was war.

"You did it, my boy! You won!"

/Dad?/

"You did wonderful, Ced! Triwizard Champion!"

Damn the bloody Triwizard to the fires of hell. Cedric raised his head and saw his father smiling wider than he had ever seen him smile before.

"Dad..."

"A true winner! A champion! Best of the lot!"

"Cedric!"

/Professor Dumbledore?/

"Cedric, what's happened?" Professor Dumbledore knelt beside him, his blue eyes blazing with purpose.

"Professor Dumbledore, I'm sorry...Harry...It was him..."

"Good heavens!" Minister Fudge appeared suddenly, at Dumbledore's side.

"Dead? Son, that can't be!"

"Cornelius, I will not allow Cedric to leave this courtyard."

"At least, the body has to be moved," Fudge answered. "People will panic if they see it. They're already starting to move. If too many see it--."

"HARRY'S NOT AN 'IT!'" Cedric bellowed. "I can't leave him! I won't!"

"He needs the hospital wing," a new voice interjected. Cedric looked up and saw Mad-Eye Moody. "Potter's dead, but Diggory's injured. I'll take him to the infirmary. We can go now."

"I'm not leaving my son," Cedric's father set his jaw. "I will not, Mad-Eye."

"I'm not leaving," Cedric grabbed Dumbledore's arm. "Sir...Voldemort...he said that one of his servants, his most faithful one, was here at Hogwarts."

"Boy, you're not talking sense," Moody interrupted. "The Dark Lord..."

There was a flash of red and Moody fell over, Stunned. Standing on one leg was a one-eyed, heavily scarred man with a look of pure hatred on his face.

"Headmaster," Alastor Moody whispered, hobbling. "If you'll help me retrieve my eye."

*** Part II

--------------

The scene inside the hospital wing was the worst Cedric could ever remember.

His parents, Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Harry's friends Ron and Hermione sat in chairs surrounding the two beds.

"Word will be given to his family," Madame Pomfrey said quietly. "They'll decide what to do with Harry's body..."

Ron made a noise somewhere between a sob and a howl. Hermione cried harder.

"Molly..." Dad was saying. "I'm so...tremendously sorry."

"It wasn't your fault, Amos...It wasn't your fault, either, Cedric dear."

Good old Mrs. Weasley. So kind and generous. Cedric turned his head as he saw her caresses Harry's face, the way a mother might comfort a sick child.

Cedric had related everything to Dumbledore in the Headmaster's office. His parents had been there. And Professor Sprout.

The imposter Moody had been restrained in McGonagall's office. Hagrid was standing guard with his crossbow.

And now, Cedric was supposed to sleep? How could he? Harry was /dead./ Cedric should have done more--that louse Pettigrew couldn't have been much. He should have dodged the spell and smashed that rat's head in. He was even shorter than Harry and Cedric was big and strong--one solid punch to the skull would have been enough to kill that bastard.

Madame Pomfrey handed Cedric a potion for Dreamless Sleep. Cedric mulled it over...the idea of sleep without dreams, without having to see Harry's broken little body was nothing short of intoxicating...but no...he had to live with his failure...hiding from it would be an insult to Harry's memory.

--------------

"You're all mad! This is a ploy to get me out of power!" Fudge shouted. "I will not see the peace

"Your winnings," Fudge said shortly, as he handed Cedric a bag. "One thousand Galleons. Ordinarily, there would be a ceremony, with the other champions accepting you as their superior but, in light of the circumstances..."

Cedric took the bag and felt a great rage bubble inside him. Winnings? Ceremony? Even now, Fudge was concerned with appearances? The damn dirty coward...

"I don't want this damn blood money!" With every bit of strength he could muster, Cedric threw the bag across the hospital wing, showering Galleons everywhere. "I want Harry back! I want my friend back! I want to find Voldemort and Pettigrew and make them pay!"

"Peter Pettigrew is dead. Voldemort is dead. Harry Potter is dead," Fudge said quietly. "Do take care to make sure you don't meet the same fate, Cedric."

"COWARD!" Cedric shouted and he thought he heard Ron shout it as well.

Cedric was too consumed with rage to be able to even feign sleep anymore. He grabbed the potion from his nightstand, the one for Dreamless Sleep, and downed it in one gulp.
