I really like fics with adults, especially Hogwarts professors, though I'm not familiar with many. A lot of them are humorous and show great friendships, like McGonagall and Snape. If the setting is during the year when Umbridge is around, all the better. Two of my favorites are The Unholy Trinity by Selmak and Just A Random Tuesday by Twisted Biscuit.

Anyone have any favorites?
