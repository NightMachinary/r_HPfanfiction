About 3 or 4 years ago I was reading a long fanfic which covered the marauders era, beginning, as far as I can remember, with their first year and continuing on until their deaths. It would probably have been on ff.net, and the only scene I can remember distinctly is one where Sirius kisses Remus, but in a really cruel way. I think it took place after the Snape/Whomping Willow incident, Remus is in the hospital wing, Sirius saunters up and kisses him, and says something like "It's what you wanted, isn't it?" The whole fanfic actually looked at Sirius/Remus quite a bit (although I don't think it was not one of the fics which aims to explore the relationship exclusively) and Sirius was portrayed on a razor blade between casual cruelty as above and genuine friendship/caring/vulnerability/etc.

Anyone know which fic I might be talking about?
