:END:
Hey everyone! I'm looking for a fanfic where Harry and Draco were tortured and 3 weeks later they are saved and cared for by snape. I'm pretty sure Harry won't talk and Draco has panic attacks. I've been looking everywhere for it but can't find it. Or if you know of any other fics where snape cares for Harry and Draco that would be super appreciated! I'm always looking for new stories to read :)
