See title. I'm in a mood for some fanfics that go into detail about magical theory - why wands are used if wandless magic is possible, why certain incantations do what they do, why potions don't kill you when they're made of highly poisonous ingredients, why Transfiguring a mouse into a snuffbox is/isn't animal cruelty, et cetera.

Further requests:

- No character bashing.
- I'd prefer fics with a low body-count and a high friend-count for our resident Main Character. In other words, no Grey/Dark/Loner Harry.
- I'd prefer it if the fic elaborates on canon magic rather than inventing more of it. I think if there was some kind of super-ritual that rips Horcruxes out of humans, Dumbledore would have found it well before Harry did (and he'd have used it, too!).

So far, I like the following fics that fit my request: linkffn(10070079; 12713828)

The Arithmancer does a good job elaborating on magic, but it is a very Powerful!Hermione fic so fair warning on that front.

Victoria Potter, by the author's admission, avoids the canon plotline as much as possible while still allowing events to transpire. [[/u/Taure]] put a lot of thought into how magic would work, and it shows in their fic.

I've read Methods of Rationality as far as I could stomach. Let's leave it at that.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

** If you're up for some Snape/Hermione, I'd suggest you read Ordinary People by Hayseed. It's only available on fictionalley though. And Hermione is young (18), so if it bothers you no point. But it's about Hermione and Snape trying to discover the very origin of magic, if it's genetic or magnetic, etc, and it's very academically-oriented, with real research, so it could be an interesting read if that's what you're looking for.
