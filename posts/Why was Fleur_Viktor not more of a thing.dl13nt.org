I get that Viktor was attracted to Hermione for her intelligence, but it seemed that Hermione was more interested in him as a friend. And Fleur didn't seem romantically interested in Roger Davies. And there's a lot of potential for a background Fleur/Viktor pairing. They're competing against each other, so they're not meant to be, they're top students, both are in a strange land with a hostile student body. Why isn't there more fanfic of the two?


** Because Viktor in GoF was introduced as not being super hot, and not being attracted to girls based on how hot they were. (This was later retconned in the DH wedding scene.) Fleur was introduced as snobbish, pretentious, and cool towards people until they'd done something to impress her. She didn't stop thinking of Harry as a "leetle boy" until he proved himself by rescuing Gabrielle from the lake. Viktor never did anything to endear himself to or impress Fleur.

From an in-story perspective, the Bulgarian quidditch team uses Veela women as mascots. Maybe Viktor is familiar with their harpy transformation abilities and decided to stay away for good reason, or maybe Bulgarians have taboos against mixed relationships, like Britain has with giant/human hybrids.

*** TBF, there could easily have been some factors at work during the DH wedding scene. Maybe he was just out of a bad breakup and looking for a rebound?

**** Yeah, he was at a wedding in a foreign country and was probably not intending to spend much time there, thats quite a difference to him spending many months in Britain where he actually gets a chance to know the girls hes interested in.

** Because neither was an important character. Fleur with Harry or Hermione is popular because Harry and Hermione are popular (and because Fleur is a magical wet dream based on the effect she has on people). Viktor/Hermione is somewhat popular because it was canon and Hermione is popular. Go write Fleur/Parvati and see how much attention that gets.

Fanfiction is about telling stories. However, most people are not interested in talking to themselves, so they try to find ways to get attention. And writing Harry/Fleur, unlike Viktor/Fleur, guarantees you readers. So given that there aren't many plots which stop working if you replace Viktor with Harry, people choose Harry/Fleur. Even if you want professional Quidditch, Harry has the skills, so you go for a postwar Quidditch fic.

** Well, do you often see pairings for Viktor other than Hermione in fanfiction? Or for Fleur other than Harry or Bill? Not particularly.

Is it a possibility to write something up between them? Sure. Though I'm not as certain about the appeal you have there - after all, they're from /very/ different backgrounds and actually have a fairly sizable support group from their own schools. The language barrier is also possibly big - if they're communicating in English as the only shared language, it could be very tough for them to understand each other with the accents. They also come from very different cultural backgrounds - Durmstrang is a known dark school, and if they have /any/ of the pureblood tendencies that we see in canon, I don't see them having much respect for a school headed by a barely-disguised half-giantess.

In addition, most fanfics will be revolving around Harry. That makes characters like Fleur and Krum more in the background, /unless/ they're being written to interact more with Harry + Ron + Hermione. And there's a limit to how many characters you can add on to that before getting too bloated - along with what I think is likely, that most people tend to care more about one of the two over the other, at least enough to add them to the story in more detail.

** One ship. Harry/Fluer.

Or the fact that Victor becomes a DE Rapisy who dares to harm sweet and innocent Fannon Haermione who cannot do anything wrong. OoO just thinking about her makes me ashamed that I would even dare think about her like that.
