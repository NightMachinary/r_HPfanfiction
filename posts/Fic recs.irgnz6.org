Hey I have been an avid reader of Harry Potter fanfiction for multiple years and I am looking for some longer completed fics. Does anybody know any good fics where Harry has found family, snape is his guardian or mentor, or one where harry gets saved from the dursleys and the story is about him growing as a person and getting past his abuse. I come across some fics that just seem to unrealistic in how fast he heals, but there are less of them then the good ones I have read. Does not matter whether its on a03 or fanfiction.net. I am so happy I found this reddit!

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE
