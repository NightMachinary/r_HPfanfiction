A boy can't go up to the girls dorms, why can girls go up to the boys. We seen Hermione go up to Ron and Harry's year dorm. I'm not sure if it all four house's or just the Lions. I understand boys can take advantage of girls, but girls could take advantage also. I understand about the Professors going up to both


** Okay, I actually have a headcanon that the gender wards on each dormitory are different

Gryffindor prevents boys from entering the girls' dorms but not vice versa. This is because Gryffindor drew from his own experiences of sleeping around a lot and decided that young boys couldn't be trusted (young Godric certainly couldn't have been).

Ravenclaw prevents boys from entering the girls' dorms and girls from entering the boys' dorms. This is because she is an egalitarian who believed in propriety.

Hufflepuff has no gender wards. This is because she was... shall we say... progressive.

Slytherin also has no gender wards, because he didn't want people getting complacent about their safety while they slept.

**** The thing is, we give on Rowling for this, but even up to the 90s only boys/men were widely thought to be the only ones that raped (and that men couldn't be raped). So, really, it /kinds of/ make sense. I mean, I expect someone as level-headed as Dumbledore or McGonagall wouldn't have thought that way, but since it's background things it's not like Rowling would care or even think about it.

** It's part of the ‘Boys can't control themselves around girls, so we'll remove the temptation' mentality. In other words (according to this mindset!), I guess it was felt boys couldn't be responsible for their actions if they're near a girl and get “tempted” to rape her. That, and “good” girls were shamed for having a sex drive, so for them to go up to the boys' dorm was just not ‘proper behaviour'.

I have no idea why it was never changed.

** It's a product of the author and times it was written in - and even still, men are viewed as more likely to abuse such things. Eg, think of the trope where guys will try to sneak into the women's locker rooms in high school to watch them undress, or all the manga/anime examples of looking at the women's hot springs - it's all the same sort of view.

So definitely, the girls could take advantage of it as well - but, well, that wasn't really the view in the 90s or in JKR's mind. (For the latter, I think we can say that given her more recent statements/views on trans people, that she has biases about those she views as 'men' entering 'women-only' spaces, and that's something that does shine a different light on the subject you mention)

I think I would personally change things around a bit - I feel like both the boys and the girls should be able to go to the others rooms, but that they'd have put some restrictions (eg, the doors being locked except to the people sleeping in the room and professors, or only being allowed during the day or the like). That way friends can hang out with a bit more privacy than the common room would provide.

****** Because even today, as a man, if you told people that a woman raped you, you'd have trouble being taken seriously. OotP was written in early 2000s when as a man if you told someone that a woman raped you, they'd just pat you on the shoulder and say 'lucky guy', the action happens in mid-90s in a school that's still stuck in 1700s. So, yeah, I think that Hogwarts has a long way to go until it decides to remove those charms or add them to the boys dormitory.

I think the idea is that guys can physically overpower girls and they are considered typically the sex-hungry gender. However in this universe the girls are not defenseless either since they have magic.

******* I disagree. Strongly.

Rowling has ideas that in our current society, especially US and western Europe are starting to be considered outdated. But in the 90's they where not. Also, she describes a different society, that has at least some ideas, habits, rules and morals that are different to ours. That does not make them outdated, but different.

Consider Frank Herbert's Dune. Would any of the societal rules of the fremen be considered outdated? No, it's a different society, molded by needs different than ours, etc.

Why are we then making judgements about the morals and habits of an obviously different society? Yes, it has some overlap with our society, but that does not mean we should expect total overlap!

From reading your reply, it seems like you're defending her reasoning, which is your right. However, allow me to regal you with a story.

A kid sat at a computer back in 2000 or so, just playing a game when his aunt came into the room and trailed her finger down the back of his neck and said that she liked her men "a little hairy."

The kid is six years old, and a few months away from turning seven. He doesn't exactly /know/ what that means, but shrugs it off. Almost twenty-one years later, the rest of that year is blocked from his memories save for when he gets nightmares. He thinks he was raped and, having been brought up in a small town that shunned all those who weren't seen as "normal," he kept it buried inside of himself.

Just like he learned to keep his sexuality hidden.

The kid in the story was me. JK Rowling has given us zero reasons as to believe that the Wizarding World has morals that aren't backwards. Case in point: Krum is technically an adult in the world, and was making moves on Hermione, who was underage. I believe that in Deathly Hallows, he was looking at another girl who was underaged. And don't get me started on the idea that there's a different "age of consent" when the Triwizard Tournament was only for "those over the age of seventeen" as they'd be considered adults.

********* Sorry for the late reply, I was not on my computer since I posted that. I don't defend her reasoning. I agree that all societies are flawed, and some people suffer due to the flaws. I agree that our current moral changes seem to better the society overall (but I always keep in mind that all effects of changes become obvious a long time after making a change, so maybe our changes bring some unknown bad along with the obvious good).

But I disagree with criticizing the morals of a different fictional society according to our own morals. An author can create a new society, it can be flawed but as long as it is consistent (and I don't think that JKR is consistent, feel free to criticize that!) that's how it is.

The magical society is flawed. There is rampart discrimination based on birth, the politicians are corrupt, the people are even worse sheep than our people are... and only the girl dormitories are warded against boys (and many other things, like Molly hitting her children, bad teachers, etc). But this is how that world is, and the story has to happen in that world.

And the flaws have a logic inside the book. We have a society with people living for over 100 years as a norm. That society will evolve much slowly than ours (I still have many arguments with my 70y old mother about a lot of our current changes, she would never consider a guy can ever e raped, and when she was young she was quite a rebel and a free thinker).

I also have trauma since my own childhood that should not happen to kids in our generation, and I am 100% sure my kids are getting their own subtle trauma from how I grow them up, but I have no ideea what I do wrong, I'll find some of them out in 20-30 years (ofc I don't want to create that and if I knew, I would not do whatever bad things I do!) and I hope I'll be able to understand and accept the new changes.

Two of your quotes back to back. If we decide to allow for a suspension of disbelief permeate through their society, I'd be willing to bet that the quote about it being a different society would die a horrible death. The reason is due to the fact that one of two things will be proven. One is that it is only as bad as it seems, which, lets face it, is pretty medieval at best.

The second option is that it's a lot worse, with a lot of the things we'd call trauma being brushed off as "learning experiences" by the Wizarding World.

At what point do we stop and say that there's things that need to be addressed about the society Rowling created? Cause I'm of the opinion that it was easy to sneak in a few of her own beliefs into it and brush it off. And we should call attention to things that may not have aged well.

Like the fact that a teacher was extremely biased, the fact that there seemed to have been something going on between an adult and child during the Triwizard Tournament(Krum and Hermione, since only those over 17 could join it), someone managed to get an underaged student into it, and the fact that almost nobody batted an eye at the idea of child soldiers being used to take down the Ministry. Something that, if we're being completely honest, should've been investigated by an outside party to avoid any sort of conflict of interests that would've popped up.

This is what I'm trying to say: we can think that the society that Rowling has created is quite vicious and outdated (and I totally agree with you here, and it's obvious that at least parts of it are intended to be bad for the story to continue). we can comment that it is so. What I don't think we can do is criticize the author for creating this fictional society. It's like it is by design: with antiqued habits and many many unjust things happening.

Now you, in 2021 consider that some aspects of the society written in 1990's that already wanted to depict an old and flawed society has even more flaws than the author wanted to put there. Well... duuh! I can bet you that in 2050 there will be even much more such flaws.

I mean, would you complain about a book that describes a 1800's schools where the kids are called to the principal office and beaten with a wooden paddle on the naked ass? Yes, it's horrific for us now but that's how our society was at that time. The principal was not doing anything wrong, but what he considered the best think he can do to help those kids. And that's the case with the Harry Potter books.
