Some of stories that would fit:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3751748/1/Harry-Potter-and-Merlin-s-Reaper]] (Complete - basically, I am looking for something like that but better written. Or at least not worse)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent]] (self-rescued and only partially, WIP)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron]] (not exactly fitting, WIP)

OK, it may be also other character - not only Hermione.


** This one is another "self-rescue" one-shot: linkffn(6593112).

  Hermione Granger is captured and imprisoned in the dungeons of Malfoy mansion. Alone, wandless, defenceless... Yeah, right!

  After years of captivity, Hermione Granger fights her way onto the streets of Voldemort's London with only the knife in her pocket and the blood on her hands. There's a checkpoint on every corner, a curfew enforced by Voldemort's most trusted followers, and the only way back to the Boy Who Lived is through the Death Eater responsible for her capture in the first place. COMPLETE.
