#+TITLE: Are there any good fics where numbers other than 7 are magic and have an effect? I read blood crest and the author had 0 and 6 be significant and in the Black Queen series numbers were important at one point. Or if you don’t have a fic what other numbers do you think are magic/what do they represent

** 7 is actual more of a gamble/luck number. If you throw two six-sided dice the most likely number is 7 (1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1) compared to all other numbers 2(1+1), 3(1+2, 2+1), 4 (1+3, 2+2, 3+1), 5(1+4. 2+3, 3+2, 4+1), 6 (1+5, 2+4, 3+3, 4+2, 5+1), 8(2+6, 3+5, 4+4, 5+3, 2+6), 9(3+6, 4+5,5+4, 6+3), 10(4+6, 5+5, 6+4), 11(5+6, 6+5), 12(6+6)

so while it make sense as a lucky number, it never made much magical sense.

The magic number was always 3. Things happen in 3s is a common saying. 3 times is the charm. And all it close relatives like 9 (3*3) and 6 as the turn around of 9

then you have numbers like 4 that is a death number in the Japanese language/ culture.

The 8 with it closed bond and similarity to a Moebius band and in its form of an hourglass, nevermind that you just have to put it on its side to create infinity.

I let some of my characters discuss this in one chapter for Aritmantic homework once.

Yeah, that's not really true. The number 7 has had important cultural, religious, and magical connotations for thousands of years. See here for more info: [[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201506/seven-reasons-we-are-captivated-the-number-seven]]

** /Time is the Fire/ by Oddment Tweak has a section where it goes into the importance and meaning of numbers in arithmancy in relation to Pythagorean philosophy. It's by no means the focus of the story, but I thought it was done well. The numbers that were discussed were 5, 7, 3, and 1. I think it all takes place in Chapter 15, but there could be more elsewhere.

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.
