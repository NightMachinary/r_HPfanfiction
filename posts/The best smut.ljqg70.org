  Witch Weekly's 'Modern Romance' series asks anonymous witches and wizards to record a week in their sex lives---with comic, tragic, provocative, and patently revealing results. Each week, a new episode unfolds in the lives of the Wizarding World's elite. Multiple pairings, post-war, EWE. COMPLETE.

Summer Rain - Regulus/Harry (age-gap) oneshot.

The Ties That Bind Us - Drarry 8th-year oneshot

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/1805545]]

Horny Harry series - a collection of one shots, and it's best if you read them in order. Basically just Harry being gay and having a lot of sex.
