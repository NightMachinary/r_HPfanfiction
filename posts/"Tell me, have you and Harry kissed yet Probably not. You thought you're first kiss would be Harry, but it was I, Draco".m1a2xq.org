** I hate this so...

Plot twist!

Ron was with Ginny but had wandered off and came back to see it. Ron is not happy. He is even less happy when he finds out that Ginny never gave any sort of an ok.

Malfoy better run. Ginny has six protective older brothers out for his blood. And don't even get me started on what Molly would do
