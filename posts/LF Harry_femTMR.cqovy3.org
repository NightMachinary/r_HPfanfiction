  When Harry and Cedric grab the Cup, they are transported to a graveyard, where Harry witnesses the resurrection of Lady Voldemort... who isn't quite what he'd expected. For one, she isn't trying to kill him. For another, she doesn't seem to like the Death Eaters either. Harry/fem!Voldemort.

** linkao3(Departure from the Diary by Tendrael) : It's well written and still gets updated quite regularly although it's not even close to complete.

linkffn(12927826) : It's not Diary TMR but otherwise it is what you are searching for.

**** I wanted to try something different when I wrote the story. First person also seemed like a logical step given that it had an extremely narrow cast focus (I mean, the two main characters are sharing a body at this point in the story), and I also like how first person lends itself to the internal dialogues between Harry and Tamelyn.

  End of second year AU. fem!Riddle. Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Thankfully, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride.

  ‚ÄúAre you afraid of me, Harry?‚Äù His mouth opened, but no words came. His mind blanked, his cheeks draining completely of whatever color had stained them in response to the curious note of Riddle's voice. It sounded innocuous enough. Harmless with how casual she'd asked the question, but Harry knew better.

** Linkffn(A Beautiful Collision). It's dormant (but not dead; the author has expressed interest in returning to the story, and was still pretty active on the site when last I checked), and only three (admittedly lengthy) chapters, but it's the best HP/TMR I've read.

Edit: the bot linked to . . . not the right fic, so here's a direct link: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9666689/1/A-Beautiful-Collision]]
