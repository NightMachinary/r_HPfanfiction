What are some plausible ways to get Harry into Ravenclaw without straying too far from his canon characterization?

As examples of what I mean by "plausible," here's a couple of ways I can see him going into Slytherin or Hufflepuff without much of a problem:

*Slytherin*

Harry is noted as having some qualities of this house in canon -- he can be clever, resourceful, determined, and sometimes throws rules out the window. He really doesn't seem to think he should be in charge, but he's /good/ at being a leader, which is another for the Slytherin column. He shows cunning on at least one major occasion, when getting the truth about Horcruxes out of Slughorn.

He isn't overly ambitious, though, which is one of the most infamous traits of this house ... and yet he could be. An orphan with something to prove could find Slytherin very appealing, and kids tend to be naturally big dreamers -- "I wanna be an astronaut-ninja-pirate!" -- which could translate into ambition.

And he doesn't even need to be dark!Harry to want to be sorted there. It could be as easy as him hearing about it being the house of Merlin, a wizard so famous that even Muggles know of him, before he ever hears the name "Voldemort." What lonely boy-turned-wizard wouldn't dream of being like Merlin?

*Hufflepuff*

Harry has quite a few traits of this house: he's loyal, and generally tolerant (of non-assholes). He seems to have a sense of fairness, like trading sweets for sandwiches with Ron, freeing Dobby, or helping out fellow competitors in the Triwizard Tournament. Although not a bleeding heart, he tends to err on the side of kindness when it comes to nice people. He /does/ tend to skip out on school work when he can, but once he sets his mind to do something important, he is dedicated to the end.

Hufflepuff has a reputation (amplified by fanon) as the house of odds-and-ends who hand out free hugs, but maybe that could make Harry want to go there. The idea of a place where he could simply /belong/ could be enough for him.

*Ravenclaw*

... hell if I know.

Ignoring intelligence -- he's not dumb, but he seems to value street smarts more -- there's always creativity, originality, individuality, and acceptance to lean on as potential qualities that a Ravenclaw Harry could showcase. But intelligence and wit are really /the/ traits of this house, and it's tough trying to figure out how he'd get there without them or without a fic being too AU.

Any thoughts? Suggestions on how to go about it? Evidence from canon showing his Ravenclaw side? This one's stumping me, and any help or discussions would be appreciated.

​


** He was excited to start learning! He read his textbooks beforehand - that's how he picked up Hedwig as a name.

Additionally, we also know that the Dursleys weren't keen on asking questions - maybe the Hat sees this as an opportunity to nurture a yet unexplored spark of curiosity.

Finally, Harry is fairly sassy, which can speak to wit and a quick mind as well. The "no need to call me sir" line comes to mind.

*** Thanks, those are some really great points and ideas!

Now it's much easier to see how he could go into Ravenclaw. To go off your first example, his interest in his textbooks could easily led to more curiosity about magic, how it works, etc. -- he might ask more technical questions of Ron when he's on the Express, or maybe he'd be morbidly curious enough to ask Hermione exactly what she's read about him.

That's a neat idea, and one I don't think I've seen before. I can see a Harry who wants to ask questions, is just brimming with them, but doesn't, and the Sorting Hat picks that up.

The thought of Harry being sorted into Ravenclaw for his smartass streak is hilarious.

*** Yeah, that does sound like a motivation canon Harry would have; he does like to agitate people who bully him, but a lot of times it's in understated, funny ways. /The Dursleys hate magic, therefore I'll learn all I can about it,/ is a good one, and it fits in well with the tone of the earlier books.

** He's fairly witty at times in the books, unlike the movies. Harry is actually one of the few characters who would fit in any house without an issue---although I think the some of the older Slytherins, whose parents may have been arrested after the fall of Voldemort, would create real issues as would Snape---and I feel like his personality would clash with what little we see of Zacharias Smith and Justin Finch Fletchly in Hufflepuff. But there's definitely a hint that he wants to do the work, it's just the Dursleys lock up his supplies, and when something interests him he follows through---and that is a Ravenclaw quality.

Also, Flitwick imo is one of the best professors in the book, too. Enough has been said about Snape's teaching, and as much as I love Minerva she sent a bunch of 11 year olds out to a forest at night and takes obscene amounts of points off. Pomona looks the other way while her entire house bullies Harry. Flitwick, on the other hand, seems warm and caring, and generally seems to treat all the houses equally. If Flitwick introduced him to the wizarding world, I could see him wanting to follow him into Ravenclaw.

But if we're talking about characters in general without any of the baggage of family tradition or house reputations....

I would say Draco is a total Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, Hermione is a Slytherin to the bone in some ways, Ron is a Slytherin or Ravenclaw, and the twins would be equally suited to Slytherin as they would Gryffindor.

***** Um... ambition and cunning? Walk With Me....

Bill (and Charlie) deliberately found jobs that took them out of the country, even though they are shown to like their family. And have connections that would let them be in those jobs while being in the same country. Justified when Bill, going against marriage custom, has his family, not the bride's, prepare the wedding. His mother takes his return to Britain as a given, and spends a sizeable part of book 7 complaining about how Bill couldn't find a nice English girl... while preparing his freaking wedding! It quite dramatically shows that Bill finding out-of- country employment was brilliant, bold... and cunning. Whether Charlie thought of the same thing himself, gave Bill the idea, or coordinated with him, we don't know. We do though, see enough of Bill in action, to recognize the cunning in the former Head Boy.

I will assume that the ambitions of fellow Head Boy Percy, were made clear enough from the books, and from other characters comments about him.

In a similar vein, as a reminder: Fred and George deliberately tanked their OWL and NEWT tests in order to force their mom to stop constantly talking about them going into Ministry work. They still did the school work - and more - to learn how to make all of their joke products. And except for Lee, Angelina, Alicia and Harry (that is, those people constantly around them THAT AREN'T THEIR FAMILY), no one suspected they would be the next Zonko's... except every Weasley older than them.

Also, don't forget Ginny sneaking out and practising broom flying, with no one noticing... at least, no one said they noticed her at it.

Then there's the real surprising one: Arthur. Possibly the safest post in Magical Law Enforcement (you did recall MMA is part of MLA, trees), Arthur Weasley is in a remarkably perfect-for-him job, for a man that doesn't know the function of a rubber duck. Who collects electric plugs, but not their attached cords. Who has a working, flying, invisibility-enabled Ford Anglia at his home (well, had, as of book 2). Who is perfectly positioned to know all of the political tricks going on, but not to get caught up in them. Who kept his job through the Voldemort takeover.

Please, someone tell me how the longest- serving department head will not be a shoe-in to replace interim Minister Shacklebolt. Then, tell me how it shows no ambition or cunning to make everyone you know see you as the obvious choice for Minister of Magic.

I'm just saying that these folks have too much success at their ambitions to not be ambitious. Also, as book 1 showed us, it's not unthinkable that someone who ought to be in Slytherin would deliberately choose not to go there.

While also being a duellist! And with a little tweaking -- his age is never mentioned, so it could work -- a story could easily say, oh, right, he went to school around the same time as Dumbledore, and I can see the two of them being friends since Dumbledore was a bit of an outcast himself before he got to Hogwarts.

Honestly, Flitwick has so much potential for character expansion that it's disappointing there aren't a lot more Ravenclaw-centric fics out there.

** The hat seems to sort by potential in some cases (Gryffindor, for example. I doubt many children do anything massively brave before school, esp the muggle-raised ones. Bravery becomes much more obvious when you're in a dangerous magical world where your life is at stake) and I've always thought Harry could've went any way depending on his intro to the magical world.

He's got the curiosity and interest in magic and learning about it before he starts Hogwarts, and in canon it sort of falls to the wayside as he's surrounded by Ron who doesn't have the same curiosity, being pureblood, and Hermione who perhaps has the interest but initially poor social skills that means it's unlikely Harry would've turned to her with his questions. Hagrid is lovely, of course, but was expelled early on and doesn't seem interested in academics. I think if Harry was collected from the Dursley's by a professor or met someone else on the train who would encourage his curiosity he could've went there easily ! I've always liked the idea of Flitwick and Harry interacting more. I think if he'd been sent to collect Harry he would've been able to encourage Harry's curiosity for magic, and we might've found ourselves with a Harry who has that same love of magic and desire to learn everything he can about it and himself ! the idea of him delving into magic because it's so different from the Dursleys and everything they've taught him makes sense to me, and I think if Harry had one teacher who pushed him academically and encouraged him to do his best he would've ended up pretty different !

Magic /is/ something to be curious about. That's one thing that has always driven me a little nuts about the books -- the lack of questions about something so fantastic. (But heavy worldbuilding is not what JKR was going for, and I love the series as-is.)

Fics like that would also put the wonder back into magic, I think, presenting it as something to be delved into and discovered rather than spammed like video game combos.

It's as if you never heard of one of the most prominent members of Ravenclaw: Luna Lovegood.

Ravenclaws don't have to be Hermione clones. Hermione isn't even in Ravenclaw (yet some people seem to think that she is the most Ravenclaw representation ever).

** I can't see Harry being sorted into Ravenclaw naturally without him being too OOC. To stay canon Harry, he needs something to push him there. He decided against Slytherin mostly because he was exposed to people saying negative things about Slytherin. He needs to be exposed to people extolling the negatives of Gryffindor as well.

I'm imagining the sorting starting the same- the hat recommending Slytherin and Harry going, "Not Slytherin!" Then the sorting hat suggests Gryffindor. "No, not Gryffindor!" He eventually convinces the hat he wants neither house. After that, I'd say it's a toss up between Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw. You could easily have him in either house if it was between those two and it wouldn't seem OOC.

Seriously, (canon) Harry doesn't have the qualities for this house! He doesn't want to know stuff just because (he either slouches/slacks off with (Mo-)Ron and just performs just above average (practically, his writen stuff is probably worse!) or learns stuff he truly thinks he needs (Patronus charm, stuff for the tournament etc.), but not a iota more!)! He lacks curiousity, sense of wounder! Frankly Harry is kind of the guy stuff happens to, he doesn't do much on his own :(
