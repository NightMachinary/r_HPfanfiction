I've been reading Secrets and Slytherin and there was a fanfiction writer mentioned who wrote a fanfiction about the series. The author was called “Lesbiannaisanna”, who wrote something called “Tales of Lions and Snakes”. I really want to read the story, but it says it isn't available. Does anybody have a readable copy?
