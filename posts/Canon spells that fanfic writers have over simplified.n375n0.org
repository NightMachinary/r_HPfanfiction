It's been way too long since I've read the actual series and way too long since a story has caught my attention. So I decided to write something that I've always wanted to read but to do need a refresher on most of the canon spells and their effective level on the story.

I'm trying to keep the canon spells as close as to what they were in canon.

For example, fanon has taken the Mending charm and completely over simplified not to the point that, that spell fixes whatever you want. When in canon, not only do you need the the bits and pieces of an item to fixe the broken item. But it doesn't just suddenly return it to it's previous quality. I remember in canon that robes can get frayed or lose the quality of the robe the more times you use the mending charm.

So the jist if this post is.. What other canon spells has fanon taken and changed their purpose or has changed the way they work.


** Or Muffliato. If I remember canon right, it prevents people around you from understanding your conversation because it sounds like buzzing/white noise. But I've seen a lot of fics that make it so that no noise can be heard or where of you cast it on someone, they can't hear anything around them (usually like for sleeping people)

*** This is a slight tangent but something that always irritates me in fics in regards to Muffliato is that lots of fics have it as a commonly known spell, when in canon it was invented by Snape and the only reason that Harry and friends know it is because it was in the Half-Blood Prince's potions book

***** I'd say that there are other privacy spells, but because they're commonly known, they can easily be cancelled. Whereas I see muffliato as a)harder to sneakily cancel because it has a specific finite(unsure if that's canon), like Levicorpus did, and b)subtle enough that unless someone was right beside you, they'd not realize there even was a charm - they'd just think it was a bout of tinnitus or crackly ears or just that they were talking really really inaudibly.

*** Ever since I got a smart-assed review asking if I'd 'forgotten about the Point Me spell' because 'it would drastically shorten this story' this has been a personal bugbear of mine.

Well, considering the person they're looking for is not being held at the north pole, I don't think it would shorten it all that much, funnily enough. If you're going to be a smart-alecky stickler for canon, then at least be /right/ about the canon you're preaching.

And lets not mention the fact that, if we're getting into canon-stickler territory, 'Point Me Horcrux' kinda buggers most of the plot of Deathly Hallows too, don't you think? I wonder how it took Dumbledore so very long to find the locations of those Horcruxes when all he needed was a simple spell!

**** The issue is, "banish" is the opposite of "summon" and "conjure" in D&D and many other magical settings. "Summon" and "Conjure" both mean to call something from <other>, such as 'conjure spirits'. Conjure also comes from con- (together) jurare (to swear, or make an oath)

You can Banish (remove from the current world, send back to hell) a Demon, but that doesn't just fling them down the road, which is all the Banishing charm does.

[[/u/applepi101]] And vanishing does not, in fact, mean something is gone forever. Things have actually been un-vanished in the books.

I don't really like it, but it IS true that a third-person limited perspective is bound to miss or misunderstand things beyond their experience.

If JKR were a better writer she could've used that as a means to explore Harry's growth as a wizard, where in early books he misunderstood stuff a lot and only later, as he learned more, did he re-examine some of his assumptions from his first few years and realize that he'd been wrong. But if JKR were a better writer, there wouldn't be so many plot holes to fill, and the fanfic community wouldn't have such a field day with her work.

Canon Harry strugled to learn the spell while in 4th year, while it's pretty common for the magically raised Harry to use this spell the first time he is on the Hogwarts Express (usually to find Trevor and show to Hermione how good he is at magic ).

I get it that a magically raised or more talented Harry should be better with Magic, but there should probably be a limit.

Canon Harry may have learnt the Patronus in PoA but he can't do Human Transfiguration, or Silent Casting, he is still a normal 3rd Year outside of knowing a cool spell.

I'm also not convinced that the Patronus is really that hard. Sure Canon say that it's a very difficult spell (Lupin tell him that, the Wizengamot is impressed that he could do the spell), but at the same times, most of the DA learnt how to use the spell in a matter of weeks (even faster than Harry did). So if the Patronus a really difficult spell, or is it just an obscure one that seem difficult because it is only usefull for 3 or 4 profession?

****** I think it would even be easier for Harry's generation as they are young.

Powerful Happy memories are hard to come by. Especially one that isn't linked in some way or another to something hurtful or even tragic.

I had to find a untained memory, full of peace and happiness for therapy. Not necessarily powerful, but just no negative attached to the memory. And seriously it had been hard. Because this memory involved that person that died, this one that places that something else bad happened, and this and that. And it's hard to only think of that one moment and to not have your mind goes to the next one, or what you want to think of.

And The older wizards went through a war. The birth of their child might still be their happiest most powerful memory. But how you do not think about their death?

Sure, I go to the worst-case scenario, but I think the more experience you get, the hardest it is to find a memory absolutely free of all negative.

Maybe it takes a certain psychological aptitude or a certain kind of personality, like Draco is good at occlumency because he's good at compartmentalizing while Harry isn't good at either of it.

For example, I've had a pretty rough life but I can think of at least five untainted happy memories just off the top of my head. And it's pretty easy for me to see each memory as detached from what happened previously or next.

And Harry survived a very rough childhood with little psychological damage, so maybe it's a personality trait of his like it is for me, and like compartmentalizing his mental experience is for Draco.

****** I also feel that very few people know it because they never bother to learn. As far as we know there are no wild demetors, at least in Britain as far as we see, then the only time you could encounter one would be in Azkaban. Only when Voldemort started using them did it become a useful spell. Even then, I suspect most witches and wizards didn't know the spell existed, the ministry probably didn't shout out too the world the method to counter their prison guards. Probably only people working for the Ministry or in the Order actually knew someone who could teach it to them.

There's a reason that the "lazy/stupid wizards" trope exists. Rowling did everything she could to make 95% of the Wizarding populace worthless losers. Without exaggeration or flanderizing of any kind, it's easy to make the case that muggles are just smarter or more capable than wizards, and I hate it.

He sees the dragons at night on November 21, gets advice from fake-Moody on the 22nd or 23rd, and practices Summoning with Hermione (before it's taught in class) on the 23rd. He masters it in that one day to the point that he can Summon his broom from something like half a mile away in the middle of a stressful situation. It's NOT that hard to learn. Harry's not the most studious fellow, and this isn't a defense-oriented spell where he tends to shine.

****** That Harry didn't start practising the spell until the night before strikes me as a very tenuous interpretation of the text.

Everything seems to indicate that the Summoning Charm has heavy theoretical prerequisites. In Chapter 15 (i.e., before the delegations arrive), we get

#+begin_quote
  Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms.
#+end_quote

After that, your own quote indicates that Harry performed badly at Summoning Charm in Flitwick's class---but that would require him to have attempted it in the first place. He also develops a mental block---and that, again, requires him to have kept trying.

Hermione has him read a lot of theory (presumably in addition to that assigned by Flitwick), and then, the night before the First Task, he finally gets it.

This reads to me like a culmination of a lot of effort and practice. And, the theoretical prerequisites (which may have prerequisites of their own) would make learning it at an earlier age more difficult.

Interestingly, this seems like a very different learning process from the Patronus Charm, where, IIRC, it was mainly about the wand motion and the right emotion---and so more suitable for learning at a younger age.

If, on the other hand, stupefy affects the body, similarly how a strong hit to the back of the neck or the head in general, then this would indeed not make sense.

I think it has to do with what the secret is about. Is it "James and Lily Potter live at Godric's Hollow" (meaning that, when they die, there's nothing to be kept secret) or is it "The Order of The Phoenix is based in Number 12 Grimmauld Place" (The Order being the secret).

In any case, Sirius wasn't the secret keeper of the Order's headquarters. It was Dumbledore. After his death, each member of the Order (including Snape) became the Secret Keepers.

** The Trace! - it's so nuanced that I don't think I've ever seen a fic portray it perfectly.

The single biggest mistake I see is the idea that it placed on a wand; this is incorrect, it is placed on every magical child through unknown means. It's worth noting that since Hermione says she practiced a few spells before coming to Hogwarts, it's possible that this is the triggering event - this also explains why accidental magic at a young age isn't detected.

The second most common is that people constantly forget that the Trace pings /any/ magic in the nearby vicinity of an underage witch or wizard - this is literally the idea reason Harry got in trouble in the summer before second year, yet people forget it all the time. This also includes magical means of transport - crucially Apparation!

Thirdly, while the Trace is placed on everyone, the Ministry does not follow up on uses of magic in wizarding areas, because obviously, they'd have to be sending out Aurors every ten seconds otherwise. So any underage kid is free to cast spells to their heart's content in Diagon Alley, for example.

Fourthly, when the Trace does trigger, it doesn't tell the Ministry who cast the spell (again, see Dobby incident) or /who's Trace was triggered/ merely where the spell was cast. This means that the Trace cannot be used to track a specific person! So long as you got out of dodge fast enough afterward, you wouldn't get in trouble. Again, Harry was presumed guilty because no other wizards were in the area at the time.

Finally, and by far the most confusing, there are a bunch of examples of the Trace /not/ working when it should, which fall to the author to explain away. Some of these are fairly easy to explain, like why the Trace didn't trigger when Arthur Weasely did magic at Privet Drive - he arranged a floo connection, which meant the Ministry knew he'd be there - but some of them really aren't. For example, the trace should have triggered when Tom Riddle killed his family at the age of sixteen. Probably the simplest is the idea that the Trace hadn't been invented yet, but this seems a little unlikely. You could also say that Tom Riddle found away around it, which would be extremely impressive, but also makes sense considering the Trace should have triggered around Harry in the graveyard, and again didn't.

Phew, that's a lot of info. Sorry for the rant, but I hope it helps!

Are Obliviators sent out as a matter of course? If so, why does anyone remember Harry's accidental magic? And why DOES Hermione get away with casting whatever she wanted for the YEAR she knew about magic, yet students aren't allowed to cast anything starting the moment they get on the train home?

*** personally, i've always assumed that trace can identify if there's an adult witch or wizard in the vicinity, so when arthur arrives at privet drive, the presence of his trace interacts with harry's and therefore somehow mutes it, as it may not be harry's magic. same with petigrew being at the cemetery --- it cancel's out the harry's trace somehow.

i've always thought it was odd and kind of interesting, and i don't think that they start handing out warnings and such until the kids do something exceedingly dangerous or have started attending a school. so while they may have pinged child magic, perhaps they just monitor for safety. turning a cat a different color or harry growing his hair back is obviously minor and harmless compared to other potential magics.

personally i've guessed that when they're children, it may come in color codes of some sort, meaning if, for instance, a muggleborn kid turned another child into a rat or something, the ministry can send someone to clean up and maybe even approach the family early.

***** the only part i diverged a lot from possible canon is idea that maybe it somehow monitors in color. it makes sense that the presence of an adult witch or wizard is also catalogued. we already know it monitors the type of spell. it's not a big leap that it can likely monitor if one is present or the danger level of the spell in some way.

i made an educated guess based on canon rather than completely changing and morphing the spell to fit my own parameters. i do think it's an interesting piece of magic that she could have been more thorough about.

also: hermione “gets away with magic” for a year beforehand, because it isn't until they're at hogwarts that they are told they shouldn't be using magic outside of it. that's the whole reason they go --- to learn to hone their magic and control outbursts edit to add: & to be productive members of wizarding society. they have NO way to even start controlling it beforehand, so it would be ridiculous for the ministry to threaten someone with no way to even start learning. i'm not sure why you'd even attempt to make that argument. it's silly.

maybe it is a measure that helps find muggleborns but who knows? it was never explained.

i do so hate when i see people take a spell and totally change it up.

And they actually DO have a way to start controlling magic before going to Hogwarts. It's literally canon that Hermione started controlling her magic before going to Hogwarts. How? By getting a wand and reading spellbooks. Hogwarts isn't even necessary per se, any more than math class is necessary. Kids with enough motivation can learn without teachers lurking over their shoulders.

So basically all that telling kids they shouldn't use magic outside Hogwarts buys anyone is control. And it's only your interpretation that they're told that at Hogwarts. For all we know it's in the introductory literature for every Muggleborn, and Harry didn't get it because he got the Pure/Halfblood letter that assumed knowledge of owls for responses, rules about magic, and so on.

----

i think i'm beginning to see the disconnect.

/for me,/ i don't look at everything not strictly said in the books as non-canon. i look at it like, "oh, well, maybe it'll turn out they're right and it'll be canon rather than canon-compliant." & this has happened in a couple of fics, which i thought was rather impressive. we have brains, and we can make correct inferences about the wizarding world.

re: An educated guess based on canon is literally what fanfiction IS.

hm. but is it? i thought fanfiction was where you took the time to /intentionally/ deviate from what what was in the books for whatever reason to give another storyline --- like everything from changing up pairings to genders to giving harry a twin, etc. that's the difference to me. canon vs canon-compliant vs fanfiction.

i typically don't read strictly canon stories, so maybe this is why i don't see a difference between strictly canon, meaning you canNOT say that even though the trace can differentiate what spell is being cast and alerts the ministry what happened, that because they didn't dispatch obliviators for harry's hover charm, they won't dispatch for other more dangerous charms.

if you're basing your information from what was in the books but giving new scenarios and environments, etc., to give them different experiences and, in turn, change the entire storyline into something else, but you're keeping the rules of the world the same, i folder that (in my brain) as "possibly canon," until i receive more information that points to otherwise.

but maybe that makes me a nerd, hahaha, because too many diviations from canon or canon-compliant world rules (like turning the trace into something that goes onto wands or changing the muffliato to be a silencing charm that everyone and their mother knows) does start to add up for me and turn it from being canon-compliant to... just a pure work of fiction loosely based on the hp series.

sorry, i'm probably bothering you at this point, but i haven't really talked to anyone about fanfiction and what is and isn't canon before, so really, it's interesting to learn about your (and others) perspective.

When did I say that? I suppose I implied it with the "rules in the intro literature" bit... If anything, that PROVES my points that: a) the Trace probably doesn't apply before school (though that's debatable given the detection of accidental magic), and b) school is not all that necessary. The very fact that she of all people started learning magic ON HER OWN, just with wand and books, proves at least point (a), and possibly (b). And application of the Trace to STOP kids from learning anything further on their own is purely a method of control, nothing to do with safety. (As a side issue, Hermione Granger set a teacher on fire within her first three months of school. I'm absolutely positive that there's a rule against using magic against teachers, but she did it anyway. She likes making OTHERS obey rules, but for her they're optional.)

As for the rest, canon is what's in the books. Nothing more, nothing less. You can extrapolate on canon, but the result is no longer canon even if it doesn't directly contradict canon. You can change canon, but doing so willy-nilly tends to result in shitty fics.

The best fics have one point of divergence (e.g. Harry was born female, or Harry time-traveled back to the Ministry battle, or Petunia got in a car crash and left Harry with Vernon alone), and the rest is butterflies from that, or are unapologetically and wildly AU. The worst have one point of divergence, most things are butterflies from that, but then there are also random changes here and there that make no sense based on the premise of the story and are explained away with "Well, it's fanfiction." Yes, but even fanfiction needs to explain things that are different from canon, just as canon needs to explain things that are different from reality. WHY are they different from canon?

If the point of divergence is "Harry is bitten by Remus in the woods, becoming a werewolf", how does that change also somehow turn Dean Thomas into a girl? Was she a girl through the past four years? Did that mean there's another, different boy in Griffindor? How does that change the dynamic in Harry's dorm and Griffindor at large? Why is Deana not friends with Hermione? Etc. Introducing random changes in addition to the main point of divergence almost always creates more questions than answers, and results in a sloppy fic.

And yes, I know this is only peripherally related to what you discussed, as your points were peripherally related to the OP... but it's pet peeve of mine and I got off on a rant. :) Happens.

** There are so many spells that are used by characters who are way too young to be able to cast them. Like ‘accio' on Harry's first train ride to Hogwarts, or ‘aguamenti' when a character is thirsty in third year. There's also spells that very few characters should know, yet so many use ‘muffialto' or patronus messengers. Then there are spells that just completely change use to become more powerful. ‘Episkey' goes from healing very minor injuries healing gushing wounds. ‘Confundo' basically becomes a legal imperius curse instead of just making the target confused.

** Transfiguration. In fanon, characters do freeform transifguration all the time in combat or just day-to-day life. In canon they spend seven years learning a list of spells that all turn one specific object into another specific object with presumable a unique wand movement and incantation each time. Even if you say that they learn an example spell from a catagory, and once you master one you can self teach similar spells quite easily, you would have to be very lucky to know the exact spell to turn something lying around you into whatever you want to use.

They do nothing of the sort in canon. They specifically turn one thing into another, but nothing in canon suggests that they're all different spells. Or that there are any specific transfiguration spells at all.

*** If you could only transfigure a specific object into a specific object then it makes the whole thing pretty useless, especially with some of the things we see them practicing. like when in the world do you need to turn your pet into a cup? it makes more sense that they would be taught hard things (like living to inanimate or hard to soft) and then be able to use that for anything later in life

**** I always thought it was more about changing a particular quality - which is why we see partial transfigurations. So rather than "match" to "needle", you're learning "wood" to "metal", and could then apply that to other wooden objects.

Why not? That would fit with the magic power curve in HP, which is that the more you learn, study and practise magic, the better you are at it. And a lot of Transfiguration is nonverbal which makes it even more difficult to master.

** The first thing that sprung to my mind was the ease in which some characters in fics, especially pre-Hogwarts children, learn Occulemency. Sometimes its treated as the intense mental training needed to fortify your mind, other times it's like a lonesome brain workout for a few years (without any specific training, guidance, or (too much) research, mind you) before Hogwarts starts, and then suddenly the main character can coast on by without worrying about Snip Snap and Dumblydoo using legilimency on them at every corner.

** IMO Avada Kedavra is a bigger deal and much more effective in the books than it often ends up being in fanfic. It's commonly dodged or stopped by blocking with some sort of inanimate item in fics, when IIRC this basically never happens in the books.

***** There's no reason to think that any random solid object can't block AK. If I have a brick wall in front of me, why wouldn't that block the AK coming at me? If I have a solid wooden table in front of me, why wouldn't the table block it? Maybe the AK would destroy the table, but to say that only pure gold can block AK seems oddly specific.

******* Sure, but that doesn't mean solid objects /can't/ block AK, it just means that in that fight, Fawkes was the only thing that attempted to block an AK. If Dumbledore ducked behind a huge piece of concrete to avoid being hit by an AK, and the AK hits that concrete, what reason do we have to believe that the concrete wouldn't block the AK?

******** The major reason why is because I think we should operate with the assumption that the characters of Harry Potter aren't dumb, and they do know the rules of their world. The AK is ubiquitously presented as unblockable- if it was as easy as putting a solid object between you and the spell, that would be taught and be standard practice, since that isn't particularly hard for a wizard to do. The only things it's ever shown to be blockable by are things that can't be engineered by most people.

The second thing is that inanimate objects frequently don't block spells. Wizards are never presented as having to aim for exposed skin- if inanimate objects block spells, why doesn't clothing?

Finally, except for the two brother-wand interactions between Harry and Voldemort, the only AKs we know of that fail to kill something are 1) the one Fawkes blocks (which does kill Fawkes, but as a phoenix he gets better) and 2) the one that is described by Hagrid as having blown up the Potter's house.

********* Whenever people describe AK as being unblockable, I always took that as it's unblockable by magical shields ala Protego; i.e. if you try to block AK with Protego, the AK will just go through Protego as if it isn't even there.

I wouldn't call putting a solid object between you and an enemy wizard "simple" if you are in the middle of a duel with them, especially considering that spells generally move pretty fast; some spells even have instantaneous results that are not dependent on distance.

The thing about inanimate objects not blocking spells is a rabbit hole though, and when you think about it it doesn't make sense for inanimate objects to have no effect on spells. If I shoot a spell off in Hogwarts and I miss my target, is that spell going to just pass through every wall it hits until the spell is outside, and then it just keeps going forever until it hits flesh? Or does it make more sense that inanimate objects typically block spells, and there is simply some other reason that clothing is specifically exempt from this?

The only AKs that we know of that fail to kill something are the two examples you mentioned, along with Harry getting "killed" in the Forbidden Forest. That being said, we don't have any examples of an AK succeeding to literally pass through solid matter to hit a target behind said matter. As I mentioned in my previous point, it just doesn't make sense for inanimate objects to have /no/ effect on spells.

If I am in one room and I cast Lumos, does the light from Lumos also illuminate the room next to me as if the wall is not there? Or does the presence of the wall affect how the light behaves?

If spells can pass through solid matter, where is the cutoff point? Is a spell able to pass through one wall but not two? Can a spell pass through 10 walls but not 11? Can a spell pass through a literally infinite amount of walls without even slowing down, until it hits a flesh-and-blood target? If this is the case, why can't Voldemort just sit in Malfoy Manor all day and just constantly be shooting off spells in every direction under the guise of "well, they're going to hit a target eventually. I'll just blanket the UK in my hostile magic because the only thing affected by them is their target. I can snipe people from miles away."

If that sounds ridiculous, it's because it is. It makes /far/ more sense, logically, for spells to be affected by inanimate matter and clothes just happen to be exempt from this for any number of reasons.

** Occlumency. Technically, it's not a spell, but it's close enough.

We don't get to see what successful Occlumency training looks like from the point of view of the trainee, but what little we see seems to indicate that it's not something that one can learn just by sitting around and meditating, or on one's own, or without at least some trauma and suffering.

It certainly doesn't involve "mental shields" or "mindscapes", and it's probably not a one-and-done box that a character ticks on their way to power. It may, however, involve long-term trauma and personality changes. (That none of the Occlumenses we know are exemplars of mental health is telling.)

I also think there's not enough shown of successfully-cast but /weak/ spells and spells going wrong.
