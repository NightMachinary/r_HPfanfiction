In the original story Harry survives the killing curse because he has part of Voldemort's soul in him and the curse killed the soul piece. What if when the killing curse hits Lily Potter in the stomach her unborn child sacrifices there soul so that their mother can live. Lily opens her eyes to see Harry rebound the curse and life goes on with Lily raising Harry.

Do what you will with the rest as long as Lily doesn't remarry. James did sacrifice himself to buy his family time to get away after all.

Harry survives the SECOND killing curse because of the accidental horcrux... but that's not how he survived as a baby; it was Lily's Sacrifice that protected him then. So, if you have Voldemort accidentally kill Lily's unborn 2nd child instead of Lily herself, you just negated her Sacrifice. So how does Harry survive?

Or are you suggesting that Magic gives Lily the win (even though she did actually die) because "its all 'bout INTENT, yo"... so Harry still gets his Love Shield ^{tm} ?

I've seen quite a few fics which invent different reasons for Harry's survival when he was a baby beyond JKR's 'power of love' explanation. Fanfic authors could be similarly creative to keep both Lily and Harry alive when fulfilling this prompt.

**** Easy solution in this case: It's the /intent/ of self-sacrifice that triggers the power-of-love effect. Lily still fully intended to die before allowing Harry to come to harm, and as far as she was aware those were the stakes at play.

***** This fits the bill for both surviving with the entire magic is all about intent thing, let's go with this.

*** Ever since reading Dresden files my headcanon has been that there's power in death and lily used her death to power the spell that let Harry survive. So if we went with that then maybe the unborn child's death could have powered it.

** Just to clarify, you mean that Lily survives, but Voldemort still accidentally makes Harry a Horcrux?

*** I think they're just using the horcrux as a precedent for AK only killing /one/ of the souls in a particular body as opposed to both.

1) Unborn babies aren't sentient enough to make any kind of decisions, let alone decide to sacrifice themselves for whatever cause. 2) Even if we ignore N1, the spell would've hit her first, killed her, and then likely resulted in the baby dying as well due to being underdeveloped and stuck in a corpse.

Also, there's nothing in canon about Lily sacrificing her soul, only her life.

*** Not in the sense that the child chooses to sacrifice itself but more that the child's soul is taken instead of Lily's. Exactly the same way that the Horcrux is taken because Voldemort isn't going to sacrifice himself for Harry and the curse hits Harry's skin so it does actually fit.
