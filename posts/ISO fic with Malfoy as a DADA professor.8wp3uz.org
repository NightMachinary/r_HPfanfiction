You heard it here folks, I'm looking for a fic that has Draco Malfoy becoming the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor after the war. I've read a handful of fics with him as the Potions professor, but it seems he might fit as a DADA professor much in the same way Snape did, with such a long and personal history with Dark Magic. I'm also not opposed to Dramione fics, so if those two things happen to overlap...


** I think in Rebuilding he eventually becomes DADA professor, originally starts out as 8th year fic but progresses linkffn(11439594)

  Hermione Granger returns to Hogwarts to help rebuild the shattered castle the summer after the war. She and the other summer resident - and eventually their friends - have to come to terms with how the war broke more than just the walls of the building. Follows multiple Hogwarts students through '8th year' and one additional year of early adulthood. COMPLETE.

*** Thank you for the suggestion! I have avoided Rebuilding, as I prefer chapters 1-3k words in length. I am about 15 chapters in now, and realize what a stupid preference that was. Again, thank you!
