Hi everyone. As much I love Snape, most fanfiction about him makes me very sad. It's not surprising since he is a depressing character, but can anyone recommend stories where Snape learns to deal with the demons in his past to actually meet his potential and be happy?

There was so much potential for him to be great. This was the guy who created spells and corrected textbooks as a kid. So bonus points for fanfiction where things turn out differently from canon, like being sorted in a different house, the teachers actually noticing the Marauders bullying and putting a stop to it, having more friends that allows him to not be as attached to Lily, leaving Hogwarts because he's finally had enough of all the politics, not joining the deatheaters, a teacher noticing his skills early on, going abroad, fighting Voldemort without being a member of the OOTP, writing his own potions textbooks and tons of other scenarios I'd love to read.

Thanks :)

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. Rating & Genres may change later.

** linkffn(Resonance by Greengecko)

This is a Snape adopts 17 year old Harry fic, post-OttP but later incorporating quite a bit of the HBP & DH stuff.

I'm going to spoil a little bit here, just to titilate you.

[[/spoiler][So in this AU, Dumbledore basically has no clue about Horcruxes. But he is still suspicious about something being off with Harry. So he subtly arranges this adoption for the dual purpose of Harry finally getitng someone he can rely on, but at the same time someone who can keep an eye of things and is experienced at managing a powerful wizard (which Harry is quickly becoming in this AU). And you get these wonderful moments, of where everyone is (legitimately) scared shitless of what Harry is capable of (which in turn makes Harry want to shoot himself), that Snape handles breaking little sweat. It's a very entertaining extrapolation to the question, what does serving a powerful dark wizard give you skills for - apparently, how to handle an adolescent wizard whose power is growing by leaps and bounds.]]

[[/spoiler][So there is this interesting dynamic, of Harry and Snape both growing in interesting, believeable ways - Snape, being free of Voldemort can actually act like he's not a piece of shit, while Harry proceeds to auror training, showcasing his developing ability to be a part of power structure. Plus Snape gets a girlfriend and tries to atone for all past shit he got into.]]

A retelling set in the world where Lily Evans made different choices as a young girl - a world in which she did not give birth to Harry Potter, and James Potter died for a different son, but their children, raised in the shadows of their parents' choices, must nonetheless find the path that would one day lead them to protect everything they hold dear from the greatest menace Wizarding Britain had ever seen

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) Not sure if this fits, but it's a major AU where Voldemort won the first war (although he is more sane and reasonable than in canon so his made society is not bad, just a bit morally questionable at times) Snape is still not very nice, but he wasn't responsible for Lily's death so he is more well adjusted. He has a lot less hate than in canon and actually pursues his own goals. He also dates a few times and gets together with someone else which makes sense for his character in context.

linkffn(Come Once Again and Love Me) Time travel story where both Snape and Lily end up time traveling from the time they died to their Hogwarts years.

linkffn(Callidus Prince and the Unseen Adversary) Snape gets slipped a potion that turns him 11 again permanently right before Harry's first year. Without prejudices, Harry and deaged Severus become friends. Although it starts in the first year, has an original story line and not a Canon rehash.

*** Well in case the Prince of the Dark Kingdom is recommended, I would also recommend the Pureblood Pretense and its sequels - it fits the request the same way the PotDK does. Snape is not the main character there, but he plays an important role. He is highly respected, confident and essentially good character. It is major AU as well. linkffn(7613196)

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) /may/ fit your request.

Snape isn't the focus, but he's definitely a main character who is much more well adjusted and (imo) a better person. He takes Harry under his wing, partially because he sees himself in Harry (young halfblood in Slytherin who grew up in an abusive household) and because he dislikes James (James is trying to disinherit Harry in this fic for spoiler reasons).

It's overall a great fic but if Snape not being the main protagonist isn't up your alley that's totally fine.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
