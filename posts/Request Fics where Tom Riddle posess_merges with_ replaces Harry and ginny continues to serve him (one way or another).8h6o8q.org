*** I agree. I like teh idea of harry being mostly subsumed, but with just a little influence in the end product RiddleHarry to prevetn the story from becoming too 'edgy' and to keep the protagonist sane. I also quite like th idea of Ginny being used and abused, but gradually becoming valued and then either becoming a willing servant/companion or betraying the MC at a crucial/important point.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
