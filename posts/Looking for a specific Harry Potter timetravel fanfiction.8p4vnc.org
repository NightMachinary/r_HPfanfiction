In the fanfic Harry goes back in time, and for the life of me I can't remember anything else but the fact that he bought his own appartment/room in Diagon Alley (I think it was on top of the Leaky Cauldron but not sure) and, as it was a harry x hermione fic, Hermione's parents came to visit.

Any help would be appreciated.


** Not sure if this is the one you're looking for, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Quantum Leap) by Seel'vor has all of that. Hasn't been updated in tragically long, though, and it might have been abandoned.

  Harry Potter won the Second Blood War and defeated his enemies... and was left with nothing. Decades later, he contributes to the creation of a revolutionary new piece of technology and destroys the future in order to rewrite his own past...
