** There's the one that has Jon Snow reborn with Harry in the HPverse. It's a fix it type story too. They apprentice to Olivander and eventually form their own guild to kill creatures for wand parts.

  Harry goes willingly to face Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. When Death shows Harry the eventual failure of his quest, Harry discovers that Voldemort has twisted much more than his own soul with the Horcruxes. At the same time as Harry's decision to re-enter the Living, Time and Magic throw another resurrected hero in the mix, the slain Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
