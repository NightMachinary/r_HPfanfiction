Just had a thought and not sure if I'm going to write it yet, so I figured I'd share.

The Dursleys are always mad about Harry and his freakish magic, but they considered this crossing the line! And they couldn't even find the boy to punish him! Yes, he was in his cupboard under the stairs, sure, but now it was huge under there. Was that a library? How in the bloody hell did he get a /greenhouse/ under their freaking stairs? With actual living, and thriving, plants?

Harry creating wizards space as a defense mechanism before he even went to Hogwarts.


** This reminds me of a story I read where Harry managed to fit a swimming pool into his cupboard but the Dursley parents don't know it. Dudley does but he doesn't tell his mum and dad so that he can swim in it. linkffn(Dudley Dursley's Sassy Gay Friend by Sideshow Starlet)

I know I'm not answering your prompt right now but I'll try to write something later.

#+begin_quote
  Young Harry is flamboyantly gay and forms a connection with his cousin. The result? Dudley loses a punching bag but gains a sassy gay friend! Based on the Sassy Gay Friend videos made by Second City Network. Now with more drabbles!
