Preferably time travel but anything works.


** Well, you probably already read it but the ones that come to mind right now are The Wastelands of Time linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]]) and its sequel Heartlands of Time linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/6325846/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Heartlands-of-Time]]) that is not finished yet and Nightmares of Future Past linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past]]) that is unfinished too.

  Sequel to Wastelands! Time has all but run out for Harry Potter. There are no more second chances. No more desperate bids for salvaged redemption. The game has changed, and in the end Harry will learn that the cost of his defiance has never run so high.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

I also like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7060807/1/Death-Shall-Have-No-Dominion][Death Shall Have No Dominion]]. Time travel aspect becomes important later in the story though. Sadly abandoned. linkffn(7060807)

Other works I liked the first time I read, but not so much down the line:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6337450/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Turning-of-the-Sun][Harry Potter and the Turning of the Sun]]: Not a fan of the last few chapters, but I really enjoyed it. linkffn(6337450)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550820/1/Strange-Visitors-From-Another-Century][Strange Visitors From Another Century]]: I like it in general, but not Harry's characterization or [[/spoiler][Salazar's decision to travel into the future with the trio]]. Still, it's a cool time travel story. linkffn(8550820)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6671596/1/A-Necessary-Gift-A-Harry-Potter-Story][A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story]]: I thought it was good, and really liked Harry's new ability. But I am so over with prueblood-society-is-misunderstood-by-muggleborns storyline. I honestly can't read it anymore, but you might like it.

I was looking at my favorite stories list, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] just caught my eye.

Also technically, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force][The Havoc side of the Force]] is a time travel story as well.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

  Harry defeated Voldemort with the power he knew not, a power far more valuable than his freedom. Sealed away until next he was needed, the Wizarding Saviour slept through the fall of his race, of magic and almost the world. Now he has been woken, the last avatar of a dead species and a being whose purpose is so old that only the bones of the Earth remember. Gen. Adult themes.
