I'm on chap 21, and I know this sub really isn't into HermionexAnyone, but I got the rec from a Dramione tik tok account. Anyways... did it bother anyone else that Hermione is a 19 year old in an 11 year old's body?! I'm still reading obsessively, but paired with the straight retelling of some parts of DH and the fact that Hermione feels her heart pang at a child Sirius... maybe I'm reading ill intent into it, but dang it rubs me the wrong way. Has anyone felt similar while reading it? Is it anyone's holy grail?


** The problem of all time travels. I have a 23 yr old Ron traveling to first year and I am still figuring out how to approach it.

I mean, what if Hermione is interested in Ron? How should he react? She would be a teenager and Ron would mentally be in his mid twenties. Even when Hermione reaches 17 it is going to be odd since Ron would be mentally thirty or something.

*** Linkffn(Returning To the Start) solves the problem admirably In my opinion.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

**** If you mean the physical brain of a 17 year old, sure. You'd have the still developing frontal lobe, the overactive amygdala, all the hormones. This is all true.

But you would also have the 30 years of experience. You would have the context and experience that could and will overrule the instincts of your body. This means that while, for example, your overactive amygdala has prepped your body to rage and run your mouth, your 30 years of experience would tell you that anger is the wrong response here. Your decisions will be informed more by your past experiences as opposed to your brain structure.

This goes double for things like sex and relationships. Your physically younger mind does not erase all your experience. Nor does it change the fact that your much younger partner will be much less experienced than you are in terms of both sex and relationships. You being physically 17 does not change the power imbalance between the two of you. You would still have the experiences of a 30 year old man, and more importantly, you would still /think of yourself/ as a 30 year old man.

The attraction by itself is already really gross in these circumstances.

***** Totally my point.

I see Ron, in this case, agreeing to go with her on Hogsmeade or even date-like parties if he feels he has no other option (like being discovered or something worse)... but I totally see him stopping this from getting further. Even if Hermione is all but begging him for a kiss.

In all senses, he should wait for a good time, even after 17 and she has discovered his true origin. Or maybe I should just send Ron back to his original timeline, though curiously Ron would still have 7 more years of life at this point (if he relived his 7 years at Hogwarts before returning to his timeline... so similar situation to staying).

The interesting thing in a situation like this is... what happens if Hermione wants him to go with her to the Yule Ball, then Ron refuses not because he is prat again but because of this age imbalance? Then Hermione gives up on him and decides to start dating someone else? Now Ron's reaction there would be interesting.

** Six Pomegranate Seeds by Seselt deals with this age issue pretty nicely. Its also a time travel fic with Hermione, but quite different and very well written/thought out, one of my favorites. A lot less heavy on the romance than Debt of Time though.
