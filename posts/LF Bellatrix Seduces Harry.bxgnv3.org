Title says Anything, but since she killed Sirius and so sparks his Rage against her, i would like this Fact to be erased. What i had in mind is that Harry never meet Bella before and when they meet (however this might be) she would catch his Eye. It would be good, but not necessary if she still has or has regained her Beauty, that she was once had.

Either Voldemort orders her to get the Boys affection or she is a dubios Person. I think it would be interesting, if she would totally act different on her Persona (she was mad at Harry for him calling Voldemort and insulting him half-blood), but in real despises him. However, i will leave it open for the Author, how this would be handled.

The Stuff with Voldemort or the War doesnt have to occur at all or in Canon.

Also it doesnt matter if it just stays on the tempting part or it gets further.


** Linkffn(Wind Shear) somewhat matches.

Harry accidentally time travels back and meets a younger Bellatrix who didn't kill Sirius yet, he makes an impression and she tries to seduce him for the rest of the story. He's a bit busy dealing with Voldie though, and while he knows that she's not the Bellatrix he remembers he's still reluctant about her.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** The first half of linkffn(Delenda Est) is worth reading. Sadly the second half doesn't measure up. But it's complete, which is nice.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
