Can be time travel.

There are tons of PoD / Time Travel / AU fics that follow Snape as he goes through school. He almost always ends up paired with Lily, at which point I have to drop the fic, since it's usually one of the sappier ships in the fandom.


** Most of these are First War fics after graduation but see if you like them.

linkao3(Into the Fold by pasi) I cannot recommend this enough. It follows Snape from 5th year and beyond to his Death Eater and spying days. It explores fascinating parts of Snape, how he invented Sectumsempra and other spells, how he learnt to cast a patronus, how and why he joined Voldemort, his state of mind regarding his half-blood heritage etc. It's one of the best character studies I've seen.

linkffn(Under Pressure by tofsla) Very good first-war Snape character study.

linkffn(Looking for Lily by Northumbrian) Again, decent first-war Snape character study.

linkao3(Romance of the Age by nimmieamee) Brilliant satire of the the entire Marauders generation.

linkao3(St. Mungo's Grim Reaper by emptyword) Haunting portrait of Snape's moral corruptness in the first war, while still being sympathetic.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. COMPLETE.
