Full Prompt :

Molly Weasley greatly desires to have Harry as a son-in-law for her Ginny. So, she decides to dose them both with a light Love Potion to nudge them into the right direction, since Harry can be a little dense with girls. Little did she know Harry and Ginny were already in a relationship, perhaps even in love, but were merely keeping it secret as neither had the desire to be in the Daily Prophet.

Bonus points if all the Love Potion does is make sure the relationship moves into territory Molly considers inappropriate for unmarried people, leads to some rather public displays of affection in the Burrow, or similar.

If more information is wanted, will provide in an edit.


** Instead of Molly, what about it being their crotchety old aunt, Muriel? I could see the lady with the goblin-wrought wedding silver being social ladder climbing- and crazy- enough to try; and what little we see of her makes it seem like she'd be a Scooby-Doo-type villain if she ever went down that road.

I know canon Molly is overbearing at times and can, when harried forget bits of info about her seven (7!) children, but she's never shown any propensity towards being that kind of moustache-twirling villain.

*** You're describing this as a "Scooby Doo villian" and "moustache-twirling villian," but 1) this isn't even being described as her being an antagonist, just trying to use a love potion to start something that's already going. A light dose, which presumably would just be to start the relationship then she'd stop. Which, while I would definitely see as morally wrong, wouldn't cause her to be a villian in the story since they're already in a relationship and she's not trying to constantly drug them or ruin another relationship. 2) In canon (I believe PoA) she tells Hermione and Ginny about her using a love potion on someone in her youth. So use of love potions is actually a canon depiction of Molly, not some fanon "Scooby Doo Villian" version of her.

**** I mean in the sense of the trope. I've read (the first few chapters of) plenty of "scheming Weasleys" fics and there's really no other way to describe Molly in those other than a moustache-twirling villain. Her characterization in those so exaggeratedly, scheming-ly evil that she's essentially one of those baddies from old silent movies that tied damsels to train tracks and wore black frock coats and tophats and laughed while the train approached.

I was more describing Aunt Muriel in this situation as the Scooby Doo villain. In the scenario I'm picturing, she has a strange, self-centered motive and if everything had worked out, she could have been dangerous, but she ultimately ended up being impotent because she would have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for those horny kids!

I do remember the love potion comments in one of the books, (although I thought it was later like maybe OotP since the girls were older and the conversation a little more appropriate for 14 and 15 year olds than 12 and 13). I know that the twins sold them, too, but Rowling frames them as sort-of-funny joke objects until they become issues. However, I was responding to the prompt which was talking about the trope which treats coersive and drugged rape and/or relationships as a plot device.

Hermione does say they're not dangerous, and she's a muggle-born.

Also, learning about love potions /is/ part of the curriculum. Or, at least, the most powerful love potion in the world is. Either way, making one does not mean using one. And using one does not necessarily mean raping someone.

A lot of shit is banned at Hogwarts. That doesn't mean society as a whole is against it. They can be sold openly in stores.

I never said it wasn't. I said /making/ them wasn't taught. But I can definitely see how you got that from what I said and I should have phrased that better.

You're right, you're only mind controlling someone and forcing them to have an obsessive affection towards someone else against their will. It's not like the main purpose of a love potion is to make someone get into a relationship with you, and it's not like relationships involve sex. It's not like the one time we actually see love potions being used successfully in canon the victim was forced to have sex with the witch, and when he was finally taken off his daily dose he was absolutely disgusted about what he was forced to do. Oh wait...

Honestly that excuse is basically saying "just because I used a date rape drug on someone doesn't mean I was actually going to rape them. It was just a prank!"

******** Lol. There are different kinds of love potions. What happened to Tom Riddle Senior is not reflective of what would happen with Fred and George's potions.

As I already said, it's plausible that they /just/ make you obsessive, and that the victim will refuse to do anything sexual with you. There is more to "love" than just sex.

Seriously, what's more of a stretch? My argument, or "the entire wizarding world is okay with rape, including the Muggle-borns, including Hermione."
