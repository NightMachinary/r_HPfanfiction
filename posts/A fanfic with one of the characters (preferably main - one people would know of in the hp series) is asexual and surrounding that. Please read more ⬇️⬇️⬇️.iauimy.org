** I feel like this rings a bell but I can't place the exact fic this originated in...

Anyway I searched it on AO3 and brought up [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=kudos_count&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Asexual+Charlie+Weasley&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling][these results - good luck!]]

I'm also going to recommend the podcast The Gayly Prophet that talks about a lot of things of this nature in case you're interested!
