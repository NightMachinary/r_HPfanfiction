John* walked hastily along the pavement. He was late to work, and thought about how he shouldn't have stayed up late rereading Harry Potter for the N-th time. As he hurried towards the tube, a tingling sensation developed through his body. He thought it was his muscles getting tired from the high pace, but then realized the tingling was /everywhere./ And it increased in intensity. It soon became so painful he couldn't really walk. He was cold sweating, and begun heaving until he was engulfed in this intense hot feeling of nothingness. He opened his eyes to see what he would describe as the Doctor Who Time-Vortex. With his entire body feeling like it was on fire, he tried as hard as he could to gain control of where he were going, to no effect.

After drifting for a while, trying to manage the agonizing pain, he soon saw essentially the end of the Vortex. He soon hit it, and felt flames shoot up all around him. If the pain earlier would be equivalent to a splinter, this pain would be closer to being skinned alive and having vinegar poured over the exposed tissue. As soon as the flames appeared, they disappeared. Blinking a few times, he decided he was hallucinating. He were at Hogwarts. More specifically, the great hall, during the goblet of fire champion selection.

*OC up for interpretation, can be whomsteverthefuck the author wishes it to be


** If his name is John, then let his surname be Wick.
