  AU: JKR portrays Harry as completely unaffected by the Killing Curse cast at him. But how would things have gone if it had been different?

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

  Vernon dies in a car crash when Harry's two years old. Without his influence, Harry's life is quite different - especially as Petunia decides to follow the advice her father gave her long ago. This is not what Albus Dumbledore had in mind when he placed Harry Potter with his Aunt!

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/228179][Souvenirs and Lost Luggage]] by tarteaucitron (includes background Dudley/Piers, nothing explicit)

There's also a short Snape/Petunia fic, written before the end of canon and therefore not including their prior acquaintance. It's locked to AO3, though, so you need to have an account.
