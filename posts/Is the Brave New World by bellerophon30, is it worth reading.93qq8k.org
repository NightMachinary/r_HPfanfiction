** Kind of, yeah, but you can skip over a lot of stuff that happens in the new school because, in the overall arc of the story, it doesn't matter.

Also, it helps to pretend that many of the teachers at the new school aren't named after /The West Wing/ characters.

** Depends on if you have a high tolerance for bullshit. Like, this story was amongst the first I read when I started reading fanfiction, and I hadn't yet developed a filter. All that mattered was devouring words, and this fit the bill. If I had found the story months later, I probably wouldn't have been able to make it through the first few chapters.

** Yes. It's garbage, but the school is in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan][the Fatherland]], which makes it all worth it.

** I enjoyed it. It's not a masterpiece but Ive re-read it a few times. Just know that Harry and his two English friends can do no wrong

** Here's the only place I can still find it online. It was one of my early favorites. Certainly not the best story, but it's a guilty pleasure and I've reread it a few times.

** I loved it, all except for the epilogue... it was heartbreaking.

** I enjoyed it a lot when I first really got into HP fanfics. It was one of the first break away from Dumbledore fanfics I'd read, it was complete and it's writing was pretty decent. I've read better since then, but I always make sure my pdf copy of it is safe because I know I'll want to reread it again one day.
