Having read and enjoyed [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14040780][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11500936/1/Long-Live-The-Queen][Long Live The Queen]], I was wondering if there were any other good fics where the British government (or some elements of it, at least) finds out about Voldermort and the state of the Ministry of Magic, and steps in and resolves things their way?


** There is MI5 involvement in linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/]])

Eta (because I just reread your post) it's not quite what you're asking for, I'll warn you. It did add an interesting element to it though

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
