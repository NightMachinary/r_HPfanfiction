The fanfic was about Harry staying in Azkaban for some years, released, and killing Voldermort. He had a castle, and a scene I vividly remember: he stood on a chair in front of the chimney, thinking about his life. How he, in his twenties had nothing while others have jobs and kids, while swirling the wine in his glass.


** Sounds angsty. Unfortunately I have read a lot of Azkaban!Harry fics and most of them I'd rather forget so I can't help you here.
