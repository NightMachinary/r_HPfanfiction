So I wanted to ask what the people here think are the Universes best suited for HP-crossovers. I think generally marvel and DC works well, because wizards would be just another weird random thing that happens there, alone the thought of a ministry trying to protect the statute, even though people like Dr. Strange or Zatannah are walking around, is hilarious, or Superman having to deal with a whole population of people that can pose a sizable threat to him and other Kryptonians, then disgruntled Squibs and muggleborn joining SHIELD or Waller trying to "recruit" Voldemort for her Suicide Squad or sending it after him, the stories write themselves. The Nasuverse would also be interesting, but mostly because I spent way to much time thinking about how the different magical systems could work in one universe and why magi and wizards wouldn´t interact much.


** I always thought His Dark Materials would make a great crossover. I have a story idea...I've just never gotten around to writing it. It feels a little odd to me, because I'm an EXPERT at Harry Potter trivia, but only a modest fan of HDM.

** I've always enjoyed a well-written Percy Jackson crossover, like the ones by Engineer4Ever. The wizarding world was seen as a crossroads for the different pantheons (bc Hecate is magic & crossroads). Wards and magic are a good deterrent for why monsters don't necessarily hunt wizards all the time. The whole physical fighting vs magic on monsters is an author by author facet.

Even though PJO is the fandom with the most crossover fics, it's rarely done well. It's more along the lines of "OMG! you're a demigod, like camp and like monsters and like magic is stuuupid, but you get twin swords with japanese names and a super cool fighting style"

*** Yep, there are crossover fics, but they're mostly Harry discovering that he's also a demigod, instead of say, Camp Half-Blood/Jupiter discovering Hogwarts and vice versa, sort of like what happened with the Greek and Roman demigods, in Heroes of Olympus. One of the better HP/PJO crossovers I've found is linkffn(When Wand and Sword Collide), and even then, it takes forever for Harry and Percy to discover stuff that we already know.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter wakes at Camp Half-Blood. Percy Jackson wakes at Hogwarts. Neither know who they are, where they are, or where they come from - but when dreams are invaded, prophecies are conjured and revelations arise, they discover the line between demigod and wizard is blurring. Something dark is coming, and Percy and Harry must unite with their new peers before it's too late. AT.

** Stargate. They had Merlin and Morgana as a members of advanced alien race (Alterrans or The Ancients) that looked exactly like humans of today, kickstarted human evolution in their own image, intermarried with humans thousands of years ago and were advanced enough evolutionary to have what looks like magic powers. Wizarding people could just be the result of that intermarriage. Nothing in either Stargate or Harry Potter contradicts the connection.

*** I never liked mixing the worlds.

If I were going to do a Stargate / Harry Potter universe crossover I would make the Quantum Mirror and the Veil become stuck attuned to one another creating a permanent link between two different Earths.

Thought of a neat storyline. Muggles on the other side of the veil are exempt from the statute of secrecy because of technical wording in the statute. Muggleborns often leave for the SG universe since the lack of statute allows for mixed communities to form. Purebloods see this as a good thing because it's like a trash can that trash throws itself into and the pure families let it continue.

** Here's an old school one: Chronicles of Amber. Voldemort is a scion of the Courts of Chaos (they've got the whole snake thing going). Deep inside the Chamber of Secrets is a Broken Pattern of the Logrus. Horcruxes didn't even exist until he willed the existence of the dark magic into being... just another example of his ability to manipulate shadow. Lily was Blood of Amber, only half sister to Petunia. Lily's dying curse was what began to unravel Voldemort, and everyone knows the Curse of the Blood of Amber is a potent thing. Harry goes back to the Chamber in year 5 or 6, and staggers through the Pattern, driving out the horcrux from his scar. Fiona (a redhead, much like Lily mind you) visits Harry and teaches him what it means to be of Amber, including how to hang a lynchpin and other true magics. United the Hallows are a lost spikard, and together they can help Harry fulfill the prophecy. The courts may well have another agent at Hogwarts, which is probably a great place for the two warring families to stash scions and teach them magic.

*** Oh hell yes. I love that universe. I feel that the stories get more army/conquest/broad scale based than the personal level story arcs that HP tends towards, and that should be incorporated into any crossovers with Amber. The reason the first five Amber books are so engaging to me is that all of the members of the royal family have the potential to be Hannibal Barca with a theoretically infinite army at their beck and call, and the give and take there of who has what in a larger universal war of attrition is a main driving force of conflict in those stories.

TLDR; I think Amberite stories are bigger. Much bigger. The beauty of that universe its ability to scale the interpersonal conflict into realm-spanning wars.

Edit: im sorry for the word explosion, i have strong feelings on the topic xD

**** Oh, that's a good point! Micro vs macro. Hmm. Maybe Voldemort gets his own army of inferi. Obviously Harry already has that leadership/charisma thing that Amberites tend to have in spades (see the DA). If you want to get into the second cycle stuff, maybe the Pattern under hogwarts is a shadow of the Ghostwheel, and he who controls that Pattern can influence the Balance. So basically similar to the final DH battle, but with different stakes.

***** Also consider playing with the unintended consequence aspect of Amber. The people in that universe with perfect information are really really rare (unicorn/serpent maybe?) and generally forces of nature more than characters. Maybe someone is trial running the inferi army plan on this shadow where magic exists, pulling strings from behind the scenes, unaware of the pattern/ghostwheel/logrus angle that exists here. Voldemort sees the power he could gain in the chamber, but is missing a bigger picture where the balance of the courts vs amber war is hanging in the balance and he's just a pawn. As things escalate, the higher powers get more involved, and things spiral out of control, with the Ministry, the ICW, a vampire run mafia, Grindlewald broken out of prison, etc, gaining power in the chaos and adding even more sides to a war. Everyone misreading what these new sides are capable of, both above and below their actual capabilites. Bonus points for Benedict stepping in with an army of his own for the first time and curbstomping everyone.

If it can kill a giant, it means that a HP mage can easily kill all the big critters, their size in this case would be liability. Though considering that Voldemort used giants in his conquest and at least some of the light side probably didn´t shy away from using the killing curse, it can be assumed that the spell has limits. Though there is no confirmation that people of the light used the curse in the second war, and I don´t know if Voldemort used Giants in the first war.

If the killing curse doesn't kill it, the damage from the scales being blasted into its body likely will. The curse blows up stone easily.

I doubt it would kill something like a Balrog, but I don't see why it wouldn't kill Saruman or Smaug.

Still, Moody (or Crouch Jr really) says the strength of the wizard decides how strong the killing curse is. He was sure if the kids in his class fired it at him, he wouldn't even get a nosebleed.

Well, I'd agree with Smaug. He is basically a lesser dragon, a mere shade of the terror of something like Glaurung or Ancalagon the Black.

But Saruman is an Istari, one of the Maia sent to Middle Earth. This means that he and the Balrog are kinda of the same nature (Balrogs also being Maia). Of course, the form they wear is different, but crazy shit could happen.

Creations of Morgoth like Orcs and Trolls? Incarnated Maia like the Balrogs? All these theories and more have their supporters, and depending on which is right, the Killing Curse may or may not work on Smaug.

As for the Maia... if I had to guess, I'd say a Killing Curse would kill their current body and force them to reincarnate, Gandalf-the-White style. (It suddenly occurs to me that because of this and a few other things, Voldemort could possibly fool some into thinking he's also an Istari.)

** Science Fiction (for a given value of Science Fiction purists I'm trying here) works really well. /Star Wars/, /Empire and Foundation/, and /Mass Effect/ have already been mentioned but /Star Trek/ works well as does /Babylon 5/, /Stargate/, /Firefly/Serenity/ and other softer scifi crossovers (/Night's Dawn/ anyone?)

There are also works that take an element of a given fictional universe without really being crossovers, say "the will and the word" from the /Belgariad/ (a bad example because it leaves whichever character in the HP universe uses it ridiculously OP), or elements of folklore like from the /Mabinogian/, the /Edda's/ or very rarely from tradition's outside of Europe. But of course they're never acknowledged as crossovers because how can they be.

The last ones I'll mention are I've read crossovers with /Criminal Minds/ that are pretty fantastic. As well as a pretty amazing one-off crossover with /Beauty and the Beast/ (the TV series from the 80s) which I think goes to show you can cross HP over with just about anything if you put the work in.

This is one that I think would have potential, if the plot were done correctly. Maybe a 5th year or so Harry ends up in the world of Belgarion? But the HP character shouldn't end up a sorcerer. I think the HP-wizardry would be enough (I doubt it would make the same noise as the Will and the Word).

** Nasuverse- magical system blending, universe hopping, mostly combat oriented fics, and the chance for some amazing philosophy battles between top tier characters.

Really anything shonen can work either through alternate histories or universe hopping, and the simplicity of the basic plot and characters usually works fairly well for a fanfic.

Anything really with a slice of life normal life tone could probably fit, it would just be part of the muggle world, glee, criminal minds, ncis, sword art online (though i am not a fan it is an easy crossover).

Slice of life "muggle" fantasy shows, charmed, buffy the vamp slayer.

Most comics seem to fit especially marvel, but those that dont usually work fairly well with single characters going to the other universe through magic bullshittery.

Really i think most can work alright so long as there is some care put to it.

*** I'm not trying to shoot you down to be a dick, but I gotta disagree here. Rowling is like the talented, underachiever C-student of worldbuilding, while Nasu is basically the worldbuilding mad god. For the uneducated about Nasuverse, I'll explain, largely because I think the Nasuverse should be an inspiration to anyone trying to have a magical system without destroying the absurdity or mystery of it all.

Even though we can't be /sure,/ HP vampires are probably just regular old vampires. Don't like garlic, die from wooden stakes, drink blood, maybe can't enter buildings without permission. This is a pretty standard pattern for mythological beings in HP. They follow the classics pretty closely and make few modifications.

Nasuverse vampires...for starters, there is no "vampire," that's more of a catch-all term for any blood-sucking being. For the two most important, proper vampiric beings, there are True Ancestors and Dead Apostles. Let's just go over the True Ancestors.

In the far past, the will of the living Earth (Gaia) suffered due to human activity, and cried out to the heavens for help.

Time to stop, we need to explain something already. Within the Nasuverse, there is a concept known as a Counter Force. In its most simple terms, living beings or large systems (such as a planet) have collective wills. This is called a Counter Force. There are two Counter Forces, at least that we care about, Gaia and Alaya. Gaia is the living Earth and all its beings. Alaya is the collective will of humanity to survive and prosper. At one time, Gaia and Alaya were in harmony, but they've long since split and are now opposing forces.

The will of the Crimson Moon (literally our moon, the moon and the planets also have their own will), answered Gaia's call. It, or rather, he, made a pact with Gaia, creating the True Ancestors. True Ancestors were a sort of parallel Counter Force to Gaia, opposing Alaya. They took human form, but were essentially copies of the Crimson Moon, containing all his bloodlust, which is why they drink blood. As incarnations of a celestial body, they possess a greater capacity for changing the world than most "gods" (properly Divine Spirits), and all have the ability to superimpose their desires onto the World (a specific term, in this case meaning reality excluding living beings with a will like humans).

So, to summarize one type of vampire, they are the living incarnations of the will of the moon created to save the living Earth from humans, and also functionally demigods with a limited reality-bending power.

Also, I'm just scratching the surface now. All this takes place within a subset of rules which are described as being the surface of a pond. Nasu isn't just three levels deeper in detail than Rowling, but he's also about three levels deeper into insanity. You can't go a few sentences into explaining something from the Nasuverse without needing to pull out a special Nasuverse dictionary, and most of what's in there dances around the definition because the concept is so utterly alien and irrational that you can't just explain it in one or two sentences. It's a pretty far cry from "the wand chooses the wizard, now fuck off with this plot point for 6 books it's a magic stick."

**** That massive difference is one of the things i love about HP/Nasuverse crossovers.

Its a kind of dichotomy, a simple system based around will which is hard to quantify, and a more nitty gritty insular magical style where each family or person has their own specific style which they know everything about both spiritually and scientifically.

This is one reason why i bring up zelretch and blending universes in their crossovers. Seeing each side meet and interact with a totally alien set of rules in a single setting is amazing to me.

Nasu has a astoundingly detailed world and tbh is the reason i actually like quantified magic and dont mind it in HP fanfics. Rowling used plenty of classic fantasy tropes and let us fill in the rest ourselves, where Nasu twisted and innovated classic tropes until they were almost unrecognizable.

My taste in HP fanfics are commonly those where the HP universe (the setting, basic plot structure, characters, and ecology) is a shell which you can then modify and deepen for the purposes of your story, which for me means Nasuverse is a great crossover fit.

** Dr. Strange would know about wizards. It's his job to protect the world from magical and mystical threats as Sorcerer Supreme. So the Ministry is below Dr. Strange in the chain. However since Wizards don't have one governing body and are separated by country they would handle their own problems since the problems aren't big enough to threaten the world and are local problems. Also, in a crossover with Marvel, DC, and TYPE-MOON it would have to be limited due to how huge they are. Anyway in regards to crossovers a few I can think up are

The other issue would be the physical issues. An Elf (or full Rider) is capable of movements faster than sight, is said to have stamina "beyond that of any human."

There are interesting things coming from this however. It is stated in the Eragonverse that the reason for the physical capabilities of magical beings was that their bodies are saturated with magic. It would be dope to see that principle in work in Harry Potter.

A minor issue would be the magical system. Eragon's is based upon language, and understanding of oneself. Harry Potter's is based upon intent and knowledge. mingling them both would be beast.

** "The Worst Witch" fits in pretty painlessly. Cackle's Academy could simply be another magic school, smaller than Hogwarts and only accepting witches -- and the lack of wands at Cackle's could easily be explained away with "they do it differently there." (After all, according to Pottermore, wands are primarily a European thing, so perhaps Cackle's just follows a tradition from Africa or something,)

I used to think that "Sandman" could be crossed over with anything, but the entire "Master of Death" thing pretty much ruined that, because now all the Sandman crossovers I see has Harry's status as "Master of Death" be a hugely big deal and he commands or fucks Death, and I'm just like nooooooooo...!

*** While I love Mass Effect and live in hope of a good cross over I'm not sure they work too well for making a great story. Game based stories tend to work best as aftermath stories else its just a written record of what happened. In that case it focuses on relationships and the effects of choices made. Mass Effect works well for that as your choices are important but it begs the question where does Harry fit in? Does Harry get relegated to being a normal crew member on the Normandy, take Mass effect 2, what alternatives does Harry provide? It feels hard to create an original and engaging story. I love both Franchises but both ate quite set in their ways and I don't think that makes for great crossovers.

A. Harry takes Shep's place as commander and magic begins to fuck with the story a bit,

or C. Harry and possibly a companion (Luna) end up in the ME timeline as a sort of tourist who then ends up interacting with the main plot as a separate but affiliated party.

But you are correct most fics just go through the plot line of ME with different specific character interactions, which personally i love as that is the kind of fic i enjoy. I like rereading through the story just with power, character, or plot point changes.

** The most seamless is really in one of the two big comic universes. Not least because the extremely overpowered HP magic would find worthy opponents in it. Dr.Strange would be one of those very real threats for one. "Normal" heroes and villains would probably have a few problems. There's simply no defense for the Black Widow against a wizard. But as you said, SHIELD (as well as Hydra) would probably recruit a whole bunch of wizards and witches to solve that problem.

In the LOTR universe, wizards could be overpowered. Not because they'd be at the end of the food-chain, so to speak. But because there are /so many/ of them. Harry alone, or just a small bunch of them can be embedded relatively well. But almost-Maia in large numbers would be a problem for even the mightiest of the LOTR universe.

I once read a good sketch for a HP / Metro 2033 crossover. I liked that one a lot, as it described the wizards, other than their muggle counterparts, seek refuge in "immortal cities" - cities that are secured by their inherent magic. Babylon, Atlantis, Rome, Jerusalem. It really got the feel of a Metro novel, with wizards and witches in it. Completely OC with a few hints and winks to canon. I think it was on DLP, but I'm not sure.

Something that I feel only ever fails because it's written by 14 year olds, is a HP / Fairytail crossover. Fairytail magic is absolutely insane. Comparing FT magic to HP magic is like comparing a jackhammer to a precision scalpel. Which is why I think those two could work really well together. It would also be really fun. Imagine the scene with Harry and Lucy staying back, and he's already preparing to cast hours worth of reparo charms, because Natsu once more lacked any sense for collateral damage.

A lot of anime universes in general have great potential. Especially Shonen tend to get overpowered real fast and can therefore balance out HP magic.

I also would like to see a HP / Witcher cross that works HP magic into the lore of The Witcher. There's a bunch of videogame universes that could be fun. The Elder Scrolls, Warcraft, Fallout,...

Dr.Strange is powerful in the movie and if you know the comics, you know how insane his abilities get. SHIELD and the Avengers wields incredible tech with which they best supernatural forces (literally gods :P). The Unforgiveables easily play in one league with the biggest villain's tools.

** Buffy The Vampire Slayer/Angel - a simple separation of Buffy Magic and Potter magic, perhaps pinning the split between the two back during something like Atlantis. Wizards would be a good ally when fighting the dark forces of the Supernatural

Anything DC/Marvel - Wizards make good vigilantes especially since Ministries only know of magic when reported or cast by kids. Plus Shield isn't the only place once can get contracted to, things like Sword (British Shield), Alpha Flight (Canadian Avengers), Star Labs, Justice League Europe etc. One doesn't have to do what the movies want and can have extremely deep stories

Highlander - Immortals are a oddity but the TV Show introduces things like seers and demons groups like the Watchers and Hunters. Adding in straight up magic would explain things and a Immortal Wizard would be cool.

Native rose - could work if you go with the lack of recognition between the two groups, Wizards are already distrustful and bigoted against those who don't have their kind of magic. The Magi can see the Potter magic as little better than crap since it can't do as well as Magecraft and isn't what they see as Magic.

Highschool DxD - better trans dimensionally than same universe but both can work if given a chance and treated like a base of a story rather than a wank fest. Magical Spells of DVD and Potter Magic can be easily separated. People forget that Potter Wizards and low level reality warpers and the only way to stop them is by magical resistance and even then if they can over power it or change the mode of attack that would matter little especially since DxD allows those of Supernatural origin or those with Supernatural items at their disposal exceed even peak human capacity.

To Love-Ru - Magic vs Alien assholes for the fate of the Earth? Yes please.

Twilight - Obvious but deserves to be mentioned as it is a popular crossover.

Yugioh - Magic exist and very few actually use it and those that do most do it thanks to extremely rare magical items. Plus a Wizard running a Spell Counter Deck is too perfect.

The rest required some Universe leaping but can work well if given the right writer

** I've considered the idea of a Fallen London crossover- it would be interesting to see how Wizarding society would react to London (and by extension the Ministry and Diagon Alley) being dragged beneath the Earth by The Masters, and what the resulting new magical societies would ultimately look like 30 or so years later.

** I have to disagree vehemently with the DC and Marvel statement. I really don't think they mix very well because these stories all happen in some kind of alternate universe (Gotham, etc..). The HP series happens in the real world though, Hogwarts is real, Magic is real, they are just hiding.

So because of that I usually like crossovers where that still makes sense. Star Trek and StarGate work fine or really anything that shares the element of taking place in the "real world".

*** I dont really see what you mean about that. Its not difficult to say that vigilantes and superheroes exist in the "real world" and there you go the "real world" has superheroes, but maybe i dont really follow that mentality as i never payed attention to the "real life" aspect of HP.

Well they don't. Look outside (or at the news), no Superman flying around, case closed ;)

It's kinda important for me that Harry comes from the real world where Magic is totally magical. If Superman exists it's not really that special anymore... kinda cheapens it.

***** Guess it just shows how different fans latch on to different things, iv seen so many magical series and systems in games shows and books that at this point it just seems normal that they are in a story, same with super heroes, and one man armies. The sense of "realism" is probably the least important thing to me.

As an avid fantasy reader I can promise you that "realism" is of very little importance to me too.

*** For the most part, DC and Marvel are on the normal earth, though. The only large difference is there are a few extra cities. From what I can tell otherwise, everything still happened the way it did in real life. It's confirmed that the world wars happened in both, and all the countries seem to be the same as they are in real life. The simple existence of a place like Gotham City or Metropolis doesn't mean that harry potter wizards and witches couldn't also exist

** Gate

Here's the plot summary from wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  When a portal from another world appears in Ginza, Tokyo, a legion of soldiers and monsters emerge to attack the city. Thanks to their far more advanced weaponry and tactics, the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) easily repels the enemy, passes through the gate and establish a forward operating base to force the Roman-styled empire of the other world to open peace negotiations. Yōji Itami is a JSDF officer sent to investigate the other world, where magic, dragons and elves are real, using his knowledge of fantasy stories to make his way in this new environment.
#+end_quote

Its basic plot is already a world cross. If the JSDF of Gate came from a Harry Potter world, there you go.

Also Little Witch Academia seems pretty obvious.
