I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/282139/1/After-the-End][this fic]] YEARS ago on Sugar Quill and recently rediscovered it on FF.net. I really liked it. It's an AU post Hogwarts fic with really great characters. Pairings are canon, but develop really slow. PTSD!Harry, Alive!Sirius, creepy Dementors and great theory on spell creating.


** Is it complete? Cause FF.net says it isn't.

*** It's pre-complete option. You'll find a number of fics are complete, but the author moved on before ff.net provided the option to label it as complete.

** Really good story, one of the true classics of the fandom. /After the End/ is a post war story written Pre-OoTP, and the story focuses mainly on how the main characters try to build back their lives in a post Voldemort world, and all the challenges that adulthood brings. There are, of course, remnants of the war that didn't die with Voldemort, and openly rebelling Dementors are the most visible of the problems. Add to that Draco Malfoy mucking things up, and things aren't nearly as peaceful as they should be.

This is probably the best written fic in the fandom in terms of writing quality ever after 15 years, and believe me, I've read a /lot/ of fanfiction. The characterizations of the main characters are all excellent, and their character voices completely true to canon. Ron and Draco are the best. Ron is snarky and insecure, jealous and loyal, all at once, and perfectly true to his canon self. Draco is the perfect mixture of arrogance, cowardliness and cunning, and no story yet written feels so true to his canon character.

The main storyline, involving Draco's deceit and the hungry Dementors, is really well done and very engaging. There were some parts in the end that hit me quite hard. The Quidditch sub plot is engaging as well -- in most fanfics I skim over the matches, this one engaged me from start to finish.

So yeah, overall really good, and well worth reading.

** Of course, one of the reasons it is AU is because it was written before Order of the Phoenix was even released.
