Just a tought, but how much would you find plausible that a lycanthropy course doesn't take on someone that is already cursed ? Not talking about a minor curse but something as equally serious, like vampirism or big berserk curse ?


** Books don't give a clear answer, but it seems like a something as serious as a curse wouldn't be cancelled out. After all, Lupin never tried to become an Animagus so he'd avoid monthly transformations, which makes me think there isn't a loophole in those things.

*** Indeed but also it would have bien impossible for him to keep the mandrake leaf in his mouth for a whole month, since he would transform during it.

But I think it's cannon (I may be wrong) that an animagus don't become a werewolf if bitten in his animal form, like when Sirius fought Remus in POA to keep him away from the children.

**** Yeah there's that. However I imagine that if being an Animagus could indeed prevent lycanthropy, James and Sirius would have tried to find a way for Lupin to keep the leaf in his mouth during transformation, even if they didn't succeed.

I don't remember wether it's stated being bitten by a werewolf as an animal does nothing but I guess it makes sense because Sirius didn't become a werewolf after his fight with wolf Lupin in PoA.

** Tell me about big berserk curse!

I think the easiest thing to do would be to make vampirism take precedence; whatever force is turning humans to werewolves doesn't work as well on vampires.

More interesting things might be bizarre interactions:

you can turn into a wolf at will, ala Dracula, or

the side of your neck where you got bit stays humany when you wolf out, as well as a gradient radiating outwards, so your fur gets more dense as you get further from the site the vampirism first showed up

The place the wolf bit you is the only part that transforms, but it transforms for fully half the month so you see vampires with one big wolfy arm

The wolf and vampire curses are in constant combat and sometimes you're basically just a vampire and sometimes you're basically just a wolf

The wolf and vampire curses are in constant combat for the ten minutes it takes for the strain of said combat to kill you horribly

*** By berserk curse, I meant something like Hulk : someone who would explode on a murderous rampage if even just a tad angry and cannot be forcibly calmed or cannot prevent his fits of rage either by spell or potions.

** I think it would be funny if applying a curse to someone lifted the last curse they were under to make room, and the curse on the Defense Professor counted. So werewolves and vampires who signed up to teach Defense would find themselves miraculously cured. I mean, clearly that doesn't happen. But wouldn't it be great?
