I'm tired of fics where Harry is either horribly abused or has a fantastic childhood. I want to see ones where his guardians, Dursleys or otherwise, spoil him and he enters Hogwarts as basically Dudley. Preferably no bashing or slash.


** If there are any fics out there where Harry is raised by the Malfoys, that might be what you're looking for...

There's a community for this on both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Malfoy-Raised/114992/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/][FFN]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter%20is%20a%20Malfoy/works][AO3]]: each one has 14 stories as of this writing, some of which may overlap and some of which will (hopefully for you) include a Spoiled Brat Harry.

If anyone recognizes a specific story in there and can recommend it, please do so.

** Linkffn(Black Luminary) I absolutely hate Harry in this fic. I have never wanted an MC dead more than here, and I have read Voldemort, Snape, and Bellatrix centric fics.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?
