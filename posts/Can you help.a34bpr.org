I'm trying to find this fanfiction that has Tom Riddle in it as the main character and he has made horcruxs but he is still a beautiful ass bitch. But he does not become lord Voldemort and is the undersecretary to minister fudge. And he is paired with Harry, who is a magical vet and he has to take Nagini to him.

#+begin_quote
  Tom, seventy-one in spirit but still around twenty-five in flesh, has climbed to the top of the government with only his overbearing snake Nagini as a companion. However, when Nagini one day grows ill, and Tom runs into young creature healer and recent Hogwarts graduate Harry Potter, all of that changes.
