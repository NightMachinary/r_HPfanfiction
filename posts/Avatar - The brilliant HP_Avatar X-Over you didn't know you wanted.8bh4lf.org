Honestly, this story is simply amazing.

The greatest chunk of the story takes place with Harry in the Avatar universe's Earth, of which pollution and the destruction of the ecosystem has essentially killed off all wizards, sans himself. I won't go into too much detail about that.

This story has the most interesting concept for "Magic, where does it come from?" that I've ever read. It's one of those explanations where you're like, "Oh, yeah, that totally makes sense" before you realize that, logically, magically doesn't /actually/ exist. It's really genius.

Harry in this story is /technically/ overpowered, but is held in check by /believable/ and /logical/ moral reasons which don't feel like an excuse for Harry to not just snap his fingers and solve everything.

Great character development, a Harry that feels IC, new and interesting people, characters who aren't 1-Dimensional (Honestly, his characterization of certain characters who I shan't name made me upset, sad, understanding and sympathetic and just /oh god, read the story/).

I don't recommend fics super often, but you're going to want to /READ THIS STORY/.

The story was /recently/ updated, as in at the end of February of this year. However it's been around since 2013 and I'm a new reader, so I couldn't tell you if the author updates once every 3 months or if he just updated after a 3 year hiatus, but it doesn't appear to be /abandoned/, if you can stand what I imagine will probably be a long wait until the next chapter.

EDIT: I know I mentioned that the majority of this story takes place on Earth but, just to clarify, almost the /entirety of the story/ has nothing to do with Pandora and takes place a year or so before the events of the movie. It's only the final two chapters where Harry goes to Pandora, and it's not to stay and make friends (though he probably will).

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night.

** I started reading this last night, what an odd coincidence. I'm really enjoying it so far, it's really well done and I can't wait to see how it develops, I just really hope it isn't a year before it updates again. It's hooked me.

I have no idea if this would match Avatar's version of Earth or if it's entirely made up by the author but either way I feel like it fits with what I know from the movie, plus the worldbuilding is so well done I'm not sure it matters.

I re-watched the movie after reading this fic. AFAIK, the only canonical things about Earth are that it's polluted to shit and companies have way more power than they should, and RDA is the company that people are working for on Pandora.

I believe everything else has been filled in by the author.

I rec'd it in a thread looking for time travel stories, so I wonder if it was my post? :D

I love this story too, by the way. Such an interesting approach to the source of magic and muggles studying it.

I thought so too. Until the latest chapter(s), it reads like Harry was in original settings rather than Avatar world. But I'm glad the author took his/her time to deal with issues Harry faced on Earth.

  Harry defeated Voldemort with the power he knew not, a power far more valuable than his freedom. Sealed away until next he was needed, the Wizarding Saviour slept through the fall of his race, of magic and almost the world. Now he has been woken, the last avatar of a dead species and a being whose purpose is so old that only the bones of the Earth remember. Gen. Adult themes.

*** I wouldn't personally consider it slash. Harry doesn't particularly have any relationships throughout the story (it's classified as Gen). However, the story does show that he seems to be exclusively attracted to females.

There's a drug-induced kind of plot point which involves him being manipulated into sleeping with a man but it isn't explicit and isn't a terribly large portion of the story. He doesn't know he was manipulated, so there isn't particularly any angst about it, either.

  Fate is a funny thing sometimes. Harry Potter and his friends survived their trial by fire and defeated Voldemort. A year has passed and Hermione Granger is apprenticed as a Curse Breaker. When she discovers an ancient tomb she talks Harry into helping with the excavation. Now they are trapped and they'll need a miracle to survive. HP/BSG now with quite a bit of Stargate in the mix
