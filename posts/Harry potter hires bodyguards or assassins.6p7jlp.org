#+begin_quote
  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.

** linkao3(There May Be Some Collateral Damage)

This is a Bleach crossover where Dumbledore (I think?) hires Ichigo as a bodyguard. It's pretty hilarious.

  “This isn't how you take over the Earth,” Tony said, deciding it was best to put aside any and all jokes, clearly Loki wasn't in the mood for them, “humans don't deal well with overt aggression, they'll just rebel constantly and do you really want to deal with that?”Loki stopped stalking towards Tony, looking at him curiously, “You're giving me tips?”“I'm saying there's another way, a better way, a way I've already started. You think you can keep hold of this planet yourself? Do you know how many have tried? You need someone to help you with that and I need someone too. I think you and I can work together.”

#+begin_quote
  Harry is fed up with the lies of the ministry, the slander of the prophet and the inaction of everyone around him in the face of Voldemort's return. After careful thinking he has come to a conclusion: find Peter Pettigrew and you find the truth. Hence Harry puts a 100,000 Galleon reward on Peter's head and watches as the entire magical community goes mad in the race to find him.

** I can't remember the name but in a story he hired professionals to deal with Voldemort and Horcruxes. It was after his name came out of goblet. Voldemort was dealed with before he was revived. Afterwards, he was probably exiled/self-exiled from Britain for some reasons. Malfoy Sr probably helped him to deal some business stuff. So many years later when he returned to Britain for a week, he stayed with them.

**** He lived in New Zealand or Australia. He had business dealings with Astoria Malfoy nee Greengrass. He was friendly with her and pseudo-friendly with Draco as a result. These are things that I remember. I can't remember the point of the fic though, like getting dressed up but having nowhere to go.
