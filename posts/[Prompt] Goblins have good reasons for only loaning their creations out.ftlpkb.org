Hermione turned white as a sheet as the book dropped from her suddenly limp hands.

​

"What is it?" Harry said, concerned at his friends behaviour.

​

In a somewhat shaky voice, Hermione replied "It's the goblins, Harry. I've been reading the only known book about them where someone actually talked to them and visited their caves rather than everything being based on conjecture and hearsay."

​

"And? What's got you so worried?"

​

"There's a reason that goblin made artefacts are so powerful. The book doesn't go into much detail but the creation of one involves the willing sacrifice of the craftsman. That's why they only loan the artefacts out, and at great cost. They are literally family heirlooms."


** I read one story, and no I don't remember nearly enough about it to actually find it, where goblins didn't spend magic to craft, they transferred it. So craftsgoblins permanently expended their magic to imbue it in their creations. Kind of the same idea, but less death and more quality of life.

*** Shoot I just read that fic like two weeks ago and I've already forgotten what the name was. I believe it involved an emp going off and wiping out all technology, and they had to make a deal with the goblins for their underground lightsource technology. It was Harry balancing trying to save the wizarding world from the apocalypse and Voldemort at the same time.

  Dumbledore's dead. On the train ride home, cars are at a standstill, the electricity is out, fires burn unchecked from Scotland to London, and chaos reigns in muggle Britain. Somehow Harry has to survive this new world while destroying Voldemort.

*** I believe theres one called the rune master that fits that description. Basic premise, when Hermione drops divination, harry and ron follow her in solidarity. They need to pick new electives. Ron chooses muggle studies. Harry chooses runes. Harry finds out he is a rune savant.

** Underground is a hard place to live. Resources are tight, always, down in the deep where the sun never reaches to nurture energy-dense crops.

Every goblin knows, deep down - and centuries of profitable trading with the surface has done nothing to convince them otherwise - that life is precarious, and the help you give your neighbour is your guarantee of future survival. Every goblin artificer is in it to keep his people - his family, his clan, his tribe, the whole of the people of the Deep Dark - safe, well and fed, knowing that they in turn will see to him.

A goblin might lease you his work, forgoing the use of it for a while in return for some other needed resource, but if you keep it beyond terms? You're not just stealing from him, but from every goblin he might have helped in the future with that magic weapon or item.

If you steal from one goblin, you're stealing from them /all/.

*** Not loan. Lease for a life term. This is not a uniquely goblin thing: chattel leases with a life term are a thing in most jurisdictions (although long out of common use most places).

If you keep rental property after the rental term has expired what you are is a /thief/.
