** how old are you?

I'm in my early 30s, and my friends and I are already doing the “I'm getting so old!” song and dance. Even though we know, logically, that we're not really that old. It's just that our bodies aren't as resilient as they used to be, and every reminder of that makes you feel Not Young, aka old.

Not to mention that Sirius lost 12 years of his life to Azkaban, aka hell on earth. He went from being free at 21 to being free at 33. So he's got the added cultural element. Last time he was a free man, different bands were popular and now no one knows the bands he likes, or they're considered “classics” or “older music”. Fashion changed, businesses moved, closed, or opened, neighbors moved, had kids, grew up, yadda yadda. He was a young rebel, now he's closer to the age of the people he was rebelling against.

*** I'm seventeen and I understand where you're coming from. I have a lot of medical issues that make me feel about twenty years older than I really am. The thing I'm focusing on, though, is that thirty is pretty young by wizards' standards. It's like being twenty.

Though, I could argue against myself due to Sirius's poor treatment and the stress aging Remus goes through when he transforms every full moon and being prejudiced against.

It just kind of gets annoying when I read a fic where people ship Harry with Remus or Sirius and they keep having the older characters bringing up their age without anyone commenting that their age difference (20 years) isn't too bad by the way witches and wizards age.

**** I'm 31, and while obviously I'm not “old”, I feel a lot older than I did five years ago. From around 22-27 there wasn't really any change, but in the last few years I've found that I can't get away with staying up all night and neglecting my sleep like I could in college, and hard work makes my joints hurt more than it used to. I think 30ish is pretty typical for the effects of aging to start becoming noticeable, even if they aren't all that significant yet.

*** Yeah, but that's just under a third of the life expectancy, thirty for witches and wizards is like being twenty or something. Though, I suppose their personal experiences is something to argue about. Sirius was more or less mentally and emotionally tortured in prison for twelve years and Remus stress ages because of his lycanthropy and what being a werewolf entails. Say people ship Bill Weasley and Harry Potter togther. That's a ten year age difference, but considering how young Bill is/looks and if Harry's of age, that difference wouldn't really mean much.

** For them specifically, it's less about being actually old people and more about how much of their lives they missed.

Between Lily and James dying and becoming a part of Harry's life, Remus and Sirius probably spent a lot of their time in a depressive haze of regret and living in the past. Then suddenly they get confronted with reality, Harry looks like James because James was so young when he died, and just like that, they feel all the years that passed by.

James and Lily will be young forever, but Remus and Sirius... they got /old./

** It's a pretty common phenomenon. I mean, I'm still in my teens and when I look at my pictures when I was three, I get the feeling of 'wow, I've grown so much'. It's actually a part of fanon that really hits the nail on the head for how much these two have endured in such a little time.

A person's twenties is as important as his childhood to how their personality gets shaped up. People usually get married at that age, maybe have kids and become established in their jobs (probably stable). For Sirius, this was cut short: he was an outstanding student, brilliant and handsome and charming but after his incarceration he's just a stamp as to how much time has truly passed. Sirius is a man out of time, even if he's in his thirties, he hasn't experienced what it's like to be in his twenties. Hell, his 22nd birthday was spent in Azkaban. In some ways Sirius is still 22, in others he's as old and as weary as Dumbledore.

This sounds horrible, but it was probably a mercy that he died before he was ever free, imagine experiencing the cultural changes, seeing old classmates married with jobs and a reputation. It sucks, because he probably could've been something important given how talented he was in more than one area, and was top of his class. Now, he doesn't have anything to work with, literally. He'll just sit and view how much the world has moved on without him. Give him a few Order missions to keep himself busy, but really, other than protecting Harry and fighting a war, trying to live, there's really nothing for him in this place. It's sad, and it's horrible but it's true. Sirius might be in his thirties physically, but he's akin to an isolated old man who has retired from the world and come back to find it has shifted drastically.

As for Remus, this poor bloke's life is enough to make anyone age prematurely. Like Sirius, physically he isn't 'old' but experience-wise? He's suffered more than anyone with his brains and talents should have, only because Fenrir Greyback thought it would be funny to make it his personal mission to fulfill a prophecy in his name. He's been shunned and scorned his entire life, and the fact that he's got this huge need to distance himself from others shouldn't shock anyone. From the moment he was four, just imagine the inner turmoil he had to go through by seeing how his parents have suffered for him. This kid is physically four, but he's probably more mature than a third-year midway through his Hogwarts years. Likewise, no stable income, no friends (he's practically isolated), living a pitiful existence. Suddenly he sees Harry again as thirteen when just last time, the boy was barely a year old.

I think for both of these people to see Harry as a teenager when the last time they laid eyes on him was when he was an infant, is enough to make anyone go 'I'm old'. They're still stuck in the glory days before James does, Remus less so, mind, but before he married Tonks he hasn't had a moment's respite. Poor blokes, it's understandable for them, but I don't think for others it is that much, because they've moved on with the world. Sirius and Remus are both the most tragic thing about this series.

** So, I'm at an age where some of my friends are single, most of them have better jobs and some - god forbid - have kids. I'm already married, so admittedly I can't argue on that one.

I'm not literally old - though my hands are showing my age the most. I'm still - as people older than me tell me - very young. I've also worked in education where the things I was interested are either an unknown or outdated, where the children were born AFTER I left school.

People at school seem so, so young. People at university immature and ill prepared for the world. I was too. I didn't believe my teacher in school but mentally there is a HUGE shift between 17/18 and 25.

In Sirius/Remus' case, their parents and most of their friends have died. They're more or less trapped into the house Sirius ran away from and swore to never return to. Both of them had their adulthood and carefree times stolen from them - Sirius through prison and Remus through poverty and discrimation. Despite neither of them having kids (until the last book) their friend's kid is now in his teens and believes he alone can save the world*. Harry is probably close to the age in which they decided they'd join the war effort and bring about it's defeat, yet a whole generation on its the same old same old.

In short, as others have said - milestones.

So on the one hand, I've always been mature for my age and on the other I've missed some core development. I'm told that feeling like most other people are adultier adults while also wondering how you got so "old" is normal.

** Well I started complaining about getting old when I was 25. I called it my midlife midlife crisis. I'm almost 30 now and it just keeps getting worse lol. It doesn't help that I have a job where I work with teenagers and it's hard to describe just how jarring the gap between two generation are. Now I'm not knocking gen z. I think their dark humour is delightful :) and I love them very much but it's still weird to hear them talk amongst themselves and to me... it's like they keep slipping into another language without realizing it. Then sometimes I'll say something and it's like I'm slipping into another different language. But we all understand the words but not the translation. It's just weird. So it makes me feel old. That's probably what Remus and Sirius feel like. Even more so for Sirius.

Edit: I had another thought. So because I'm around gen z so much if I'm at a party or talking to my older family members and start guessing or misusing slang for example'Fleek' or ‘Yeet'. Without thinking I'll just say your using it wrong. Then have to explain it the how's and why's.
