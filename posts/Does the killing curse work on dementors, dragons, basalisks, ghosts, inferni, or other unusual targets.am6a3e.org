** I would say that it probably works on Dragons, Basilisks, and any other truly living (albethey unusual) magical creatures. However, if you want to close the plothole of why people ruthless enough to use Killing Curses wouldn't just take them down in one hit that way, you can always say that though it is immune to magical protection per se, Dragon or Basilisk hide's magic-resistance is defence enough against a Killing Curse.

Dementors and their ilk are classified as "amortal", that is to say that while they outwardly resemble living things, they are not considered "alive" for purposes of Magical Theory. This suggests to me pretty heavily that no, the Killing Curse wouldn't work on them.

It /certainly/ doesn't work on ghosts; the whole point of the KC is that it makes you dead when you're not; the whole point of ghosts is that they are dead.

Inferi... I would also say no. They're not alive. Heck, they're not even "undead" to any meaningful degree; there's nothing in them of the deceased's personality. They're just animated puppets that happen to have used human corpses as source material; we know they're devoid of any kind of consciousness, and are instead just running on (artificial) instincts.

That being said, we know a Killing Curse hitting something too thick for it to go through it, but that it cannot kill, will cause an explosion. So maybe a Killing Curse would still be useful against Inferi, who, being "objects", would get blown up by it.

*** Would guess that the size, strength, and where you hit a creature also determines whether they die or not. Like if you shot a dragon normally it's likely the spell would deflect. But if you hit it in the eye it would penetrate their natural resistance, but maybe only stagger it. Same way that giants and dragons need multiple stunners to overcome their natural resistance, would guess the same principle applies.

**** Ok, but then that kind of implies that a dragon-hide cloak would be an effective defense against the killing curse. Which, on the one hand, it'd be pretty much just a physical barrier, and canonically those can block the killing curse, but on the other hand the spell is supposedly unblockable...

Hmm, now I'm imagining Aurors with dragon-hide spell-proof vests...

***** I'd say the dragon hide blocks it /once/ as it is destroyed in the process. Also, the AK is still likely to kill or severely maim its target if it explodes the dragon hide.

You want something not attached to your body that can block it.

***** When the curse is called unblockable, my head cannon says, that means by magic. Wizards seem full of them selves and believe if magic can't do it then it can't be done. I don't remember exactly but when Dumbledore and Riddle fought the AK was block by different objects but nothing that was made with magic. (Maybe the shield thing but I don't remember.) So maybe it should by said that it can't be blocked by magic.

** Well, you can't kill something that's already dead. So I'd imagine Ghosts would be, at best, mildly inconvenienced. Inferi might suffer the same fate as inanimate objects struck by a Killing Curse(explosion), so it would probably be at least somewhat effective. Dementors are weird. They're not undead the way Ghosts are, but I don't know if they'd be "alive" in the normal sense. So might not affect them either.

Anything else? If it's alive, it can be killed. In the case of beings or creatures with particularly high inherent resistance to magic, it might take more than one hitting it at the same time(Like with the Stunning Spells against Dragons) to be fully effective.

Canonically, they are considered "amortal non-beings", a classification which also applies to Boggarts and Poltergeists: beings who bear surprising similarities to either living or undead things, but are not, nor have ever been, "alive" magically speaking.

** My personal head canon is that the killing curse is a type of soul magic. Due to it it destroying or removing the soul of the person hit, it would not work against anything that is not human because they lack a soul.

But that can't be canonically true because Hedwig is killed by it.

So probably against dragons and basilisks but not against dementors, ghosts, or inferi because they aren't living things.

Buuuuuut who knows that stupid ass spell should've never been created. AK OP valve plz nerf

*** Maybe that just means the Killing Curse doesn't do anything to your soul, like fanon thinks, and it just shuts your body functions down all at once. All your nerves, your muscles, your spine, your brain - it just stops working and you're switched from alive to dead.

** I'd wager the killing curse only works on living things. So it'd work on trees, dragons, basilisks, but not on rocks, inferi, or anything 'dead'. Of course, only a supremely powerful wizard would be able to down a dragon, so much so it'd be mostly be impossible.

**** I would argue would argue animals don't have souls either and therefore it shouldn't work on them either but that's how hedwig was killed.

AK is a broken spell that never should've been created tbh

Agreed. Totally OP and makes very little sense.

** I'd say it would take more than one k.c to kill a dragon or a basilisk for the same reason it takes more than one stunning spell, whether power or thick skin. Stunning spell "stuns" the target just as killing curse "kills" it. But then again, "magic."

** I think that the hide, while resistant, loses power by not being part of the creature. The aura or what have you of the dragon playing a large role in defeating enemy magic. Might save you once though!
