i'm reading all the young dudes but it's so. painful.

i'd love to read something like sirius and remus raising harry, or the marauders in hogwarts story ending well and everyone's happy

i feel like everything sucks so much right now that i need to consume positive content! lol


** This one's rather fluffy and sweet. EWE Wolfstar, Harry quits the aurors and moves in with them. linkao3(21852754)

(I realise it's not exactly what you're looking for, but it might work to cleanse your palette nonetheless. Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with all that many wolfstar fics.)

  Summer, 1999. Harry comes home with news. Quite a lot of news. Harry takes a deep breath.“I'm quitting the Aurors,” he starts with, which is followed by a moment of stunned silence.“What?” Sirius says.“All right," Remus says. “Do you know what else you want to do? Did you think about it?”Harry blushes, the way James used to---a rosy glow lighting up his brown skin---and says, “I wanted to---that is, I thought I might be a teacher.”Remus, quite suddenly, seems to have something in his eye. "Oh."“What?” Sirius says.“And uh---there's more. I was thinking I might like to. That is. I want to become an Animagus.”

** Shameless self promo

My story will cover the school years, the first war, and the aftermath of the events of Halloween 1981, diverging sharply from canon after that date. Before then the story stays true to the small amount of canon detail we know about the Marauders, but is heavily embellished, exploring both the things Harry wasn't told, and how perspective effects the interpretation of events...

Also, featuring The Hogwarts Annual Super Secret Games, Artist!Sirius, Inventor!Remus and Potioneer!Peter.

It's nowhere near finished, currently near the end of October of second year, but I promise a happy ending for Sirius and Remus.

  Death is stasis, and no one returns from it.But the Potters are not really exceptional at obeying rules.---Months after their death, Lily and James drag themselves through the Veil with a guest. They have some things to do.

  There are a few things Sirius really didn't count on for Christmas of 1979. The extreme sexual confusion is one of them; Remus Lupin is approximately seventy-eight of the rest.
