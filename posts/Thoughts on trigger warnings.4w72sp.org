Hey guys. I'm writing my first multi-chapter fic, and I want your opinions on trigger warnings. I put warnings for graphic violence and depictions of rape at the beginning of my first chapter, but the first few chapters have been pretty tame. I'm writing Chapter 6 right now, and it has some fairly graphic depictions of a Death Eater raid. I'm debating if I should restate the trigger warning at the beginning of the chapter, or if warning people at the beginning of the story is good enough. Thoughts? I personally don't like trigger warnings, because I think it takes some of the suspense/surprise out of it, but I don't know if there's some sort of etiquette I don't know about.


** I really wouldn't worry if the tags are in the story as a whole. I don't like reading about sexual violence, so I just avoid stories that have that in the tags/warnings. There's no need to have individual ones for chapters.

*** Thanks for the reply! Looks like general consensus is not to worry about it. :-)

** Is the fic rated M, and you already said it was going to be graphic?

The reader should already know what they're getting into, and if they don't they deserve what they get.

** I like having a short reminder just at the the top of the specific chapter. E.g. A/N: Warning: Character death. Or if you want to be less spoilery Warning: explicit/dark themes. // A/N: please re-familiarize yourself with the warnings stated on the first chapter for this chapter.

I think it's a nice bit of courtesy.

*** I agree. Try not go give any spoilers, but it's a nice reminder for people who are following multiple stories.

** Since it's a multi-chaptered fic you're posting over a period of time, I would suggest addin an AN at the top of this chapter to remind readers that yes, this is the fic that has all that rape and mayhem and death in it. Your readers may be following a number of fics and sometimes it's challenging to remember which story goes with which warnings.

I DO warn on individual chapters, but then again, I've been known to go 6 months between updates on my current WIP.

** I generally don't bother with trigger warnings as long as I don't use anything worse than in the source works. And since HP canon covers war, the murder of children, genocide, racism, mind control, sacrifices, rituals, child abuse, terrorist attacks, torture, mutilation, bullying, accidents, and abuse of power, pretty much anything but explicit rape is covered, unless the line to "splatter territory" is crossed.

** Trigger warnings, pfffft. If someone is triggered by what I wrote, I'll take perverse pleasure in it.

I'm of the opinion that people who use the phrase "trigger warning" in a non-joking manner should get a monthly ban from the Internet every time they do it.
