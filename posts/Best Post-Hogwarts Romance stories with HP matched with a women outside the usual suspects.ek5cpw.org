The usual suspects would be women like Ginny/Hermione/Luna/Fleur/Tonks.

Basically looking for romance fics where Harry Potter, years after Hogwarts, develops a romantic relationship with a women (or even multiple women) who is not within the typical cannon group (OC's being fine).

Some examples would be women like Tracy Davis, Hannah Abbot, Lisa Turpin, Katie Bell, Astoria Greengrass, and so on...

The key point being *POST*-Hogwarts, and obviously non-canon compliant in any way.

Obviously looking for non-main character slash. Any rating is fine but I would much prefer more mature fics, and as such, violence, language, or smut is not an issue provided the plot comes first.


** Linkffn(Twelve Days by TheEndless7) for Harry/Gabrielle. Fair warning that it's initially Harry/Ginny
