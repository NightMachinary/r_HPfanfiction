Seems like every fanfiction involving this pairing has Harry be completely immune to Fleur's allure. While I enjoy the pairing regerdless I wish more people played around with the dynamic.


** I dont remember the name but there's one during GOF where Fleur goes after Harry because she wants fame and his presumed fortune. So she's going to have him knock her up. He's not immune so she thinks it's going to be easy, until its revealed that thanks to her allure, the Horcrux comes out as the primary influence, and it is into hardcore BDSM as a sadist.

Fleur ends up fleeing England after one night.

**** No, and that's why I'm upset. I'm pretty certain it was just a one-shot I read on ff.net since I read it back when it was the only place I read from. It doesn't go into any real smut because it goes hard for the comedy angle towards the end.

** The common justification is that the relationship wouldn't really /work/, at least not long-term, without Harry having at least some modicum of resistance, since Fleur is implied to look down on boys who get charmed by her Veela side.

He also eventually shrugs off the Imperius curse in-canon. Most fics that don't have him be 100% resistant, will lean on that angle to let him /eventually/ push through it - and we go right back to the first situation where she's interested because he's pushing through her mind-control.

There is at least one Harry/Gabrielle where he's not immune - Harry Potter and the Power He Knows Not ( linkffn(13160344) ) has him not-quite-immune but somewhat resistant (he visibly struggles against the Veela at the World Cup), and it makes the allure a semi-conscious thing that Veela can suppress or project to varying degrees. It's not a Harry/Fleur, but since Gabrielle is aged up to 16 it might scratch the same itch.

  Book 1 of a Trilogy. Harry Potter thought his life could not get any worse. No parents, the worst childhood one could ever imagine, and now no godfather. Harry Potter was wrong. When his name comes out of The Goblet of Fire, Harry is abandoned by those closest to him, and is sure that he is truly and completely alone. Once again, Harry Potter was wrong.

  Starts off from the Quidditch world cup, Harry finds a more important reason to fight for and that sometimes, a fairytale or legend is a lot more than it seems. Discontinued. Sorry.

** Hogwarts Battle School is sadly unfinished, but is a pretty fun AU, essentially its Ender's Game shoved into the HP universe. It starts in 3rd year, so Fleur doesn't show up until about half way through. In this fic, even Occlumency doesn't offer a very strong resistance to Fleur's powers.
