A discussion in another thread made me wonder if such a story exists. I'd prefer Harry actually doing some dubious/problematic things and getting a redemption, but if Dumbledore notices everything before it happens and prevents the whole thing I'll take that as well.

I just ask for no bashing, harem and Harry/DE/LV pairings.


** Have you read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and It's sequels.
