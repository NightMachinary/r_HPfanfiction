I rarely see him done this way, I want him to get the spotlight instead of being bashed around while Lily imperiuses him to become a rug to be stepped on.

  An hour after Dumbledore told them about the prophecy, James had his entire family- including the dog- bundled up on a Muggle ferry to France. Because there's valiantly dying for the greater good, and then there's good parenting.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.

** One where Lily isn't bashed either, because it seems as if at least one of them has to be bashed in any Potter's survive stories.

**** It happens sometimes in Dark!Harry fics where the darkside is right and muggleborns are ruining magical culture blah blah blah. Also happens when it's Marauders' era and writer wants a different ship for James.

Edit: I actually remember just one fic with only Lily bashing in Harry's era.

*** Fairly badass? They keep holding the idiot ball so the plot continues through the stations of canon. It's crazy, as a Magical Orphan(tm), Harry's parents surviving should blast the canon plot and Harry's canon characterization into smithereens. Yet convenient misunderstandings and coincidences keep happening to make people chug along the train tracks of destiny to ape the canon timeline.

Harry doesn't have abusive relatives to make him shy, withdrawn and distrustful of authority, so the author engineers a series of escalating miscommunications to justify having basically the same Harry as canon (in terms of his relationships with the adults) as the end product of a radically different childhood.

In the CoS equivalent, Lily accompanies Harry into the Chamber but instead of solving everything and saving the day like you'd expect of Lily Potter DADA Professor she literally stands there crying while Harry fights the basilisk!

#+begin_quote
  Lily could only watch, wandless and voiceless, as Harry pulled the hat off of his head and grabbed a silver sword encrusted with rubies from inside. He held it in his hands and looked at her.

  ...

  Lily would have done anything for her wand, anything except give up Harry. She held him tighter and cried harder.

This fic series is so disappointing to me because it could be so much better if it just discarded the stations of canon and went in a new direction. The writer is very good technically, there are no grammar or stylistic issues I can see, it's just a question of their vision that gives me pause.
