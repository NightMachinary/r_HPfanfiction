********* "Yes but you forget that unlike Malfoy, I happen to have the right....counterspell for this."

"You do NOT know the vanishing charm, Harry."

"Who said anything about a charm? Kitty, GO!"

Like a flash of orange, Crookshanks leaped from Harry's lap into the flock of birds somehow managing to kill three of them before he had even landed. The next few seconds were far more gruesome - the poor screaming birds simply could not find any refuge from his slashing, deadly claws. Mere moments later, the area looked like the aftermath of a very violent pillow fight...if pillow fights resulted in blood spatters and tiny corpses everywhere.

As Hermione watched with a shocked expression, trying to process both the massacre that had just happened and the idea that HER Crookshanks was teaming up with Harry, the boy casually got up and waved his wand to...wait a minute!

"YOU KNOW THE VANISHING SPELL?! WHEN DID YOU...WHY DIDN'T YOU VANISH THE BIRDS IF YOU KNEW HOW TO?"

"Because," said Harry as he leaned across, Crookshanks sitting on his shoulder calmly licking the blood off his paws, "I needed to get a message through to a dumb bint."

** Ok, a couple things.

1. Freud was a bit of a freak, but even then his belief in the concept focused more on a person sexual awakening or first sexual thoughts than it did long term infatuation or love.

2. He used a review of Odipus Rex to push his idea and gain popularity, but his actual theories don't truely match the story in the first place. He basically said "look, incest!" And proceeded to then completely disregard the differences in his beliefs and the context of the story.

3. If you actually think of the story instead of Freud's mother issues, Ginny fits better. Oedipus wasn't raised by his mother, and didn't even know what she looked like till later in life. He kills his father, some stuff happens, and he proceeded to marry and bone his mom. They don't know she's his mother till after the fact, and the woman who raised him is afk by that point in the story. With all that, Lily 2.0 (aka ginny) fits the mold a hell of a lot better than daphne.

4. This is kind of a dumb situation regardless. Even if a love interest has similarities to someone's mom, they're not the same person. There's nothing wrong with it and trying to twist it to look like incest fantasy is weird.

**** I think they have some similarities in that they are both introverted which makes them seem distant and cold at a glance. But I've always seen Daphne as someone who is very self-assured unlike Petunia who is constantly comparing herself to other neighbors and demeaning others to make herself feel better. Daphne, I think, can have a good nature once Harry crosses that barrier and gets to know her better. I like the idea of Harry pairing with an introvert because it seems to fit with his personality better.
