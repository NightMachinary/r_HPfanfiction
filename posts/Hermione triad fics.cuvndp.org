Love Maisey2k10 and KeiroMarcos toad fics and I'm looking for more. Either F/F/M or M/M/F, as long as Hermione is the main focus. Don't mind if one of the others is Harry or Draco, but no Ron, Snape, Voldemort or death eaters. If there is smut it has to be well written. I've read everything involving Fred/George and Daphne. Crossover is fine, has to be over 80k wording

Thank you!


** I totally misread the title. I was wondering why Hermione would be in the Chinese mafia and intrigued that there might be fics that have it.

** Is triad a common term for threesome fics? Because coming into the thread I was totally imagining incense master Hermione inducting blue lantern Hogwarts students into the (14)DA.

** Here's what I can recommend:

Linkao3(Searching for a Happier Ending by Kemartin2009) Hr/Severus Snape/Remus Lupin, still updating. Hermione returns to teach at Hogwarts after being abroad for 10 years.

Linkao3(This Life by coyg_81) Hr/Draco/Blaise Zambini, still updating. 8th year fic where Hermione and Blaise are Head Girl and Boy respectively. Post War. This is fine, though the plotting could be better, as in slower.

Linkao3(The Hedgehog's Dilemma by shadukiam) Hr/Harry/Draco, still updating.

Linkao3(Changing Scenery by aethling) Hr/Harry/Draco, still updating. This is a Veela!Draco fic, so Harry and Hermione are his mates. It's entertaining and well-paced.

Linkao3(Fourteen Thousand Galleons by Frumpologist) Hr/Harry/Draco, complete. Hermione has just divorced Ron, and owes 14,000 galleons to the laywer. She is employed as Scorpius' governess.

Linkao3(for as long as you need us) Hr/Ron/Harry. Complete post-war fic. It's a one-shot. It's pretty grim.

Linkao3(Sugar and Spice by InLoveWithForever) hr/Draco/Theo Nott, complete. It's pretty fluffy and smutty. Takes place during 8th year. There is a sequel which is now up and updating.

Hope this helps!

  After years of self-imposed solitude in the United States, Hermione returns to Hogwarts to work in peace on her pet project, a special potion she's developing. Her progress is stuck, so she turns to the most talented Potions Master she knows of, Severus Snape, to help her. At Hogwarts, she reencounters Remus Lupin, and sparks fly, but those aren't the only sparks that are flying. Starts out RL/SS, becomes HG/RL, and more eventually.

  Hermione is Harry's best friend, and Draco is Harry's long-term boyfriend. The problem, of course, is that he's sort of in love with both of them. The Age of Aquarius has finally met its match. Draco/Harry/Hermione triad fic.

  Seven years have passed since the war ended. Hermione has everything she's always wanted, but she still isn't satisfied. When she mentions she's bored to Harry, she didn't think that her boredom would be alleviated quite this way. And she definitely didn't expect to see Draco Malfoy again after all these years, and not like that. Well, she certainly wasn't bored anymore.

  After the War, there is a boom of marriage and divorce. Hermione finds herself among the statistics of war heroes who couldn't save their marriages. When she receives the invoice from her solicitor, she has no choice but to answer an ad in The Daily Prophet: Malfoy Heir Seeking Nanny. But, everything is not quite what it seems as Hermione navigates the waters of post-divorce life.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.

  Contrary to what she claimed, it wasn't grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste she smelled.A mind-boggling amalgamation of confusion followed by a peripheral realization, and then instantaneous fear made her flush so severely that the room went fuzzy around the edges of her vision as she choked out the lie.It was old parchment housed in the restricted section, tart green apples, and something spicy---not cinnamon, cloves?---that lingered inside her nostrils. She was woozy, her lids drooping heavily, even as a small part of her brain screamed at how wrong this was. A larger, louder part of her shoved the shame down in favor of baser instincts. Those instincts dampened and dissipated and the shame crowded in the further removed she was from the delicate, unmistakable scent wafting from the cauldron.WINNER of Mischief Managed Award (Best Recently Completed Story) 2019 Enchanted AwardsWINNER of Summer Lovin' Award (Best Love Story) 2019 Enchanted Awards

*** Not to sound mad or anything but you need to read what I requested. Only 4 of your recs was over 80k wording, and two of them was Ron or Snape in the pairing which I specifically asked it not to be. But otherwise thanks for the suggestions
