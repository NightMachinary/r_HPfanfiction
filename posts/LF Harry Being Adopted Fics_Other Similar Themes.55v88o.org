  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** Does the prose calm down later? Also, why set it in a more modern timeline so you can make the world more accurate because you are afraid of tiny inaccuracies, and then have Harry dropped off at what appears to be a 1940s orphanage with a matron and get straight-up adopted after a year, even though they cannot trace where he came from?

  Keith Brackwood was disillusioned with the wizarding world. So he, like many other muggleborns, returned to the muggle world and after taking his A-levels and finishing university he took a position at a small primary school in Little Whinging. He couldn't have foreseen how this decision would influence the fate of the savior of Wizarding Britain. Child Harry fic.
