Fanon authors like to think that the Imperius curse defence which was done by several Death Eaters like Malfoy Sr, Crabbe Sr and Goyle Sr, to name a few, after the First War is a flimsy excuse, that it's a sign of weak will, weak mind, yadda yadda yadda.

But, if we look at Book 4 and 7, we see that it's just Harry who is able to fight off the Imperius curse out of a class of 40, and as far as we know, the entire school. Everyone else shows next to no resistance.

Viktor Krum, the best student Durmstrang has to offer, fell to the curse. Even Death Eaters who are familiar with the curse are susceptible to being controlled. Travers, Carrow and Junior come to mind. Even wizards who are otherwise capable are susceptible - Alastor Moody, Crouch Sr, Podmore and Bode were all put under the spell successfully.


** The way I see it, it's mostly problematic because it's really hard to prove whether or not someone is under the curse. Being a matter of weak will is a fanon thing.

** I've always believed...

Harry is highly resistant to the Imperius Curse because it induces a sense of euphoria. It's such a shock to Harry's system (especially in his Fourth Year) that his subconscious mind knows that something is wrong and works to discover what. Conscious thought leads to questioning. Questioning leads to overcoming.

People who are well-adjusted, i.e., they have happy experiences in their past, are more susceptible because it's not an alien feeling.

** The weak will thing is absolutely fanon, albeit one that is very, very tenuously rooted in canon - arguably - because it takes the assumption, based on the example of Harry, that strength of will enables one to resist and eventually overcome the Curse, and reverses it to conclude that susceptibility to the Curse indicates weakness of will.

This is absolutely codswallop, because even those characters strong enough(or stubborn enough) to fight it off /were still under its influence to begin with/.

Doesn't matter how strong-willed you are, you are still going to be caught if the Curse is used on you. You might be able to escape its influence with a great deal of mental effort, but it's not gonna stop it from influencing you to begin with.

Also, it seems to be impossible to determine that someone is under the Imperius Curse. For example:

As of the beginning of the Triwizard Tournament and up to, IIRC, the First Task, Barty Crouch Sr. was already under the Imperius Curse. Nobody noticed - not even Dumbledore.

The following year, Madam Rosmerta was under the Imperius Curse for a very lengthy part of the school year. Nobody noticed - not even Dumbledore

Pius Thicknesse was placed under the Imperius Curse(by Yaxley, IIRC) early in DH. While Moody realizes that Thicknesse "has gone over", nothing indicates that he suspects Thicknesse to be under the Imperius Curse. And despite being surrounded by eminently qualified wizards including his boss, Rufus Scrimgeour, nobody else ever noticed a thing.

*** I am curious about the resistance.

So, if we say that strong will does not translate into ability to throw off the Imperius, then what is the criteria?

I mean, what made Harry different in that class that he was the only one able to throw off the curse? If we can't use will power, then the next best thing we have is strength of character. Unfortunately, Harry is very unlikely to be the only one having either of those two. So, both of them are out.

So, what is the requirement for resisting it?

**** I apologize if I wasn't entirely clear. My point was a response to the purely fanon idea that the so-called Imperius defense is:

#+begin_quote
  a sign of weak will, weak mind, yadda yadda yadda.
#+end_quote

The implication here being that only a weak-willed person would be susceptible to the Imperius Curse to begin with, and thus conversely that a strong-willed person would not have been affected - which is bollocks because strength of willpower/character demonstrably *DOES NOT* correlate to susceptibility in the sense of /being affected/ by the Imperius Curse.

It affects /everyone/.

Strength of character/will can be argued to correlate to ability to /overcome/ the curse. Someone like Pettigrew, who's a chickenshit little coward, would never be able to throw off the Curse the way someone like Harry can. But Harry was still, on multiple occasions, affected by the Imperius Curse, and even in Moody's class it took him several attempts before he could throw it off.

Snape knows, and presumably told Dumbledore, and Crouch-posing-as-Mad-Eye publicly alludes to it without breaking his cover. However, Sirius didn't know and didn't have one, and nobody thought that was suspicious.

People knew that the skull and snake were Voldemort's symbol because he'd cast it above the houses when he killed everyone inside. I imagine that, if anyone saw them, they'd just assume that they were tattoos that some Death Eaters had, and not definitive evidence either way.

But in a Wizengamot trial, the jury doesn't know the inner details of how Voldemort and his circle work. With the Imperius defense there to cast reasonable doubt on a person's crimes, I don't see how they'd pardon someone for murder but prosecute them for a tattoo, unless they straight up admitted to being terrorists, like Bellatrix and her gang.

Someone already mentioned Rosmerta was under it for a whole school year and nobody noticed (not even Dumbledore).

Moody's rant in GoF with the spider was always exceptionally chilling to me. At first the class laughs as he makes the spider dance. It's a curse that can seem so harmless, but he can force that spider to drown itself or bite someone in the class. The laughter quickly stops. The imperius can disguise itself as an innocent joke but it leaves no trace and you can do irreparable damage with it. I mean the minister Thicknesse is under it for over a year(?). Originally nobody had any idea and he was the head of the DMLE under Scrimgeour. Moody is about the only one who suspects I believe that he's under the imperius or that there is someone compromised. Imagine waking him up from that and he'll have been trapped in hell for all that time.

** Fanon has done a number on the Imperius Curse for sure, but I would argue that canon screwed it up with inconsistent information first.

First up, we have Harry. Whatever quality it is that is needed to fight the curse, Harry seems to have it ten times as much as anyone else. He can fight it off easily after a few minutes of practice while twenty of his peers, to a person, have no success at all. And this is the same Harry who's rubbish at Occlumency in the next book. It just seems too improbable that he's /that/ different.

Then there's the fact that it seems as if you can build up a resistance to the Imperius Curse over time, rather than it grinding your will down further. Barty Crouch Jr. is kept under it for twelve years, but then breaks free on his own. Then his father was under it for just a few months, and he /also/ broke free long enough to come from his home to Hogwarts (and acted conspicuously delirious when he got there). If this is a common trend, the Imperius Defense starts to look less plausible if the defendant claims they were under it for years.

Then you have the detectability of the curse. Most of the victims we know of acted perfectly normal, at least long-term. However, Stan Shunpike had a "strangely blank face" when he was under it. Katie Bell "looked all funny" (though admittedly she had it cast on her by someone who was under Imperius herself and had probably never used it before). Travers was also "looking abnormally vacant" when Harry cast it on him and had to be specifically ordered by Harry to follow them. This suggests that the curse is not as invisible as was first suggested.

And the parting shot: every time the Imperius is used in the movies, the victim looks pretty spaced out, presumably for cinematic purposes, and this only serves to cement that last point in people's minds.

I just assumed that a Patronus strong enough to easily repel one dementor would also be able to repel many dementors. Its power seems to radiate in all directions, so it wouldn't need to be divided among them.

***** Resisting the imperius isn't a sign of off-the-charts power either, but it is a sign of something special.

I kinda disagree though. Each Dementor brings their own aura of despair, so it's not unreasonable to assume that it's worse the more there are, and therefore it's harder to fight off.

Then there's the sheer amount of space that that many Dementors cover. To affect them all, the patronus has to radiate enough mojo to reach all of them. Feels like it's reasonable to say that the more powerfully the spell is casted, the more area the patronus can protect.

So while I wouldn't say it's necessarily a sign of an extremely powerful wizard, it could easily be interpreted to mean that it was an extremely powerfully cast patronus.

** I think you're missing the point.

Most authors think the Imperius excuse is weak for several reasons:

1. In their canon you need to make a conscious, willing choice to join the Death Eaters and accept the Dark Mark by performing some sort of horrible ritual (usually torturing muggles).
2. How likely is it that someone was under the Imperius for years (remember that the first war started in the 60's and only ended in the late 70's) and not suffer some sort of brain damage or personality shift? Just look at Barty Crouch Jr.
3. It's a good excuse, it makes people uncomfortable by bringing up ghosts from the war so they don't tend to think too much about it lest it brings up bad memories for them. It's why the kids of Harry's age are much more critical about it since to them the war was just a distant memory of their parent's time.

*** I'm not sure if the first point is canon or fanon. I don't remember anything in the actual books about how the Mark must be earned. Malfoy has the Mark and he's no torturer or killer, as we see from the scene in the Tower.

The second point, Crouch Jr was sane enough to fool pretty much everyone into thinking that he was Moody. He has two moments of weakness, right as he thought he was going to kill Harry and in the grounds near the WC stadium. Other than those moments, he was in a pretty calm state of mind for pretty much the entire time we see him.

**** To the best of my knowledge, canon says nothing about how the Mark is earned; and anything written about it by the fandom is merely a cartoonish overstep in making the Death Eaters look as evil as possible. (I'm pretty sure I read a fic a long time ago that had Draco earn his mark by kicking a puppy to death.)

Yeah, that's why I wrote "In their canon". Torture is just a common trope I've seen used in many fics, the main point was that joining the Death Eaters and getting a Mark should be a privilege, like joining an elite club. It shouldn't be akin to getting press ganged into being a sailor during the 19th century.

There are many forms of madness, psychopaths for example can masquerade as normal, sane people quite well. Watch the movie American Psycho and you'll see what I mean. Barty Crouch Jr. was most definitely insane, whether it happened before he was sent to Azkaban is up to the author but getting held under the Imperius by his dad for years certainly didn't help.

** Are there fics that make the Imperius Curse look weak?

I think the issue with the Imperius used in fanfiction is how an author's worldbuilding will often introduce other types of magic that do similar things, or perform the same function. Love potions, memory re-writing, compulsion charms, magical or mental blocks (as revealed by the Gringotts tests), Horcrux possession, or whatever way Parselmagic is turned into a plot device.

So it's not that Imperius is weakened, it's just made irrelevant to the story, when it was a big deal in the canon. The benefit in using alternatives also allows the author to write a character who can do bad things without passing the moral line of using an Unforgivable Curse.

*** IMO, possession by horcrux ought to be stronger than the Imperius curse, if only because horcruxes are described as the "darkest art".

There was one fic I read that described the possession by Horcrux as nigh on unyeilding. I think it was the Mind Arts, but I can't be sure - Harry chances across the Diary and is completely ensnared by the power of the horcrux's compulsion.

I think that the Imperius is superior to all those other bits of magic that have relatively similar effects because the Imperius is fairly easy to cast and offers complete domination over the victim, even over long distances and long periods of time. Love potions require the victim to be dosed regularly, memory modification only allows for partial control and the horcrux possession requires direct contact with the horcrux.

**** Hermione's character is always very interesting to me. She can perform a spell that is functionally identical to the Imperius (overrides a person's natural willpower and personality), but feels bad about stealing from a muggle supermarket under tHarry's invisibility cloak.

  Hermione had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left) and Harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears.

***** Hermione has quite a simple moral system, she's very black and white even more so than Harry. In Order of the Phoneix she panics at thought of harming a Death Eater that only looks like a child, is horrified at the thought of stealing and disobeying school rules. But for Hermione those same moral compunctions don't extend to things she can justify to herself. Treachery is the ultimate sin, so Marietta is justly punished. Saving her family can only be a good thing so it doesn't matter how she goes about doing it.

Those moral aspects of Hermione, frustrate Harry across the series.
