:END:
I read a piece of fanfiction about a year ago (I think it was on ao3) itwas a femHarry one. I think it was set after 4th year. Any way the main things I remember was that Dumbledore was given a treaty by Voldemort to sign and it would prevent/stop any war; I remember one of the terms was that femHarry would have to stay with Voldemort at weekends whilst at Hogwarts and holidays and he gave her a portkey that would transport her. There was a bit about femHarry using occlumency to keep Voldemort out of her head and not realising that it hurt (?) him and when he confronts her about it she denies it can, but when he raised a barrier against her she felt like half of herself was missing and she screams etc. I also think she kept the visits to Voldemort a secret from everyone bar Dumbledore and told people she had training with Dumbledore at the weekend.\\
A lot of detail I know, but for the life of me I cannot find it at all. I'm hoping someone else has/is reading it and can point me in the direction of it. Many Thanks!
