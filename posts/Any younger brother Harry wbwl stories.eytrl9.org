It seems a common trend for Harry to either be twins with the wbwl or the older sibling. Just wondering if there were any stories that deviated from this


** Would it make literally any difference if Harry was the older or younger sibling to the wbwl? Most fic's with WBWL have Harry not raised with his family anyway, so I can't see it changing much.

I'm sorry for not knowing any fics like you want, but if you're just looking for a fic that deviates from the standard WBWL tropes, Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi is a good, albeit abandoned, fic.

** I like to think I'm well-versed in the WBWL trope but I haven't come across him being the younger sibling.

** I believe there is linkffn(three black birds), which has Harry as the older brother. I haven't read far enough, but it could be that the younger brother actually is the bwl.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.
