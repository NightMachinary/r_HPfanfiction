I'm in the mood to read some stories where a character has either a physical or mental disability or something different about them.

Be it blind, mute, deaf, or a variety of different things (doesn't have to be that, it can be autism or anything else).

Am fine with any pairings (doesn't have to have a pairing in it).

What I would not rather have: Not looking for super powered Harry in the story. Would rather NOT have Weasley bashing, if possible.

It can be Harry as the one, or someone else entirely.


** linkffn(12744735;11637611)

These two stories were recently recommended in a thread about fem Harry stories, in both the main character does have a physical disability. One of the stories has a mute fem Harry, in the other story she is blind in one eye.

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right? (FemHarry)

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** If you're willing to give epistolary a shot, then Text Talk is fantastic. It's a slash Remus/Sirius fic set in the muggle world.

The disability is uncovered in the fic itself. Remus Lupin has Cystic Fibrosis.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1651109/chapters/3501239]])

The author has another fic called Trash Boys with a different condition HIV but I didn't enjoy it as much. That said, this fic is less about the condition.

A third Remus/Sirus fic with Deafness and epilepsy. Written by a CODA, so the portrayal of Deafness is accurateI didn't go looking for that pairing or set it the muggle universe, it just seems very common for this genre.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4787432/chapters/10954928]])

Those three are the most recent three, after exhausting my usual channels and forgetting to bookmark things. These ones could be decent but might not be.

First Year with an initially undiagnosed epileptic Harry Potter.

linkao3( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20407870/chapters/48408682]] )

First year with autistic Harry linkao3( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1009469/chapters/2003090]])

I can't think of any others off the top of my head, although there is a fic with a young Harry and an audiologist Remus Lupin out there somewhere.
