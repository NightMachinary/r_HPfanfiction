What historical essays (or novels) do you recommend reading to better understand the dynamics, political and military tactics of the Death Eaters?

Some ideoligues or groups that are historically comparable.


** In all honestly, I would advise researching cults, more so than military organizations, like the SS for instance. Slightly stretching it, but also read up on how KKK functions (or used to function back when they were still lynching and burning crosses).

** i mean, they're comparable to the kkk/neo-nazis, but the best way to understand the death eaters is to read about how they are in the books and from whatever jkr's written or said about them. they're their own specific group with their own specific dynamics

** Everyone and their mother compares them to Nazis, but they're not. They've really got nothing in common other than having a case of the Big Racism, and even then, not in the same way. As far as I can tell, they're closer to the KKK in ideology, and prior to coming into power, structured like a drug cartel or some other minor organized crime syndicate. I don't know any perfect fits off the top of my head, but I'd start by looking into white nationalist gangs for their internal dynamics, and drug cartels for their political and social influence, as well as their military tactics.

*** The whole Muggleborn commission and its "scientific" and legal bases are a ripoff of the NÃ¼rnberg Laws (1935) and the underlying Social-Darwinism.

The overall tactics used by the Death Eaters are very similar to the Sturmabteilung.

The Snatcher Squads are a mixture between Gestapo and SD, or SS squads sweeping occupied territories.

The failed first attempt and lax punishment are parallels to the Hitler-Ludendorf Coup of 1923.

There are way more parallels beyond "Big Racism"

** Don't they literally get pissed and go attack some muggles in the Quidditch World Cup?

I am not entirely sure what military tactics you expect them to employ. They charge in and throw spells. The enemy holds their line and throws spells back.

I haven't seen any "strategy" of any sorts in the books except for the maneuvering to gain allies, and even them it was mostly approaching some monsters and saying "ay lmao lets go kill muggles and blood traitors. I swear I won't turn on you later, despite my ideology of pureblood supremacy and how everyone else is impure and worthless", gaining the allegiance of giants, acromantulas and werewolves somehow, considering that the death eaters were massive bigots.

But those are the decadent post-Voldemort Death Eaters who are just trying to have a spot of "fun" without seriously trying to learn the War. Barty Crouch Jr, who on the other hand is much more concerned with actually upholding his Master's legacy, keeping the old ways alive, and if possible even ready the world for V's return, is very vocal that these so-called Death Eaters are unworthy of the name.

**** Yeah, but you can literally count those guys in one hand. And most of them spent years in Azkaban, so they aren't all there in the head (not that they were before).

There is a difference between subterfuge and military tactics. Crouch Jr. was a decent infiltrator (despite the fact that he kept taking swigs in front of everyone) but that is all they showed of him.

I stand by what I said that there is not really a single moment in the original works were "strategy" was really used in a fight situation.

There was the eventual plan to trick each other, but it usually went downhill and they winged it.

***** I'm not saying it's shown; what I'm saying is that it's /implied/, by way of a "true" Death Eater like Barty considering the World Cup attackers pathetic shadows of their former selves, that the attack on the World Cub is not a good standard from which to extrapolate the likely behavior of First War-era Death Eaters.

As for Barty's frequent swigs, I take that to be "hiding in plain sight". He had to do it so often it was unlikely he'd never be caught, so might as well make a habit of being seen drinking foul-smelling ale in public, and no one will be the wiser if they see you hurriedly gulping down a flask of /something/ at an inappropriate time.

Not really. They staged a coup and took the Ministry in an afternoon. The Order might claim otherwise, but they were defeated and forced into hiding that day. There were no open battles or large-scale acts of sabotage. The Muggleborn commission was not bombed, Azkaban not assaulted, Death Eaters not hunted. All the order managed was a radio show and some form of militia which could be called upon for an uprising. They were the Resistance or Armia Krajowa, not the Red Army slugging it out with the Germans in Stalingrad.

****** Even then it did not look like a civil war. There are two or three known Death Eater casualties (Moody) in exchange for two thirds of the Order. The Ministry was about to fall when Voldemort was defeated by Lily. That still sounds more like the German invasion of the Netherlands or the defeat of an insurgency and not like a civil war.

******* I wasn't thinking of the "civil war" as between the Order and the Death Eaters, but rather as between the /Ministry/ and the Death Eaters. Crouch Senior's Aurors were authorized to use Unforgivables, which I think goes to show they weren't messing around. I imagine the casualties were a lot more numerous on both /these/ sides than they were from the Order/Death Eater skirmishes.

**** The Nazis tried a coup first. The fought in the streets in the 1920s. Hitler was even sent to prison after the coup failed. They had uniforms and classified people according to their blood. And once they took the power - which came with oppressing the opposition and murdering rivals - they started an all-out war. But most important: They started a genocide, as did the Death Eaters. Really, trying to treat the Death Eaters as mere neo-Nazis or KKK-members is wrong - they are the real deal wizard Nazis.

***** Oh, they're certainly more like Nazis than they are like the KKK --- the KKK comparison is, I think, more accurate to speak of the post-Voldemort, decadent Death Eaters as seen at the World Cup.

What I'm saying however, is that while there are heavy parallels, they're not /quite/ Nazis either; a coup and a takeover are two different things, even if the end results look basically the same, for example.

Mostly, I don't think Lord Voldemort ever maintained pretenses of being the legitimate government of the British Wizarding people, in the way Hitler claimed (and, rather likely, /believed/) he was doing what was best for Germany's interests. To my mind, Voldemort just made it clear that he was a living war machine and he was going to Sauron the heck out of England whatever you did, so you might as well join him... and there might be something in it for you and your causes if you did, too.

The Death Eaters were also not organized like a military, as far as we know --- wizarding "armies" never are, at the end of the day. The closest Muggle equivalents are cultists, but that's not really on the mark either, and neither is the frequently-cited "terrorists" comparsion. They're just... they're Dark Wizards. It just doesn't exist in the Muggle world.

****** I think the best comparison would be the Sturmabteilung (SA), the Nazi streetfighting gang of the late 20s and 30s, who used terror tactics, intimidation, hits on undesirable stores (like you see in Diagon in HBP) and generally assaulting their opponents. The police and justice system often turned a blind eye because they were sympathetic to the cause or afraid of defiling them. And you see the Ministry do just that.
