I love fics where muggles observe Harry and the others from the outside and end up drawing their own conclusions.

Sort of along the lines of the novel-length [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] or the oneshot [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6519436/1/Criminality][Criminality]].

Does anyone know of any other fics like these?


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5538558/1/In-Which-the-Princess-Rescues-the-Dragon][In Which the Princess Rescues the Dragon]] by Vera Rozalsky includes scenes in which a muggle psychiatrist/therapist observes and treats a group of war survivors including Harry.

  Post-DH. The line between politics and family is razor-thin, especially when you're a daughter of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black. Following the Battle of Hogwarts, Andromeda Tonks receives a condolence note from a surprising source.

** I posted [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071][Strength of Steel Wings]] a few days ago.

Slight spoiler as it gradually reveals this over the first few chapters, with some hints of it early on, but the premise is that Harry is kicked out by the Dursleys at the age of 8 and adopted by an older Muggle who is investigating the Wizarding world (he is not aware that Harry is a wizard initially).

** Here's one for you. It's a short, humorous piece set during a birthday part for Harry and Ginny's daughter Lily. Dudley and his kids are guests. Full disclosure: I'm the author.
