Looking for any sort of story where Snape and Harry decide to work for themselves instead of Voldemort/Dumbledore.

Preferably no slash.

I don't think "friends" is the correct term with this story. But they do eventually work together amiably and respect each other.

#+begin_quote
  AU after OoTP, a few HBP details. An obsessed, grieving Harry has decided on a dangerous way to defeat Voldemort. Snape is paying closer attention than before, but his contempt for Harry blinds him. Eventual Snape as Harry's guardian story. COMPLETE
