You could also treat it like a fic request.

I've never seen this before. Seems kinda interesting.


** ...I just now realised how /bizarre/ it is that Peter Pettigrew was able to find Voldemort, help him build his baby form, hide out in Little Hangleton for most of a year and help orchestrate a plot to kidnap Harry and restore Voldemort's body...\\
When Dumbledore, who already knew about Voldemort being in Albania, was unable to take the time to locate and apprehend the spectre of the dark lord (or ask some Aurors to do it), and apparently didn't learn of the move to Little Hangleton until it was too late.

*** I /assume/ that the Dark Mark was used to locate Voldemort. I also suspect that as long as he was not embodied, containing him would be a futile endeavor. After all, Voldemort was able to flee after the confrontation with Harry at the end of /Philosopher's Stone/.

**** Fair enough. I suppose Horcruxes wouldn't make Voldemort or any other dark lord/lady such a threat if you could just bottle up their spirit and bury it somewhere.

...Although that /would/ make for an interesting story; an ancient dark magician whose horcrux/es are long lost somewhere in the geologic record, is released from their long-forgotten prison, and sets out to bring destruction to the world once more. Harry Potter X The Mummy?

I just imagined the Ghost Busters theme going with this.

**** I'm almost sure he was able to locate him because Voldemort was eating rats and wormtail could talk to rats and they were like "we avoid this place"

******** I just checked the passage again and Voldemort wasnt eating rats. He was possessing them. That's why they were avoiding the area.

********** >His filthy little friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them

so i think he was possessing more than just snakes
