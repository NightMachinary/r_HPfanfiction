So, the fic I'm looking for was actually rec'd here a year or so ago. I haven't been able to find it via google or reddit search.

It was posted on livejournal, I think? The fic was a Tom/Minerva pairing, with Tom being a good guy who never became Lord Voldemort. Tom and Minerva teach at Hogwarts. Dumbledore was taking "For the Greater Good" to a crazy manipulative insane level where he was basically a Dark Lord. I think Grindelwald might have still been alive in this fic? But Dumbledore had an Auror like group of mercenary types called his Greater Good or something... and Minerva and Tom were trying to stop Dumbledore's overcorrections. Dumbledore's Greater Good was a huge theme through this story.

It was intended to be a three-part series, and the first two chapters had been posted. The first two chapters were thoroughly unique and well-written. I was kinda hoping to re-read and see if the story had been finished.

Any ideas?

edit:

[[/u/someorangegirl]] has re-rec'd this fic. Please read it, it is wonderful! A snippet:

#+begin_quote
  The noise Gellert makes is worn and ancient, but he raises the wand anyway, cries "Expecto Patronum!" like it's the Killing Curse. And, on that front, perhaps it is; the wolverine that tumbles out glows white, and then red, before it snarls.
#+end_quote

And, follow on through to [[http://gyzym.livejournal.com/109306.html][Part 1]]. Still no part 3, sadly, but well worth the read regardless.


** I rec'd this here way back when :) It's on gyzym's livejournal, part 1: [[http://gyzym.livejournal.com/109306.html][Living on Wildfires]]. Sadly, it looks like it hasn't been updated with a part three--I think she's writing a book now.

Edit: It's also on AO3 - [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/619228/chapters/1117296]]

*** YESSSS. Ok, so I couldn't remember if the reddit user who rec'd it or the author had "orange" in the username... But I actually tried searching with "/orange/" as a search term to see if that would pull it up. xD

Anyway, thanks!
