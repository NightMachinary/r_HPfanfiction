Anyone else think this is acceptable in stories:

"I am Lord Hadrian Potter Black Peverell Slytherin Gryffindor Ravenclaw Hufflepuff Emrys"

I cringe so hard I actually /recoil/ away from my screen. Why do people keep on doing this? It's really not as cool or impressive as the author thinks it is. Not only is the name ridiculous, but that's not even how inheritance works. Like so what if some daughter of Slytherin married into the Peverell line who then married into the Potter family centuries ago. Naming conventions and inheritance has already been established both in the real world and in HP. You don't see Draco calling himself 'Draco Malfoy Black', even though he has a better claim to the family than Harry does. And keep in mind, most of the time, the MC is somewhere between 11-17 years old when they say shit like this. I'd never be able to take some kid seriously if he said something like this at the start of a conversation.

Seriously, this is weird. Please stop. It's not as cool or impressive as you think it is. Whenever I read something like this, it makes me think the author unironically wears a fedora because they think its cool.


** Definitely cringe but I honestly think the people who write these stories are actual preteens writing for the first time or something. There's no way for me verify that lol but I just avoid those stories ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

** Oh yeah, definitely a turn off.

I can stand the lordships or nobility if they can write things where it makes sense in context, like a relatively minor AU where the Potters have a title or where Harry gets one through the Blacks or whoever.

Double-barrel surnames are also something I can deal with if it makes sense in context, like getting adopted and keeping his parents' family name while adding his adoptive parents' family name or if the character marries and keeps their 'maiden name' ala someone in Justin's family as he's a Finch-Fletchley so it's likely somewhere along the line his ancestors were a Finch and a Fletchley.

Something like Potter-Black or Potter-Lupin or some other variant with Potter and one other name can be viable in the situation of a marriage with the Potter name kept or an adoption where both sets of parents are honoured by having their family names.

Once you start bringing in triple or more barrelled surnames, /especially/ if it involves families that are no longer existent under that name if they exist at all, it's just a 'nope' and back out of the fic.

As far as we know, in canon, Slytherin's family line wound up as 'Gaunt' as the last known magical family before Voldemort claimed the title of heir (him being a Riddle and the first and only child of Merope Gaunt, the only one of her generation of the family to procreate that we know of).

Ravenclaw is the only confirmed family to have a child, but there's no known continuance after Helena, who died at the hands of one of the Baron.

We know */a/* Smith family had relics from Hufflepuff before Voldemort stole them, but I don't recall if there was any confirmation of relation, and the one in question was murdered, so we don't know for sure whether Zacharias Smith is a descendant or not. It's possible, but I don't know of a family tree confirming it.

Gryffindor? He's probably the least know, though a lot of semi-accepted canon is that the Potters and Longbottoms are descendants, likely due to both Harry and Neville pulling his sword from his hat, which I believe is less blood, more attitude.

For Peverell? Well, that's probably the most likely link to older families for Harry or whoever you're replacing him with, mostly due to the Cloak. I doubt there's anything else politically or valuable left that's not already mixed into the Potters' 'fortunes' whatever they may be.

In terms of the changed first name... well, the one good thing is that it's often an indicator that the fic would have gone 'Harry in name only' had the author stuck with the name, but honestly unless you're changing him for a girl, there's not really a reason to mess with his name except to puff yourself up and it's really very much a turn off to reading the fic.

** It's awful.

I always stop reading when it starts like this, and look, I really enjoy reading got-like fanfics about Harry being Lord Black.

Anything else is bullshit and I don't have the patience to read it.

Not even Lord Potter is good, the Potters obviously weren't noble. And Peverell, it would be stupid to assume the name for the simple fact that hundreds of wizards from all over Europe would come after you to see if you have any of the relics...

*** I don't mind the lord stuff so long as it's well written and reasonable. Something like "I am Harry Potter, Lord of House Black" or along similar lines is fine.

It's just that most of the time, the authors don't even stop to think how some of this stuff sounds like out loud. Some of the stuff they write might sound good in their heads, but the moment you speak it out loud you realize how ridiculous it all sounds.

** I could live with the concept of "House of Potter" and maybe house words for long pureblood families... But, the moment someone calls anyone with a nose 'Lord'... I'm usually in out.

** The only way I could justify that is for political reasons. I dont think magic would do this to force someone to carry on the Names, nor do I think you have to have the name to access vaults/hidden properties/repositories of knowledge/magical artifacts. If that was the case, Voldemort wouldve been magically compelled to have kids.

So whoever has all those names is just using them for the shock-and-awe factor, just like Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, Cheif Warlock of the Wizengamot, Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, Grand Sorcerer. That's not even including the masteries he holds in Transfiguration, Charms, Alchemy, Potions, and whatever else.

For those who care about that, it could also be shouting how pureblooded you are without shouting about it.

***** No its probably just the author thinking the MC sounds better as a 'Hadrian' rather than a 'Harry'.

I mean, I kinda get it. They want to have some OP character but Harry is a pretty average name, so they change it to something with more gravitas like Hadrian or Harold. It's not my cup of tea, but I get it.
