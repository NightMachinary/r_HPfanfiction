So, in the process of writing a story and this question has me stumped on how to handle.

In HBP, Snape makes an unbreakable vow to help Draco and kill Dumbledore if the boy cannot. However, Draco has been given this mission as a punishment - it's strongly implied that he's expected to fail and it's basically a death sentence.

By making the vow, Snape has also been handed a death sentence. Of course, he's more competent than a 16 year old boy but it would be hard to argue he's a match for Dumbledore.

So, do you think Voldemort learns of the vow during the course of HBP?

​

I would think Voldemort would be pretty irritated that one of his high ranking death eaters and his one spy within Hogwarts is compromised by this. And, the language of the vow technically leaves a loophole ("/Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts to fulfil the Dark Lord's wishes?') -/ if Voldemort changed his orders to Draco, he could spare Snape. Why wouldn't he just do this?

Or, is Snape not considered a high-ranking death eater until after he kills Dumbledore? Does Voldemort decide that he'd rather Snape be forced to prove himself by killing Dumbledore at the risk of probably losing his spy?

Is this answered anywhere in the books? I just reread most of HBP and I still don't think it's clear.

(Or is this one of those things we're supposed to not think about? Like, similarly, why doesn't Voldemort just order Snape to kidnap Harry so he can kill him.)

** Doesn't seem like he knew. He said Snape had been loyal to him. My best guess is Bellatrix didn't snitch since it was her sister who got Snape to do it, and besides if Snape succeeded then Voldemort's greatest obstacle was gone.

*** Bellatrix snitching wouldn't be in her best interest anyway, since she basically forced Snape into it.

** Voldemort was so insane at times in the books it's hard to really figure out what he would do or think. But from what I get out of it, my personal opinion... Voldemort probably didn't trust Snape completely until he killed DDore(I wouldn't have) so even if he did hear of it (probably did but wasn't mentioned) if I was Voldemort I'd probably be stoked that My Spy who I didn't know I could trust, just took an unbreakable vow to kill one of the biggest thorns in my side
