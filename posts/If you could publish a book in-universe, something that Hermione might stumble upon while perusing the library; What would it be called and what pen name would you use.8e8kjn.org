***** That's one way to look at it, but there are ways to make Bill & Co. into more likable characters. For instance, perhaps part of their motivation is to remove all those nasty ancient curses before nosy /Muggle/ archeologists find the tombs and get obliterated like those poor Carter Expedition people. And it's not like we know just what Gringotts /do/ with all those artifacts; for all we know (and with their love of fine craftsmanship I could really see it) they respectfully place it all in a large, academic Goblin National Museum of Wizarding istory.
