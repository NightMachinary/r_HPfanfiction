It's 3-4 chapters, I can't remember the name but it may have been something like “Improbable”?

Specifics: in the first task he enters the arena and transfigures rock into a chair and Accios a book down for him to read. Doesn't go anywhere near the dragon. Similarly in the second task he dives into the water, comes back up and pulls out an inflatable raft chair and just chills on top of the lake for an hour.

Can't remember the rest but I know it was hilarious

** Sorry, don't know the fic. But as an aside, chances are that the Triwizard rules would include a clause (express or implied) that participants try to win. Such terms are common in contracts and routinely enforced. Similarly, the rules of sporting competitions generally do not permit teams to "throw" games.

There are even different recognised levels of trying (subject always to the particular terms of the contract, read as a whole). In simple terms:

#+begin_quote
  Endeavour = token effort is enough.

  Reasonable endeavours = you have to genuinely try.

  All reasonable endeavours = you have to genuinely try and keep trying until you have exhausted all reasonable avenues.

  Best endeavours = you have to try so hard that you are expected to sacrifice your own benefit to achieve the goal.

In terms of competition laws - Bagman cheats the Twins and they never get their money back or mention a Ministry way to mediate/get compensation for the issue, so we know they don't probably really have security laws aside from 'death by Goblin'. Mayhaps they don't have 'effort' terms like that either?

Which does leave the loophole of someone tricking Vernon into entering Harry on Harry's behalf, which might sort-of hold up (the age restriction should still kill the contract).

Well, possibly. But Common Law relies on things having 'come up' in the past and laws being made then. Someone has to make a law and forbid a thing, right? If everyone in Ye Olde Magical Britain had gone all in on the Tournament, then there might never have been a law made and thus it'd be perfectly legal. I mean, owning a slave was technically legal in England until 2010, while trading them was made illegal in the 1800s. If stuff doesn't come up, we really don't get to it quickly.

EDIT - For anyone rereading this in the future, I checked - did a lot of reading of some really dry historical legal texts and more mercifully modern analyses - and Taure is correct here. Ignore everything I say about Slavery being legal or not criminalised, I was operating on some odd misunderstandings of centuries-old legal structures. :D

#+end_quote

Definitely not the case. Even during the height of the slave trade, owning a slave was illegal /inside/ Britain. There are various cases from the 16th to 18th centuries where courts freed slaves on the basis that there was no legal basis for slavery in English law. The cases use various phrases of a similar type: to set foot on English soil makes you free; to breathe English air makes you free.

The problem, of course, was not the law itself but access to the justice system. Which is the same problem as today with modern slavery.

******* It's really more of a quibble than anything else. Mostly depends on your philosophical and practical definitions of illegal and legal. I'll explain that as I go, it's easier to demonstrate with examples.

From what I understand of the situation, the previous cases of slavers being penalised or punished had criminals charged with the things that lead to slavery, but never slavery itself. False imprisonment, assault, trafficking, even owning a person, etc, but never was anyone charged using the term 'slavery'. It's true that slavery was technically illegal, in that most of the things you'd have to do to get a slave and keep one were illegal, but the actual charge of 'enslaving a person' didn't exist. It was 'technically' legal, just not practically. In a case around 2010, we realised that having all the separate laws might've worked, but it was ridiculously impractical and thus combined the lot. We ignored the problem until it became one, then we fixed it. That was the point I was originally trying to make. Our legal system is almost entirely made up of things enshrined into law through that pattern. Ignore an issue, see it become a problem, then make a law to forbid it.

And technically those cases of freeing slaves were never done on the grounds that slavery was illegal, only that it wasn't legally recognised. Again, only a technical distinction, but an important one in English law at the time. We have a thing called 'Positive Laws' that give people rights or specify actions you can/must do - think the 'you have the right to bear arms' in the second amendment(?), as a good example of the format. If you are/do A, then you can be/do B, basically. That's how the US established slavery as a thing, and we never had any of those positive laws on slavery. Essentially, you couldn't enforce the right of one person to own another (or rather, to apply chattel property law to a person). That's what it means when there's 'no legal basis to support' something in English Law. It doesn't mean the practice is illegal, only that it isn't legal.

(Oh, and the ruling of the Mansfield case you're (and they're) quoting essentially was that people cannot be removed from England against their will, but the judge was quoted as saying he believed that property rights could not be attributed to people except by positive law, but he never put that into his ruling.)

The lacking distinction of slavery as a separate thing arose from Norman times (1100 ish) when they took advantage of the Irish-Icelandic fights over Slavery to abolish the trade of slaves and the networks there just sort of fell apart and the slaves melted into the serfs of the feudal system and the clarification was never really made from there as it was never needed. Again, ignore the issue until it becomes a problem, then make laws on it. We're big on that pattern here.

Apologies for the long message, but if I'm wrong please do correct me. I'm always happy to learn!

******** The word you're looking for is "criminal". To call something illegal is to say it is contrary to law, but this is a much larger class of things than those with a criminal offence attached.

Many actions are unlawful without being criminal - the entire class of actions known in English law as torts, such as trespass, false imprisonment, conversion, etc., which are civil rather than criminal wrongs.

Slavery within Britain has always been illegal - which is to say, a civil wrong which courts would correct if asked to do so - but it has not always been a criminal offence.

The distinction between "illegal" and "not legally recognised" doesn't really exist when it comes to slavery. Rather, detaining a person against their will is prima facie illegal (unlawful imprisonment), and can only be justified by a lawful excuse (i.e. if slavery had been legally recognised, it would have created an exception to the illegality).

As for "positive law": the default assumption of English law is that of liberty, i.e. all things are permitted until they are prohibited by law. In English law, you don't need positive law to give you rights: rather, positive law is required to /take away/ rights. In the case of slavery, a positive law would have been required to displace the common law right of all people to habeas corpus.

********* Wouldn't Habeas Corpus (at that general time) only be applicable if they were regarded as English Citizens? ie. If you kidnapped someone from another country, then brought them here, would they still be protected by Habeas Corpus?

I am most definitely neither solicitor or lawyer, so this is all just my layman understanding of stuff I've picked up here and there over the years and I can't really repudiate or question or confirm anything you've said with what I currently know. I'd take your word for it, but like me you're a random voice on the internet and I have no idea if you're right or not. Though I'm getting the feeling I may have misunderstood something somewhere, so I'm gonna try and find where I've likely mis-stepped. I think I might've misunderstood the 2010 thing as filling a gap where slavery was never criminalised or tort-illegal rather than taking the common law into statutes/codified law.

I can't tell if that last paragraph comes off in an offensive manner or not, but I am definitely not intending to be insulting or anything. I just think it's very silly to take anything someone on the internet says as gospel without doing some work to verify/substantiate it. This is something that'll take me a while to look into and I feel it'd be rude for me to leave a response any longer, hence me making this conclusion-less response now.

******* True. I make a lot of semi-extrapolated assumptions to fill in gaps of stuff I don't know/can't remember until I can find/be corrected with the right answer. Like, I would assume that most of our changing governments would've instituted new laws each time we were conquered or our national structure changed (eg. the integration of Scotland and Wales and beginning of the UK rather than simply England). The Normans did institute their laws over the older English laws in the 11th century, so it's possible. I'm not sure how those transitions occurred though, nor how they might differ in magical society.

Also, it's possible that 'consent' differs in some magical sense - perhaps Harry resigning himself to taking part counted at consent? And if being told that being told that your name being in the goblet counted as 'informing', then it's possible he also wouldn't be able to claim he was tricked into 'signing' either.

And if memory serves, UK Common Law and English Common Law aren't necessarily the same thing, so perhaps one covers it and not the other, and that one was never adopted by magical people?

If nothing else, we know their legal system isn't necessarily like ours, given their apparent government-influence in the Prophet and general libel/slander behaviours.

I am most definitely neither solicitor or lawyer, so this is all just my layman understanding of stuff I've picked up here and there over the years. I'll be poking around over the next week or so to try and see what I can find on this and the slavery pre-2010-illegality note, so hopefully I'll be able to find something.

I did, however, recall some Irish myth about geases: those most certainly did /not/ require anything like informed consent, and were quite binding, as well as being explicitly magical. They are probably a better basis for how magical contracts work.

Unfortunately, that memory is someone telling me about them, so I have no reference to share.

For instance, it does not care that Harry hasn't yet reached majority -- the Age Line had to be added on top, and isn't actually part of the binding contract. So it isn't post-1600 -- it's more like maybe post-1200 or something, whenever the Triwizard Tournament was first introduced.

***** Fair point. But it's possible they added a second set of laws in addition to the magical ones on the Cup. Like the cup gives the basics "Put names in the cup, I pick the competitors" and then there's some legal thing somewhere that says "If you are a competitor in the triwizard tournament, then you must do A, B, and C". Probably not, and they probably just left it at the Cup's rules and called it a day, but Harry was so oblivious he could've signed a dozen documents without really making note of it to us.
