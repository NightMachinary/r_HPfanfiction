Harry doesn't believe that he is a wizard, due to Dudley's presence.

Or...

Nullifying the magic of the dementors, Dudley delivers the ol' one-two to their faces.

Or...

When Dudley reaches a certain age, all of Magical Britain find themselves unable to perform magic, including one Lord Voldemort.


** That's Vernon, not Dudley. Just to the contrary, when Dudley leaves for Smeltings and distances himself from his father, he finds out that he is actually magical.

** This is an interesting concept. But once someone figured out what was happening, Dudley would end up in the middle of nowhere extremely quickly. Or, more likely, dead. Voldemort would never allow a being so dangerous to him to live. He would probably get out of the magical nullifying range and then hire some assassin muggles to do the job. Then kill the assassin muggles so no one would no he had to hire muggles.

** There is a Spanish fic, "Alianza". There, Dudley is a wizard but his only power is having "a very hard head", meaning, he can resist Obliviate and Legeremens.
