What is the name of the trope where Harry's only friends are girls. Sample for the trope the fanfiction "Breath of the Inferno"


** If Harry is the main character, the trope you're looking for is [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarringSmurfette][Starring Smurfette]]. If he's not, it's [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneGuy][The One Guy]]. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple][The Smurfette Principle]] is the same thing with the genders reversed.

And if they are more than just friends, there are plenty of harem tropes that might apply.

**** No, it's because the kind of wish fulfillment fics where Harry's friends are Hermione, Luna, Daphne and Susan where they all act in uncomfortably sexual ways for their age are USUALLY written by men

***** I am a man. I don't write anything with these harem-ish kind of things. I have seen them though and can agree those mostly written by men.

******* Fortunately, not this one, but I met couple of stories, where we find out very soon, that Grangers are all in fact nudists.
