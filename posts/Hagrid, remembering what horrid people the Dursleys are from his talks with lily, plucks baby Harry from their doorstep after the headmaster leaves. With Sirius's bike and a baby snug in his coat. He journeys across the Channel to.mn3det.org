** Hagrid hopped on Sirius' bike once more and looked at the house where Dumbledore had put little Harry.

"Good man, that Dumbledore." he muttered, looking towards the witch and wizard as they disapperated.

Minerva had told him a little about what she had seen from the muggles as Albus settled Harry in. It wasn't good or flattering... And that wasn't including what Lily had told him in the past nine years he had known her and James.

"He's a good man, Albus Dumbledore is." Rubeus said again, a little louder to himself as he started up the motor bike. It barely hummed and he couldn't feel the vehicle shake beneath him at all.

Lily had often came to him, crying over losing her sister, ever since first year. Petunia had been happy at first... Then came the realization that Petunia wasn't a witch too. Hagrid felt for the poor girl, he too was stuck looking into a magical society he wasn't allowed to fully be a part of. But where he had remained optimistic and jovial, Lily's sister had grown jealous and hateful.

He still remembered her seventh year, when Lily had come crying to him that first night because no one else would understand. Petunia had slapped her and called her a freak that had gotten their parents killed just before Lily had left for school...

He wasn't sure if they had spoken at ALL since then.

"Albus Dumbledore is a good man," he declared loudly to the night, "But even good men make mistakes." and with that he was off the bike and scooping up Harry. "It's going to be ok Harry..... Ain't nobody gunna hurt you. Even if I gotta fly across the Channel to keep you safe."

With naught but two large strides the giant was back at his bike and had put little Harry back into the side car, fitting the one year old like a bassinet for an infant. And with little more than a brief rev of the engine, the pair were gone into the southern sky.

*** This is perfect. It illustrates Hagrid's respect for Dumbledore, but doesn't cliche it down to 'Dumbledore is perfect' and makes it more nuanced.

Presuming there's no bullshit 'Dumbledore can magically find Harry anywhere (there has to be a limit to that deluminator)' I could see Hagrid being safe in France and Harry not being discovered for a long time.

** This is such an interesting idea. - I'd love to see a Hagrid-raises-Harry story. I am not 100% sure Hagrid would make the most responsible guardian (loving? Sure. Responsible? Uhmmm...), but even that could create some interesting story material.

The only problem is that Hagrid is unquestionably, completely, loyal to Dumbledore, and going against his wishes (to the point of fleeing the country even), seems so very out of character for him.

Hmmm, maybe that /is/ why he is moving, though. He feels lousey for taking the kid, but at the same time feels like he cannot /not/ take him. But now he does not know how to face Dumbledore and tries to avoid that confrontation not because he is suspicious of Dumbledore or anything like that, but because he just cannot deal with seeing dissapoinment in the older man's eyes.

** Hagrid revved the bike to life, and took off. He waited until he heared the tell tale sounds of apparation, before circling back to pick up the shivering bundle on the step of Number 4 Privet Drive.

"As good o' a man as Dumbledore is, it ain't right to leave such a little tyke out in the cold like this. Why... Lily" he sniffled as he continued to speak, almost trying to refrain from crying "she always said her sister was the worst gal ye ever did see. She, yer mum, little Harry, showed me some of them letters yer aunt sent. They were horrible, nasty things, and I reckon she'd be horrible to you. So, I do belive I'll be takin' ya with me, and I'll do my best to keep ya safe." Hagrid tucked the little bundle back into the modified side car, and flew off into the night, soon becoming a blink of light in the distance. Petunia was not startled when she walked out the next morning to get the milk bottles, and all the cupboard was used for was to stash away more junk of Dudley's.

Harry and Hagrid adopted new identities, Hagrid now going by Rory Haward, and Harry became Louis Cooper. 'Louis' grew up around interesting, sometimes dangerous creatures, thanks to Rory, like wood nymphs, thestrals, hippogriffs, dugbogs, and nogtails. Animals were attracted to him, loved him, and found they could easily communicate with the young boy. He became fluent in French, as did Rory, thanks to Madame Maxime, the half giant headmistress of Beauxbatons.

"Bonjour, petit Louis. Comment vas-tu aujord'hui?" inquired the woman, as she walked down the large expanse of field to the little cottage on the outskirts of the grounds.

"Bonjour, Madame Maxime. Je vais bien aujord'hui, comment allez vous?" The rather tall, lanky boy asked, as he pushed his glasses up his nose.

"Ah, très bien. Je me sens merveilleux, comme le temps est beau, n'est-ce pas?" Madame Maxime had finally reached the small house, pulling to a stop near Louis.

" Le temps est magnifique. Rory dit qu'il s'attend à ce que nous ayons plus de jours ensoleillés bientôt."

"Ce serait merveilleux, mais je crois que les prévisions météorologiques de Rory sont un peu erronées, non?" She gestured to the dark clouds rolling in on the horizon, chuckling at how horribly Rory could predict the weather. "Dites-moi, où est Monsieur Haward, j'ai une question pour lui." 1/?

** Hagrid was just about to start his bike again when he heard Harry cry. Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall had already Disapparated and Hagrid was alone on the street. Alone and in doubt. Could he leave a baby out in the cold? And not just any baby, but the child of his friends Lily and James. It didn't take long for Hagrid to make a decision. As much as he respected professor Dumbledore, he simply could not leave a baby in the cold to freeze to death. He could not live with himself if he did. Decision made Hagrid got off the bike, picked Harry up and flied away into the night.

After a few minutes of the cold air hitting his face, he could think a bit more clearly. Staying in Britain was out of the question. Dumbledore would find him in less than a day. Hagrid wasn't worried- he knew Dumbledore would not harm him. He couldn't face the disappointment on Dumbledore's face and he also knew Harry would be left with those horrible muggles again. Hagrid briefly contemplated settling in Siberia and starting his very own dragon reserve. After indulging in that dream Hagrid realised that the harsh winters and giant fire-breathing creatures would not be conducive to raising a child. He then remembered visiting rural France some years ago to attend a Jump (and Fly) race of Abraxans and meeting madam Maxime. (The flying horses although large were surprisingly agile and quick). But more importantly than horse racing- would madam Maxime take Harry in? Would France be far enough from Dumbledore?

***

The next morning classes at Beauxbatons were disrupted by a very strange appearance. A half- giant soaked through (it had rained over The Channel), clutching a small bundle that was somehow still dry, was banging his fists on the chateau's gate. The headmistress promptly exited the building, wand drawn, and ordered the students inside and the teachers to bar the door and protect the students.

“/Who are you and what is your business here?/” asked the headmistress harshly.

“Can you speak English? My French is a bit rusty.” Hagrid answered jovially undeterred by the severe look on the woman's face.

“Who are you and what do you want?” madam Maxime repeated her question.

“Good morning, I am Hagrid. We met several years ago at the races. I work at Hogwarts” he was trying to look presentable, but hesitated “I ‘ave come to ask you to take this child and protect it. His parents were murdered by the Dark Lord”

Madam Maxime's expression softened somewhat, but her voice remained firm: “If you are monsieur ‘Agrid then what was I wearing when me met?”

Hagrid had to rack his brain hard to remember that sunny afternoon he spent in Maxime's company. “A green dress with a Beauxbatons badge and a white hat, madam” he answered. This reassured Maxime it was really Hagrid and besides that the effects of Polyjuice on giants and half-giants were notoriously... unpleasant. And so, she invited them into her office.

***

“So he is truly gone then? Dead?” Maxime asked excitedly. In the last few months there were several incidents of missing people in the area of Caen. The journalists had had a field day with speculating it was the British Dark Lord branching out.

“Aye, he's gone. For now. Merlin knows what dark magic he possesses. I wouldn't be surprised if he returned one day” Hagrid had tears on his face as he had told Maxime of the fall of the Potters. “That's why I've come here, to ask for your help. Can you take ‘Arry and protect him? I respect professor Dumbledore. But he wanted to leave poor ‘Arry with his muggle relatives. He would have been completely defenceless and ignorant.”

Madam Maxime remained silent for a long time, thinking. “I understand your plight monsieur ‘Agrid. But what do you expect of me? This is a school, not a nursery or kindergarten” The desperation was evident in Hagrid's eyes and it moved her. She continued “Return tomorrow morning and you will have my answer”

Fortunately, Hagrid always carried his money in one of his expendable pockets so he rented a room at a nearby tavern. This proved somewhat difficult as he spoke little French and had to convince the innkeeper he hadn't abducted Harry. Well, he had /technically/ done that, but it was all for the greater good as professor Dumbledore was wont to say. Finding nappies for little Harry and changing them proved a challenge for him, but in the end he succeeded.

/\/***

On the next morning Hagrid, along with Harry, was again sitting in madame Maxime's office and waiting. “Good morning, ‘Agrid. I have good news. I spent yesterday researching how to help you and found a legal precedent. It hasn't been used in a while, but I believe we can grant young Harry “scholastic sanctuary” It would protect Harry until he is off age and allow him to live here.” Maxime explained. Hagrid was very happy to hear that Harry would be safe. He didn't worry for himself too much. He could always find work with his experience and knowledge on animals. Or he could always just lift heavy stuff in construction.

*** The students at Hogwarts were excited to meet the foreigners from Beauxbatons. But what really caught their eyes were the two large figures of the headmistress and Hagrid. The reappearance of their lost hero Harry Potter drew gasps from the crowd. He had been gone for so long that everyone focused on him and not the blonde girl holding his hand. Not being the center of attention was a new, and welcome, experience for Fleur Delacour. She was not going to participate in this tournament as she quite liked her body intact and free from scars. However, madam Maxime had explained she needed Hagrid to tend to the abraxans and everyone knew that where Hagrid went Harry followed. Maxime had offered to write a recommendation letter and introduce Fleur to the famous Charms mistress d'Amboise. The truth was that Maxine didn't have to cajole Fleur too much to come to Scotland. As much as she wanted to become a charms mistress, Fleur also valued her friendship with Harry Potter very much.

She thought to that autumn morning four years ago when she had first met him. Harry, being British and raised by a half-giant was the odd one out and was being bullied by upper year students. Fleur had made a short work of them with a few charms that ensured them an embarrassing visit to the school nurse. Harry had been following her everywhere after that. This had irritated Fleur greatly at first- she already had an annoying little sister and didn't need an annoying little pseudo-brother.

However, as she had come into her Veela heritage Fleur became more and more lonely as the other girls envied her and the boys lusted after her. She found herself enjoying Harry's company more as he seemed unaffected by her changes. He always had a new story about his guardian and the creatures they looked after or a new quidditch move. And thus, Harry and Fleur's friendship started in earnest. The last year had been marked by thoughts that made Fleur blush and worry because Harry was too young and she didn't want to ruin their friendship. And now she had the chance to spend this year personally tutoring Harry. Yes, things were looking good for Fleur Delacour and not even the dismal Scottish climate could dampen her spirits. Harry Potter would be hers before the year was out.

Hagrid, on the other hand, was on pins and needles. He had abandoned professor Dumbledore and taken Harry thirteen years prior. He was amazed, and a little saddened, that no one had ever come to look for Harry. Hagrid had become an apprentice to the local magizoologist and after a few years had saved enough money to open his own veterinary clinic. His gentle nature and vast knowledge of creatures had ensured the success of his business. People from all corners of France came to his clinic with their creatures raging from crups to hippogriffs and thestrals and on one memorable occasion a real dragon egg. After a brief internal struggle Hagrid notified the French ministry so they could transfer the egg to a dragon reserve. Now, he was scheduled to meet with professor Dumbledore at his office after dinner.

***

“Good evening, Hagrid. I am happy to see you in good health after all those years” Dumbledore greeted him later that evening. Hagrid was feeling like a little firstie in the headmaster's office and was surprised at his jovial tone.

“Professor Dumbledore, sir, I can explain” Hagrid began, but was interrupted by the headmaster.

“There is nothing to explain my friend. It is perhaps, I who owes you an apology. I shouldn't have left Harry with his muggle relatives. A year after you... left Vernon Dursley was arrested and sent to prison for embezzlement. They really were the worst sort of muggles” Dumbledore explained and Hagrid felt his fear lessen.

“I... dunno what to say, ‘eadmaster. I expected you'd be angry with me” Hagrid falter.

“I was at first. But on the evening after you left, I had a most enlightening conversation with madam Maxime. She informed me both you and Harry were safe and about the legal precedent she had found.” Dumbledore pretend not to notice the look of astonishment and surprise on Hagrid's face. “I suppose I would have been angry had you taken Harry to a less secure place. But Beauxbatons has centuries old protection and living there would let Harry grow up away from his fame.”

Hagrid felt relief wash over his body. Even after all those years he was afraid he had disappointed and let down Dumbledore. And there was Dumbledore greeting him like an old friend and congratulating him on a job well done. Dumbledore was truly a great man.

The End.

AU: Well, this got a bit longer than intended and I was trying to keep it brief. But I have a few errands to run so I'll just stop here. I'm sorry, but I hate, /hate/ writing accents and halfway through realised I also have no idea how to write Hagrid's dialogue. And I just couldn't keep myself from inserting Fleur in there. And I totally stole the scholastic sanctuary from Philip Pullman, so sorry about that as well.

Edit: Thanks for the award.

*** I /love/ the idea of a Harry raised in France and going to Beauxbatons.

Sadly, it means a lot of OCs, which can be difficult.

Best way, IMO, is to start at the GoF and have flashbacks to how he grew up in France. Thus, you cut down on OCs a lot.

** Hagrid doesn't speak French. He barely speaks English. While the French magicals are less prejudiced than the English ones, the odds against him getting a job at Beauxbatons are huge. Plus he'll be an international criminal who stole a baby and crossed national borders, against the orders of the Holy Dumbledore, in whom Hagrid has total faith. There's way too much OOC here to make this work.

Translation charms. Even if they're not canon, this is fanfiction.

We know nothing about France beyond a little bit about Beauxbatons. For all we know, giants are kept as pets there. Madame Maxime being headmistress despite being half-giant does imply that France is less prejudiced, as you said, and so I don't see why Hagrid would be denied a job for not being fully human.

I'd like to think Dumbledore would understand, unless you're going for an evil/manipulative Dumbledore. Hagrid having faith in Dumbledore is a good point, but Hagrid isn't an idiot. As Dumbledore himself said, “I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being --- forgive me --- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.”

I disagree, but anyways, this is /fanfiction/.

Hagrid was kicked out of Hogwarts partway through third year. Basically he's a seventh-grade dropout, with a snapped wand. Unless he has someone dedicated to casting and recasting non-canon spells on him day after day, that won't work.

He hasn't been all that understanding in the books. Not even of Harry saying he doesn't want to go back to the Dursleys when he's 12 or more. It doesn't seem likely he'd go along with Harry out of the country at 1.

You can take all kinds of twists and turns to force the idea to work, but once your workarounds look like a pretzel it'll be tough to sell. Fanfiction is fanfiction, but if you're rewriting entire characters to make it work the OOC kills SOD.

***** There's supposedly potions as well and anyway, we're completely ignoring the fact that it's possible to learn French. As for Dumbledore, correct me if I'm wrong, but Harry never speaks to Dumbledore about the Dursleys in canon. That's pure fanon, iirc.

****** I don't have the book in front of me, but I'm pretty sure that Harry asks at the end of Book 1 to stay away from the Dursleys, but I could be remembering wrong. I haven't read the books in years.

Regarding French, sure it's possible to learn, but given how bad Hagrid is at English it'd likely take him years to learn, and in the meantime he'd be unemployed in a foreign country with an illegal child.
