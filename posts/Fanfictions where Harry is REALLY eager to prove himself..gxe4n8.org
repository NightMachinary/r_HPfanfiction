Hey guys, send me your best fics where Harry goes looking for trouble because like the hat said, he is REALLY eager to prove himself.\\
Reckless and Brave beyond the healthy limits im searchin for fanfictions where Harry just love challenges, like HIMSELF entering the triwizard tournament just because he wants the eternal glory.\\
Like wanting to face Slytherin's monster because he's eager to test his limits.\\
Like searching for Sirius Black so he can challenge him.\\
The type who faces danger smiling and is pratically a fighting maniac that loves the adrenalline rush of a confront.

BONUS: If in the fic he is the one who sbmited his name to the GoF.\\
BONUS 2: This one is a bit difficult but i would love this adrenalline freak Harry using regularlly the Sword of Gryffindor

NO Fem Harry\\
NO Slash\\
Must be somewhat long, preferable completed.\\
If theres some pairing, i would preffer Harry to be with anyone other than Hermione and Ginny.


** linkffn(Antithesis)

Edit: be careful, it's dark

** Well, the first thing that came to mind was linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slightly Suggestive Handshake), which definitely counts. Great crack.

  In order to increase 'the power the Dark Lord knows not,' Dumbledore gives baby Harry a powerful love potion. This bold move results in...unusual consequences. Witness Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, Boy-Who-Caught-the-Snitch-Two-Times, and Boy-Who-Conquered-Voldemort-But-Did-Not-Kill-Him at his very best...which is considerably less impressive than everyone expects. AU.
