I am having a hard time finding a Hermione/Tom Riddle fic. In the beginning, she is brought to Lord Voldemort by Snape, and LV remembers her from his past and kisses her. She travels back to the 40s, and she ends up in a relationship with Tom Riddle. I also remember that she ends up pregnant. The biggest aspect of the story is that the events of the future often change, and LV sends a letter and a ring back to his younger self. I've described it as best as I can. Anybody know it?


** Ok, I found it. Must have been offline for awhile as its description says that it has been re-uploaded. It's called "All the Wrong Choices" by LadyBaelish1127 on FF.net.
