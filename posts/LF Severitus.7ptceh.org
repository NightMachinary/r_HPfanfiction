  It is only days later -- four, to be exact -- that Severus feels a twinge of something in his gut. He's carefully bottling potions when it hits, the desire for mist against his skin, dark ryegrass beneath his feet. A small boy with green eyes standing at his toes. [Sequel to What it Is.]

** These are not "Severitus's" so to speak as most of them are Snape-adopts-harry or Snape-mentors-Harry, one of them is Snape is Harry's Uncle, but I love that entire genre (including Severitus), so here's my list of favorites for now (It's being added to, I forgot alot of the ones I used to love! D:)

  Voldemort is dead but Harry Potter's problems are far from over. Indeed, the very day after the battle, Harry Potter looks into a mirror and finds himself staring at a stranger and an old secret is brought to light. And what does this have to do with Severus Snape, still alive (unfortunately, as far as Snape is concerned) after being dragged out of the Shrieking Shack?

#+begin_quote
  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
