To any who are currently writing, or plan to write Fanfics. Lose- When an object or person that was previously present is no longer. Loose-A word to describe pants that are too big.

Damn-An expletive. Dam- An edifice that holds back rivers.

If you begin a sentence with a certain point of view, say 3rd person narrator, STAY IN THAT TENSE! "He began to think to myself, 'I wonder what Hermoine would say'"- She'd say don't write like an idiot.

Caught on- To come to a realization. Cotton on- A piece of cotton that is on something. I mean really, how the fuck does that even begin to sound like it makes sense.

Sense- There's 5 of them. Some people might have 6. Since- The interim between two times, or for a certain reason.

People screw up the absolute basics and it completely ruins a story. When I see someone thank a beta and they have all this shit, I want those betas to puke a little in their mouth every time they burp for the rest of their lives.

** You missed amuse and bemuse somehow. Whenever an author uses the word bemuse I have to stare at it for five minutes trying to figure out if they're using it correctly or as a synonym for amuse XP

It's a shame you missed an idiom and now everyone's focusing on that and ignoring everything else =P

** The one that bothers me the most is defiantly vs definitely. 99 percent of the time defiantly doesn't fit. "Hermione defiantly wanted to read her book." So confusing, did definitely want to read her book or defiantly wanted to defy some one and read her book. Then vs than Your vs you're All these change the context of the situation.

** There are at least nine distinct senses but I get you weren't trying to be scientifically accurate with your jibes. But because you weren't and because of the tone of your post I decided to point that out. Don't be unkind to people who don't know as many things as you do because it's nearly guaranteed there's somebody who knows far more than you.
