Ah, Wattpad. Just the name brings back middle school memories of reading badly written PJO slash fanfiction during Science class. While not the first site I read fanfic on (that would be ff.n), it is the site that got me obsessed with fanfic, and the first site I published anything on. Which leads me to my question. Has anyone ever read a genuinely good, non-cringy fic on Wattpad? For any fandom?


** Ummm no actually... I can't even say my own fics were good because they were trash. Imagine my happiness when I discovered ao3 tho!

** I like [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/12122491-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation][Dursley's Daughter by writerer]] (and it has an unfinished sequel). It is very much non-adventure just the normal high-school life of teenagers in the magical school (and yes, Daisy Dursley is a daughter of Dudley), but if you like Kipling's Stalky & Co. or most high-school TV series, then this is pretty good. One of two best Dudley-has-magical-daughter type of stories.

** ‚ÄúConfessions of a gay Disney prince‚Äù is a behind-the-scenes of actors in Disney world. They have sex, but it's mostly character building and is generally very good. It's written in a play format.

** [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/146293683-the-confectionary-chronicles-hp-spn][Confectionery Chronicles]]

A crossover with supernatural but you don't need to know much. Basic plot is that Hermione prays to Loki the trickster god and ends up becoming his priestess, adventures, interesting magical lessons and looks into history.

It's not complete yet but would actually say it's worth the read.

** I remember I found a really interesting crossover with Twilight (which I know is really radical). It basically set up Hermione as Bella's sister. It obviously changed up a lot of things but was very creative.

And not fandom, but the best f/f stories I've read have been on Wattpad. Specifically one writer who's name I'm blanking on.

X-Men crossover, Logan is Harry's dad, not James. Incomplete/abandoned.
