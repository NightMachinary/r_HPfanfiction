Such was the statement in newly minted Minister Kingsley's office, and silence fell.

"I don't even see what's wrong with that. Most of Voldemort's supporters were Slytherins, the man himself too! Most dark lords have been slytherins. We ought to make sure they don't get any more power."

"Minister, we..." tried one of his aides, but Shack was already not listening.

"In fact, we need to abolish the house entirely! Tell the hat to divert all the slytherins into other houses. Maybe some good influences will help those kids."

Several members of the cabinet looked around nervously.

"Maybe we'll even institute harsher punishments for anyone who would have become a slytherin."

"You don't have that kind of auth-" started the robed mask, who was perhaps a living being or perhaps simply a facsimile concocted by those enigmatic magicians.

"I'm the minister! If not me, then who does? We need to take precautions. Everson, get me a list of all Slytherins currently working at the ministry."

Everson, who was an intern, suddenly felt tension in the room grow out of control.

Because he had been a slytherin.

One of the older wizards led him out, effectively breaking the tension.

"Heck, why stop at that? Get the hat to spit out a list of all the diverted students and we'll blacklist them. From the government, the auror corps, maybe even the Unspeakables."

"I doubt the hat would agree to that. And neither would we."

Kingsley looked up from his desk, at the angry faces of his most trusted advisors.

"Why not?"

"Because if you do that, the Ministry will be empty. Who do you think becomes a politician? Some gloryhound? Some bookworm? Some hugging enthusiast? No, it's us. The cunning ones. The ones who can play the game of politics."

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.

  In the morning after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry felt tired. In the morning after the morning after, he was downright exhausted. The war may be over, but there are still battles to be fought.

** "Good," says Shacklebolt. "You bloody incompetent fuckwits haven't sorted any of this shit out with all your 'cunning' and 'clever politics,' even with all the time and money in the world. Two dark lords in a hundred years out of your house, and none of you did squat. /Two./ All it would take is a penknife in a dorm room, and the problem is solved, but not one of you could be assed. The bastards have to sleep sometime.

"'Everyone here's a Slytherin,' no wonder the place has gone to the dogs. Maybe if we had more hugging enthusiasts and bookworms around, the next Dark Lord wouldn't be able to just snap his slimy fingers and conjure up */tactical kidnapping and child murder squads/* out of thin air.

"Besides," he says, leaning back in his chair, refusing to yield, "if any of you were half as clever as you pretended, you would have never let the damn hat put you in. Everybody knows it'll sort to wherever it's asked. What kind of real Slytherin lets themselves get put into Slytherin? A dumb one, that's who. Now send me Potter and Granger and get the hell out of my office. Bloody snakes."
