I'm just looking for a few fics where Ron and Draco aren't at each others throats and could actually be considered friends.\\
edit: Interesting: When I typed the title in on the submit page, the first letters of all the words were automatically capitalized. Obviously that didn't transfer. My apologies to those who look out for that sort of thing. It was not my intention to make those errors. Sorry. :)


** "On a Train, Switching Tracks": Due to a misunderstanding about muggle society, Ron and Draco work together to keep Harry from going crazy due to his fame.

  First year: "Celebrities," Harry said. "Fame makes them mad. I take it the wizarding world doesn't really have them, then?" Draco and Ron exchanged glances. "No, not really." AU, assorted oneshots and snippets.
