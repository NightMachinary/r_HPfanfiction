The 2010's are almost done so now it's time to share our favorite fics of the last ten years!

Fics that were either started or completed from 2010 to 2019.

** A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh is about an immortal female Harry who gets sent back to the dawn of civilization. It's not complete (and from the looks of it it never will be) but the author really sells the “timeless” feel of the story and Harry's journey through history. It has its flaws and plot holes (my biggest gripe is that Harry can't really be a bigger character without the author rewriting world history, so there's that limitation) but the strengths far exceed the weaknesses.

** Although it was started at the end of 2009, I'd say that The Boy Who Lived was the most influential fic of this decade. Whether or not that translates to best is debatable of course (I'm kind of meh on the fic myself), but with hindsight being what it is, I'd say it was the most important fic as well.

** There's a lot of junk that gets recommended on this sub. To be a good story, you need good characters, a good plot and good writing. If you want a great story, you need all that and a certain X factor that adds something else to the mix.

Restricting myself to one per author, the only stories that come close are:

- Patron
- A Long Journey Home
- Nightmares of Futures Past
- Strangers at Drakeshaugh
- The Pureblood Pretense (+sequels)

With some honourable mentions such as The Aurors, The Changeling, The Debt of Time, Shadow Walks and The Lie I've Lived.

But the best story of the last decade to my mind is unquestionably linkffn(Vitam Paramus by TheEndless7).

First and foremost there is no better character-driven story in the fandom. Everybody is given space to grow and develop in their own way. The two main characters have stories that intertwine like nothing else and I could write hundreds of words on how they interact and develop together.

Then there are the backup characters such as Titus Button. You start off wondering who the hell he is and end with him so firmly established as Harry's best friend that it's not even a question. Others like Madam Fae, Lunfrey, Daphne, Eva and more are each given their own personality and all have their little moments to shine.

Some people criticise the lack of a plot but that's missing the point. You can have vast amounts of bells and whistles - just look at the latest Star Wars film - and the story is still rubbish. Or you can write about two people healing and fill the page with emotion and suspense. I know which I prefer.

And in case anyone dismisses this as [[/u/Te7]] 's beta defending him, this story was done and dusted long before that happened. In fact it was because I loved VP so much as it was being written, and I posted reviews and developed a correspondence with Te7 that things reached the point where we started doing that.

It has its imperfections. TheEndless7 is a better writer now than he was in 2013 - that's what practice does after all - and if he were to rewrite VP it would be even better. But that doesn't change the fact that Vitam Paramus, as is, is the story I come back to more often than any other.

And to me, that makes it the greatest.

** How do you define 'best'?

Personal tastes are too different, one reader's best fic could be considered absolute garbage by the next.

Do you want to use number of Reviews or Favorites as the metric? In that case, I see Favorites as the better one because Reviews can be negative and fics with more chapters will have more Reviews.

When it comes to fics with most number of Favorites on FFN, Isolation, HPMOR, and Harry Crow (!) are leading the pack by a wide margin. But 'best' fics? At least our sub doesn't think so. While we accept Isolation to a certain degree, recommendations of HPMOR and Harry Crow are generally downvoted into oblivion.

--------------

There is a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/htmlview?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app][list of most recommended fics]] on this sub from 2011 to 2018, and [[https://hpffrec.hackesta.org/][the HPFanfiction Recommender]] that lets you search for more recent popular fics and authors.

Among the Top 20, my personal favorites are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), is obviously the most popular one by a wide margin. This ‘Harry' thinks he's Voldemort, acts like Voldemort, has the power of Voldemort, but he only wants to teach DADA forever.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is my favorite postwar fic. Harry and his friends finally had it enough and declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They began with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who got off again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is a dark war epic set in an extreme AU. It's one of the very few fics that has Harry raised by his own parents, but he actually turns out to be a lot more vicious than in canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), is Harry time travel to 1975. He teams up with Bellatrix and changes a lot of things. This Harry is war hardened veteran, and Bellatrix, despite following Harry, is by no means a paragon of virtue. But it's fun watching her in action.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), is another long war epic. This Hermione forms her own guerrilla group and becomes a very effective killer of rank and file Death Eaters. But Harry and Ron are not slacking off either, as they will come into their roles later in the story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), is a dimensional travel. Here, badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are thrown into a new world where things have become very different. They are not particularly dark, but they kill Death Eaters without blinking their eyes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is a major AU in which Harry was raised by Sirius in France. He went to Beauxbaton along with Neville and the Weasleys, and was personally taught by Dumbledore there. In 1999, Ron volunteers to go spying in Britain, where he meets a loyal Malfoy enforcer, Hermione.

*** Number of Reviews / Favourites are both poor metrics, not least because they're self-reinforcing. That's also true to some extent of most recommendations on this sub.

You say personal tastes are too different, and that's true. But lists of critics' choices of films tend to produce the same sort of results year after year so these things aren't totally subjective. The difficulty comes in getting a group of people who actually know what they're talking about to read a decent number of stories. Ain't gonna happen here.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

*** The one thing I always hear about Antithesis is that it's really sad, and I'd like to try it but I'm a bit scared that it's going to wreck me. I really don't need something very depressing right before Christmas or at the start of next term. How bad is it?

**** Oh boy. It was absolutely incredible but it wrecked me. I had time off from school so binged the entire thing straight thru and I was such a mess afterwards. Its deadass the best fanfic I've ever read. It's such a heartbreaking story, but it's so worth it. Like a third of the way thru is when it gets real. You'll be sad, but you won't regret reading it. Also, make sure you don't read the comments/reviews ppl have left. Lots of ppl accidentally leave spoilers.

  Harry Potter spent his eleventh birthday in a cabin on a tiny rock in the middle of the sea, listening to his cousin snore on the couch.When a knock sounded on the wind-swept, rain-drenched door, it was not a giant fist (or a half-giant's fist). It was a short sharp rap that sounded once, twice, three times before Minerva McGonagall simply charmed the lock open and stepped inside. "Apologies," Minerva said crisply, as Vernon raced out brandishing his rifle and Petunia pulled Dudley up off the couch and behind her. "I wasn't sure you could hear me over the weather.” The rain fell down behind the professor in a roar. She was perfectly dry.Minerva fished in her pocket without looking, because the only things allowed in her pockets were only ever exactly what she needed. “I've come to deliver this," she said, pulling out a letter and handing it to Harry, who was cross-legged on the floor, "because our owl post seems to have been unable to get through.”“And I've come to deliver this," she added, pulling out a second letter, "because Hogwarts by-laws require a professor to hand-deliver acceptance letters to Muggleborn families for their explanation and comfort."

  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."

  “Just... tell me.

Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13294472/1/Vivicendium][Vivicendium]] - Marauder's era fic focused on Sirius and a Slytherin OC girl.

Okay, so hear me out, I know this isn't a typically recommended fic but holy hell, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13294472/1/Vivicendium][Vivicendium]] is such a good Marauder's era Sirius/OC fic. I like it because 1) it's underrated af, 2) it's updated every Sunday without fail. It's a slow burn, well written fic if you like canon-type stories. The author has also written some good HG stuff too. I'm not the author but I literally logged into this throwaway account bc I'm sad that her stories aren't more popular lol. I normally can't get into OC love interests but CrashingPetals (the author) somehow makes me like the OCs in all her books.

ETA: This is unfinished and probably isn't the best fic of the decade bc of that. It's one of the few fics I consistently follow, however.

  Vivian Blair is the sum of everything Sirius hates: an elitist Slytherin prefect. Pranking her is something he takes great pleasure in, but this time it will have unforeseen consequences. He should know better than to toy with Fate, for the more love poems he writes, the less of a prank they become, and the more Fate seems intent on getting some revenge of its own. Sirius Black/OC

It's an AU after 3rd yr in which instead of Sirius going on the run like Dumbledore told him to, he gets his crap together, gets a lawyer, and uses all the slytherin cunning and pureblood power the Black family taught him to take over the wizarding world so harry doesn't have to fight Voldemort.\\
It has Manipulative!Dumbledore, but he's pretty sympathetic too, so I wouldn't call it bashing. Lots of politics and wizarding-worldbuilding. It is Harry/Hermione ship, which I don't usually like but there isn't any ron bashing and everything else in the story is done so well that I usually just ignore it.

** My best read, at least, and that I don't see recommended too often. (Beware, some M/M).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15685254][like the rain chooses the grass]] , by Tsume_Yuki. Linkao3(15685254)

It's Fem!Harry, a crossover with Avengers/Black Panther. Shipped with Erik Killmonger. And it's just... so...???...good?? I mean, this writer is just so good, anyway. And it's usually the fic with Harry becoming the Black's big brother that is recommended, but this one just... touched me, I guess. (Also, it doesn't gloss over racial/social differences or anything.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3579981][No Competition]] , by AnyaMcL. Linkao3(3579981) The funniest crack fic I've read, ever. Unfinished but it was just so, so good!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1884870][The Bitter Hug of Mortality]] , by Meh_forget_it. Linkao3(1884870) Unfinished, the end became a bit... weird, but it was one of the most interesting MOD Harry I've read. (Also, one of these fics where Harry is taken away from his family and siblings for a reasonable reason, and his family does love him, and he does love his siblings and everything).

And, of course, anything by LullabyKnell, but mostly [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366][face death in the hope]]

  Harry unexpectedly winds up in 1976 and has no option but to restart his sixth year with his parents. Some things change, some things stay the same. Part One of a three part retelling of 1976-1981 with Harry's presence altering the timeline. Romance is very slow build.

201*9* is not the "end of the decade."\\
20/20/ */is/* the End of /The/ Decade."\\
­\\
You do not start counting at '0' and end with '9'.\\
You start with '*1*' and end with '*10*'.\\
­\\
Now, for the /end of the decade that you listed/, that's still a ridiculously broad request considering what was great in 2011 may not have been considered decent in 2015.\\

A "Best [Item] of the Decade" list can withstand times changing, and fanfiction is one of those things that just can not manage it.

*** while this is mostly semantics, I feel like the OP is correct, when the number changes from 1X to 2X people /will/ perceive it as a new decade, regardless of where you start counting from. The same way 2000 was perceived by everyone as the start of the new millenia

*** In our society, people state the 9's as the end of a decade. You're right, normally you don't start counting at zero, but in this case 0 is an entire year. Therefore, society decided that the decade is 2010 - 2019.

2020-2029 will be another "decade"

*** As a computer programmer, I must strongly disagree with both statements. Even aside from 0-indexing arguments, we refer to the "1990s" as being from 1990-1999, not 1991-2000. So no, 2019 is absolutely the end of the decade.

*** The decimal number system that we use makes use of ten numbers (hence the name, decimal). It begins with the number 0 and ends with the number 9. So I must disagree with you on this
