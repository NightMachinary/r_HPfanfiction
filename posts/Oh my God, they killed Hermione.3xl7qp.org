Or how Fanfiction authors spice up their stories by killing Emma Watson.

I've been seeing this start to happen a little bit more and more in Fanfiction. So far, I have to say, it hasn't appeared in any bad fanfics that I've read yet, but that may be because I don't read stories with horrible summaries.

Still, it puzzles me. I've seen this used somewhere around 6-7 times thus far, with about half of that being this year. I don't mind it, but I wonder why authors killed Hermione over another character. What is it with people killing Hermione? Why can't they kill another character with greater impact?

I can only imagine that it is meant to give their story greater impact, but I don't understand why they don't do it to other characters.


** I hadn't really noticed that until you pointed it out. Then I realized, even my (draft) WIP kills Hermione in the first chapter.

As to why, I'm not entirely certain. It's a post-DH fic where Harry and Ron are the main characters: Auror partners who are hunting down a mysterious Dark wizard. I knew I wanted to have someone who was important to both of them die at the start for impact.

Why her and not, say, one of the Weasleys? Well, I figured she'd have the greatest impact and to be honest, she was the first choice that popped into my head. It was also partly to annoy one of my fanfic-reading friends, who is a big Harry/Hermione shipper. As the outline grew, though, I also realized that it really did make sense plot-wise as well.

** I enjoy seeing a good Hermione death though unfortunately I don't see many of them. It's really easy to write her as a Mary Sue because the film version of her was a Mary Sue. Killing her removes a Mary Sue and gives the author freedom to write without being hampered with a Mary Sue.

Can you please link me to these Hermione death fics?

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

*** I can only immediately think of two, and one is a long ways through the story. Here is one that is near the beginning-

** I suppose it may make Harry, Ron, (even Neville or Ginny), etc. work harder to succeed? I think killing Hermione would effect Harry and Ron since she's such an integral part of the trio. She does a lot of the heavy lifting--planning, learning, and being a better magic caster. If she died, Harry and Ron would be forced to think more (I love Harry and Ron but plans, they do not do). Though I haven't read any fic with that. If it's growing more popular I think it may be because a trope writers use instead is to kill Ron to bring Harry and Hermione closer, or just generally because people think he's the weak link. It's a fresh idea in a repetitive fanfic world. I'd love to read some fic of this. Any recs?

It seems like it's going to be cliche at first, but it's really turning out well so far.

That's one I read recently.

I don't remember the other ones, except for one. But that fic has Hermione die a really long way through the main story, and I don't want to spoil the punchline, so to speak.

****** Just read the second chapter. I like it so far. Hermione dying seemed natural since Harry wasn't there to save her. Also, since Harry is so competent in that fic, Hermione isn't needed to do all the reading and grunt work. Usually when authors make a studious Harry they make Hermione his instant or begrudging friend because they share academic interests. I like that this one takes a new turn. Thanks for the rec! I enjoyed it.

******* Indeed! And it manages offputting and manipulative Dumbledore without bashing him or making him literally worse than Hitler.

I really like characters like that, not very black and white. If the author keeps updating, I honestly think this has a good chance of becoming one of those fanfics everyone references when a new member of the fandom asks around for a rec.

** well i say better kill her off than make her a slytherin pureblood , lol. i saw a few were she dies and it feels its often in fics were she is not needed anyway, like her characterisation is so weak she doesnt contribute otherwise.

** In writing classes you learn that "killing the parents" is a trope used to guide children into adulthood quickly as characters. Ron and Harry despite all they've gone through still rely fully on Hermione in all of the books to the point she's like the maternal character. So, it's easier to kill her off in order to show how her death made the two rely more on themselves and each other and grow rather than keep her around and have 30 year old characters acting like 12 years old.

******* It kind of felt fitting though, at least in my opinion. It felt like it was meant to represent the kind of mistakes Harry made, and how he refused to lose. Idk, I guess I'm not understanding where exactly you're coming from. Could you explain a little more in depth? I'm honestly interested to hear more on why you disliked it.

** I haven't actually seen many kill Hermione stories which do not also feature Dark Harry or Other School Harry, but by the sounds of it you are talking about Harry being Hermione's friend before the death (ie also not those stories which have bashing)? If that is the case, I can only think it is because Hermione often acts as the one who provides answers to the plots problems, and therefore by killing her off you make any current problems more difficult to solve. Also as really the only girl in most of the books the impact of her death would be harder then Ron or Harry for the audience, as they either identify with her or see her as a damsel in distress.
