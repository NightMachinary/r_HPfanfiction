** Linkffn(the queen who fell to earth) sort of does this as an intro to a crossover with 'Dragon Riders of Pern'. Harry heads out to the first task with every intention of letting the dragon eat him, then something amazing happens. It's an excellently written trilogy, unfortunately the third part is unfinished as one of the authors (of a husband and wife team) passed away from cancer not too long ago. Even still, they are well worth the read.

*** Do you need any knowledge of the crossover? The summary makes it seem like it's rather important, more of a full on fusion than a character transplant but how well is it explained for someone who's never read any of the Dragonrider books?

**** As it's set in the Potter universe, they have great exposition explaining the Pern universe to Harry as he learns of his bond. I'd never read the Dragonrider books and still was easily able to follow along and enjoy the read.

*** I have to say that the summary of the fic kind of annoys me due to the word “years” being unnecessarily abbreviated despite the summary not being even close to the character limit. I mean, I don't know, maybe I'm jaded, but to me it speaks of lack of care from the author.

***** It's not done in the language that is my native language, that I do know; it is sometimes abbreviated to the first letter and a dot, but that I believe to be different (because it's actually allowed on official documents when they have a lot of dates and are wordy) from ... this. I will take your word that it is fairly common in English, but I am not used to it and it does come across as laziness to me (two letters!) in the situations where there is no actual need to do it, the same kind of laziness that leads to people not checking their summaries and ending up with typos in them.
