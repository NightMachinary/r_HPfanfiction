Hey everybody!

I had a few different requests for fics and instead of making a bunch of different threads, I thought "why not make one big thread?"

I'd like fics that have *one or more* of the following

- *Creative spell use.* Cant cast /crucio/? Sandpaper charm to the genitals does the job as well. Usage of spells beyond the eternal /stupefy/ during battle. Doesn't matter if its creative usage of canon spells or OC spells but just something different.
- *Capable enemies.* Powerfantasies where one side stomps can be fun, but I'm looking where the conflict is more of a challenge. It gets boring when I can see from the first chapter that the good guys are gonna win. Insane, arrogant Voldemort is kind of boring? I want to see the prodigy Tom Riddle who charms the loyalty of his followers, not the continuous torture he uses in seemingly all fics.
- *Natural growth curve* I'd like to see a fic where Harry has to work for every single advantage. Where he can't just walk into Gringotts and demand a million galleons in inheritance. He doesnt have to be this machine who trains day in day out, just a little proactivity on Harry's part plz.
- *Dark Harry* not just light-morality-but-very-pragmatic Harry, I wanna see a blood purist Harry, or a psychopath who tortures and kills because he likes it. Edgy stories are ok for this one because I doubt there is any fic that isnt edygy for this request.
- *worldbuilding* Anything with extensive worldbuilding, especially outside of Europe/ britain-france-and-the-US.

I've got no problem with slash as long as it isn't A/B/O or /errybody gay now/. Harem is not a fav but it's okay as long as it isnt thinly veiled smut. Of course, decent spelling, grammar and syntax is all appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** Voldemort is quite the capable antagonist in my AU story "Patron". For example, he only had Harry forced into the TWT as a distraction for Dumbledore so he could prepare his resurrection ritual without trouble while Dumbledore was forced to protect Harry. Of course, should the boy die in the tournament, that would be a bonus. Dumbledore, though, had his own plots going, to counter Voldemort. There's also world building, but mostly focused on France, Bulgaria, the Balkans, Turkey and Jamaica.

Another AU story of mine, "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", features the adult trio as curse-breakers, searching for the ruins of Atlantis - across Northern Africa, Turkey, Brazil and the Caribbean Sea, with a trip to the US as well.

Most of my stories have a more proactive Harry as well.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** linkffn(The Arithmancer) and it's trilogy, for sure, for everything except for Dark!Harry.

Hermione's the MC, she starts as a math protege that goes into Arithmancy in Year 1, it takes a bit for her to get going but she invents all kinds of terrifying things over the trilogy. Wonderful view of Arithmancy and how it influences Magic (not to mention the third in the trilogy for world building), and the Enemy is suited to put up a fight, to the very end. Harry's more grey then in Canon; he's not stupid by any means, but he's more light than dark.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** Fate by TheTrueSpartan on FF.net.

The enemies are overwhelmingly strong, the spells are new and interesting (moving protego's, blinding people by levitating sand, firing face lasers, ect.) and the main character is both very dark and somewhat light. (A desperate need to protect his family combined with learnt psychopathic tendencies)

The main character is also Ron Weasley, which is very interesting. Just prepare yourself because this story does NOT pull punches. And Ron has a particularly fucked up life.

It's also 2.6 MILLION words long, which is neat.
