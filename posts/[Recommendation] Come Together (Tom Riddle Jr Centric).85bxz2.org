I have to admit that this story blew me away in terms of both story telling and character growth. It actually made me root for Tom Riddle as the protagonist of this fic.

Before I read this story, I guess I had a sort of pessimistic view of Tom Riddle considering he grew up to be Voldemort. I actually did not even understand why people wrote fanfics about him. However, I did later got into reading the Harry Potter and MCU crossover. Eventually, I found Come Together where the fic was set during the WW2 era. With me being a fan of Captain America the First Avenger movie, it already peaked my interest. On the other hand, I also noticed that one of the main characters labeled was Tom Riddle Jr. Plus the summary made me conclude that the fic was from his point of view. I weighed my options and just went for it since I had yet to have read a crossover fic involving the first Captain America movie.

As it turned out, it was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my entire time I have ever came across a HP and MCU crossover.

It stays true to Tom's personality but made room for him to grow. At age 16 at least. This took place after the Chamber of Secrets which he is still very much guilty for. The story is very well written from the beginning and continues to become more impressive as I read on. It's to the point that I have no clue how many time I've reread this specific fanfiction. I just keep coming back. I didn't even care about how long I had to wait for an update as long as the author updated. The fic updated a few days ago too, so I'm a happy reader.

** I really liked this fic and continue to follow it. While it does retread old ground from captain americas first movie, it also creates its own scenes and has started to get to the point where the plot should diverge. I look forward to future updates and am hopeful that the future chapters will bring more divergent scenes.

** It's canon-stationy so much that it hurts. At some point you get TFA with Tom Riddle. So... Awesome idea, but the execution is completely off.

*** I can see some-what when you said â€˜cannon-stationy' however, that's the general plot. Honestly, I don't know what you meant by that. Story wise, it's unique and comprehensive. The fic does not even follow the movie exactly and deviate quite a lot as the story moves forward. Though, I am curious what made the fic gave you the impression it did.

**** Terrible English aside?

Well, any kind of original plot went out of the window the second we met Steve. The next two chapters retell scenes from TFA with Tom and other wizarding characters inserted in them. That's when I dropped it.

***** Some re-tellings are bound to have happen in a crossover. I wouldn't expect the author to totally trash the original story and change the character interactions for no reason when they would most likely say something similar. As I assume what you read so far, the story did started out original, did it not? I try not to judge a fic as soon a there's a couple of rehashing. That's where I give the author the benefit of the doubt considering what they wrote so far was different and for the fact the fic was a crossover.
