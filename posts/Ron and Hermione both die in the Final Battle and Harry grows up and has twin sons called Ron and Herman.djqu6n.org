***** Yes, the name Hermione first appears in Homer's Iliad, as she's the daughter of Helen of Troy and Menelaus of Sparta.

Shakespeare later borrowed that name again for his Winter's Tale.

Hermione is actually a popular ship name. The French had built [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_ship_Hermione][a total 12 of them]] throughout the history, including a 2014 replica of a frigate that fought in the American Revolutionary War. The British had built [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Hermione][a total of 4]] between 1782 and 1967.

****** For a minute I misinterpreted what kind of "ship name" you were referring to, like the French really wanted some couple to be together.

This is what happens when I read too much fanfiction.
