Anyone in the mood to share what they're reading?

Any WIP that got recently (say within ~1 month) updated or is normally updating regularly (more or less).

Because /come on/ we all hate waiting and don't start reading a fanfic if it's not 1/2 done already or from an author that's reliable in their updates ...

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born]]) - because I love time travel and founders and arthurian legends and runes and the overall adventure feel over anything relationshippy here ... and the goblins, cause goblins ... /rock/ (see the pun? no? nevermind ...)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10478838/1/Corvus-Black]]) - always a fan of /who's your daddy?/ fics and this one has the extra *omfg* /who's your/ *MOMMY*? in it. (psss ... its Bellatrix O.O)

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4174809/chapters/9425418]]) - one of those reliable authors, and I love the take on amnesia and its consequences

Sooooo , whatcha readin guys n gals?


** - linkffn(brilliant magic), a slytherin!Hermione paired with the Weasley twins.
- linkffn(lady Archimedes) I think everyone will know this one, but just in case, it's the sequel to The Arithmancer.
- linkffn(misplaced moony) was updating regularly, but the author got into another story that is now finished, and then into another story again. I'm really hoping she'll pick this one back up as I really like it. It's a remione with a Remus of her age from an alternate universe

** linkffn(Grow Young With Me) I actually just read this last week and it hasn't updated since then but it was only published in March and updates often, last time was a month ago. This is the fic I'm most excited about updating. It's instantly become one of my favorites. It's amazingly well written. The OC is fantastic, and it does a great job allowing the reader to understand how Harry is feeling.

linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero) Another of my favorites. Updates every 2 weeks, missed this weekend but it's the holiday so that is expected. Its a dimensional hop, great interaction between Harry and Iris.

linkffn(The Black Prince) HP x Game of Thrones. Just updated yesterday. It's an all around incredible fic.

linkffn(A Fallen God) Loki Odinsson, God of Mischief and Lies, ends up in Harry's head. Humorous and action filled. Just a lot of fun to read.

In another good development, the author finally stops his usual Dumbledore/Molly/Ron bashing.

The resulting Harry inherits all Voldemort's memory up to 1981, and becomes more ambitious, cunning, and ruthless. The story is in early stage as they just got to the second day of their 6th year]]

** linkffn(A Marauder's Plan) is a story about Sirius sticking around after fleeing Hogwarts instead of going... wherever he went in canon. Planned to cover all of forth year, currently it's just after the second task if memory serves. Some details will probably set off individual pet peeves ("Pronglet", "so mote it be"), but the overarching story is very well plotted, with good dialogue, character development, and mystery.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** linkffn(Harry Potter Without Harry Potter) - a AU in which Harry did not survive that Halloween night when he was a baby. Great world building in this one.

linkffn(Identity). This one is the third in a series of AU stories. An sequal to one of those "Sirius escapes earlier and raises Harry"-stories with a little extra AU twist.

Not updated since September, but one of my favourites and I trust not abandoned: linkffn(Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past). Another sequal to an AU story. PoD in this is the existence of Veronica (Ronnie) Weasley instead of Ron.

... Basically, I like AU stories with a canon feel.

** oh good lord.. you have opened a can of worms my friend. Okay Ill start with the Non HP fics since there are only three of those. linkffn(8211184),linkffn(10332343),linkffn(9854207) They are all Naruto and each are fabulously written. The First is OutFoxed, which is the only Harem Naruto Fic I can read, the next is Shinobi Rising, a cross over between Naruto and young justice. Finally is the sequel to Legacy by Cr4zypt, The Eternal Guardians. Legacy was the second fan fiction I ever read and I am proud to say I read each update when it occurred. Cr4zypt is an amazingly good writer, who's sequel has characters from both the bleach and Harry Potter worlds. (as of the most recent update of the Eternal Guardians) now for the Harry Potter fan fictions linkffn(11191235),linkffn(11446957),linkffn(10298096) Now I am also following Rent-A-Hero, and I am waiting for the next book of A Reluctant Champion series which will be out sometime in the new year. Of the three, A Cadmean Victory is probably the best written story, featuring a Harry who is decisive (This is the best adjective) The other two, (Harry Potter and the Emerald Trance, and Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) both feature an extremely Slytherin trouped Harry Potter. all have been updated within the last week. EDITS I attempted to fix the whole issue with paragraphing. Reddit just does not seem to want to do what I want it to. I am sorry.

  (5/7) It is a dark time for Harry Potter. Voldemort is secretly amassing power, and only Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix opposes him. Abandoned, libeled, loathed and reviled, Harry has few allies and fewer options. Harry must learn to control his powerful and mysterious emerald trance; if he cannot, Harry will be consumed by darkness. (AU Slytherin!Harry)

  What if Harry were a Slytherin? What if everyone thought his twin brother was the BWL? What if someone tried to do something creative and innovative with the two most overused cliches in HP fanfic? AU, currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NOTE: There will be NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Also, basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys.

*** Thanks for all the story recs, wow thats a loooot! I dont read naruto, maybe i'll have a look i just cant really fathom a crossover. I read the manga when i was younger, but I'm not as interested in it anymore.

Also I'm fairly certain you need to press the enter key twice for 1 line break, just fyi.
