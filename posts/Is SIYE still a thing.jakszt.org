Today I was cleaning my mailbox, and found out my old SIYE mails. The first fic I wrote was awful, I'm not a native English speaker and my grammar was dung. So, I remember being casually on the internet and seeing this SIYE challenge and I created an account and made one fic. Grammar wasn't the only dreadful part, because I had only read like 2 fics then and made this terrible thing with happy goblins and manipulative Dumbledore. (You can laugh at old-me, I'm laughing at old-me now)...

So earlier I went into this SIYE account and saw there are some recent challenges. I logged into my account (which had a different mail assigned to it and a different penname) and found out that my old dreadful story had like 30 something reviews, dating back to 2012. Does anyone know if SIYE people get notifications for replies to reviews? Because I just replied to all the reviews some as old as 8 years old and not sure what people would think of late replies saying "thank you" to as answer to "good job, looking forward to next chapter".


** It most definitely is! I find the website a bit hard to navigate, but check with [[/r/harryandginny][r/harryandginny]]. You'll find quite a few recommendations for H/G on SIYE there

*** Do you happen to know the rules there? Do they only take romance stuff or are heavier plots with H/G allowed as well. If I have Canon Pairings HG HR there and both couples are equally featured, is that fair game for them? Or does it have to be more HG heavy than HR?

**** Heavier plots are allowed as long as there is a clear H/G ship :)

***** Thanks. Could be good to have an account there. One of these days I'll be writing a story mainly focused on Harry and Ginny and I'll post there as well. Pull the "back from the dead author" thing.

**** Do you mean the sub? Or SIYE? Either way, I think as long as Harry/Ginny is the main pairing most other things don't matter as much, but I'm not entirely sure

***** I meant SIYE, sub seemed more obvious. Thanks.
