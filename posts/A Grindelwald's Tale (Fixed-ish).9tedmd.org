I recently went back and fixed up the grammar on the story to try and make it easier to read. I also made a few changes to certain character interactions to make the story a little more realistic.I would appreciate any help in improving the story whether by grammar or story ideas. It's at 300k+ words at the moment and in fourth year. Updates tend to be weekly though at the moment I am going through a bit of writers block. The grammar changes so far have reached up to chapter 79 and should be fully updated by the end of next week.

The story focuses on an Oc in Harry Potter's year. The Oc in question is the grandson of Gellert Grindelwald.

To give a quick summary.

Rodrick Grindelwald spends the first year accidentally pissing off Harry Potter, the second year on purpose and in third year he declares a war against Gryffindor entirely.

Theres new magic, old magic, illegal magic, broken laws and just about everything in between.

There's even an extra Hollow .

And that's not even including the changes some of the other characters have went through.

But above all.

Everything that happens in the story, from teaching a child unforgivables to mentally scarring certain Death eaters, is all Gellert Grindelwald's fault.

This is also a new acc in case anyone recognises the story from any of my past posts.


** I'm always a little leery of OCs (seems like half the time they end up being SIs in all but name), but the premise seems interesting. I'll definitely give it a try.

**** A self insert. Which is when the author writes themself into the story.

****** No problem. I think self inserts in general are relatively rare in the HP fandom, so I'm not terribly surprised that that abbreviation doesn't get much use here.

  Follow Rodrick, grandson of Gellert Grindelwald, as he struggles with his own identity in a world both magical and dangerous. Will he ever be able to step out of his grandfather's shadow? Maybe if nobody finds out his family name in the first place. Of course, things don't always go to plan... Disclaimer: J.K Rowling owns Harry Potter. Credit to Episoph for the summary.
