[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/fictionalcandie/pseuds/fictionalcandie][fictionalcandie]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/camichats/pseuds/camichats][camichats]] both write James/Sirius almost exclusively, and they're really good.

These are James/Sirius after James/Lily, rather than instead.

This one is ABO but very anti-establishment and non-traditional. Nicely written too. Skip it if it's a hard no.

  Sirius doesn't take James's declarations of love seriously, thus suffering through events that he could have avoided otherwise and still have reached the same outcome.

  It's Christmas, and the extremely Gryffindor James Potter has hopelessly fancied untouchable Slytherin Sirius Black in secret for months now. What he doesn't know is that they've got remarkably similar secrets.

#+begin_quote
  Four years after the fall of Voldemort and the consequences of war are still visible. James Potter, the grieving widower and father has been Minister for Magic for a year, but with Great Power comes Great Responsibility and those who hold the office of the people are usually the most lonely. In a world of political dealings and quests for power, who to trust is never quite clear. Sirius Black, the mastermind behind the Potter campaign mysteriously quit as soon as he'd got his best friend into office. Now he runs The Marauders, doing whatever necessary to service his clients. He's a political fixer and he's damn good at it. The Scandal Prongsfoot AU nobody asked for. Canon until after the war.
