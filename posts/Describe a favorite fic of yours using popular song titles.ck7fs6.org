  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** "Call me maybe"

To describe the fic

"Call Me"

A lovely subversion of the average post OotP summer angst. Harry finds a small letter with a phone number, he decides to call it and ends up on a date with Lisa Turpin. Summer romance from there on, no moping, no training montages, no helpful goblins, no bashing, just some light hearted fun. The adults are a tad too reasonable and due to the underage magic restriction, there is not a lot of magic happening.

*** From what I remember there was a bit of bashing, even more so in the sequel.

**** It has a somewhat more rule-abiding version of Hermione. Other that, no bashing. I mean, if Harry ran off from the Order in canon as he does in that fic, you bet Hermione would be pissed. And she is less than pleased with public displays of affection, so her reacting badly to sex is not that OOC. I'd prefer a supportive, wingman Hermione over the characterisation the author wrote, no question there, but it is still bearable.

***** I remember Harry ranting about the Order loads which annoyed me after the first few chapters as he just kept repeating the same things. All that being said I've not read it in ages so take it with a pinch of salt.

****** The canon Order is useless as nipples on an air balloon. And their treatment of Harry is more than a little questionable. So being pissed at them is perfectly fine in my book as long as you don't make up stupid shit like love potion plots or mind control. Not sure about "saying the same thing", but each chapter has a different thing happen. The only reoccurring theme is trips with Lisa and her family.
