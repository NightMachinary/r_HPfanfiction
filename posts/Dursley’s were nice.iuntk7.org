Looking for a Harry/Ginny fic where Harry lives with the Dursley's, but instead of them treating him like a piece of dirt, they treated him as a son. If anyone knows anything, let me know. I would love to read something like this, with a lot of time on my hands.


** Not sure how to link it but "A Better Man" essentially Vernon gets a second chance after he dies and the entire Dursley family turn out to be good people. It is a Harry/Ginny fanfic

  Vernon changed in the beginning to be a better man, thanks to a wish. How will this affect Harry, and the entire Wizarding World? Now complete! Please R&R. AU, HPGW, RWHG, RLNT

  What if Dudley wasn't an only child. What if a gift of Lily to her sister, along with the wards protecting Harry resulted lots of children in a household full of love instead of resentment. What if the wards were more powerful the more family that lived under them, What if the protection imparted by Lily to her son, also was imparted to those new magical children
