** On one hand, HELL YEAH NEW UPDATE! On the other hand, I actually thought the last chapter would have been the perfect way to end this story. Ah well, I'm sure Rakeesh has more greatness planned for us.

** Now that I know the author hasn't dropped off the face of the earth, I think I'll actually create an account so I can thank them for this work. It beats the hell out of reading yet another clichÃ© monster that makes Borat seem refined and eloquent.

*** If anyone else decides to do like me and sign up, once your account is created, you sign in with your email address, not your username. I picked a name like Word1 Word2 Word3 and wasn't able to login. I tried every combination I could think of, but it didn't work. I finally notice that the prompt said "email" and not "username." Once I tried my address, it worked.

** I really liked how Rakeesh dealt with the language issue. Not in your face, but enough to show a struggle.
