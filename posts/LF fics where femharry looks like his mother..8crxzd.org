Preferably without Harry/Snape, or any pairing really. This isn't a prerequisite, but I'd prefer plot over pairing. I've always enjoyed fics with femharry, so any help would be appreciated.

*** That would depend on whether Harry is fem! at the start of the story, and how Harry feels about the whole thing, wouldn't it? /pronounpolice

** I've started a a story where Harry is actually a girl (since birth) who looks like her mother (except for her father's hairs), starting at year 1 at Hogwarts. The chapters covering the first year have been published. Fair warning, the main events are somewhat close to first year canon, it may feel like a rehash depending on your expectations, even though seeds of divergences have been planted. I'm currently posting year 2. However, the fact that the main protagonist looks like Lily has not been much explored yet (not explicitly at least).

I'm not exactly certain about the rules regarding (shameless) self promotion, so I'll put the link [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12849528/][there]].

** linkffn(Harry Potter and The Mysterious Case of the Girl Who Lived): Harry has a curse out on him that makes him appear female to those who have magic. They see a girl who looks like his mother, and it's an important plot point addressing double standards that would arise from that. No Snape shipping because in this fic Harry is an eleven year old straight boy, but it addresses the issue and Flitwick is kind of creeped out by the idea that Snape could be interested in Harry

***** The first book has basically no change, I admit. But if you keep reading the books, as they go on, I start changing things. That was also my first fic so i wasn't sure what to do
