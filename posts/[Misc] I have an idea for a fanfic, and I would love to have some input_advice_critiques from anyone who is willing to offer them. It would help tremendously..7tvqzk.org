I've been working on a fanfic (Shatterpoint) for a long time - particularly the characters, setting, and world-building. What I would like is some input, advice, and/or even critiques of my idea. I know it might not be a lot to go on, but it would still help tremendously. Thanks!

- 2030s: A "dark" lord (born John Diggory - distant relative of Cedric) and his army sneak themselves into the MoM. John is almost completely anti-pureblood and fights for those who cannot fight for themselves, including oppressed creatures. Incredibly powerful, much more so than Dumbledore and Voldemort combined. His army is utterly devoted to him through loyal, not fear. They plan to use an Unspeakable device that can rewrite reality, but Harry manages to intervene during the process, which completely shatters the Potterverse reality. Anything that happened prior to "shatterpoint" was HP canon.

- In this new reality, John found himself in the late 1960s, where he effortlessly slaughtered Voldemort and his forces, before he redirected his "justice" towards the rest of the Magical World. By the 2000s, the Shatterpoint!World is completely different to canon, mainly thanks to John and the Righteous (his army). Pureblood witches and wizards above the age of sixteen - as well as anyone who defied John - are rounded up to work in labour camps, without any magic to aid them. Any pureblood kids below the age of five/six were adopted by suitable couples who have consistent exposure to the non-magical world. On a more positive note, those that used to be classed as 'lesser' creatures can find fair, well-paid work in Shatterpoint!World, and technology has been successfully integrated with magic in most regions of the world.

 

But what of the main characters, you may ask?

 

Jak Sar aka Harry James Potter:

#+begin_quote
  In this new reality, James and Lily were unknowingly killed in 1978 by the crash-landing of a fleeing couple from amongst the stars. After finding out what they had done, while also knowing that they couldn't run forever, decided to take the identities of James and Lily Potter and thus become human. No-one suspected a thing, until Sirius found out by accident a year after. Thankfully, Sirius managed to eventually move on from the death of his best friends, and became friends with the alien couple. On 31st July 1980, Jak Sar or Harry James Potter was born without a prophecy looming over his head. Even so, through a twist of fate, Harry was born as an alien, and the interaction of magic with his alien DNA granted him superhuman powers - super strength, super speed, flight, invulnerability, electrokinesis (magical and mundane in nature), and super senses. On the other hand, he cannot cast magic or apparate.  

  As he grew older, Harry became more and more powerful, but even then he still lost his parents at age 5 to a skirmish between the Righteous and a pureblood fanatic. Tragedy struck once again when he was 10 with the death of Sirius, during a visit to Diagon Alley. Over the next fifteen years or so, Harry drifted across the world, helping out now and then with his tremendous power but never truly intervening with large-scale conflicts. This Harry is resourceful, patient, with a justified amount of fear in regards to his powers. He is fiercely protective of the ones who earn his trust, but has excellent control his emotions. He is also pragmatic and rational enough to know when tough decisions need to be made. If Harry had gone to Hogwarts, he would have been sorted into Slytherin.
#+end_quote

 

Ron Weasley:

#+begin_quote
  Born in a poor family, just like in the Prime Universe, he was not taken away by the Righteous - mostly because John knew about the Weasley family. However, from a young age, Ron had a knack for invention and soaking up knowledge like a sponge. Despite the discrimination of being a pureblood, Ron grew to become famous in both worlds for his brilliance and became the first magical billionaire. Secretly, though, Ron had been travelling the world to accumulate skills, while also working on a project dubbed "Crimson Knight" - an armoured supersuit. He saw the world outside and wanted badly to put a stop to John's tyrannical reign. Yes, he saw the advantages, but at what cost?  

  By day, he was Ron Weasley - billionaire, philanthropist, genius - but by night, he was the Crimson Knight, a vigilante who preyed on those who targeted the weak and/or innocent. It can be argued that Shatterpoint!Ron is paranoid, with a hesitance to trust others. Others would argue that Ron likes to be prepared for any situation and outcome, often with a no-nonsense attitude. Shatterpoint!Ron would most likely be found reading a book or casefile or learning some obscure branch of magic/tech (*just in case* something happened). But something looms around the corner, and Ron knows that whatever it is that is coming, will need more than just him to face it.
#+end_quote

 

Hermione Granger:

#+begin_quote
  Both of her parents are still dentists, but her mother Initsa had secretly been a part of an elite group of assassins that worshipped the Greek pantheon. On day, the four-year-old Hermione found herself the only survivor of a landslide while on a family holiday. Fortunately, the assassin that was tasked with keeping tabs on their old student had rescued the child and brought her back to their temple up in the mountains. Over the next twenty years or so, Hermione was trained to become an elite assassin, and thanks to her magic, an assassin who would harness some of the powers of the Greek pantheon - super strength (considerable, but not nearly as strong as Harry), super speed (just a *hair* faster than Harry), invulnerability (again, not quite the same level as Harry), flight, and enhanced magical senses (as opposed to Harry's more mundane senses). Shatterpoint!Hermione may not get a lot of pop culture references sprouted by Daphne, but her heart is filled with pure intentions, even if she is an assassin. Courageous to a fault, you could break all of Hermione's limbs and she would still keep fighting without pause. In contrast to the more serious Ron, this Hermione loves to joke around from time to time.
#+end_quote

 

Daphne Greengrass:

#+begin_quote
  Due to an accident involving a cryogenic stasis machine, Daphne became cryokinetic and, to a lesser extent, hydrokinetic. This has also affected her durability, strength, speed etc. to a slight degree (only when compared to Harry and Hermione). Despite her powers, Daphne is anything but cold. Boisterous and always willing to have a laugh, she is an open book to many and known to spout pop culture references, even if not everyone gets them. Even so, it is clear to those who get to know her that her sister, Astoria, running away from home several years ago still affects her to this day.
#+end_quote

 

Drake Black:

#+begin_quote
  Born a squib to Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, on the run from the Righteous, Draco (later Drake) was taken in by distant relatives living on the other side of the pond in rural New York. His new guardians - squibs like himself - owned, lived, and worked on their family farm. Unlike Prime!Draco, Drake grew up knowing the value of hard work and teamwork, as well as having an affinity to animals. When he turned 17, Drake was gifted with a Black heirloom - a totem that could allow the user to harness the powers and abilities of any magical and non-magical creature. Additionally, it provided magical protection from things like the Unforgivables and legilimency. Because he was raised on a farm, Drake is often underestimated due to his farmboy persona. But underneath that persona is a wise, courageous individual who will always offer the shirt off his back without hesitation.
#+end_quote


** I found the premise quite interesting, but there's really a lot of Mary Sue-ing in the character bios. Harry is Superman, complete with the alien persona, Ron is a billionaire and Batman, and Hermione is assassin and Wonder Woman. I don't really see how meaningful conflict and development can happen when everyone has superpowers. Also the alien part - really lost me, it seems unnecessary and goes beyond the "extra" of even most overpowered Harry fics.

*** Yes, these characters in particular do seem over-powered. But I've made them overpowered because the threats they will face together (and individually) will be overpowered as well.

Plus, conflict doesn't have to be about the power struggle between the enemies; more so, it would be about right vs wrong - /should/ they change the world back to what it was - and how the public will view them.

I can concede with the whole alien part being somewhat unnecessary. The main reason why I did it was so that there was an even greater parallel between these guys and the Justice League.

**** I think you should focus more on character development and starting small, before considering the "power struggle" stuff. Aside from the Justice League stuff, characterization is very OOC. Some readers won't mind, some will. I'd personally recommend making their backgrounds a little more like they are originally. Drake Black as a wise, courageous farmboy is a bit... ?

I also think that making them the Justice League is a bad idea. Superhero stuff translates well into film and comics because explosive grand imagery, but that's a lot harder and more tedious over text. (I may be biased because I dislike superhero movies, so take this with a grain of salt.)

It sounds like you already have a vision for what you want to create - and that's good. But whether this idea has mass fanfiction-community appeal, I doubt. Of course, creating something, whether it be art, writing, or music, is foremost for your own satisfaction. So if this is what you want to write, I'd say go for it and be true to your ideas.

***** Oh, definitely! I'm not going to dive straight into the nitty, gritty stuff right away. Each character would be fleshed out as the story progresses. Characterization is quite OOC, but in this context that is the point - reality has been shattered and has tried to repair itself, much to no avail. It will definitely turn some readers off.

Although it can be hard to translate superheroes to text, if done right, I /think/ that I can pull it off.

Where did this magic come from? His parents were aliens, not wizards.

What's the point of the labor camps? What are they doing? Making widgets? Segways? iPhones? Is there a way out of this forced labor? There seems to be a contradiction--you say that pureblood wizard children are farmed out to suitable couples and then purebloods are put to work in work camps. So these "suitable couples" just hand over their adopted children? That doesn't make sense. This reminds me a bit of "Red Rising".

Regarding Ron, this doesn't make sense:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

John knew what about the Weasley family? That they were poor? That they all had red hair?

It seems to me that you've got a sort of superhero crossover thing going on which could be interesting, but there are several areas that still need to be fleshed out.

#+begin_quote
  Why? What happened in his background to make him this way?
#+end_quote

Near the end of the Second Wizarding War, John and his family - his parents being muggle-born - went into hiding under fidelius. A family friend ratted them out to the death eaters, who stormed the hideout. Six-year-old John managed to hide himself somewhere safe, while the rest of the family tried to valiantly fight back, only to be soon defeated.

Now imagine: you are six years old, it is dark but you can hear everything going on around you. You can hear your parents being fed their own "dirty blood", your sister being sexually assaulted before death, and your brother being tortured then killed - all of this because of their ancestry. You then hear that the family friend that betrayed your family did so because of blood status and greed. It doesn't get any better as you get older; yeah, the war was won, but did anything REALLY change? You still hear the word "mudblood" thrown around, as well as prejudice against what purebloods deem as lesser creatures. The worse thing: no-one is doing a DAMN thing!

#+begin_quote
  How? What sort of studying did he undertake to develop his magical might?
#+end_quote

John was always magically powerful, even as a little boy. That was why his parents were so concerned about going into hiding, for if the DEs got their hands on him... He naturally became more powerful as he grew older - not able to use a wand because of his power - while pouring over everything he could find. Having a Slytherin friend with plenty of connections certainly helped. The Hogwarts faculty were worried that they would have nothing to teach him by the time he finished his third year, but he was a Hufflepuff, so what he could possibly be up to? After completely smashing his OWLs, John left to travel the world, learning ancient and obscure magic with questionable legality. Several years later, he returned to Britain - his spies ready in position - with powers and abilities that made him a god amongst witches and wizards.

#+begin_quote
  Where did this magic come from? His parents were aliens, not wizards.
#+end_quote

His parents were aliens who became human wizards via advanced alien technology. Basically, the tech enabled them to acquire the ability to manipulate magic, and it was the interaction between magic and alien DNA that gave Harry his powers.

#+begin_quote

So these "suitable couples" just hand over their adopted children? That doesn't make sense.
#+end_quote

Although a reasonable and affable man in many aspects, John can be quite vengeful. The point of labour camps? To demean the pureblood population, to show how them how having "pure" blood didn't do squat for them. Their purpose can vary for each camp and individual, depending on behaviour and performance. The better-behaved and competent individuals have the easier, more relaxed jobs.

In regards to suitable couples handing their adopted children, I made a mistake. Instead, the children stay with their new family. It is only those who are "too pureblood" that are sent to the camps. Pureblood families are given the opportunity to peacefully hand over their children, or be met with extreme force.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

John had heard about how the Weasley family had such a positive impact on the Wizarding World and were not quite like everybody else. Not to say that he thought they were great people, just that they weren't the typical purebloods.

**** All right! The fleshed-out background makes more sense--thanks! :D That's pretty hardcore about the "dirty blood" thing and I can definitely see how it would make someone bent on revenge. Reminds me of Shoshanna in Inglorious Basterds and how having her whole family murdered in front of her drove her to her ultimate revenge plot.

I don't understand this:

#+begin_quote
  not able to use a wand because of his power
#+end_quote

Why would he not be able to use a wand? What does his power have to do with it? In canon, a wand is mainly a way of focusing and directing one's power, no?

#+begin_quote
  but he was a Hufflepuff, so what he could possibly be up to?
#+end_quote

This seems disingenuous. He's obviously ambitious and the Sorting Hat would have definitely picked up on that. What's your story for how he ended up in Hufflepuff?

#+begin_quote
  "too pureblood"
#+end_quote

I'm interested in what the criteria is for this. Is there a psychological test? Magical way of detecting? What about their former families? Do any of them miss them or are the children Obliviated from remembering their biological families? That could be another way of showing Diggory's cruelty. Are there pockets of resistance of families that were forced to give up their adopted children? Like you have a couple that tried for years to have children of their own, and then they're given this pureblood child to raise and they adore him, but due to some arbitrary "too pureblood" decision, he's taken away. I can definitely see that driving some parents to desperate measures.

This seems like weak reasoning. I feel you can make a much more stronger argument for leaving the Weasleys alone. John Diggory remembers the previous timeline and how the Weasleys were then--what was it specifically about them that led to him letting them flourish in this new timeline? How are they different in this timeline? They see all of these bad things happening to other pureblood families--what sets them apart? It can't just be because you want Ron to be a playboy superhero. :D Give the reader a concrete reason to go all in on Ron being a playboy superhero.

#+end_quote

John's tremendous power through such a focus would be like trying to squeeze your arm through a straw - impossible. Wands would either be unresponsive or combust. Plus, John wouldn't want to depend on such a tool, which further separates him from other witches and wizards. From a young age, he trained intensely with wandless magic, until it became second nature to him.

#+begin_quote
  This seems disingenuous. He's obviously ambitious and the Sorting Hat would have definitely picked up on that. What's your story for how he ended up in Hufflepuff?
#+end_quote

It was definitely a hatstall between Slytherin and Hufflepuff. John was incredibly ambitious, as he wanted to accomplish something great at such a grand scale, along with having a pragmatic mind. However, above all else, John had unwavering loyalty to his comrades and to his cause. He worked hard - harder than most could even imagine - and was unfailingly kind to anyone who wasn't pureblood or a sympathiser. Even then, he always tried to be civil. He also wanted to make a statement about those who are underestimated i.e. Hufflepuff.

  It is more of a psychological test. Is the child attached to their pureblood family? Can they be "persuaded" to love their new family more? This is why the Righteous tend to prefer taking the children when they are younger, as the older ones would most likely need to be obliviated.
#+end_quote

The thing that is very important to remember is that John wants the Righteous to be different from the DEs. They won't be cruel for the sake of being cruel - if a peaceful solution can be reached, they will choose it. Any member of the Righteous who are needlessly cruel or sadistic will be dealt with immediately. Even so, if they don't hand over their child, they will be punished, depending on how much they resist. This can lead to obliviation of more than just the memory of their child(ren). Pockets of resistance mostly comprised of parents does sound like a good idea to explore.

The main purpose of taking pureblood children is to "rehabilitate" them and ensure they turn out to be much more muggle-aligned. Those who don't are sent to juvenile detention centres, until they are of age, where if they deemed "too pureblood" are sent to the camps.

#+end_quote

Well, I wouldn't call Shatterpoint!Ron a playboy; he is too focused on his mission against John and the Righteous. But in all seriousness, Ron was not taken away by the Righteous /from birth/ because of who they were in the original timeline. John was going to take him away, having already separated the other Weasleys, when he was a bit older, but a deal was made - haven't really decided what deal yet - that spared Ron.

Furthermore, as Ron got older and submitted wondrous inventions to the world that you wouldn't expect from a pureblood, John decided that he was an exception to the rule, if barely. To be honest, this explanation is still in the works, so I'd be open to any suggestions.
