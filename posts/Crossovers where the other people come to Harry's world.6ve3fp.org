** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) shows a /Dungeons & Dragons/ wizard called Milo teleported into the /Harry Potter/ world. It's a clever and often very funny story, and is totally within the reach of someone who doesn't even know anything about /Dungeons & Dragons/ beyond "It's a fantasy-themed RPG."

linkffn(The Stag and the Dragon) starts with the cracky premise that since literally /anyone/ would have been better than Umbridge, none other than Darth Vader is hired as the D.A.D.A. teacher. Then it takes it dead-seriously and, despite a few narrative wonky moments, manages to mix the /Star Wars/ and /Harry Potter/ worlds better than anyone could imagine.

  Crossover and OoTP AU. It's Harry's fifth year, and a desperate Dumbledore hires a new Dark Arts teacher who might prove to wreak more havoc than Umbridge ever could... Darth Vader.

**** Man I miss HP and the Natural 20. Towards the end there Milo had really fallen into the background for the random sideplot character though. She was an interesting OC but her storyline didn't flow into the main one at all.

  "But have you SEEN this man?" she went on as if determined to find fault with the applicant. "If he's not a dark wizard, he certainly looks the part. Should we trust him? And will the students trust a teacher who..."

  "Wardrobe choices notwithstanding, Minerva, we have no choice," Dumbledore told her kindly but with a quiet firmness.

*** MOD stories often have Harry traveling to another world when he dies or goes through the veil. It's pretty common in other fandoms.

** linkffn(The Root of Darkness) by Amorphis760 crossovers to Harry Potter where the SI MC finds himself in HP world in the later chapters. I really recommend this. MC goes to HP pretty later chapters though.

  I was nothing special before I died the first time but when something offers me the chance to live again I take it. Reborn into a world of death I will survive. There will be no mercy and no pity. For there are monsters that roam this world and to survive I might have to become one myself. Elements of the Gamer and X-overs in later chapters.

**** The alt. universe Potters being assholes was an interesting take, I just wish Ginny and Ron hadn't been written as being so dumb (weirdly naïve too for people who just fought for their lives in a war a few months prior). I was hoping they were meeting with Hadrian to secretly scope him out but I guess not. -_-
