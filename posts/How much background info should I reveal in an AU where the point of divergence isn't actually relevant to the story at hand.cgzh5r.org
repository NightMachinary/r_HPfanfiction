To be more specific, I'm writing an AU where Voldemort is killed (for good, horcruxes and all) before the prophecy is even made. The only relevance this has to the story is to provide a different upbringing for Harry; the story itself focuses on Harry and family when he's ~7yrs old.

I know all the details of how V's end happens, but I'm unsure how much I should reveal to readers given its relative lack of importance. Can I get away with just saying he's dead, that he was defeated in battle before Harry was born, and leave it at that? One of my possible starts includes a memorial event for the war just to establish V's death, but I fear that draws too much attention to the matter.

Any advice?


** If your story is about worldbuilding, then you should definitely explain the PoD at some point. If your story is more about the characters and character development, then it isn't important and can be glossed over.

** Just subliminally hint at it (Character talking about it or something), and then drop the bomb when you want the reveal.

** You can have characters mention that in a dialogue. For example, when reading magical history with his mother, Harry asks Lily what actually happened to this Lord Voldemort, so she gives him a lecture right there.

Or Lily is working as an Unspeakable, and she's leading a project that attempts to counter future dark lords with Horcruxes. Her point is that they got lucky since Voldemort only used artifacts for his Horcruxes, so they could be identified and tracked down with relative ease. But how would they deal with a future dark lord who only uses mundane objects for Horcruxes? She can have this conversation with some fellow team members, and you can do a lengthy exposition here.

*** I think perhaps I was unclear in my post. I'm not concerned with *how* to reveal the information, but whether I *should*, and if so then how much. It's not pertinent to the story I'm telling (a family-focused mystery) but I worry that if I don't give /some/ info on V's death, then readers will just end up asking me about it. Or perhaps I'm just overthinking, and as long as V remains irrelevant then readers would be perfectly happy with the story presented?

**** I disagree with the others; going into too much detail might disrupt the flow of the story, especially since you're writing a "family-focused mystery" and Voldemort and his defeat (probably?) won't be relevant at all. A brief mention/description is a good idea to include, but I don't think there should be much beyond a brief description. What's reasonable to tell a 7 year old Harry (if that's how you work it in)? That's probably how much it should be discussed. Saying he was defeated in battle by x person is fine, going into details about who destroyed his horcruxes and when and how is, in my opinion, too much.

If you want to, you could explain it in A/N or post a companion short of Voldemort's defeat.

But ultimately, it's your story. If you've got an idea that you think works, go for it.

**** You definitely should, it's always annoying to see a massive divergance with no explanation.

** The best sort of writing is where an author demonstrates that they did the research without spelling it out for you. Something like how the Martian both comes across as knowedgeable of science and if you fact check any of the numbers it works out, but he has no need to explain all the details he worked out on how a spaceship would get to Mars.

It is hard to do. Many professional books fail in this. Still...

** Drop enough hints to figure out the differences here and there, maybe flashbacks to previous events that happened differently.

** Considering it's a major divergence, maybe put it in the description and put a note at the beginning
