I'd like something that'll keep me reading for a while, preferably with a bit of angst here and there, and no OP!Harry either. I wouldn't mind crack, but those are usually short, completely open to crossovers, and I'd love if it's complete! I don't really care if there's a pairing or not, but I usually don't enjoy HP characters with one another (no clue why, I've just never been into them) SI/(insert canon character) Reader/(insert canon character) are big no-nos for me, and if an OC/(insert canon character) is well enough done, I'll give it a go. Hope that's not too many requirements, also, I only know English, sooooo.


** Fates gamble part 1 and 2 are very good. Idk how to link them but just google that and add fanfix and you will find em

**** If you enjoy it, there's a different crossover with Fate Zero by Carnivorous_Muffin. Might need to read Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus first. If you enjoy it though, there are several good crossovers and one shots.

I also enjoy Full Metal Alchemist crossovers where Ed (or someone else) teaches Alchemy. Best one I can think of is The Colours of the World. I read several of these crossovers before I watched FMA and enjoyed them.

*** This bÂ¡tch (me) does not have the necessary patience needed for stuff like that, so unfortunately, no use to me, but thanks for letting me know bout this.
