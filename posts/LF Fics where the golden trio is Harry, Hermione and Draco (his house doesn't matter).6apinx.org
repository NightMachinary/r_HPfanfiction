No bashing, please. Also no slash or gender bender.


** Just read linkao3(the king's Indian attack) and it's the three of them to start with, with Daphne Greengrass joining later.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy. However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

** Edit to add: I just noticed you said no slash. The first and second stories are good. They are strictly friends in the first story. Harry realizes Draco might like him in the 2nd story but that's it as far as slash goes in that one.

The only one I know of is the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/53590][Leo Inter Serpentes series]]. Just so you know, the third story introduces the Draco/Harry pairing as well. There is also Mentor!Snape in there in earnest by the third story.

As far as I remember, the Golden Trio aspect is the most relevant in the first story.

  A retelling of the original series, but this time, our hero wears green and silver, not red and gold.
