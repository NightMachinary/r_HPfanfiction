I read this oneshot a long damn time ago and I can't seem to figure out exactly what it was, and I've spent far too long searching. Basically, it was a post-Voldie thing with Harry finishing his last year of Hogwarts. He starts wooing Daphne Greengrass and it seems cute, and at some point he... Kills her, I think? Or just petrified her or something, but it was in the Chamber of Secrets. It seemed pretty well written... Maybe, but as far as I remember it was a nicely done messed-up Harry.


** Sounds like Intoxication by NosTresReges. Sadly their stuff has been pulled but the fic may exist in someone's [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86859311/Intoxication%2C%20a%20harry%20potter%20fanfic%20_%20FanFiction.pdf][archive]].

*** Yep. Intoxication is awesome.

Do you have any of the author's other stuff? I heard s/he wrote at least two other fanfics, but I've no idea where to get them.

*** Thank you so much! That makes sense- I was looking through a hell of a lot of them and I never saw anything. You're the best, man.
