So, I'm looking for fics where Harry isn't really sure how to be a person and interact with other people and learns over the course of the story - like Parsel (Link below), where he has to adapt to being Human and doesn't quite get anything at first. Or that one where Sirius raised him as a soldier to kill Voldemort, then he gets to attend Hogwarts after Voldie is dead and has pretty much no idea how to be a regular person (if anyone is curious about finding that one - I don't remember the title, but I think it was longfic with a slowburn Harry-Ginny pairing and I read it on FFNet a couple years back).

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

** Have you tried, The Left Words? The abuse Harry suffers as a child really effects his ability to interact with anyone and function at Hogwarts. It takes him a long time to make friends, interact well with other students, and finally open up to others and form bonds himself.

Slash, but no smut (the violence in general is much more graphic); although there is one scene where Harry gets trapped and ends up watching 2 characters having sex that is not explicitly described (it's literally these 2 lines: he has to watch all that happens, all movements and every moan. He's relieved when it stops. )

**** I was worried when I started to read this because it has 13 parts in the series! Almost all are not relevant to the main story, just different AU 'what if?' one-shots. The final one, Growth Left (18K words), is the best of all and made reading the angst, suffering, and setbacks in the first/main story worth it. It won't make sense without reading the entirety of The Left Words, but I'd highly recommend it.

I don't usually like soulbond/soulmates fic, but I liked this interpretation of if!
