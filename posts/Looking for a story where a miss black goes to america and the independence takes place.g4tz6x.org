This is a long story divider in different stories. It begins with a Hogwarts fair and a female member of the black family decides that she had enough of her family and decides to take a job with the "overseas department". In the beginning se stays in contact with a magic drawer to communicate with England. There are even some aventures with a small pumpkin pie. Then the revolution happens and she decides to stay and they lose contact. Her cover in the colonies is to run an inn. The sleeping dragon in think it was. Then in the sequel she decides to come back to England where her father/parents had dies in the meanwhile. She reunites with her younger twin brothers who are minister of magic and her sister(s) who wrote a book about the pumpkin pie at the annual family fest where a professor potter is maries in to the family.

The story could also be a crossover but i'm not sure about that
