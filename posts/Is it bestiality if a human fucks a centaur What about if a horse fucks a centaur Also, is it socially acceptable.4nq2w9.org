** In the Wizarding World, there are beings and there are beasts. Beings have near-human intelligence. Beasts have animal levels of intelligence.

Centaurs /should/ be classed as beings, but despite possessing 'human intelligence', centaurs are classified as Beasts by the Ministry of Magic, at their own request, as they were unhappy at having to share Being status with hags and vampires.

So technically, it's bestiality.

However, it's really not morally bestiality as centaurs can understand the request for sex and give verbal consent.

It's probably not too socially acceptable, I would guess, seeing as how some wizards take offense when wizards fuck muggles and those are humans.

How on earth does the way he was cast out suggest so? Not to mention that the other centaurs are as versed in divining astronomy as he is, and casually discuss it in front of Harry in the first book.

** I'd say that it's xenophilia if a human and a centaur get it on consensually. It's icky to some people, but shouldn't actually be illegal under a just system imo. They're different species (presumably) who are both demonstrably sapient, and therefore capable of giving verbal consent, therefore I don't have a problem with it. If we met sapient aliens, and the sexual deviants of both species decided to try getting it on, I wouldn't have a problem with that at all.

If a horse fucks a centaur, it's kind of the same situation as a horse fucking a human, by the same metric. Seems reasonably clear-cut, tbh.

Here's a thought though, that occurred to me as I was reading this thread... what about /snakes/? They can talk and reason in the Potterverse, though apparently only parseltongues can understand them. They're definitely sentient, and debatably sapient, so is it bestiality if you get it on with a giant snake? Kinda a grey area, really.

Oh, another one... transfiguration. Not animagi, but straight human transfiguration. If you turn yourself into a non-sapient animal with the intent to have sex with another non-sapient animal, with the knowledge that you'll change back some time later... is /that/ bestiality, or just two non-sapient animals having sex? And how does that interact with the above if you turn yourself into a snake?

I think this should be considered normal /if/ you inform beforehand your non-sapient partner-to-be that you're a transfigured human and should be considered both bestiality and rape if you fail to do so.

**** So d'you mean 'Hey horse, I'm gonna be a horse in a minute so we can screw, but just so you know, I'll turn back into a human when we're done. I know you can't understand me, and I won't be able to understand the concept of consent in a minute because I'll be a perfectly normal transfigured horse, but just so that we're clear...'

or do you mean, 'When I transform into a perfectly normal non-sapient horse, I'll do my damnedest to remember that I need to tell you I'm a human before we fuck. I probably won't, because I'll be a horse and therefore unable to really understand what I mean, but... here goes?'

Because both seem fairly pointless, but I agree with the first in principle. I don't think the second would really work, unless you were a horse animagus, in which case we're back to the bestiality by default.

***** Exactly as absurd as that, yes.

OP's question reminded me of the recent UK ruling /[[https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4ngh99/trans_people_in_uk_could_face_rape_charges_if/][(“Trans people in UK could face rape charges if they don't reveal gender history”)]]/, and the association made me laugh, so I decided to frame that into a comment.

Just to make sure: I do not mean to imply that having sex with trans people should be considered bestiality or anything stupid like that. Rather, if the drawn line on whether or not sex with another creature should be ok is based on them giving a /verbal/ consent, then one may as well go the full length and apply all human standards to the potential animal partners --- in which case your scenarios would apply.

** Bestiality is sex with animals, i.e. creatures that can't give consent and are non-sapient. That's why it's considered a bad thing to sproink your dog. And probably why centaur-horse relations would be just as disapproved as human-Harambe relations.

If we ever discover aliens, human-alien relations wouldn't be bestiality in any sci-fi sense. Fantasy creatures/races would follow similarly. Really, we view centaurs through a human-centric view by describing them as half-horse, they would probably see us as hairless apes.

Note that through this biased logic, as they are known to be sapient, I would fully approve of Pokemon-human relations... Of all sorts.

**** Shine on, you crazy, beautiful pedant. The issue of bestiality is muddled enough without confusing our terms by implying that we aren't also animals. The issue with bestiality isn't even /about/ the idea of 'sex with animals'. It's solely about consent, and the ability to meaningfully give it.

Also, given that a centaur is notably sapient, them screwing a horse would be just as bad as us doing it. Unless horses are somehow sapient in the Potterverse. Who knows, apparently fucking /snakes/ are sapient, after all.
