I am looking for any stories that preferably start in first year of Hogwarts, although au in early Hogwarts is also good. Hopefully it is, if not a series, a long fic that details the entire time at Hogwarts and perhaps a bit beyond. Yes i realize au is kind of broad, however I really am looking for nearly any kind of au there is, althoughIi would prefer if there are pairings for them to not be harry/ginny. Bonus points if they're harry/draco. I'm down for anything so hit me with your best shot.


** Problem of Potions is the only complete fic I can think of that goes years 1-7 at Hogwarts (iirc). Essentially it's a Harry that really likes potions, much to the chagrin of Snape. Fairly cute and lighthearted. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335]])

The Art of Self-Fashioning is complete and has Neville as the BWL, the Potters in St. Mungo's and Harry as a transfiguration prodigy. Really dark, really well written. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5103614/chapters/11740079]])

HPMOR is the longest of all of them, is complete, very AU but the story concludes at the end of the first year. Many people don't care for the Harry in this fic, but I really enjoyed the Voldemort, the humor and most of the story. It was my introduction to fanfiction.

Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived is my favorite WBWL fic because Harry actually gets along with my family. Harry ends up going to Durmstrang after a single term at Hogwarts. Really good, but incomplete.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]])

Magical Relations is a fic where Dudley is also a wizard. This is fun, but incomplete at the start of year 6. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/331625/chapters/535217]])

On the Way to Greatness is my favorite Slytherin!Harry fic. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness]])

Hogwarts Battle School is neither complete nor does it start in the first year, but I thought the AU was pretty cool. It's Ender's Game shoved into the world of Harry Potter (you don't need to have read Ender's Game beforehand though).

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

  Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. AU.Harry and Dudley's first year at Hogwarts. Highlights include bullying, subversive tactics, new friends, and misplaced magical objects.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) spends a long time (too long imo) in the first couple years at Hogwarts. Heavily AU and tons of world-building.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) is only years 1-3. Sequel is updating at a glacial pace, so I wouldn't expect it to ever finish.

Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is just year 1 and the sequels are even longer. Again, tons of world-building beyond canon.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace.

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.
