Two good ones I've read have been [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8624601/1/][The Time Spiral]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/][To Shape and Change.]]

What are some other good time travel fics? Any characters/pairings.

One of the best fanfics, and I didn't see it in the previous post...

** Several ideas, in rough order from most- to least-recommended:

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7086910/1/Retroactive][Retroactive, by wordhammer]]. Not your usual time travel: A couple hours after the Department of Mysteries, Harry asks Luna if they could go back then. If I needed to pick one fic from my list, it'd be this.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4061219/1/The-Time-Meddlers][The Time Meddlers, by witowsmp]]. Harry and Hermione time-travel back and fix things - but then things start going wrong in a new way...

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7516619/1/][Of Time and the Snorkack, by Wrexscar]]. A surprisingly different Luna gets an unexpected chance to fix things early. Also see the sequel [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8619927/1/The-Time-of-Consequences][The Time of Consequences]], which Wrexscar unfortunately but maturely abandoned after realizing he didn't know where to take it.

- [[http://onj1.andrelouis.com/hp/esama/Unsealed.txt][Unsealed, by esama]]. One-shot, looking back on Harry's surprising time-traveling. Esama took it down from fanfiction.net, but it's archived elsewhere.

- [[http://fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns, by kb0]]. Your usual travel-back-and-fix-it story... but with an unusual protagonist, leading to novel difficulties and style.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5137164/12/Double-Time-Trouble][Double Time Trouble, by Skysaber]]. Hermione gets a twin self. Then the universe explodes. Then they wind up back in time. Then after many interesting things, the story starts going off the rocker (a frequent problem with this author)... shortly after which, it's abandoned (also very frequent). Still worth reading, at least in my mind.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4612714/1/][Knowledge is Power, by robst]]. Just about anything by him is a guilty pleasure, considering how Harry and Hermione (always paired) always solve their problems easily and spend the rest of the fic showing us readers around. But his premises and other touches are so good that they sometimes almost make up for it.
