I'm wanting some crack. Anyone want to suggest some crack-fics that are still actively updating on at least a semi-regular basis? Thank you!

***** Some if it you might get a little confused about but it mostly takes place at Hogwarts/Magical world. Just keep in mind Byakugan can see through stuff, Sharingan can predict movement and copy things, Itachi isn't evil and Hari is pretty prodigal by Naruto standards. Most of the japanese terms have been put into english. Leaf/Sand/Sound/Rock/Grass/Waterfall/Mist/Rain (Dunno if I forgot any) are villages where ninja live. For now, a majority of the plot is in Harry Potter, but once it gets to focusing more on Naruto-things for a bit, you might want to check out the Naruto wiki.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

I'm not sure which I like better. They are both good in their own way. FYI: It says complete, but its still being updated.

  Draco Malfoy was a strange child, even by wizard standards. Actually, no, scratch that, to say he was strange would be putting it lightly, to be frank, Draco was a insane pyromaniac who had already committed multiple acts of arson by the time he was five. Not that anyone would ever say anything about it of course. And knowing Deidara, for him this was downright tame.(Reincarnation)

** linkffn(fragments by dogbertcarrol)

and also More Fragments, Yet More Fragments, Yet Again Even More Fragments...

Dogebertcarrol is pretty cracky all around so you could just run through his entire library, but the fragments are great for crack that hasn't found a home in its own story yet...and sometimes you can find one that DID get turned into a story

Also.. linkffn(odd ideas by rorschach's blot)

edit: There are Harry Potter fragments in DBC's stuff FYI..

Seems to me that most fans of HP are also fans of Stargate(crossovers), Buffy/Angel, and Naruto fanfiction.

If you are running low on HP and havent tried any of the others, give them a try!

  The reasoning of pureblood fanatics is incomprehensible to anyone halfway normal, and even Harry Potter is close enough to ordinary to find himself at a loss for how on earth Narcissa Malfoy so suddenly became Mrs. Ronald Weasley. [crackship, crackfic, crack premise; Roncissa, lemon-scented]

  Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy seek each other out in the dead of the night at Hogwarts during sixth year for some quiet respite from the drama unfolding in their lives leading to a secret relationship between the two. Full of Dark Marks, grief, teenage angst awkwardness. Arts by the lovely FreyaIshtar!
