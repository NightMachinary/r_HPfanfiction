** Why would muggles support Voldemort?

Also, I hate to bring in real world American politics, but this is exactly like the OK hand sign and white supremacists. Quick lesson for those not in the know: 4chan thought it would be funny to convince "the media" that the ok hand sign was a white supremacist symbol. It got a little attention from low quality media sites, so white supremacists started using it "ironically." Then they started using it not so ironically. Now, every time someone makes the OK sign, they get accused of being a white supremacist. It's annoying because it's still the OK sign when most people use it. It's only a white supremacy dog whistle when used by white supremacists.

So even if it was some kind of wizarding secret sign for Voldemort, it would still just be the victory sign for muggles.

** And if they're angled downwards that means "Albus", which means anti-voldemort.
