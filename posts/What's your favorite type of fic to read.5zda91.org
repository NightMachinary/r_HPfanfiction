** The good kind.

But for real, though, I like AU stories best. Whether it's a point of divergence fic or a change in the function of magic as we know it in canon, I just really enjoy reading it.

My guilty pleasures include well-researched (this is a must) time travel, unusual relationship dynamics (platonic or otherwise), and reading about Harry overcoming odds in a manner that makes a shocking splash in whatever I'm reading. I love the 'reveal' of some power or a long-kept secret. It's probably one of the reasons why The Pureblood Pretense has me by the lapels even after nearly a year without updates.

How about yours?

*** I also love stuff that's super AU (but really fleshed out, of course). I also really enjoy ones that have a lot of political stuff in them. - it just adds a whole other dimension to the work.

There's also the occasional fic like Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness that is more or less canon compliant but is just superbly written.

**** Do you more like the scheming nature of political characters in a story, or the world-building and expounding narrative most associated with fanfiction that features it? Character-driven and world-driven. It's difficult to decide which is more interesting. I think it relies on the writing style. If a story can do both, I have heart eyes.

** My favorite type of fics are canon-compliant, post battle H/G stories that go up until they get married. They are my favorite because Rowling's ending (minus the epilogue) left a lot of unanswered questions that were more about the characters than the overall plot. I like the fics that seek to answer these questions.

HOWEVER....

Once you've read a couple, you sort of read them all. As such, I've branched out slowly into other genres. I started with alternative POV, canon compliant 7th year fics, then did AU post-war, then time travel, and finally alternate OOTP and HBP/ independent Harry fics. At the end of the day, as long as its written well, is believable and doesn't ruin my preferred ships and characterizations, I'll enjoy anything.

** I like post-Hogwarts fic that examines how messed up a lot of those kids would be as adults after going through all that trauma. I don't really like it going too far- I don't want Harry who can't tell the difference between hallucinations and reality or anything like that, but fic that takes into account that he was a neglected kid who was purposely raised to have a martyr complex really fascinates me.

My favorite book in the actual series is /Half-Blood Prince,/ and a huge part of this is how it feels like Life at Hogwarts.

Also, I have a Hagrid-sized soft spot for stories that focus on Luna and Ginny, but keep the friendship platonic.

**** Harry Potter:

The Havoc side of the Force is hilarious. Fair warning, Senator Palpatine seems to be filling in for the usual 'evil Dumbledore' type character... though he actually /is/ evil so it works? I just like reading about Harry and *HK-47* gallivanting through the old republic.- linkffn(8501689)

Wand and Shield's early chapters before he settles into the MCU. Especially amusing are the ways he both accidentally and deliberately stymies Nick Fury's efforts to keep him under surveillance. - linkffn(8177168)

--------------

Not a Potter, still Harry:

Beyond the Outer Gate Lies is Harry Dresden (with Lash in tow!) winding up in Highschool DxD which is this weird almost softcore anime about Devils, Fallen Angels, and etc. Harry reacts to such circumstances /mostly/ as expected (aka no buildings have been burnt to their foundations /yet/ ) - linkffn(10202330)

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-song-of-ice-and-fires-that-werent-all-my-fault-asoiaf-dresden-files.336499/][A Song of Ice and Fires That Weren't All My Fault]] is Harry Dresden (with his daughter Maggie) in Bravos of Game of Thrones circa Robert's Rebellion. /Some/ of the locals seem to find his status as the *Winter* Knight to be concerning.

--------------

Not a Potter, Not a Harry:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/displaced-spider-man-dc-crossover.410660/][Displaced]] is Spiderman abruptly finding himself in Gotham. Snark ensues.

The rest of the ones I can think of are SIs doing the exploring rather than crossover characters.

  Harry Dresden had thought he'd seen it all. So had the voice inside his head for that matter. But when one of his all too typical wild weekends ends up with him stranded far outside the Outer Gates, beyond the stretch of even creation itself, he finds out that there are other things out there, laying in wait. Still doesn't make it any easier to make rent on time though...

Examples:

- A long journey home. After so much bad worldbuilding it's so refreshing. It does "ancient secret" right. The characters have flaws. Stuff doesn't work out. It has fun moments. Sadly I haven't found anything in that direction.
- Stages of Hope. It just showed me that tearjerkers can be done right.
- Oh God Not Again! OP timetravel in an awesome way.
- A Black Comedy. It's a great crackfic, that also does AU well.
- Perfectly Normal, Thank you very much. It's a great fic, showing that Dudley can grow up. Showing that Harry can forgive. Satisfied an itch I didn't know I had.

I know there are excellent fics out there that are AU/Time Travel/Canon Divergent that would rival the main series in quality and its amazing they exist but they just arn't my thing.

Of course being that picky makes finding Fics I like fairly difficult. I really wish canon complaint was a search term on some of the sites would make my life so much easier.

*** The problem with this is the fact that there are a lot of plotholes that imply a world a lot different from what the canon conclusions are.

For example Dumbledore placing the stone in a castle full of children with traps easily overcome by first years and a Cerberus behind a door anyone could open does not make him a good guy. Or no adult ever doing their job. Arthur is utterly incompetent (like apparently most of the ministry), the teachers ignore racism and bullying and let's not forget about Snape and his hate towards the Potters. And Dumbledore knowing about Harry's dark ten years make him a sick criminal and not some figure to look up to.

Malfoy is spurring genocidal propaganda since he was twelve, Ron is treating Hermione like shit and in the end, they both end up portrayed at least neutrally. Everyone conveniently forgets that one is a deserter while the other was a follower of magical Hitler for two years while sympathizing for at least eight.

Rowling's ideas about relationships are seriously wrong. We have the casual mention of rape drugs (Molly), obsessive behavior that gets you your partner in the end (James and Ginny), Snape and his obsession for Lily and Ron's constant abuse of Hermione. Molly and Ginny constantly berating Fleur springs to my mind as well. Probably the only healthy relationship displayed is Cedric/Cho and that was a background pairing.

I really love the world Rowling created, but for me, it's just the framework, not the finished thing.

** The first thing that jumps to mind are fics where Harry isnt a meak little boy blindly following Dumbledore or others.

I also prefer fics that are not afraid to offend or at least be realistic. An example of this is authors who write romance or violence into a story, but tap dance around things like "violence, murder, kissing and sex", afraid to offend readers or end up with Mature or Explicit ratings. In the real world teenagers in a school environment do PLENTY of dating with all that it entails, and dancing around it is just silly. And for gods sake, there is plenty of violence in the original books (kissing and implied sex to for that matter).

And fics that have unique and interesting ways of introducing Harry Potter (outside the old standby of Privet drive abusive home), are always interesting as well.

My guilty pleasure fics would be harem ones (Or at least female groupie or follower ones - and Harry doesnt have to be male) or superpowered Harry ones. These interests are likely my guy side leaking. Sorry ;)
