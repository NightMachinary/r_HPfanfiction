No slash please. :)


** linkffn(The Girl who Imprinted; Chrysoclorous) are imo the best ones. TGWI is unfortunately abandoned or in a massive hiatus, and Chrysoclorous hasn't been updated in a while, though I don't think its abandoned. Both are quite different from one another, with Humor being prevalent on TGWI and drama/angst (not teenage angst, don't worry) on Chrysoclorous. IMO, Chrysoclorous is the best fanfiction of Twilight(including source and xovers) I've ever read, though, I haven't read that many.

  The Volturi ran off with their tails between their legs, but a gathering that large of supernatural creatures attracted attention from the magical world. The magical world is still rebuilding from Voldemort so Harry gets sent. He finds trouble quickly with vampires - and an infatuated shape shifter.

*** The girl who imprinted was the fanfic that made me like fit/muscled women.

Aside from that I have read it three times as my guilty pleasure. The weakest part of the story is the Draco characterization. I can guess where the author was going, but it damaged the story a bit in my opinion.

  Harry Potter has just defeated Lord Voldemort as the Battle of Hogwarts draws to a close. Or so he thought. Suddenly needing to run, Harry ends up somewhere he could never have imagined: a Muggle hospital in America. When he finds himself in the care of a mysterious Dr Cullen, things start to go wrong. As innocent lives are put at stake, who comes out with their secrets intact?
