I always wondered why I never saw a fic that made use of this perfect opportunity. :)


** Probably because you'd be writing a whole new story around it. Lord knows it would be impossible to make canon fit in there without a crowbar, grease, and a few cables.

Well, yeah, thats kind of the point :)

And I'm not sure if it would really be so difficult. The Sherlock-side is easy enough, all we know is that Watson and his sister do not really get along, that her name is Harriet, her nickname is Harry and that she was in some kind of failed relationship with someone called Clara. That's a pretty loose frame, if you want to keep it.

The HP-side is admittedly a little more difficult, with the canonical Harry (or FemHarry in this case) obviously not having siblings. With the right approach it could be possible to form a believable AU, though.

And no, unfortunately I do not have a scenario on hand :)
