I've been seeing some heist movies, and it got me thinking: could you use a time-turner to steal itself and no one else even notice it's missing in the first place? Are there any fics where somebody does that?

I also wouldnt mind recommendations of fics with epics heists, if you know any.


** There was something I read a long time back that had Harry get into the Ministry, have a time-turner given to him by a stranger, do what he needs to do, and through a convoluted sequence give himself the ssame time-turner.

Also, a nonjon fic had that essentially be how the time-turner was invented. A guy got a visit from a stranger, who gave him instructions and built a working time-turner in front of him, which he then used to teach himself how to build a time-turner as the stranger.

Time travel is fun

**** I can't remember the first fic, sorry.

The nonjon fic with the time-turner was part of the "Where in the World is Harry Potter?" series, but I can't remember which story. Starts with linkffn(2354771)

For heisting, also by nonjon, A Black Comedy gets recommended a lot. No time travel, but there's an alternate universe involved: linkffn(3401052)

For the most intense time travel elements I can think of, linkffn(3928184). It says it's a sequel, but it's not important to have read the other part.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** There was a one-shot (I think it was actually posted on this subreddit fairly recently) about Dumbledore convincing a Department of Mysteries employee to give him a time turner by creating a forged copy and claiming that the employee had given it to him in the future. The employee was convinced and so happily handed a real one over when Dumbledore came in a couple minutes later to request a time turner.

Put in other words, Dumbledore exploits an implied causality loop to obtain a time machine---which he then uses to attend two different meetings at once (McGonagall impersonates him for yet a third).

*** I'd love to read a story, though, where someone does try to get smart, does mess with time, and against all odds, succeeds.

I mean, the usual trope played straight up until the very end, then it turns out the guy's really that smart (or lucky) and everything goes smoothly in the end.

*** but wouldn't it be a self-sustaining loop?

I mean, imagine your future self hands you a time-turner and says "you will not believe what we just did" and then you just... /you have to do it/, otherwise Paradox. You know? But of course, you'd be given the newly-stolen time-turner, then you'd use it for whatever you needed, then use it to break into the Department of Mysteries and steal it, give it to your past-self, then place the older, used time-turner right back in place at the time you stole it, and nobody notices it was ever missing.

A bit... complex, maybe, and would need a lot of planning, but ultimately doable imo. Also extremely /epic/

**** That's true, but the way I'm seeing it, canon Time-Turners work by [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutTime][Tricking Out Time]] rather than by an "actual" time loop, which would be why it works out if you go back a small enough amount of time, but you change the present if you go back hundreds of years (/Pottermore/) or even just a couple of decades (/Cursed Child/). As a result, I don't think this would work.
