I've already read Taure's Alexandra Potter, SlyGoddess' A Butterfly Effect and wordhammer's Holly Evans and the Spiral Path. Those are the only good (At least 3/5) school years fem!Harry fics I can remember reading off the top of my head. Are there any others?

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)

** linkffn(8233291) is another fantastic fic, and it's part of a large series too!

Though it's very dark and has child abuse and pedophilia (not sexualised) as part of it's themes. And it starts in fourth year.

** linkffn(Looking Beyond by shinigamigirl196) is one I found to be decent, and it's very long.

Just a warning- it's mostly a canon rehash with a few minor differences (Hope (Fem!Harry) is more than willing to kill enemies; Horcrux hunt is slightly different) until after Voldemort is dead. After that, it goes into new territory involving Greek mythology.

EDIT: Just remembered that she has a newer, in-progress one that is not a rehash: linkffn(Serpent Tongue by shinigamigirl196)

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived.(Greek Myths Abound) Fem!Harry
