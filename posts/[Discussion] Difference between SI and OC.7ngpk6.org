Hey everyone! So there's been a lot of SI threads on this sub lately, and as I was going through them, I couldn't help but notice that some of the SI descriptions sounded more like OCs than SIs. Now, I know that that SI stands for self-insert, but would that self-insert just include same name and physical features + full change of personality, or they other way around? Why would an OC not be considered an SI, or does it?

I used to think that I knew what the difference was, and I think I still do, but I wanted to clear it up and hear what you all have to say as well.

Thank you in advance, and Happy New Year!

*** This is similar to my view, although I also like to point out that an SI to the world is an OC, and really isn't an SI to anyone but the author and maybe close friends who know them.

*** Sorta unrelated, but question. What are some good ways to get your SI sucked into the HP verse? I know death is common but its a bit cliche.

** The line between OC and SI is blurry, but I generally draw the line at meta knowledge; if a character explicitly or implicitly has meta and foreknowledge, they're an SI (that is, even if they don't say that they know things that they shouldn't, if they make a decision based on knowledge that they shouldn't possess, they're an SI). Otherwise, they're an OC.

I should mention that some authors - myself included - deliberately blur this even further. I have a /Naruto/ story I'm working on where the SI is an OC from our world who was inserted into Naruto. Niko/Kenta /isn't/ me and doesn't share all my values or personality traits, but I write him as if he were an SI character. This is basically the inverse of [[/u/Deathcrow][u/Deathcrow]]'s point about sneaky SIs pretending to be an OC.

*** This gets even harder to distinguish with time travel stories. If someone comes back in time with meta knowledge, how different are they from an SI? Especially if you use a somewhat minor character who lacked development to do so.

**** Then the line blurs even more. But there's still a distinction: a time traveler came from in-universe and only knows the stuff he himself knows. Conversely, a SI will have seen stuff from an outside perspective. If, say, Susan Bones went back in time, she'd still have no idea where the Chamber of Secrets was or what was in it, whereas an SI would. Unfortunately, poor writing can make this even harder to distinguish, as a bad writer might give their character meta-knowledge by mistake.

** Eh IMHO that's a judgement call... I've read a few stories that had an OC and only after a few chapters it became obvious that they are sneaky SI fics. Symptoms include: Mary-Sue-ish OC, long ranty monologues by the OC about canon events, the OC always being right and winning arguments with his/her incredible wit. There's a lot more red-flags of course, but they can be kind of subtle.

In any case, I enjoy some honest and self-aware SI fics, but almost always nope out of "sneaky" SI/OC fics ("Random OC character goes to Hogwarts, who is basically the Author and messes with canon").

** Example... Harry gets a summer job, his boss and co-workers are OC's because they were not in the books or movies. Harry gets a girlfriend that is a muggle, OC. The girl from the coffee shop in the movie, who is a muggle, gets expanded upon... movie canon OC.

Daphne or Astoria Greengrass, Canon OC unless you use a lot of tropes built up in fanfiction over the years, in which case you might call them Fanon OC.

Main Character of the story being non-canon or canon OC and written from the Authors viewpoint? Probably SI. Original Supporting character (or very out of character canon character) that is used to express the authors viewpoint, SI.

Harry expressing authors viewpoint to an extreme...borderline SI, usually goes hand-in-hand with Mary-Sue.

Mary-Sue is usually someone who knows everything, can do any spell perfectly, gets godlike powers, gets the harem, etc... There is a fine line where you can make a God-like Harry with a Harem that is not a Mary Sue character... but its an easy line to cross.

** A self-insert is supposed to represent the author... or represents the author out of some wish-fulfillment thing. A SI will generally have the same opinions, likes and dislikes as the author, and often look like an idealised, beautified version of the author.

Obviously these are not required traits of an OC, which is a lot broader as a term.

** By definition, a self-insert is the author themselves, while an OC is a character created for the story, independent of the author's personality. However you will always find overlap. Some author's OCs will always have many elements of themselves while others will be more gifted in creating characters which meld into the setting as if they were canon characters themselves.

SIs can also be written with knowledge of the fourth wall, it's quite popular, but not necessary and I personally think an SI which is dropped into the world unaware of the entire plot is much more interesting, but then it all depends on the capability of the author.

In a way it's impossible to tell if an OC is an SI if you don't know the author or they don't state it explicitly. You can try to guess based on how real the character seems, but if an author is skilled their OCs will seem real while if they're the opposite even a self-insert will seem like a made up person.

** Any self-insert is an original character, but only some original characters are self-inserts. Original characters are based on ... things, sometimes on people we know, sometimes on ourselves, sometimes on other characters, often times a combination of those and even other things. Self-inserts are original characters that, on the most basic level, are based on the writer, on the writer only, and on the writer fully.

The one notable difference between the two is that most people don't seem to have it in them to criticise themselves by acknowledging their flaws, faults, shortcomings, and failures, which leads to self-inserts often enough being perfect to the point where it is boring and somewhat annoying and to them never failing which is more of the same. A well-done self-insert is one who is indistinguishable from standard-issue original character because they have their strong and weak side alike, because they have flaws, make mistakes, but sometimes succeed too. A well-done self-insert also requires somewhat in-depth introspection of ourselves, present and past, and acknowledgement of our innermost faults, dreams, fears, but also those strong points that nobody knows about because they only shine through at the time of need when nobody is looking.

I've written a few original characters in my life. Some of them have traits that come from myself, but ultimately if you were to materialise them next to me nobody would be able to say that they are me because they aren't, they just may be similar in some aspects but it would be easy to tell that they're different people. And I've written exactly one self-insert. For what it is worth she is an original character because she is created by me rather than being taken from some other work, but she clearly is a version of myself and if you were to materialise her and put her next to me aged the same as the character the only differences would be those that were required to allow the character to be in the story and at best you'd have people saying they are twins because outside of those required differences and the divergence in character development that happens during the course of the story they would be pretty much identical.

**** I'm ... very much unsure how that is relevant to my comment specifically. I haven't read your story and thus cannot judge your character, not to mention that I have never read/seen/played/whatever the other side of the crossover, so ... that.

Unless you were just bragging that you've made a self-insert, I guess.
