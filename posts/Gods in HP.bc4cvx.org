What if the ancient gods were just wizards, and this was before the statue of secrecy?


** This is a pretty common thing for authors to include, I think. The furthest I've seen it taken is linkffn(The Long Game by inwardtransience), which has multiple immortal characters.

I personally like the idea in theory, but it comes across as rather disrespectful sometimes so I generally prefer to say some legendary heroes were magical instead.

#+begin_quote
  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

*** As a big fan of this idea: not that I know of. It /could/ be the case, but canon doesn't say. And there /are/ those who prefer to think wizards were more like shamans, wise-men, priests and the like, than gods.

**** Pottermore mentioned that Isolt Sayre(the founder of Ilvermony) was a descendant of the witch Morrigan, who is a goddess in Irish mythology.

***** Ah, interesting. Although, to keep playing Devil's advocate... it's a point in the theory's favor, yes, but not necessarily a ringing endorsement; could this not simply be another case of witches and wizards naming themselves /after/ deities, much like Minerva McGonagall (who clearly isn't actually the goddess Minerva)?

****** This is the quote where she is mentioned

#+begin_quote
  Her father, William Sayre, was a direct descendant of the famous Irish witch Morrigan, an Animagus whose creature form was a crow. William nicknamed his daughter â€˜Morrigan' for her affinity for all natural things when she was young.
#+end_quote

A famous Irish Witch named Morrigan who can turn into a crow and is associated with natural thing , basically has to be the goddess Morrigan who often appeared in form of a Crow and was connected to land and animals. In this case Rowlings intentions seem pretty clear.

**** Legends and myths evolved from simple feats of strength. Fiendfyre spell would have considered a wizard a god in ancient times. The God of Fire or some such...

**** You seem to have a high opinion of humanity. We see water flow downhill and suddenly that's proof the Earth is flat. It doesn't take much to convince the uneducated of anything you want especially when you can do magic.

***** You misread me; I wasn't saying /I/ disagreed with the theory, only that A) canon doesn't say it itself, and B) there are people who hold differing views.
