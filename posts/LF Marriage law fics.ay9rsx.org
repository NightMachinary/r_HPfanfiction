So as the title says. I'm looking for your favourite marriage law give preferably with Harry as the MC. Not opposed to slash but will give anything a bash üòè


** linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution)

Who says that the population would blindly accept a marriage law? In this one, the DA quickly organizes a very violent resistance against the Ministry, other magical governments don't like it, and soon all of europe is at war.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** This sub-genre just isn't my thing, but I did really like /The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic/ in a snarky, darkly-humorous, and very morally dubious way. linkffn(5802874). Even its summary has always cracked me up a little.EDIT: Also, I can't forget to mention S'TarKan's /There's Always a Way./ It's much...nicer? Less morally dubious? linkffn(2612901)

** You need to realize that a marriage law is so fucked up that even Nazis, Stalinists, and Maoists didn't dare to push for. The only regime that did something similar in real world was the Khmer Rouge. If you don't know what kind of monsters they are, google it.

A Harry or Hermione who has beaten Voldemort will react very violently to this shit, very violently. However, if this shit gets passed before they got really strong, then running away is the only option, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/][Escape]], linkffn(11916243).

This sub takes an extremely dim view of the marriage law trope. Most recommendations you get will be about how to fight it.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play

  SSHP. To avoid the machinations of the Ministry, Harry must marry a reluctant Severus Snape. But marriage to Snape is only the beginning of Harry's problems. Voldemort has returned, and before too long Harry's marriage may determine the world's fate.

  Hermione Granger couldn't help but think that no matter how difficult they had all figured rebuilding their society would be, no one was expecting anything quite like this. It was another stark reminder that just when things were finally starting to level out, they would never truly have peace and stability. Her entire life in the magical world had been full of shocks and stumbles, and this one seemed like the biggest of them all.A post-war Dramione marriage law fic... with a twist!
