Almost all my fic reading choices have been based on Ginny, I loved her potential in the books and I've loved seeing ff give her more to do than canon does. But! I've probably read most everything there is to read with her as a main character/love interest and I think it's time I branch out.

I've always loved Hermione as well, but I've never read any ff with her as a lead or with anyone other than Ron (or other Weasley brother)! I would love to get some recommendations with Hermione as the lead character, lead love interest, etc.

Because I do love Ginny I won't be super interested in anything that bashes her, that's my only real caveat.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

***** This is one of my favorite fics.

1)According to the author, it's not a romance fic (and there's been no romance as of yet). Currently, the fic is midway through third year.

2) Harry does feature. He and Hermione are friends, but not very close. However, he does affect the plot, both via his friendship with Hermione and his actions as Boy-Who-Lived.

** I've no idea why someone would downvote you. Your request is perfectly reasonable. I started out in a similar situation as you, focusing on Ginny first and then moving on to Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5]] is a H/Hr author who also happens to like Ron. His stories generally are Hermione-centric, feature intelligent heroes and villains, and involve Muggleborns fighting pureblood extremists. His newest fic, *Divided and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994), is really well written and has become my favorite WIP.

Someone already mentioned *Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(9863146). Its author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel][White Squirrel]] is another Hermione writer who does not bash the Weasleys. His short time-travel *A Little Child Shall Lead Them*, linkffn(10871795), is very nice.

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is a great Hermione-centric fic with canon pairings. I wrote a long post recommending it yesterday, and here is the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/54fral/sensible_harry/d81rgmq][link]]

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** It's D/HR, but I adore Elionwy's A Writer of Fictions. Post Hogwarts, they run into each other at Oxford. Honestly, I can't do it justice!
