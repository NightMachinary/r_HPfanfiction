How do you think Magical Butchery works? Do they even need to Kill the animal or can they put it to sleep romove the meat they want and then heal it with potions. Or do you think what ever meat they would get would be worth less than the potions needed to heal the animal each time makeing it unprofitable?

Of the magical meats we only see dragon meat in the books and it is show to have some healing properties. Do you think that magical mix some dragon or other magical animal meats in were they can? Like mixing a small amount into say a salami?

In the seires we hear Re'em a magical breed of Bovine and the use of Re'em blood. Do you think the magical world has crossbreed the Re'em with other cattle to try and get even a reduced magical benefit from normal cow products? And are there any magical animals that they may have crossbreed with a other farm animals?


** I do like the idea that healing spells might be used there. Could be one more reason for purebloodists to find Muggles barbaric --- heavens, they actually /slaughter/ their cattle?

*** Do you think that Magical Britain buys food from the muggle world or are they mostly self sufficient?

how big do you think a magical Farm would have to be to supply the whole of magical Britain?

**** I'm one of those who hold there's about 10,000 people, so yeah, I think they'd just get the basic ingredients from Muggles (possibly through /Confundus/-assisted crooked deals; maybe that's how Malfoy got so rich), and wizards make the actual food themselves. Of course, that's only for general things; there are people like the Weasleys who just grow/raise most of their food, so to speak.

All this, mind, may be different in the magical United States, which are big enough for it to make sense they'd support themselves, and, going per /FB/, even more reluctant to deal with Muggles.

** I mean i dunno about healing properties of dragon steaks specifically? covering certain types of bruises in normal steaks was a normal thing, I thought?
