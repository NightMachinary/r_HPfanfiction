Looking for a fic where Harry creates his own DE group or something similar to that premise. Would prefer dark/grey over light but i don't really have a problem. No slash on main pairings ( don't matter if there are none pairings just no slash). Thanks in advance!

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
