I enjoy marriage law challenge fics, mostly because I like enemy to lover/atypical pairings.

While listening to a great courses audio lecture I learned about two real marriage laws. One in ancient Rome and one in Chinese occupied Vietnam.

I'm super fascinated. Did anyone else now that this fic trope has historical references?


** As a fascinating note, the Roman nobel women who were effected gave the government the collective finger and registered themselves as prostitutes rather than give up their sexual autonomy.

The Vietnamese mounted war elephants and sacked 65 villages with an army of women then crowned a queen.

So, obviously, we need more HP marriage law fics where the women burn the world.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_ancient_Rome#Marriage_laws][Marriage Laws introduced by Augustus]] were merely "marry and have kids, or pay more taxes" laws. They didn't force strangers into marriages.

*** They did have very strict consequences for nobel women if they were convicted of adultery. It also resulted in very girls being engaged to much older men whom were trying to avoid family obligations. (I can't marry her yet, she's 6) I think it's a fascinating attempt to legislate morals.

**** Many countries had and ahve drastic punishments for adultry.

All that doesn't change the fact that this law was in no way, shape or form anything like the "Oh, the Ministry will now pick your groom/bride for you" Harry Potter trope.

***** Surely true. They didnt have magical soulmates or arithmacy spell crafting. I wasnt making a one to one analogy. Only thought it interesting that political social engineering has tumultuous consequences. And that it's sometimes fun to include historical context to fantastical fiction writing.

****** But that's not a historical context. Not at all. Attempts to encourage marriages aren't the "now we force two people together" trope.

If you're looking for historical context for the HP marriage law trope, then you should be looking at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_marriage]["forced marriage"]], not at the Roman marriage laws.
