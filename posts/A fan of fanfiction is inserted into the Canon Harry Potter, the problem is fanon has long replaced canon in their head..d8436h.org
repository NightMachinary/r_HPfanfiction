One of the many problems of SI fanfic is that the character are almost never wrong about the way they (wrongly)assume the world works, which often results in them basically imitating Indy Harry and actually succeeding, in doing things like finding out new ways of performing magic or becoming a goblin friend. This Prompt is basically what if they behaved that way in a canon world.


** u/VeelaBeGone:
#+begin_quote
  becoming a Goblin friend
#+end_quote

Out of all of these dead-ass tropes, this has to be the worst.

Of course, by "friend", what is usually meant is something like this;

#+begin_quote
  "Hello, can I see Griphook please?" asked Harry.

  "nOt MaNy WiZaRds ReMeMbEr OuR nAmEs.... BuT yOu DiD!!! YoU aRe UnIqUe AnD dEsTiNeD fOr GrEaT tHiNgS, wE wIlL hElP yOu WiTh AnYtHiNg YoU wAnT, gObLiN fRiEnD!"
#+end_quote

I definitely would like to see a Harry that expects that, but then gets absolutely fleeced financially. Because, y'know, they're generally really greedy, unpleasant money-hoarders. That's kind of their thing.

*** I can't remember the name of the fic, but I recently read one where Harry goes to Gringots to do an inheritance test and finds out he's related to Godric Gryffindor. He asks about the money, and the Goblins tell him Godric had so many descendants that the inheritance was split a long time ago, so basically all he gets is a boring certificate.

*** It's like the fanfic wish fulfilment was "If only Goblins were like House Elves". Wealthy, independent, powerful warlike creatures with history of resentment and defeat grateful and humble? Because a kid is nice? Not likely.

Now, a shrewd, vengeful AND respectful young wizard with a brilliant plan is another story. But then you need a politics, magic and finance savvy HP, and that only works (for me) with time travelling. And even then, after deafening Voldyshorts, Harry was still a young lad, not a season political operator.

So yeah, no.

** I never realized the "Harry is friends with Goblins" trope was that prolific of a trope? Ironically, the only time I've come across it was when I was reading this Avengers/HP crossover. Harry wanted to bail out of England and live in comfortable obscurity in America, and Harry (apparently) had paid the Goblins back for all the mess he/Ron/Hermione caused with the bank heist in DH. It wasn't so much a "OhMANWhatACONSIderATEHUUUUmanYou'reAGOblinFriendNow" but a "Because you were respectful and owned up to your mistakes, we will grant you ONLY ONCE some help." And they sorted out all his paperwork and finances. And that was it.

*** Much worse.

The goblins are basically used a plot devices to pretty much remove any conflict. It usually starts with Harry meeting them and after showing just a little bit politeness they immediately do everything the can to help him

Its usually enough for Harry to call them by their name, but it can also be something like him greeting them with some cringy goblin greeting like "may your blade be bloodied and your vault fill with gold", sometimes he even goes further and makes the first Goblin he talks to his Account manager.

After that they usually start doing stuff like tell him about his real vaults that Dumbeldore has hidden from him, those are full of wealth and tomes and magical objects, none of which is ever going to be used, they also give him a long list of properties he own, none of which he is going to spend any significant amount of time in, then they offer to do a inheritance test on him, during which they discovered a lot of things, like the amount of lordships he's entitled to, all the marriage contracts he has, any hidden magical power he may have and all the life debts people owe him. Then they also remove any health problems he may have, like giving him nutrition potions, healing his Eyesight, removing the magical blocks Dumbledore placed on him And removing the soulpiece inside him.

This was just the very common stuff, whats also common is that they pretty much help him with any kind of problem he may have in the future, to the point where I have seen quite a few fics where they ended up destroying all of Voldemorts Horcruxes after meeting Harry.

The word you're looking for is fangirl.

Fangirls in general would be really shocked considering the males most popular with fangirls are people like Draco, Snape, or Tom Riddle. I can really see them being shocked that neither Draco or Snape are attractive in canon, and can really see a fangirl falling prey do the diarys manipulation.
