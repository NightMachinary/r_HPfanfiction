Why can't people just say "this story is dead" or "this story is cancelled" instead of INDEFINITE HIATUS.

Like that just gives the reader false hope man..


** Well, if it is a lie, sure. But there have been enough stories where it turned out the truth. Can't remember what story it was, but I remember one that sat on indefinite hiatus for 11 years, and was then finished.

But of course you are right in general, most cases of indefinite hiatus can be read as "abandoned".

*** I think honestly if a story has sat like that for over two years its safe to assume that it has been abandoned

**** Yeah, I consider anything that hasn't been updated in a year abandoned. Even the occasional story that actually gets updated afterwards very rarely will really be picked up again.

**** Very possible. I think something like "I have nothing to say for myself except that life happened". But I can't remember what story it was. I know it was a big story in the mid 2000s and I think he picked it up again and finished it in 2016.

** I think it's probably because the author needs some hope too. Writing is a really precious thing, and few people want to abandon their own story outright. Putting indefinite hiatus leaves them room to come back. At least for me, sometimes life gets too rough to write, but I think authors are entitled to be able to pick up their story again when they desire to.

** I get why you would say Indefinite Hiatus, if you don't know how long it'll be.

But some people say their story is on PERMANENT HIATUS??? wtf?

** I have a story in a different fandom (NCIS/NCIS:LA/Hawaii 5-0 crossover) that's one part from being finished ... and has been that way for almost five years. Why? Because I changed jobs twice, moved to a new state, switched work schedules about five times, took up running and have had a few family things happen. Do I still intend to finish it? Yes. Do I know when that will be? Nope. Every time I start digging into it again, life throws me a curveball and it's six months before I even have time to think about it again. It's not dead, but it's definitely on indefinite hiatus.

** well... good news/bad news

bad news: you're definitely correct good news: if “indefinite hiatus” gives you any sense of hope you still have a lot of fanfiction to read

at this point my eyes just slide over the story like it's not even there
