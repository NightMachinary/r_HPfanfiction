Hiii, I've always been a fan of time travel and dimension travel fics, and recently I started to read fics again, i just finished Timely errors for the second time and i love it, if you could recommend me fics like that one I'd appreciate it a lot. What I liked about Timely errors was the interactions between harry and the marauders, how Lily, Alice and frank where introduced and Harry being quite powerful. I like fics that combine those moments of everyday life they would have in hogwarts but also add some exciting moments like a fight with DE or voldemort I'll really appreciate everything you recommend and try to read it, thanks to everyone üíú

  ‚ÄúI was going to kill you,‚Äù Grindelwald said nonchalantly, twirling the wand in his hand. Harry's blood ran cold, all too aware of his own vulnerability. He inadvertently recalled the row of followers in the back of the dungeon, their reverence and fear of the lord undeniable.

  "What changed?" Harry asked, quiet but daring. His heart was beating loud in his chest, adrenaline beginning to pump through his veins. Grindelwald's piercing eyes finally turned to him, tracing his features unabashedly. ‚ÄúYour resemblance to the Potters.‚Äù At the mercy of the powerful Gellert Grindelwald, an amnesiac Harry Potter reluctantly accepts to assist in the lord's search for the Hallows --- by spying on the heir to the Cloak of Invisibility, James Potter.

** This is borderline a crack fic, but honestly one of the best time travel fics I've ever read. It's incredibly funny but manages to remain tasteful and not repetitive.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

*** I'd argue that everything but one chapter is crack, it's a great fic though
