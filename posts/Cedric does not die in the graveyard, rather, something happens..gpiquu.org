  And then, without warning, Harry's scar exploded with pain. It was agony such as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all, his head was about to split open. From far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say, ‘Kill the spare.'

  A swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the night: ‘Avada Kedavra!'

  A blast of green light blazed through Harry's eyelids, and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he retched, and then it diminished; terrified of what he was about to see, he opened his stinging eyes.

There stood Cedric Diggory, beaten thoroughly, but still alive. His vision was a haze of confusion as the once-fat Pettigrew stood quivering and shaking blurred into the graves surrounding his person. And how- why had Cedric lived? Harry could not ponder any longer as he felt the distinct, almost bloody taste of dark magic surrounding Cedric.

"Do you not wonder how I lived?" came the voice of Cedric, and a malicious, delighted voice it was. Though it was small, the ringing silence of the graveyard was disturbed highly by Cedric's voice- no, who was he? This could not be Cedric, the Hufflepuff he knew was.. dead?

"That spell," Cedric continued, "can not end a dark creature's life." He turned at such an angle where Harry could see Cedric's eyes- they lacked an iris and were instead a shade of black that could not reflect light. "And I happen to be a dark creature." Cedric turned again and his eyes landed on the cloaked Pettigrew.

Pettigrew snarled and drew his wand. "Avada Kedavra! Avada Kedavra! Avada-" Each spell went through Diggory's body as if they were useless, and came out ghostly wisps of white.

Harry felt a flash of horror.


** Cedward, is that you?
