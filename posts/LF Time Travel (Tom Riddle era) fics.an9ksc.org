Looking for any really decent fics that involve someone (Harry, Hermione, w/e) back to Tom Riddle's time.

Slash is fine, but no 'X raises Voldemort' fics please.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** unsphere the stars is an active WIP fic involving Hermione going back in time. Characterisation is spot on. Plot too. Highly recommend it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7728303/1/unsphere-the-stars][unsphere the stars]]

  When Luna makes a terrible mistake and ends up in a time she never imagined she'd been in, what will happen before she gets back? And what will she do when she realizes that Tom Riddle is in her year? Rated M for language, violence, sexual content. *This story is in the process of an edit for more canon compliance & (hopefully) better writing. 12/32 chapters edited.* Sequel now up.

** Okay, so I don't have a lot, but here goes:

linkfnn(The Unwinding Golden Thread by Carnivorous Muffin) is one where Harry goes back and messes up the timeline pretty horrendously. Just started re-reading it myself, and it seems to be a bit of a "For Want Of A Nail" situation. 53k words. Complete.

linkao3(When in Rome by XblackcatwidowX) is one that I haven't read in /forever/, but it's a Tom/Harry where Harry and Hermione are the time travelers. ~158k words. Complete.

linkffn(Wear Me Like A Locket Around Your Throat by VivyPotter) is one where only Harry ended up lost in time, and it's a bit of a slow burn. Tom/Harry. 220k+ words. More about all of the characters and their developments over the course of the story rather than any particular plot. Ongoing; most recent update was last month.

linkffn(How to Prevent a War by CrazyJanaCat) is one that I also haven't read in a while and I can't vouch for its quality, but according to my notes it's (another) Tom/Harry except Ron, Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Sirius /and/ the twins go back in time. Don't remember much else about it, sorry. ~118k words. Abandoned.

linkffn(Past's Player by The Fictionist) is the abandoned prequel to Fate's Favourite by the same author. Another one where I don't remember much, but it's only Harry who goes back. Wasn't one of my favourites, but it fits your requirements.

Finally, linkao3(love is touching souls (surely you've touched mine) by ToAStranger) is a rather fluffy romance where a grownup Harry ends up in Diagon Alley Christmas morning about fifty years in the past and comes across Tom. 34k+ words. Complete.

I vaguely remember having read a few more, but these are the only ones that I have in my notes.

  COMPLETE. When Harry and Hermione inadvertently tumble half a century into the past, they find themselves in the same year as the notorious Head Boy, Tom Riddle. Both Harry and Hermione's courage will be tested when they are confronted by chances of romance from the most unexpected of places, and unlikely enemies hiding in the tallgrass.Lost in the past, they may well forget the way home.Not DH compliant.

  Harry Potter wakes in 1943, with golden scars littering his skin, and a headache. Who knew what time turner explosions could do? He decides to stay undercover until he can figure out a way to get out of this whole mess. Unfortunately, Harry was never very good at following plans. Tom Riddle didn't anticipate an interesting new arrival... but he can work with this. TMR/HP

  Getting stuck in 1942 was bad. Getting put into Slytherin was even worse. Having Tom Riddle practically stalk him? Harry hated his life. Prequel to Fate's Favourite. [ABANDONED.]
