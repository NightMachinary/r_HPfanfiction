So there was this dramione fic I read a while back. I can't remember the name of it for the life of me and I desperately want to read it again. Hopefully one of you have heard of it? I'm going to try and recall the plot Draco and Hermione work together in the ministry and then draco starts his own business and asks hermione to join him in his endeavor. Blaise also works for/with him. Pansy is a famous fashion designer and there seems to he unresolved feelings between pansy and blaise. Please tell me it rings a bell for someone!!!


** This one? I swear I've read one exactly like that but cant remember the name!
