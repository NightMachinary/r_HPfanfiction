:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey guys, it's JJ.

Today I'm looking for a fic that's a little more... Family oriented I guess. So in the story Harry's parents survive. Sirius in Azkaban never happens, Remus is around(i think?) and generally all good things. So the marauders + Lily all move into either houses next to each other or like in a circle. With the potters in one, the black family in another, lupins in another and maybe other's? I Remeber it focuses on family a lot. Harry I think is the eldest, then he starts to get new siblings, and I think a pair of twins? (please don't quote me on that.) Sirius also has kids, Remus I think has kids...Blah...Blah...Blah, harry eventually goes to an elementary school I think. Because in one scene I remember that Lily brings him to school. I don't know whether or not he-who-must-not-be-named is touched on or if it focuses more on the kids.

Let me know if you need any more details from me. I'll be posting a request every couple days I think. There are some fics that I really want to read again.

Sincerely, JJ

Edit: Monday Dec 2nd 2019.

A few more details that I remember or that I can give more examples of them are Harry being an older brother to a few siblings. Him going to a primary school. (75 percent ish sure that he did.) living in a community made up of the marauders + more that may have been called something like the den - that filthy rat wormtail. I don't think it was a bashing fic but I could be wrong. I specifically remember a scene where Lily is picking him up from school with either a clear pregnancy or with kids in a pram.

Please let me know if you need more details.
