So I finished the series and I thought it was incredible. Probably the best next gen fanfic I've read so far. I noticed he uploaded a sequel called Lily Potter and the Third Realm where Lily sets forth to rescue her brother from whatever happened after the Abyssal Vortex was sealed. But it's unfinished! It hasn't been updated in 4 years and I'm absolutely devastated. I have no idea what happened with NoahPhantom. I know he was in prison for a time but I'm gutted we never get to find out what happens to Albus and it seems he's destined to be stuck in the Third Realm forever.

Now I wish I'd just left the series as it was before discovering there was a sequel. I would've been content with the ending. Anyone else found themselves in this situation?
