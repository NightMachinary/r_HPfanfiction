Since I am watching the X files(one of the best shows ever of you ask me), i was wondering was there any inspired tropes of it in Harry Potter. Having a Luna like Maudler in the Ministry department chasing mysterious cases people have no found evidence of with her sidekick Scully (be it Ron, Harry, Neville or anyone else).
