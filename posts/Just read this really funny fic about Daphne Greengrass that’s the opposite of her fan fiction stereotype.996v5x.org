It's called Daphne Greengrass, Side Character. It mostly details her fifth year and her friendships with the other Slytherins. She tends to complain about how the school is cultishly “Pottercentric” and her own weird fascination with how overrated Harry is. She has a fun internal monologue that is 0% Ice Queen, but doesn't ever into Penguin of Doom levels of humor. She kind of reminds me of Auriga Sinistra from Lamentations of a Starry Eyed Twit in the beginning, but the story is getting more serious as the plot to Order of the Phoenix kicks in. It deals with how the other school perceives Slytherin, hating students by their house blindly and how they have to come together to protect each other. It reminded me a little of The Changeling in that regard, but I like Daphne's relationship with her friends and Astoria. The highlight of the fic is the friendship between Pansy, Daphne, Tracey, Blaise and Nott. They're interesting, likable and well-rounded with some snappy dialogue

  Daphne Greengrass is on a quest to be the main character of her own life for once, but that's easier said than done. Includes: conspiracy theories, evil plotting, a Slytherin revolution, and sassy Potter. OotP, HBP, and DH. Not your usual Daphne.

*** Actually that is addressed. Daphne hates blood purity elitism stating that even though she's a part of the Sacred 28 she has a Muggle great grandfather (like the rest of them, they just won't admit it) And they aren't saints, they're pretty terrible people but it's enjoyable kind of like Seinfeld. They sort of ignore Draco and Crabbe and Goyle for the most part. He's quietly tolerated then made fun of behind his back. Because Pansy is their friend, sort of, and she's obsessed with Draco, they're forced to deal with him. She's also friends with Hannah Abbott, Stephen Cornfoot and Sue Li, spending a lot of time with them as well. Daphne notes that while they do get involved in Quidditch related skirmishes, Ravenclaw can be pretty vicious in targeting everyone with their spells just because they want to try them out, but no one seems to complain about them. Basically, because she sees a feedback loop of people disliking them for their House, she doubles down on the being evil part ironically while just being a normal bratty schoolgirl.

A house does not make you evil, nor does the father make the son evil. Bias like this is toxic, and needs to be stamped out immediately.

I've always seen the stereotypes as believable in the sense that the sorting makes them gravitate towards their expected stereotype. Or put it another way, Gryffindor makes kids more reckless and foolhardy, Slytherin makes kids more snobbish and elitist, etc.

***** One could definitely argue that it's terrible leadership to place kids with other kids who are like them, that it exacerbates and reinforces kids' flaws as they're growing up. Gryffindors continue to think that being tribalistic is OK; Ravenclaws continue to think that if you're not clever (or working hard to become clever) then you're inferior; Slytherins think there's never anything wrong with always acting in your own best interest; and with Hufflepuffs, there's an implication that they're not brave or clever or ambitious, so why even try to be any of those things if you're feeling insecure already?

Growing up means appreciating the differences in others, and learning more about yourself and your world in the process. If you place kids in Houses based on their personality, they never learn that!

Death Eaters were treated as all evil. In the real world, Nazis were, and are, treated as evil; child molesters are treated as evil.

In contrast, Slytherins appear to face no systematic long- or short-term difficulties with regards to education, work, or social prospects. They face some mild stigma during school and occasional unfairness in decisions about /house points/.

Contrast this with the in universe treatment of werewolves: no structured education options, consistent and formalized obstacles to work, public advocation for social isolation. That is what being treated as evil looks like.

******** This is really complex, so I'll try to use a single example to demonstrate: the Dursleys.

Consider their portrayal in the first three books. They left Harry underneath the staircase for ten years while giving their son a second room to keep his toys. They're all fat/snobbish/ugly/mean/thuggish (pick your adjective). They take swings at Harry with a frying pan (how Tom and Jerry of them) and throw him about without seriously abusing him, which is unrealistic given the pattern.

In short they are the evil step family from classical Germanic fairy tales.

But then GoF came along. Suddenly the Dursleys are disciplining their perfect son, forcing him to go on a diet, and no longer acting as violently. They show far more reluctance to act violently unless they are pushed (until the muggle baiting by Fred and George).

In OotP, Dudley is still a bully, but now it seems more believable. He's the big kid, he knows how to fight, and he and his friends feel like a more realistic gang of teenagers than a cartoon gang. The Dursleys react appropriately to Voldemort's return:get rid of target #1. But this is the book where Dumbledore unveils that he is at the Dursleys because of the blood protection (or more accurately Rowling finally came up with a reason to explain Dumbledores actions around GoF/OotP). Now Petunia is protecting Harry, however reluctantly.

Finally, in HBP and DH they now seem like real people. Sure they're jerks, but believable jerks. Dudley was a bully, but he could still see beyond it if pressed. Petunias behavior was a result of jealousy, entirely understandable when compared to her amazing sister Lily. Vernon, he just wanted to have a normal nuclear family, something that is incredibly common in our society.

I not excusing their behavior, merely pointing out that as the books progressed, the characterizations became less black and white, more like real people.

What I'm getting at is that the early books were written in the style of classical fairy tale stories. But as Rowling began to realize she needed to build a larger world for her story, connect larger plot lines and events, characters diverged and became more human.

Ron was jealous of Harry's fame/success, James was actually lot like Malfoy in school and bullied a man Harry nearly refused to consider objectively (Snape), Voldemort was a product of circumstances he had no control over (his family, parentage, childhood home) and not just ‘he is evil and always has been.'

  since they share his House, hang out with him, and support him in Quidditch
#+end_quote

All Gryffindors are the Darkest and Evil wizards and witches.

Also Harry's perspective on who hangouts with whom is totally biased because:

- he dislikes all Slytherins by default since the beginning of his first year;
- he doesn't interact a lot inside his House (other years except his team) and with other Houses.

** Thinking about where I've seen unusual Daphnes, a lot of fics that do interesting things with her seem to come out of the SpaceBattles forums.

- In linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk), Daphne is very much a normal teenage girl who keeps trying and failing to get Hermione to put more effort into her appearance.
- In [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/][/Perks of Survival/ by Kevin Vacit]], Daphne is a noble pureblood and a complete ditz.
- In linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5), she has to navigate the complexity of wizarding war, between wanting to avenge her parents (whom Hermione blew up) and protect Astoria---who is far too eager to fight---from the war, all while having to put up with Draco's rather mediocre leadership.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Just finished it in 5 sittings, thank you so much for recommending this fanfic. This story has become my second favorite after On The Other Side linkffn(6593210). My favorite is chapter 9 where [[/spoiler][The slytherins splitted into 2 groups]] and Adrian Pucey is like an angel<3. Too bad Daphne [[/spoiler][rejected him]].

I'm dying to know the rest of the story. I hope the author will finish it until Deathly Hallows tho.
