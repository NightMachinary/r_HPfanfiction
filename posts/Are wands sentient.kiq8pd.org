"The wand chooses the wizard" is something we are all familiar with. I would be content to believe that this is simply because some wands are better suited for certain wizards, and leave it at that, but for a rather startling realisation I had recently.

In HBP, Harry finds various incantations in Snape's old copy of /Advanced Potion-Making/, and he uses /at least two/ of these spells, /successfully/, without knowing what they were supposed to do.

This completely blows the idea that magic is /all about intent/ completely out of the water (although some spells, namely the Cruciatus Curse and the Patronus Charm, do require certain mindsets for them to be effective). In that case, how on earth would either /Levicorpus/ or /Sectumsempra/ have worked, given that all he had were the incantations? He had absolutely no clue what /Sectumsempra/ would do, or he would never have used it.

So, why did it work?

The only thing, apart from Harry, that played a part in casting that curse was /his wand/. Could the wand itself recognise what a curse is supposed to do from the incantation? Is that why one must always pronounce the incantations correctly, and why non-verbal spells are so difficult? If the way to get a spell to work is to communicate the incantation to your wand, and with non-verbal spells you have to do so /silently/, I can see how it would be difficult.

So what does this /mean/?

Does the wand literally choose the wizard? Is it capable of recognising similarities and differences in its own magic and the wizard trying it out, and of rejecting or accepting that wizard accordingly?

Does this mean that the Elder Wand is simply the /most sentient/ wand, and that's why it's known as the most powerful? That it's just easiest to communicate with, and therefore the easiest wand to use? If that is true, is it possible that it's been picking up unique skills from each wizard that has wielded it, the way Harry's wand picked up some of Voldemort's magic in the graveyard due to the wands being connected? That it is in fact the most powerful wand simply because it has had powerful owners, that only came to own it because of its reputation as the most powerful wand in the first place? It's quite the beautiful circle. This heightened awareness could also be the reason it always changes its allegiance to the one who defeated its former master: That all wands /would/ change their allegiance in the same way, but they don't recognise when their master is beaten. If that is true, is Draco Malfoy's hawthorn wand special, or is the Elder Wand just so aware of what is happening that it recognised that someone had beaten its master, and promptly switched allegiance on its own, prompting the hawthorn wand to do the same?

On a relatively unrelated note: Could wands theoretically be Confunded by a powerful enough wizard (or a sentient enough wand)? What would happen if a wand /was/ Confunded? Could it be made to believe that /Diffindo/ has the same effect as /Wingardium Leviosa/? If so, could such a charm be used to confuse the Unforgivable Curses with other incantations? Or could one confuse a wand into thinking that, for example, "FORWARD!" is an incantation? (I now think that Hagrid's "umbrella" has definetely been mended, and more than likely tampered with, by Dumbledore.) Could one convince a wand that its allegiance lies with someone who has never beaten its rightful owner in their life? That its master is a different wizard than it should rightfully be?

If so, would one need the Elder Wand in order to achieve such a Confundus Charm, or would one simply have to be a powerful wizard? Barty Crouch Junior did manage to Confund the Goblet of Fire, after all.

Discuss.


** To elaborate, the wand gains sentience from it's core. In this case Fawkes' feather. Fawkes' approved of cutting Draco to shreds.

** I think this is the way where lies madness. Even considering JKR books as canon we have to accept that there are mistakes, because (contrary to the Holy Spirit in case of the Holy Scriptures), [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Mistakes_in_the_Harry_Potter_books][she certainly makes mistakes]]. Introduction of /Levicorpus/ and /Sectumsempra/ are just going contrary to everything we have in the rest of the books. We learnt many times that doing magic is not just shouting the words (that's whole point of seven years studies at Hogwarts, after all), but suddenly one word scribbled somewhere on the margins of Potions textbook (without even the description of the wand movement) is sufficient to almost kill Draco. JKR is just not Tolkien, so her universe has huge holes in it, and if you want to make any systematic theory about it, you have to be ready to ignore some nonsensical parts of it.

*** I think that there is no one coherent system that can fully explain everything that happens in the story. Instead you are better off creating your own headcanon which you feel is satisfying and ignoring what doesn't fit. This is the reason Harry Potter has so much fanfiction written about it.

*** Also, levicorpus is fairly mundane, I doubt it would require intense intent to achieve, and Sectumsempra is dark and Harry was plenty pissed when he cast it, so the anger could have acted as part of the intent (that is, he was angry and intended to harm, the method of which is probably irrelevant if you know the words for the spell.)

** I personaly see intent as part of a wider picture, it isn't necessary but it helps. It's why some spells can't be cast silently, words help both to shape your intent and magic. I've always thought that there was multiple forms of intent, some are shallow, these being "easy" to cast silently, whilst others like say the patronus are deep and either impossible or highly difficult to cast silently.

No, it doesn't as 'magic is all about intent' is born of 'you have to mean them.' 'Them' being unforgivable curses. Harry, himself, only considers the statement when casting the Imperius and Cruciatus Curses.

HBP:

#+begin_quote
  Harry turned the book sideways so as to exmine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble: Levicorpus (nvbl)
#+end_quote

We only see the incantation, but there are also other words there some of which had to tell Harry to flick his wand upwards.

And while Harry knew what Expelliarmus would do, he didn't read a single thing about it. I believe he also got it the 1st or 2nd time he cast it.

#+end_quote

Yes. In a way. I suppose?

Wands choose the wizard. That was stated over and over again and we saw that. Pottermore establishes that wands can differentiate between regular magic, dark magic, and can know when their chosen wizard is using them dishonorably and practicing self-deception. Ollivander on the wand wood page even suggests they can choose accordingly. Rowan (I think) has never chosen a wizard who has gone dark.

#+end_quote

No, it means the Elder Wand is the most powerful and the least loyal. It goes where the 'power' is, which, I believe, destroys the sentience argument. To the elder wand beaten = more powerful.

All wands don't change in the same way as some wands are more loyal than that. If Draco had three wands, one wand would remain because that wand wouldn't have switched allegiances while sitting in a drawer simply because its master had been 'beaten.'

Yes I know, I just meant that this does not apply to /all/ magic, as clearly pronunciation matters, at least sometimes (see: "Never forget wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and ended up on the floor with a buffalo on his chest." and "It's win/gar/dium levi/o/sa, make the /gar/ nice and long.) and foreknowledge of what the spell does is not always necessary (see: /Levicorpus/, /Sectumsempra/.)

#+end_quote

Beaten generally does equal more powerful, particularly as this would mean one has to best one's opponent in a duel. No matter how arbitrary, that definition can technically be placed on one wizard randomly hexing (or Disarming) another with no retribution. Why would this destroy the sentience argument? It can't see, so it only has the magic of its master and the magic that affects its master to go off of. It recognises that its master has been Disarmed, so it deduces that the wizard to have done that must be more powerful than its current master, and switches its allegiance to the new wizard. All without ever having been held in said "new wizard"'s hand.

Because a truly sentient wand would understand that Draco isn't more powerful (skilled) than Dumbledore.

***** Isn't that a bit of a tall order? How is the wand supposed to figure that out? Age? Magical experience? Amount of spells he is able to cast? Reflexes? Variety of duelling stances? All are convoluted, and what is more, the Elder Wand has no way of knowing any of them.

****** No, it's not a tall order given that magic can differentiate between the intent of the caster (you alone know whether it will harm your soul to save an old man), wands understand the difference between regular magic, and there was a boat that could asses how "weighted" an adults' magic was.

"Skill level" isn't convoluted. It's ability to perform any given spell to a great degree (think the others begging Harry to cast his patronus because there's went as good) than that of the other guy.

This is only in the interest of the soul, though. That's not, strictly speaking, anything to do with magic as if Snape had taken out a gun and shot Dumbledore through the skull instead of using Avada Kedavra, he would've died instantly and the result would be the same. (Come to think of it, the Elder Wand would probably be able to tell who killed its master in that instance, too, but it's the principle of the thing).

Dumbledore also revealed to Harry that he wanted Snape to become the master of the Elder Wand and that was also a reason (though obviously not the only one) that he told Snape to kill him. The Elder Wand can't tell if the intent behind the spell is malicious or not.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

There's also a spell that can track any magic performed in the vicinity of minors. There is obviously a dividing line where magic doesn't recognise you as a child anymore, but the Elder Wand would only be able to tell exactly that- whether or not they had yet to have their 17th birthday.

I agree with you on that, but I ask again, how on earth is the Elder Wand supposed to know the skill level of any given wizard who casts a spell on its master?

#+end_quote

No. If it was only the matter of communicating/understanding a spell that the caster was trying to use and the purpose of it usage then Hermione or Bill or Fleur or Ollivander etc. would have repaired Harry's broken wand. I'm sure at least one them possessed a wand that was both sentient and bonded enough to cast the repairing charm reparo.

As for the rest of that paragraph, logic you're using is a bit backwards and hard to understand. I will try to speculate as best as I understand.

All wands do change their allegiance if their master is beaten and they do recognize if their master is beaten. Otherwise why/how could they change their allegiance in the first place.

Draco's wand was not special and Elder Wand does not affect its allegiance. Draco had the Elder Wand's allegiance because he disarmed Dumbledore and then Harry gained Elder Wand's allegiance because he disarmed Draco. It was AFAIK the only example of wizard with two wands being 'beaten' in canon and when Harry beaten the Draco when Draco was using his hawthorn wand he gained the allegiance of both Draco's hawthorn wand and the Elder Wand.

Now does this mean any wizard that have the allegiance of two or more wands would loose all of their wands allegiances when they're beaten while using only one of their wands? Possible. Could it be that it was a special case due to Elder Wand? Equally possible.

All of that aside, if Elder Wand was such a mega sentient wand I would think that it would have known that Draco was a tool in the hands of Voldemort and thus its allegiance would have gone to Voldemort instead.
