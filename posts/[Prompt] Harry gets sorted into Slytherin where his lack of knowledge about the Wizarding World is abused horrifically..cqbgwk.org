Draco convinces Harry that all the members of Slytherin are Nobility and that he's the Potter Heir ^{^{TM}} and therefore teachers must treat him with respect and he has to show the appropriate level of deference to those with more impressive families than his. Like the Malfoys. Dumbledore immediately panicks because Harry is a phenomenally rude boy with delusions of grandeur and assumes he's the next Voldemort. Equally concerning is his insistence on practicing Winter Solstice ceremonies that no one has heard of instead of Christmas like everyone else.

Malfoy convinces Harry to swear an Unbreakable Vow to be his servant and Harry does it because no one bothered to tell him the consequences.

Susan Bones files a restraining order against Harry after his repeated, and creepy, attempts to demand her hand in marriage at age 12 because Pansy convinced him marriage contracts are a thing.

Harry is humiliated in the Daily Prophet after it's revealed he's been arrested after spending 4 hours at Gringotts telling every goblin that he's their ally and he hopes their swords drip with the blood of their enemies. This did not result in goblins being nicer to him.

Harry fails his second year classes after he spends the entire year using an ill-fitted wand he didn't win that he bought in Knockturn Alley because Nott convinced him he needed an "untraceable wand rather than a ministry provided one from Olivanders"

Dumbledore gets seriously worried about Harry after Harry screams at him in front of the entire Great Hall that he demands to be emancipated and freed from his evil relatives, now aware that Dumbledore only sent him there so he could steal his fortune by acting as his Magical Guardian. Dumbledore explains he was just sent to his closest relative because that's generally what happens, he has no fortune in secret hidden vaults and there's no such thing as a Magical Guardian.

Harry decides to run away in defiance of this obvious lie and has to return a week later because he has no usable skills and the centaurs creep him out as it turns out they're actually just weird horse people not genius seer's. He couldn't find the famed Potter Manor because it's not real, his parents lived in a cottage because they weren't that rich.


** I love this prompt.

He keeps calling all the muggleborn mudbloods and saying how they don't understand the culture.

*** This world's version of the DA is Harry teaching all the Muggleborn's everything they need to know about wizarding culture, such as not marrying outside your blood type, not owning property of any kind and making an effort to ensure you never appear more attractive or powerful than your betters. Rather than disband it Umbridge endorses the message and makes it an official class.

Harry's classmates might not go along with it all but they at least understand why Harry reminds them all of a classic muggle monk. He has to rent all his clothes from his housemates who prank him by making them all bright orange, he's celibate as he can't date anyone in his house due to being a half-blood and he had to shave his head to ensure Draco has the title of Best Hair In Hogwarts.

** Harry is deeply depressed after he fails to learn any House Elf magic from Dobby despite Daphne telling him all Purebloods learn this at a young age. He's not able to do it because he's not a House Elf and their biology is completely different.

He does eventually learn some wandless magic after a year of trying. It's shit and he fails all his classes, there's a reason people use wands.

The same goes for all the ancient magic he learnt from Malfoy Manor's library, it's much less efficient to use a horse than a car and the same goes for the 15 word chant that Stupefy replaced.

After a summer abroad to learn Ancient Eastern magic on the advice of Flint, Harry returns confident that he now knows how to summon small objects in Chinese. That's all though. Foreign languages are hard and magic is pretty ubiquitous. Also foreign governments tend not to hand out secret weapons to random English children, no matter how famous they are here.

** Hilarious!

They could tell him that magical cores are a thing, that his muggle-raised one is very weak, and convince him to do all kinds of non-existent ritual things, to strengthen and nourish his core.

Waltzing into the Forbidden Forest on a night of a full moon, "when the forest magic is strongest," so that he can "soak it in and give his core a badly-needed vitamin boost.".

Dance naked on the edge of the lake at noon, "so that the increased contact with the energies of all four elements can properly nourish your core.".

Eat random flowers growing wild around the grounds, "because those are magic flowers, with magic cores of their own, and they are like candy for your core.".

Stop bathing, because "building up a personal musk is your bodies' best way of conveying energies from the element of air to your core. We can bathe, because we weren't muggle-raised, and our cores are plenty strong as is.".

Walk around for hours in the sun with no protection, until he gets a bad sunburn, because "your core needs a mega dose of the element of fire, and this is the most efficient way of doing that.".

Breathing really hard and fast until he feels woozy, because "Again, mega dose of the element. You should especially do this right before attempting to cast spells in the classroom.".

Walking around barefoot on sharp rocks. "If your feet get cut or bruised, you're doing it right.".

"Remember, there's no real need to tell anyone what you're doing, or why. All the teachers know everything about magical cores, and how the muggle-raised come to Hogwarts with malnourished, atrophied cores. Why, they should even award you house points for your diligence.".

** Draco takes Harry's spot on the quidditch team by convincing Harry to try out on a flying carpet. Obviously flying carpets are superior in every way to "lame broomsticks which were invented for mudbloods who don't know how to fly properly."

Madam Hooch is not impressed with this flagrant attempt to circumvent the ban enacted by the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts office. Arthur Weasley refuses to remove magic carpets from the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects. Harry is then given detention for a week and goes further in debt to the Malfoys who pay the fine in his stead.

** I thought about this over night and came to the conclusion this boils down to a fanfiction about an orphan being horribly bullied. I couldn't see it ending very well, most likely Harry committing suicide as in the prompt it seems he has no support base to fall back on. Though I guess if you made Harry autistic it would be believable. He would follow along gladly with what his "friends" are doing to him.

** I do remember two fics that sorta touches on this in passing. One is that the goblins take advantage of the Muggleborn because the muggleborn are going by british banking policy and end up signing all their money away to the goblins in an unbreakable contract. James stopped Lily from doing that, and that's all I can remember about it.

And the other is no one can talk about how bad the ministry really is (it's a Harry/Hermione fic) and Dumbledore tries by writting a book and dying because of it.

No titles, because I am at work and don't have access to my library, sorry.
