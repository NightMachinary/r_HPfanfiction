Just read on facebook that Educational Decree No. 28, the one that announces Umbridge as the new Head of Hogwarts, was introduced on March the 30th. My idea was, what if, it was an April Fool's joke.\\
Maybe the Ministry suddenly grew a funny bone, or something happened to Umbridge and the Ministry has to save face, or general wizarding population finds the decree so absurd it was just assumed to be a joke.

Go wild, go cracky (or not), go be creative!


** I'm imagining that some low-level Ministry employee deep in the bureaucracy wrote it up as a joke, and was horrified to see it be taken seriously by the higher-ups.

***** I'd love to read a fic where Percy taught the twins the basics of pranking and they provide a cover for his mischief.

******* Percy spends the entire occupation drafting absurd regulations to grind the system to a halt while wondering just how far he can take it, claim it's to stop blood traitors, and have everyone rubber stamp it.

******** "You actually are joking, Perce --- I don't think I've heard you joke since you were ---" -Fred Weasley's last words

Just about those words a full one shot can be written. When was the last time Percy joked and why did he stop.

********* That summer where Percy was sending tons of mail was actually him inquiring about business loans and the like to prepare the twins' for their shop. The entire "mock Percy for having a girlfriend" conversation was an act to keep Mrs. Weasley's attention off it.
