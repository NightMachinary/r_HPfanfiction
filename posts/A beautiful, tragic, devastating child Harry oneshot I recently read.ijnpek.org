Just wanted to gush about this childfic oneshot, Alastair's Cupboard, that I read a few weeks ago. I cried myself to sleep at 2 in the morning after reading it. I don't want to give too much away, but it has a grim interpretation of where Harry actually got his scar. It's well written and the final sequence in particular is a masterpiece. I was so heartbroken.

In short, I highly recommend it. And if there's anyone on here who has read it too, I would love to hear what you think!

Trigger warning for child abuse.

I read both this and the fic you gave above, and I think you might like it

  Hello journal. Today we have a prompt. Our prompt is our favrit family tradition. I do not have a favrit family tradition because I do not have a family. Signed, Harry Potter. Harry Potter's third form journal. A peek at pre-Hogwarts life.

*** So, I just finished this Hello Journal fic! I understand it's not technically finished, but it ends on a note that feels complete. I honestly don't think it could end any other way and still be canon compliant. Both of these fics are so sad! My heart aches for young Harry. I actually think the 2 fics go remarkably well together. I imagine the last half of “Alastair's Cupboard” as the ending to “Hello Journal” as well. /Spoiler/ I would not put it past Vernon to accidentally go too far and beat Harry to death/severe traumatic brain injury after an unfavorable encounter with social services. As grim as that is.

** I'm going to read that when my heart is more ready haha. I'm wondering if you've read Two Things? It's also a oneshot about young Harry suffering (emotional) abuse at the Dursleys. Really wrenched my heart.

  Harry is only four years old and the Dursleys are already mean.

  Oneshot, Abused!Harry. Before Hedwig the owl, there was Alastair the spider. In an unforgiving household, 10-year-old Harry has no one else who cares whether he lives or dies. He'll need every ounce of vigilance if he is to survive. Warning: descriptions of physical child abuse.
