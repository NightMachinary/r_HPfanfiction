** It's not particularly common, but I don't see a problem with posting an occasional fan art, so long as it's tasteful.

Quite a while back, there was an entire conversation based off searching for a story that matched a piece of fan art in tone.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6b7127/ginnyluna_fics_that_are_this_cute/]]

So maybe the key is to find fan art that can spurn discussion.
