** Just a quick note:

The PDFs on that site are the originals made by someone (possibly even CC herself) prior to the removal of all her fics. They're also pretty big files because as well as the text, it includes pictures (scene fanart, etc).

So for anyone who's interested, I have the fics in smaller file formats, without the pictures, and I'm perfectly happy to email them to anyone who wants. Available formats include (but are not limited to):

- .rtf or .doc
- .epub (for most ereaders)
- .lit (microsoft reader)
- .mobi (for kindle)
- .pdf (smaller file size - total trilogy is 7.2MB, compared to the original being 55MB)

I can provide each story as individual files or all three combined into one file. Just drop me a message if anyone's interested.

** We discussed BNFs of the past whose novel-length fics made a big stir. The biggest of the BNFs that I recall was Cassie Claire, whose Draco Trilogy (now taken offline, but downloadable as PDFs at the site I linked to) sort of set the stereotype for Dracos forever after.

I called it a "guilty pleasure" because CC caused quite an uproar due to some copyright issues. However, as much as I found the later books in the trilogy rambling, I thought that the first one was quite fascinating. It's stuck with me.

So, thought I'd link it. This is what fanfic was looking like when I started reading: speculating about unfinished books and often novel-length or longer.

NOTE: A number of the punch lines in CC's DT are from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and other tv shows/sources.

** Hi, there was a big stir when these were published, since it was found that CC had plagiarized quite a bit from other fanfic authors, mainstream authors, and TV shows. I know she later claimed ''inspiration'' but that was when her feet were put to the fire. I'm not saying this to make you decide to read it or not, just thought you ought to know.

*** Yes, that's what I was posting about above. Some folks asked about links earlier, though, so I wanted to share the link. I hate plagiarism, having taught college classes. I was disappointed by CC, because I loved the beginning of the first part of her trilogy.

** For anyone unaware, [[http://www.cassandraclare.com/][Cassandra Claire]] went on to write the Mortal Instruments series after her fanfiction beginnings. I haven't read them, but they're making the first one into a movie.
