So, in Hogwarts we have the Trophy Room, right? But the only awards that you can get at school that we know of are "Special Award for Services to the School" and "Medal for Magical Merit". But even the description of the Trophy Room is /"Awards, trophies, cups, plates, shields, statues, and medals were kept in crystal glass displays in this room"/, yet they never mention those other awards. And we don't see Harry, Hermione or basically anyone receive any awards or statues or anything like that during their time at Hogwarts (other than that Special Award for the Services to the School, but that was for the Chamber of Secrets & a special case).

Then: any ideas for cool awards to use in fanfictions (either as a background element or for characters to win)? Or competition that you can win those awards in?


** Random thought, Why would Hogwarts keep a "Special Award for Service" in the trophy room in the first place?

I would imagine an external award or something like a Quidditch tournament Hogwarts won against Beauxbatons would be a good candidate for the trophy room. An award Hogwarts gives to a specific student for a task like this would be for the student to keep, not for the trophy room.

*** Maybe they get a seperate copy of award. Transfiguration or conjuring is handy there and a need to keep records in one place can be reason to keep an award on display while student get their own copy.

**** A written record on a book or some sort of plaque works better for that purpose. Not saying it can't be done, just that it feels odd

*** Perhaps he pointed out that as he was going back to a muggle orphanage for the summer where it probably wasn't a good idea to leave a Hogwarts award lying around on a table, or it was awarded when he was back at school and didn't want to sleep next to it in his dorm room. It was temporarily put in the trophy room for 'safekeeping' and was promptly forgotten about. Or perhaps that is part of the award. You get immortalised by the trophy being on display for future students for ever more. It isn't any more silly that getting something shiny to collect dust on your mantlepiece and get thrown out by your grandchildren.

**** Well it is plausible, harry or his friends never got any trophy for their second year adventure as well. I think it was mentioned somewhere that they were awarded a special award for services towards school.

** Presumably Harry's Triwizard Cup is stored there, because I don't think their was any memory of him keeping it. Even if it was offered, I doubt he would have wanted to be shut in his room at the Dursleys with a massive, shiny reminder of his survivor's guilt.

*** I'm picturing adult Harry's home office with a corner piled with junk (TriWizard Cup, Order of Merlins). Meanwhile, framed on the he wall is Dumbledore's Army signups sheet with a single galleon.

**** The office? No, all that useless stuff goes in the basement. The office is for important things. Like recipe for the Hogwarts House-Elves Treacle Tart he got after the Final Battle.

** I honestly assumed that we just didn't see it because Harry didn't care about it but I assume that quiditch cup winners are listed there as well as academic awards which again of the trio only hermione would have cared about them so were again not mentioned

one idea I had was that the reason we dont see rewards being given out for academic achievements or other such awards that weren't up to the discretion of the headmaster (COS) was that they required a consensus from all four heads of houses and snape was petty enough to not allow anyone not from slytherin to get it and that by the time canon started people had just stopped trying to get them

** Maybe we don't see much because not many are handed out and that room is only full because it contains every award won on the last millennium.
