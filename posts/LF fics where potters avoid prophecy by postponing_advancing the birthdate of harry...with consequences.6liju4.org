Maybe Potters thought risk of using time turner during pregnancy is lesser than being targeted by voldemort.

Or after realizing lily's child might fit prophecy, Snape contacted and persuaded lily to use his potion which would postpone birth without any ill effect.

Or whatever other way!

I'm looking for fics where Potters avoid prophecy and possibly raise Harry, but Harry is affected by whatever method they used and has to deal with it.

Like Voldemort's inability to understand love is related to his conception by influence of Amortentia.

*** This story doesn't fit any of the OP's criteria. It's nevertheless an excellent read, though.

**** Well, the Harry's birth date isn't different, but everyone thinks it is August 1st right? So this makes POTDK a point of divergence fic (if you ignore the pagan stuff and the faeries) where the Potters lie about Harry being born on August 1st rather than as the seventh month dies. Essentially it's an extreme what if Voldemort went after Neville. Correct me if I'm wrong. I mean it doesn't include what OP wants with potion affects but it does have that point of divergence that Harry's date of birth is different for all intents and purposes.
