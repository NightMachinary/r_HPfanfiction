** u/Lord-Potter:

  "Tell me everything that happened on this date" And then the person who was asked this tells them everything that happenen

But that's exaxctly how it works. Rereading chapter 35 of GoF, Barty tells Dumbledore everything about his escape from Azkaban, his time under his father's control, how he captured Moody, etc. He goes far beyond simple yes's and no's, and explains in detail how the event played out.

** Dumbledore's were more specific, but he wasn't asking BCJ yes or no questions and BCJ was telling all his secrets. In fact, Winky scolds him initially.

*** I view it as a combination of misdirection being possible, there being countermeasures, and will.

Plus in trial, they might have some clause that prevents self-incrimination.

We've only seen it used once, but that's why I think it's rarely used and Pottermore takes this stance.

** I have a character fight it by babbling about somewhat off-topic, but still true things to distract his interrogator, but I'm departing from canon there just for fun. In canon, people tell the whole truth under its influence.

** Actually that's exactly what it does, Barty spills literally everything with minimal prompting and Snape states when threatening Harry that it'll have him spilling his deepest secrets with just a few drops.
