Looking for some well-written stories where one of the main characters gets pregnant/impregnates someone whilst still at Hogwarts (can be 8th year), whether its a school project or just an accident. I've become quite intrigued by fics in this genre and how the characters interact, most particularly the ones with a Dramoine pairing!


** I'm not the biggest fan of this type of story and the pairing isn't quite what you're after, but one that comes to mind is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1515678/1/Birthday-Surprises][Birthday Surprises]] by Lolly Phoenix.

  Harry receives a rather unusual 17th birthday present from the Headmaster. A present that changes anything and everything.

Another, perhaps, is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9192529/1/Shake-Me-by-RoxieSnape][Shake Me]] by RoxieSnape

  AU Harry disappears ten years ago, from his relatives. When he comes back he is not the innocent boy everyone knows. The Boy Who Lived, grew up differently than anyone would have imagined. He's not the goody goody way to polite boy from Number Four, he's a sarcastic, arrogant little twit, who has love deep down and wants to be loved. But can he open up to anyone around him?

Neither is what I'd deem particularly good, but both are readable and involve Hogwarts-era characters with children.

I've never read this one, but I've seen it on favorites lists and it has been heavily reviewed: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/395212/1/The-Greatest-Scandal-in-Hogwarts-History][The Greatest Scandal in Hogwarts History]] by AgiVega

*** Awesome! The Greatest Scandal in Hogwarts History is exactly what I was thinking along the lines of, and the other two have interesting plots that I will definitely check out. Thanks!!!
