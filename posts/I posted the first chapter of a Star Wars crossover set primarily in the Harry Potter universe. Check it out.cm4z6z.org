*** Well the summary of the fic itself is "Jedi Padawan Harry Potter has received his letter to Hogwarts and the Wizarding World will never be the same for his having done so."

More details than that without spoilers include the fact that he was trained by an adult Ahsoka Tano, has absolutely no knowledge of his past and never lived with the Dursleys. The fic will explore his conflicting feelings about his loyalty to the Jedi and his loyalty to a past he didn't know he wanted and, ultimately, his decision between the two of them.
