  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Harry is victorious and Voldemort is gone, but not all is as it should be. Thrown into the past Harry takes on the role of James Potter's long lost cousin and attempts to do the one thing Hermione always warned him about. Is this a second chance or curse?

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Sounds a bit like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5059648/chapters/11635768][It starts with Harry's eyes]] too. Beware, this fic is chock-full with tropes.

  Another of those time travel stories to save Sirius (in more than one way) and for Harry to have some more emotional chaos. Some creature stuff thrown in. Love the clich√©s and maybe create some new. Or the one in which a mysterious artefact kicks Harry back to a time where he collides with the Marauders and has to deal with completely unexpected emotions AND an upcoming creature inheritance - with consequences that are really going to freak him out. Maybe.Marauders' Era starts with chapter 7.
