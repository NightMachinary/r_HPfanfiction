** Any kind of extensive magical training before the age of 11. I don't mean little stuff like the stinging hex or tripping jinx, but full on Dark Arts or NEWT/OWL level spells.

Students don't start Hogwarts till 11, I'm not sure exactly why but I highly doubt it was just an arbitrary number pulled out of a hat. So when Harry shows up for his first year at Hogwarts knowing more about the Dark Arts than Severus Snape I'm out.

**** Yea, I can agree with the distinction between knowledge in theory and training in casting. It is one of the things I don't understand about magical students not receiving a formal education before 11. You would think that it would be detrimental to the statue of secrecy to have magical children running around with freaked out parents trying to figure out how their child just summoned a cookie.

Personally, I would love a story where Harry was raised by an insane magical theorist and consequently has all these wild, and even occasionally correct, ideas about how magic works.

*** Pretty much all my squicks can be summed up under the heading of: Screwing around with human reproductive biology. It started as just Omegaverse (I read a lot of Johnlock a couple of years ago and holy shit is that ship filled with Omegaverse) and then it became Institutionalized sexual power dynamics, and then I kept broadening it until it reached its current incarnation.

I have no problem at all with people screwing around with human sexuality, it's just when either a) governments get involved or b) human biology is messed with (e.g. mpreg) that I'll nope out of there in an instant. There's a Johnlock fic where absolutely everyone is either sexually submissive or dominant, which is an interesting premise and I might have really enjoyed it, except that everyone had to register their preference and it was on all their IDs and that was just too much for me.

So this was basically a really long way of saying: I agree.

It's like I have 100 hit points going into a story, and every cliche will do a few dice of damage, depending on how bad it is, until my interest is slain.

I agree, a comprehensive list is impossible. However, here are some of the most egregious and common offenders that come to mind:

- AAA+ magical cores (often bound/stunted intentionally or by accident), power ranks, etc.
- Gringotts inheritance blood test, Heir of multiple founders, surnames with multiple hyphens, etc.
- Lord/Lady titles for Purebloods, magical nobility in general
- First Years falling in love at first sight, especially when a "soul bond" forms that equals instant pre-pubescent marriage
- Harry defeating Voldemort primarily due to his preternatural dodging skills and Quidditch-honed reflexes

A story really has to be well-written to contain more than one of these and still hold my interest.

#+begin_quote
  Lord/Lady titles for Purebloods, magical nobility in general
#+end_quote

This is actually pretty logical, it's just terribly executed by all fanfic writers. Britain has a system of titles and honours which still exists in the present day. It would make sense for a magical family here and there to have inherited one, or held on to one since before the Statute of Secrecy.

In fact we know of at least one family this is true for. The Malfoys *are* genuinely nobility. We know the Malfoy family came over to England with William the Conqueror and were given land by him as a reward, and then continued to move in royal circles for centuries. That means that Lucius is going to be (at least) a Baron. Probably higher than a Baron since one of the Malfoys was said to have attempted to woo Queen Elizabeth.

So where does fanfic go wrong?

Firstly, it forgets that the titles are /Muggle/ titles. We never see any Malfoy show off their title, and you imagine they're probably deeply ashamed of it because it reveals a Muggle connection in their past.

Secondly, it makes the mistake of giving holders of titles actual political (or even magical) power. Magical Britain is largely analogous to modern Britain. Grindelwald occurred simultaneously with WW2 (and maybe WW1 also), Voldemort was simultaneous with the Troubles. Trends in the magical and Muggle worlds mirror each other even where there is no direct causal link. So the power of any magical nobility that may have once existed should, like the Muggle world, be now ceremonial only.

**** Yes, it certainly makes sense that some wizards and witches, especially in older families, would have noble blood, possibly even extant titles, though these may have been "erased" when the ISoS came into effect. You've correctly pointed out the root of my issue though - these are Muggle titles. As you say, they're probably either considered an embarrassment or simply irrelevant in magical society, where the opinions of Muggle monarchs likely held little weight even before the ISoS. It's pretty clear that what matters to Purebloods is the /magical purity/ of their blood, not any relation it might have to Muggle blue-blood.

**** I don't think it's strange at all. I was never into anime or manga so I can't speak to that aspect from personal experience, but I certainly don't mind power ranks or levels in video or tabletop RPG games. They serve an important purpose there, and are an established element in that genre.

I think part of what attracts people to JKR's magical world is that it seems totally whimsical and haphazard, totally counterintuitive - from a Muggle perspective. Muggles live in a very mechanized, quantitative, and rational world, because they need to in order to survive and thrive. Wizards have magic so they've never had to develop things like logic, common sense, and scientific reasoning; not the way Muggles conceive of such notions, anyway. It might even get in the way sometimes! Many of the most talented wizards we see are slightly (or more) crazy.

I think a lot of the cliches that bother me actually stem from fanfic authors ignoring this, and just introducing Muggle elements into Wizarding society, with a few minor modifications, but still following a Muggle sense of logic. Admittedly, it's hard to step outside of a Muggle worldview, since we're all Muggles.

JKR was quite good at it though, and that gives the world she created much of the luster that keeps us writing and reading fanfics in it. It's easy to ruin this atmosphere when introducing original elements to the canon world.

They would also not just be descriptors of size, color or element but rather things more strange. For instance, in my head, Aberforth Dumbledore's magic tastes of Goat Cheese.

***** Yes, this. Even in canon, there is clearly a difference between muggles and wizards; one can do magic and the other can't, so what is that difference. And each wizard's magic is clearly different; some people are good at charms, others transfiguration, divination is clearly an inherent talent. This indicates that there is something different, not only between muggles and wizards, but also between different wizards.

I prefer to think of the magical core as an extra bodily system (something akin to the respiratory or nervous systems) that you can train. This can come across as anime-like depending on the way that it is introduced and written. I fully admit that I am influenced by the idea of chakras as introduced in The Last Airbender. However, in canon HP, they make a big deal out of the ability or lack of ability to practice magic. Dumbledore's Army is a group that formed out of this necessity; they felt they weren't getting enough practical experience behind the wand actually doing magic; these people clearly believe that simple theory is not enough to fully be able to do magic. In PoA, we see Harry struggle for months with the Patronus Charm before being able to cast it successfully on any scale. Clearly training it helped. That's why I view the magical core as something that can be trained and strengthened.

******* I can see that; a little bit too... eastern philosophy for me, but I could dig it if written well. I think my own views are viewed because I am a lifelong athlete, in particular a distance running athlete (track and field, cross country). In distance running in particular, if you practice, you will get better by training your heart and respiratory systems, but you are still somewhat limited by genetic makeup; some people will just never be great athletes because the potential is not there. I find this very analogous to the use of magic as presented in the book. We have the magical prodigies (Tom Riddle, Voldemort, probably Grindelwald), who by all accounts were simply talented from the outset. Next we have the talented wizards: probably Harry's parents, Bill Weasley, maybe Harry himself; people we know to be powerful, but not really powerful enough to be called prodigious. The next category would be those with talent, but have to work for it. I would place Ron and Neville in this category; by the end of the series they are both competent, not powerful. Then, we have several other levels of degrading magical power, ending in muggles, who don't have any magical ability (but do have the ability to have magical children). I think that each of these people have varying degrees of the magical core system; the "magic muscle;" one thing that we see is that even people who are prodigious in their magical talent had to work quite hard to get to the magical level they find themselves at; much like any athlete will tell you: hard work defeats talent on the highest levels. Basically, the magical core is definitely something that can be physically trained

The idea that it's just "athleticism" is far too mundane and boring, the irony of it notwithstanding.

I've also probably seen a lot more of these than most as I was really into post-Hogwarts fanfic back before the series was completed. Many authors felt they had to provide some details about Harry defeating Voldemort before they got on with their post-Hogwarts story, and it often defaulted to "boom, reflexes."

**** Using a muggle trauma to point out the problems in the magical world is not a bad idea, but I have a couple of questions about this idea specifically:

1. why does it have to be female Harry? A male Harry is in the same place mentally as a female Harry. Bad fanfiction (*this is not what I think*) make Harry female and then abuse her because they believe that females are weaker, more vulnerable, more emotional, or females are more traumatized by events then males, there making a 'better' story. Males are humans too.

2. why does it have to be rape? Why not physical assault? A bombing? A simple car crash? Rape removes power from the victim, but the situations that Harry gets into are not about him being completely powerless. Even in the graveyard he is given back self agency by having his wand back. So it seems odd that you want to equate what he goes through in the magical world to the muggle rape.

3. Why Dudley? Sure it is more 'angsty' and a 'bigger betrayal' to have family attack fem Harry, but Dudley is a stupid kid who used his fists to get his way, and eventually grew up to say to Harry he "was never a waste of space". Dudley, for all his faults, never seemed to be about controlling others, about taking power away from others. So why make him the rapist?

***** 1. Dudley, as far as I know, is heterosexual and would not rape a male Harry. He might attack him, but that's not really anything different than what male harry usually puts up with anyway. An author could make Dudley gay if they wanted to for a Male/Male rape, but that's their prerogative. I agree that bad fanfiction does female rape for all the wrong reasons, but this choice is more in relation to Dudley than Harry.

2. It has to be rape because, in this instance, Dudley is severely drunk and was earlier turned down for a date (which is the reason he's drunk). It also makes the attack more personal and immediately threatening than Dudley simply taking a swing at her which he does anyway. Admittedly, this might be a bad reason, but to be honest I've never really seen any /good/ reasons to put rape into a story, so that's likely something I'll have to look into. A bombing is also a good idea, but it lacks the personal intent-to-harm nature of his previous encounters (Quirrel trying to murder him, Diary Riddle directing the basilisk, the graveyard. Can't really count 3rd year cuz' the dementors will kill anything).

3. See #2. However, I do admit I have a poor grasp of Dudley's character, which is something I will have to fix. In this case it is caused by Dudley's frustration with himself and everything else in general. Dudley very well might not normally be receptive to the idea of rape, but being drunk can give someone the capacity to make very bad decisions they might not normally make.

The point I'm trying to make with the scene isn't the scene itself, it's fem!Harry's /response/ to the scene. What would you normally do in a rape situation? You run away. You call the police. Harry doesn't run away because she's used to not being /able/ to run away, so it doesn't cross her mind. The only reason she runs in the graveyard is because the Priori Incantatem ghosts told her it was even possible, and that the portkey would take her back. So when Dudley tries to rape her, she does what she always ends up doing in dangerous situations: She deals with it herself as best she can.

After the scene, Harry reflects on what happened and what she should have done. She realizes she should have called the police, because that's what you do when someone tries to rape you: /You call the police/ once you're able to do so. Why? So people who are /trained/ to deal with this and /capable/ of dealing with this hunt down the rapist and put him in jail. This is what the average civilian does in a dangerous situation. Yet at Hogwarts Harry has had to deal with deadly beasts and people trying to kill her. And she deals with it herself, because she thinks "This is Hogwarts. This is magic. This is the bad that comes with the good." But that isn't the case in the muggle world; rape isn't the flipside of getting a eating ice cream or getting a good job, because rape is a /crime/ and it's not her responsibility to deal with the rapist. Yet in the magical world she has to deal with things that could easily kill her, when there are other people who are /trained and capable/ who should be dealing with this instead.

With this in mind, her revelation is that the magical world /is not the exception/ and it is not her job to deal with all the dangerous things that she has dealt with.

Gah that was long. Hope that answered some questions.

****** That's an interesting train of revelatory thought; I like it.

However, the same situation could work if Dudley tries to strangle Harry/severely beat her instead of trying to rape her. Domestic violence and muggings are also one of those 'everyone knows to call the police' cultural touchstones and frankly, huge handprints on Harry's neck makes it more obvious to everyone that something is WRONG, whereas attempted rape itself doesn't leave as many visible bruises unless beating occurs.

Dudley never uses sexual humiliation against canon Harry- he once refers to Cedric as Harry's boyfriend but never otherwise calls Harry a poofer, canon!Dudley never implies that Dudley thinks sexual prowess is important (by saying that girls love him, etc.). He just beats Harry and other kids up for lunch money and calls Harry a freak. And yes, boys frequently use sexual humiliation against other boys to bully them- calling them gay, saying they have a small dick, calling them a big pussy, etc. But Dudley never does because his mind doesn't work that way.

So I think it's fair to say that not only is attempted rape or sexual humiliation not something that is limited to girls, but Dudley's complete lack of sexual taunts towards male!Harry means that it'd be OOC of him to try to rape a female Harry.

Also, speaking as a woman, it'd be nice to read about violence towards us that isn't likely to get an online sexual predator's rocks off too. Tbh, why normalize rape when you don't have to?

**** Unless you're changing the story a lot, the Ministry didn't deal with Quirrell and the basilisk because they were never informed of them. Also if Harry sees something like Voldemort trying to grab the Philosopher's stone and thinks s/he can stop him, it would be his/her problem because who is the #1 target once Voldemort gets his body back? Harry. It would be stupid to do nothing because you'd get killed later because of it.

And really, the Trio gave a seriously weak effort at getting an adult to deal with it. They went to find McGonagall and when she snubbed them, instead of thinking "Hey there are at least two other Heads of Houses we can go warn", they think "Welp nobody's going to do anything, better do it ourselves."

As for Voldemort, most people don't try to fight off an armed robber in their own home, they just barricade themselves in a room and call the police. And then go into witness protection if it turns out that robber has a hardon for their death.

** The Weasleys are gold diggers! Pfft. Yeah. Okay. Worst gold diggers in existence, I guess.

Harry is the sweetest thing since cotton candy and must be defended against the mean, mean world. Ugh! This is often paired with Harry being exceptionally delicate-looking.

Harry the long-suffering martyr. He's depression, guilt, and self-involvement given human form. EVERYTHING is his fault.

Harry does a 180 and decides everyone is against him. It's labeled as independence but comes off like extreme paranoia. Related: Harry gets a long list of innate skills (often from goblins.) Usually paired with Harry buying half the books and tools from Diagon and Knockturn Alley.

Harry is beat/chained/almost-killed by the Dursleys regularly, and he is terrified of them. The Dursleys are all kinds of messed up but not only is habitual beatings not canon but Harry is not a wilting flower around them. At some point before he turned 11, he decided they were fools and often lets them know it.

Draco is a smooth operator and the Prince of Slytherin. In fact, all Slytherin's are ultra-cool and detached. Please. The only one who has maintained that image has been Blaise Zabini.

Snape is secretly nice... Yup. That's where I stop. Sometimes paired with James being an irredeemable jerk who probably gave Lily a love potion.

Dumbledore is a masterful manipulator who acts like a dim child when he's caught. "Why would anyone not agree with my totally-evil plan? I don't get why they're mad." That's the great manipulator?

It involves characters being manipulative and/or emphasising their flaws without thinking about their strengths. It /infuriates/ me, because that sort of thinking pretends these were two- or even one-dimensional characters, when they're obviously not. I mean, /really/...it almost feels lazy to write that sort of story. There's so much canon material out there nowadays to use in order to understand/ build character motivations etc. If someone really wants to write a "fix-it" type fic about certain characters' attitudes, there are ways of making those fics be about character growth and development (rather than irreversible flaws)... I like that sort of thing. No character in the HP books (except perhaps Voldemort) is completely "black" or "white".

***** Yes, but once you put something so unusual in a story - and make it seem rare even in the wizarding world - the readers' expectations will be raised that you put it there for a reason. Take metamorphing away from Tonks, and it doesn't change her character arc or her actions at all. Which makes the talent itself feel like a red herring (to me).

I've never read a fic that makes Harry a metamorphmagus (not challenging their existence, just that I tend to bounce off fics that load Harry down with extra powers), but I could easily imagine it being an interesting part of his time at Hogwarts - how he uses it, how it changes other students' reactions to him, how it enables him to sneak around the castle, how he fools some of the teachers, what might happen if he loses control of it, e.g. doesn't realize his annoyance has just transformed his face into ugly!Draco, how he might take risks by trying to pass himself off as someone important in order to get information - the sort of stuff Harry would do, but with a different spin on it because he has this non-canon ability he can't resist using.

I don't think it /has/ to be a cliché, but of course that entirely depends upon the individual writer's talent.

** While I found the whole "/Harry is the heir of half a dozen magical families/" amusing in the beginning - these kinds of stories could be great fun to read if done right - it quickly became incredibly popular and authors actually took the whole thing seriously, which is the worst mistake ever. The same is true for those who write a Dumbledore/Weasley bashing fic and be serious about it. Make a parody of it, have fun with overdone characterizations and I love to read it.

The whole idea of Gringotts providing more than storage and security services (which is what vaults are used for, after all) is actually quite smart. It's difficult to get a good idea on canon!goblins, but it's clear that they are rather distrustful of wizards. From there it is not too large a leap to "/lets subtly cheat the dumb wizards out of everything we can get our hands on/". Although I like that kind of thing (if done right), the problem most authors have is its inclusion in their stories when there is no need to do that. Goblins aren't important for wizards, since they only view them as beasts who keep the wizards' money safe, which is exactly why it has become a bit bothersome to read about these amazing goblins every bloody time. I'd much rater see it done right a dozen times than wrong by hundreds of authors.

On another note, I have a real difficulty of getting into stories that feature Slytherins as main characters, whether told from their point of view or not. I don't think many of them are nearly as bad as they're made out to be in canon, just growing up in such an environment is reason enough why they aren't shining examples of humanity. It's not easy to write about an antagonist without throwing the whole canon on its head. The vast majority of post-Hogwards Draco/Hermione stories for example, or the Severus/Hermione AU stories for that matter, totally break my suspension of disbelief. All of them spent years growing up as each others enemies and even fought a war over their difference in their outlook and conviction. I don't think them finding romance with each other works so quickly after the end of hostilities. Maybe put such a story 20-30 years into the future and after each side of such a pairing has gotten enough life experience and I may start to believe that it could eventually be possible. Haven't seen anything like that yet, but I admit to not having looked too hard for it either.

*** Having the power to defend yourself does not mean you can conceive of doing so, especially if you were raised in such a culture.

For example, in many cults women are treated terribly and made to only fit in 'womens' roles, like tending the home and having children. Many of these women were raised in a modern, liberated society. These cults also tend to have a lot of weapons around. And yet, the women don't rise up and kill everyone, they don't even /leave/ when they can.

It's similar (but not totally the same) in an abusive relationship, a women could easily take up the kitchen knife and stab the bastard who is hitting her. /But she doesn't/, because she can't see herself doing so.

Patriarchal societies existed for thousands of year before women's liberation, and you can not tell me that women in Afghanistan are fundamentally different (less intelligent, less stubborn, less able to be independent), to women in America, and yet despite the fact that 87 per cent of Afghanistan women experience domestic violence, it continues to happen.

This is the magical disanalogy. In the magical world women would be able to seize their rights by force, though actually even that doesn't make sense. Because men have no monopoly on magical violence as they do/did in the Muggle world, there's no reason to think a patriarchal society would arise in the first place.

It's not really inconceivable that witches were raised to think they had to obey men, and believed it (a big part of them at least), because that's what happens today in many patriarchal societies still.

****** There's a hanging question over the extent to which 1692 was when secrecy started vs the date at which a long-existing secrecy was legally recognised. Quidditch Through the Ages, at least, seems to imply that secrecy was the de facto norm well before the statute, and the Muggle and magical worlds were historically separate.

For example, on page 11 of QttA, it refers to the Wizards' Council of the 1200s trying to prevent "Muggle broomstick sightings". Further, chapter five of the book is entirely about "Anti-Muggle Precautions" and we read about the various ways wizards tried to stay hidden from the Muggles hundreds of years before the Statute. The book makes it clear that the Statute not so much created secrecy so much as it created punishments for Ministries that failed to enforce it perfectly: "the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy of 1692 made every Ministry of Magic directly responsible for the consequences of magical sport played within their territories".

So there's a strong implication that magical and Muggle worlds have been separate for a very long time indeed, and certainly far longer than the Statute of Secrecy. As far as it concerns women, a look at the chocolate frog cards indicates no shortage of powerful historical witches not under the control of any patriarchal society, going back all the way to the ancient world.

******* I think this comes back to tight and loose canon, in the /books by themselves/, the society appears to be very patriarchal.

Molly stays at home, despite the fact they need money and she could work. Narcissa is also a 'stay at home mum', as were Lily and Alice from what we know.

The only married magical women who worked at all appeared to be Luna's mum, and she 'worked' from home, but may not have been paid.

The women who /do/ have jobs are almost sexless spinsters like McGonagall and never been married (or will be) like Bones and Umbridge. Apart from Bones, /all/ the positions of power mentioned are men.

In the national sport, there is a team set aside of /just/ women, even though the sport is clearly not affected by physical strength and therefore all the teams should be integrated and there be no need for a women only team.

Tonks is the only female auror we know of, and she was a rare metamorphmagus apprenticed to Moody himself.

In other words, the few women who are not in very traditional 'women roles' seem to be rare exceptions, not the norm. In the wider canon powerful women are mentioned more, sure. But for just the books, it could be thought to be very male dominated.

Ahem. Excuse me, but Minerva McGonagall is way sexier to me than someone like Molly Weasley. I have no problem at all imagining McGonagall having an interesting private life that's simply irrelevant to Harry's story. She has no children, but that doesn't mean no sex. I fully expect she and the other witches on staff unwind on a regular basis with a few drinks, discussions of books and magical theory (they're academics, after all), and who's sleeping with whom.

I do think the books come across as implicitly patriarchal because JKR reproduced what she herself had been raised with. She was a young writer who set a fantasy in a magical boarding school; it didn't occur to her to examine her own assumptions or notice the disparity she'd created. I suspect if she were writing the books now, the distribution of active roles in the series would look a little different.

I'd only call it an excuse if I assumed she knew better and just didn't bother doing it, but I'm fairly sure it never crossed her mind to look at her unconscious biases - just as it didn't occur to her that her maths were wrong or that there were plotholes/coincidences/infodumps she might want to revise. Blind spots, maybe (although by DH I get the feeling she was also really tired and willing to rush things into print).

******* A Pottermore entry also reveals there were female Ministers all the way back in 1798.

Contrary to popular fanon, this means the Wizarding World is much more progressive than many, many muggle countries today.

************ First, we don't know if it is a popular election, or always was a popular election. It's rather likely that the Wizengamot elected the minister, and we don't know how the Wizengamot members were elected - if they even were elected. The British House of Lords certainly wasn't a democratically elected parliament back then as we understand the term today.

Second, it is the same: Just because the leader is a woman sometimes doesn't mean the society is not patriarchal.

"The Minister for Magic is democratically elected[...] Generally speaking, and despite many a moan and grumble, their community is behind them in a way that is rarely seen in the Muggle world."

In other words, yes, they are (usually) democratically elected by public vote. The source is that very same Pottermore article.

Oh, I'm not contesting that. That's not what this is about, though.

It's that many countries still bar women from positions of significant power, and the Wizarding world, at least in Britain, seemed to elect women to such positions much earlier than their Muggle counterparts.

Therefore, the original statement of them being more progressive than many are today is still true.

EDIT for clarity.

************** "Democratically elected" doesn't really mean the same thing for everyone. It says nothing about who was allowed to vote, for example - in many states not everyone could vote, for example. No matter what the law said.

I'd also not call the wizarding society "more progressive". The fact that they allow slavery is enough to disprove that claim. They might be more progressive in some areas, but given how despicably barbaric many of their laws are, they certainly do not come close to western Democracies.
