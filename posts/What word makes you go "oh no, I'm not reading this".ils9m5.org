You're reading a fic and then you come across /this/ /word/ and you just cringe so hard that you close the tab and think /nope/


** I struggle a lot when I'm reading a fic and the names for the characters' dirty bits get significantly weirder as you go... its starts out with the actual term, then a typical slang/nickname, then somehow devolves into something that I think is supposed to be like sexier or something? Like why you gotta keep calling a clitoris a "pleasure pearl"??? Now I'm just picturing a big ole pearl down there, all shiny and round, ready to be added to a necklace or something... I fully get needing to shake up the language so its not repetitious but lord sakes alive yall where do you come up with this stuff?

*** I think a lot of these scenes are written by folks who haven't actually performed the sex act they are describing. That's ok, it's part of the fun of writing, but seriously if someone I was having sex with said, "Oh, Jalapeno, your pleasure pearl is glistening..." I'd be like "Shut up and lick it!"

So that's my rule of thumb. Would it sound sexy to actually have it in the dialogue, or would the partner have to tell you to shut up and lick it? If the latter, find another way to describe what's going on, rather than describing the anatomy itself.

So, so snooty of me, I know. And I try to holistically assess the story before I bolt, but - yeah, it's associated with underdeveloped writing and meandering plot and heavy reliance on tropes. So it's not actually about Harry's Avada Kedavera ‚Äúorbs‚Äù, not really. Just a correlation that makes me do a quick stock-take and (more often than not) bounce that back button.

*** I always have to wonder if the people who write that phrase have ever been kissed. But let's think about what this would actually mean:

If one assumes "battling for dominance" is a physical endeavour, one would assume the primary motion of the tongue would be side-to-side, because up-and-down movement is weaker. If you are "battling for dominance", you would know of this deficiency and not try to attack the opposing tongue from the top or bottom. Therefore, you would work on strengthening the extrinsic muscles. In particular, the genioglossus muscle would need to be strengthened and stretched because that is the only muscle in the tongue that is used to extend the tongue forward out of the mouth.

However, if we have all been interpreting these passages incorrectly and "battling for dominance" is more of a showcase than a fight, then the intrinsic muscles would need to be strengthened. These muscles are used to curl the tongue, roll the tongue, and engage in speaking, swallowing, and eating.

Obviously, the true "battle for dominance" would use a combination of these tongue muscles and the winner would be the partner who would demonstrate stronger side-to-side strength and greater tongue flexibility would prove to be the winner of such a fight.

Now for a truly fair "battle for dominance," tongue lengths must be compared to ensure they are less that one standard deviation apart from each other. The average length of a tongue, when stuck outside the mouth, is around 3 cm, but the world record is recorded as 10 cm. It is unreasonable to expect a 10 cm tongue to battle a 3 cm tongue. It's like weight classes in wrestling; there must be tongue classes as well.

Now that I have considered what is needed for a "battle for dominance," I find myself disturbed that it occurs so frequently, and with no care for the safety of the participant. If tongue classes are ignored, not only do the risk of injuries increase due to reflexive biting, but the potential of being choked to death is quite high if one is battling a tongue of over 10 cm. What a horrible way to die.

Please be careful while "battling for dominance," kids!

NOT HAVE OLD VAULTS!

Why the hell would the goblins preserve a fortune sitting in an abandoned vault for centuries, just on the off chance a new heir suddenly appears out of nowhere? It would go to the closest relative at the time of the owner's death. Barring that, it would go to the state, or the goblins (whose defining attribute is greed) would just claim it, rather than giving it to some distant heir ("Yep Harry, you're actually Hufflepuff's long-lost heir! Unfortunately, uh, there's totally no fortune to go with that. Nope." It's not like they get audited.) Same goes for abandoned manor houses. Mansions don't just sit empty for centuries waiting for an heir who will probably never show up.

Besides, James Potter was a pureblood fully integrated into wizarding society. Anything inheritance test Harry takes would have also been given to James, so if Harry really is Lord Hadrian James Merlin-Gryffindor-Peverel-Slytherin-Potter, then James would have had those lordships and fortunes too, and it wouldn't be some big surprise!

***** For Lordships it's even dumber, because in those fics, the government tends to work based on the Lords. So by not eliminating dead Lordships and elevating another minor family to the spot they are literally actively crippling their agency, power, and influence.

Additionally, a noble title has to be recognized by the state, or the active nobility. You can't just declare yourself a Lord and the other Lords are SOL, they can deny you. Just straight up. Say you're either not legit in general, or that you don't have the right to the titles, or that you don't deserve them, etc. So Harry could never spring his power on anyone, because the entire Wizengamot would just deny him and leave him on the streets destitute once they've confiscated all he has or will ever own. Because that's how the government would be structured in those fics.

***** It's very easy to understand why they might have them - the goblins presumably put a fee for the vaults, and with magic it could just be draining it directly from the inside of the vaults, making them get all the money without a fuss. Contracts and laws might make them have to keep the vaults around as well. After all, there've been a lot of fights between wizards and goblins, and it appears that the wizards typically have won those. Seems feasible that this type of practice would have been enforced in those deals.

I do agree on the mansions/landed possessions outside Gringotts - there would need to be something very specific for that to be feasible. The only way I can think of would be a very heavily defended/warded manor, with the keys to those defenses being within the Gringotts vault. So the effort to break those defenses would be far more than it'd be worth, and so it just sits there unoccupied. Otherwise, they'd need to be possessions that are relatively short time - eg, Potter family possessions.

There are a few options for Harry inheriting more than his father - but they're hard to do in an interesting way. Just to throw some out there though, they could be inheritances that his father never bothered to get tested for (eg - the Peverells dying out and the goblins not bothering to transfer it over to the new lawful owners), it could be through his mother, it could be by 'right of conquest' or through the horcrux distorting things, it could be through the Blacks, or it could be through houses disappearing with the war causing new inheritances.

I don't necessarily like those from a narrative standpoint, unless the conflict is going to be on the political sphere and Harry needs a foot in the door there to be important. Unfortunately people like to just make Harry obscenely powerful, which is super boring on its own.

I always imagined that these old Vaults come from old contracts and so can't be removed. And Goblins are at least known to keep their word.

Maybe there's some magic at the Bank, or contracts set up with old families that prevented them from just removing one of their Vaults.

It's not like they have a lack of space, or as if having a Vault there bears any cost to them.

Can you imagine if some pureblood came accusing Gringotts they robbed him? And had some proof? It would be a big mess, and it would all be avoided by doing nothing, at no cost for them.

In the one story I am writing where he is a descendant of Slytherin(the firstborn line in the story, that either became squibs or never presented themselves), the only thing he gets is a signet ring, and a whole lot of prejudice and problems when it gets out. The money and properties went to the other sons.

He gets more stuff from the Potters, who as a rich family had some properties and money, but not billions of galleons or anything exorbitant, just old money stuff.

****** But the decision on what to do with the vault takes place when the owner dies. It goes to their heir, and if there is no heir, it goes to the closest living relative. If there are no relatives, it would probably just escheat to the state after a given period of time. But whatever happens, there would be some decision or procedure for disposing of it around the time of the original owner's death. The chances of a secret heir that pops up 500 years later demanding ancient fortunes are vanishingly slim. There is just no reason to keep giant fortunes in limbo for ages because when there's no heir found to begin with, there's nowhere for a new heir to come from later, so it just wastes the entire fortune by preventing anyone from using it, ever. It would be bad policy for everyone to pointlessly tie up resources like that by maintaining vaults packed with gold belonging to no one. Plot contrivance aside, if there's no heir now, there will never be an heir in the future, and /something/ needs to be done with the treasure.

What if the inheritance can only go to direct blood descendants? Or maybe only to the firstborn line? And what if there's magical ways that say if there's one and until that method tells there isn't they can't touch it.

And yes, centuries is too long, I agree by that time there either isn't a line anymore, or it would have been found already.

But you can find some ways around that without being too illogical, it could just be artifacts and Gringotts has a history of keeping those for millenia. It could be James knew but it was a secret.

****** Harrison is a fine name. But for some reason, whenever i see it in HP fanfics, my mind immediately went to Harrison Ford, and conclude that "yup, this author is american, and watch Star Wars". Which is weird because turns out, it's a much popular name in England than in the US.

On the other hand, Harrison is a great name for Harry's son. "Who's this young man?" "Oh, he's my son" "What's his name?" "Harrison." Imagine a conversation like that.

**** People want to have a longer, more noble sounding name than "Harry" for those fics. If you're not British, it's not necessarily easy to realize that Harry can be a nickname for "Henry". In comparison, both Harrison and Hadrian being shortened seem like that'd be logical to Harry.

For Hadrian in particular, the Roman connection also adds some cache to it. Many wizarding names seem to be older fashioned and with Latin/Greek connections, at least for the purebloods - so that's why I think people have latched on to Hadrian.

***** I love Hadrian as a name. But I'm french so it's more Adrian for me (or Adrien in French). And it isn't a rare or snobbish name here. I mean, I work with one, I dated another years ago, and I think there's two kids by that name at the school I work at.

None of them are nicknamed Harry.

However, in the H.P cultural context, it just doesn't work out. It's James, Harry, Charlus, Henry, Abraham Potters. Many have common, regular name (at least for their time period). So a rare name just doesn't fit.

It's interesting how different culture can change perception.

According to canon, the person who becomes an animagus expresses their physical features in the appearance of the animal. It doesn't seem too far-fetched, therefore, that the animal would also express itself in the person, if not physically then mentally. So when Sirius speaks in dog terms or Lupin speaks in wolf terms, I just accept it as a believable part of the world-building. Especially a post-Azkaban Sirius who spent as much time in dog form as he could to preserve his sanity.

Personally I don't think pet names come across well in dialogue 90% of the time anyway, but even if people disagree I think there are loads more commonly accepted pet names for children that feel more authentic coming from two adult British men that grew up in the 60s and 70s.

I think that summed it up. Similar sentence constructions (even though I admit I am guilty of using way too many adjectives than necessary, I would never do such an abomination! /shudders/) and that, that freaking description freaks me out more than imagining Voldemort having intercourse in his creepy snake hybrid form...

(I do not mind slash honestly, but why do they have to fudging feminise the male character!? And those adjectives! They are nightmare inducing! Oh I am going to have horrid ones, especially as I typed that crap!)

And Lyra Aquarius Alexa Cornelia Phoenix Black Potter Peverell or even the same name copied pasted and different last names; and metamorphagus powers, with the ability to shift into multiple animagus forms or even an Original character doing the same and having tons of guys following her around without any sort of character interactions (Hey I love reverse harem as much as any girl would; but this?! Hell to the naw!)

In short Mary Sues.

I think the reverse is applicable for every sentence I mentioned, I am not a sexist, in fact I am a feminist and that means equality of both genders you know?!

*** Actually, this reminds me of the power level problem in Dragon Ball. These fics reduce someone'e potential to their magical core, which is largely genetic. It's so clear in the books that someone's magical ability is based on their skill level, not on how powerful their magical core is.

Going on this magical core thing though, I'd love to read a fic that delves into the workings of magic. Harry Potter is what I'd call a "soft magic" system, where the rules of how the powers workings aren't well explained (to be fair, I don't mean that the magic isn't well established, I mean that the magic is abstract) . I'd love to see someone realistically work that into a "hard magic" system where the rules of magic are concrete. If this involves magical cores, so be it, but I'd want to see it well written.

Here's this amazing, almost living force of pure primordial chaos, capable of anything if the right imagination and thought is applied to it. It will give thoughts form, bring memories to life and change the tides of luck itself!

And then the scientist!character guts it down into zero-point energy manipulation, then invents spellguns and puts some ex-machina alloy on bullets to break any shield and equips the british army to subjugate the wizards like the british empire has risen again, then makes a chemical that turns all wizards into squibs and mundanizes all magical life, which is then enslaved in the science mines to gather physics research.

And then they airstrike Voldemort who despite growing up with WWII propaganda around every street corner didn't even put a basic bounciness enchantment on his roof.

** songfics. like, if the prose is interspersed with the lines of songs. or when the author copy/pastes a whole verse, or even a whole song, as it's being sung by a character.

poor/inconsistent grammar/spelling. Luscious Malfoy.

and when it's blatantly obvious the author hasn't bothered to look up British wordings/spellings/customs. pancakes, ma'am, mom, dollars, biscuits meaning rolls instead of cookies.\\
same for fics where the author ignores the setting and writes in references for things that didn't exist yet, weren't developed to the point we know them at now, or weren't widespread/widely known in Britain at the time.

genderbending, when it's for no reason other than the author not wanting to write slash or wanting to write a specific femslash and when the author doesn't actually bother exploring gender dynamics. there are several good fics with Harry or other characters of a different gender than in canon, or trans and not assigned the same gender at birth that they have in canon; but most of the ones i've seen are just there bc the author wants to write Drarry and have it be straight or write Harry/Ginny and have it be sapphic. genderbent fics can only be good imo if the author actually takes stuff like misogyny (or transphobia, when applicable) into account.

going off that, tropes that boil down to reproduction or gender essentialism: soulbonds, ABO, mpreg, Veela bond, etc. grosses me out.

soulmate fics where characters get into serious relationships at a young age, have underage sex, or end up marrying the person they start dating as a teenager.

sexual assault being there for shock value or for a reason to bash a character, without trauma/other consequences explored at all. same for other types of abuse outside of the canonical treatment of Harry by the Dursleys.

first person pov. i just can't. the only exceptions are if it's told by an OC, sometimes.

"Muggle" being a slur and being replaced with "Mundane." it feels pointless.

Harry being named Hadrian, and actually wanting people to call him Hadrian. same for Harold. same, on a lesser level, by Harry actually going by the hyphenated last names of every single family he's apparently the heir of.

However realistically I'm also aware that's by now a pretty embedded part of HP fandom, so I don't completely nix anything with those elements. I just find them a bit reductive - the whole point of the series was meant to be that magic was what you did with it, rather than there being some kind of /inherently/ mystically Bad magics that would corrupt you if you started to use them, like a poison or similar. That kind of concept comes from other properties with a much more classical-magic bent, or works with (in my experience) a religious metaphor or savior-story at their core.

"Ma'am".

It obliterates any attempt at characterisation for young /British/ characters to go around calling strangers (or adults generally) "sir" or "ma'am".

It's clearly a common phenomenon in the US, but in the UK we are just not that formal. It breaks the "voice" of the fic if the main characters suddenly inexplicably have American mannerisms, and as soon as the first "ma'am" rears its head, I subconsciously begin looking out for more signs that the writer hasn't captured the characters.

"Sir" has a bit more leeway because there are some contexts where it might get used, but if you go around the UK calling women "ma'am", they'll think you're taking the piss, or have mistaken them for the Queen.

That trope always bothered me. Why would they protect coins against melting them down? If they have enough gold to mint an entire dungeon full of them (judging by the few descriptions we get of the Gringotts vaults, they can easily store billions of Galleons), they would not even notice if someone melted even ten thousand of them down, nevermind that most people will have even a thousand in the bank. And if anything, if people reduce the amount of currency by removing some of it, the rest is worth more.

I mean, it's not like they buy gold on the London Metal Exchange and then mint coins way below the material value of gold. If you want to protect against economic abuse, just add a cap on how much pounds they accept each month/year.

** Abusive relationships as the main focus is the trope that invokes the strongest distaste for me, and makes me stop reading a fic. The keyword being "main focus" -- I'm mostly desensitized to abusive Tobias/Eileen, and if the main focus is on, say, Snape's crappy life instead of the relationship itself, I wont stop reading the fic for it. But abusive Ron/Hermione? James/Lily? Or some Hermione/DE forced noncon relationship? Any other abusive relationship where the main character is one of the ones affected? I've seen all of those examples, and I detest them all, and if I see it, I'll stop reading the fic. In fact, an abusive!Jily fic affected me badly enough for me to lose all interest in that ship completely, and I still avoid the ship if i can. It was after this that I stopped reading fics centered on abusive relationship in general.

There are other instadrops for me such as mpreg, but that's more of a "oh well I guess this isn't for me" rather than "no no NO please go away".
