** Whenever I'm re-reading The Changeling I'm often struck with how awesome it would be to read the books as they are now but with all the Ginny stuff happening in the background.

That scene where Ginny calls Harry a hypocrite?? I would love for that to be canon and to have read it from his perspective.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** I would keep the story, but add /Alexandra Quick/ linkffn(3964606):as a second series that happens later on, just continuing the story of special wizarding children across the world. I'm really interested in the idea of how wizards live in different cultures. I would totally be interested in a series (fanfiction or not) that takes place in another country.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
