Let me explain my stance: for all it's whimsy and eccentricity, the Wizarding World is dreadfully mundane. You have flying on brooms, wands, and pointy hats, but it's all just window dressing. If you're a witch or wizard in the HP world, your life's course is to go to school, get a job, and, hopefully, start a family. Rinse and repeat.

As a thought experiment, lets take Harry Potter and his quest out of the world it takes place in. That means no Voldemort and no Death Eaters; just the society of Wizarding Britain, functioning as intended. What we're left with, in that case, isn't adventure and daring-do, "local gods" exploring and expanding their domains; but housewives, tradesmen, clerks and public servants. Normal people who, /incidentally/, can do magic.

Sure, some professions are more exciting than others, and it makes sense to have a central government, taxation, and all the things that go with it. But that's where all this /normalcy/ comes from. By having wizards living completely separated from the normal world, they now have to take care of all of a society's needs themselves - like managing of public transport, taxation, law enforcement and emergency services. /Hell/, goods and services /in general/. What you end up having, is just our world, but /weird/.

One thing I could see be done, is to make it smaller. Have the magicals hidden among the normal populace, living ordinary lives, working normal jobs, that they occasionally enhance through magic; it's practically what they're doing already. This way you avoid the need for a large government and many of the constraints that come with it, leaving only one rule - /Don't get caught!/ I can still see the specialty professions existing - wandmakers, enchanters, potioners and healers, as well as aurors, for when things go /really wrong/, but overall you're left with a much more streamlined society. Orphans and muggleborn are in the minority, if I remember correctly, so they can be fostered or apprenticed under other magicals, until they are self-sufficient (everyone else has their friends and family to rely on). Schools like Hogwarts and the like can function like academies or universities - elite institutions, attended by those who want to push boundaries and become something exceptional.

Another way to do it, would be to make the magical world bigger. /Much bigger./ Hell, add a Fae Realm and Underworld, and make places like King's Cross station and Diagon Alle be just small areas where the two intersect (many mythologies have other worlds that exist along our own, that can be entered trough a physical location, connecting the two). This way you can have any kind of cultural differences, moon-logic, and bizarre legal and moral norms, and have it all /make sense/. You can do away with all that "don't let the muggles notice" nonsense and have some truly fantastical buildings, vehicles and fashions!

I don't know what brought this on. I guess I just want to keep enjoying a world that starts to fall apart, once examined under an adult's scrutiny. Mostly, I guess, I want to see the characters I've grown to like in something that stimulates the imagination, rather than contrive some machiavellian plot, that takes place in the equivalent of someone's backyard.

So? How would /you/ make the Wizarding World /magical/?


** Personally I like the "normalcy" of magic - I feel that is what keeps the HP world so relatable.

Magic can fix many material needs we Muggles have, which gives the reader the "God I wish I was a wizard" feeling which is so key to the HP universe's lasting appeal. We want magic so much because we can see how it could be used in our current day-to-day lives to make life so much easier.

But at the same time magic doesn't fundamentally alter the nature of interpersonal relationships or social problems. In this way we can see parallels to our real world problems in the HP universe while still having the "Wish I was a wizard/magic would solve so much" feeling. It's like the perfect combo to reel readers in.

This is why I dislike fanfics that have veritaserum be infallible, or memories be reliable enough you can use them in trials, or for it to be possible to just swear an oath and now everyone knows you are telling the truth.

All of these ideas undermine the relatability of the HP society, because a society where you are never uncertain because the truth can be guaranteed; where you don't have to trust people because it's possible to completely eliminate the possibility of betrayal... this is not a world that we can look at and recognise our real-world problems in.

In particular I don't see how taking away magical professions and giving wizards "normal jobs" makes them seem more magical.

In my fanfic, one of the ways I make the magical world feel more magical is to use ecological themes. Wizards are able to enjoy a higher quality of life than Muggles without any reliance on infrastructure or industry. Additionally we know that for reasons of secrecy, most wizards live in rural locales. This to me gives the magical world a fundamentally bucolic character which feels romantic to modern sensibilities.

Some selected excepts from VP Chapter 14 (The Workshop) which are focused on this:

#+begin_quote
  The Muggle world felt /wrong/.

  Hogwarts was filled with nooks and crannies, hidden alcoves and spiral staircases, but everything was neatly rectangular at Number Four, Privet Drive. The anemic electric lights were a pale imitation of a flickering, crackling fire, and the front garden was little more than a square of grass, not a single blade out of place, its perimeter brimming with meticulously arranged flowerbeds. Just like everything else in the Muggle world, there was nothing wild there, nothing truly /alive/.

  Claustrophobia was setting in, and Victoria found herself longing for wide, open spaces---forests and valleys and sprawling castles perched atop tall cliffs.

  [...]

  Vernon left for work, and soon enough Petunia drove Victoria down to Great Whinging high street, where a number of charity shops were to be found. As they looked for a parking space, once again Victoria was struck by the strangeness of the Muggle world, all concrete and plastic and glass. It was as if the Muggles were determined to kill off all connection to nature.

  She had been thinking about this a lot over the summer. Muggle technology depended on the laws of nature, and yet Muggles seemed so disconnected from everything green and living. Meanwhile, wizards lived in close contact with the natural world, even though their powers continuously defied it. At first Victoria thought that it was simply because wizards didn't need things like electricity and roads, but her time in the garden had made her rethink that idea. Magic was supernatural, yes, but it was also closely connected to nature. It was an interesting contradiction.
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  She began to relax. The sun and wind had dried her out quickly, and now the broom was level she could sit back in the saddle without having to clutch it with her thighs. At first she didn't think they were going that fast---certainly the breeze wasn't too strong---but when she risked another glance down, she noticed that the clouds where zooming past beneath them, faster than any car. They quickly left London behind, the urban sprawl giving way to farmland dotted with small towns. Victoria took a deep breath of the cool, clean air. At last she was out of the crowded Muggle world with its smog and litter. This was where she belonged.

  Every so often they would pass other flyers in the sky, from lone riders to families on long tandem brooms like their own. Each time they crossed paths with another flyer, Mr Bones would slow down to greet them, often calling out to them by name:

  “Afternoon, Lincoln!”

  “Byron, old chap! Perfect day for a spot of flying!”

  “Leaky on Saturday, Abbott?”

  One time they were even overtaken by a greenish blur on a racing broom.

  “That's a Cleansweep Six, girls!” Mr Bones shouted as their own broom wobbled in its wake. “Probably one of the Holyhead Harpies!”

  Not long after their encounter with the racer, they came across a wooden signpost sticking out of a cloud, directing flyers towards Diagon Alley, Godric's Hollow, Mould-on-the-Wold, Appleby and even Hogsmeade. It was here that they began to veer to the east, heading into the Fens. The land below became flatter, a lush green riddled with rivers.

  [...]

  ... they shot down towards a tall, irregularly shaped building on the east bank of the river. A water wheel jutted out from its side, turning steadily in the rapid current, and ivy grew all over the stone walls. The house---for surely this was where Susan lived---was surrounded by vegetable plots, and beyond them were fields in which a handful of cows grazed. There wasn't a road or electricity pylon in sight.

  A flat platform occupied around half of the roof, almost like a Muggle helicopter pad. They circled it as would a carrion bird, each circuit bringing them closer, spiraling downward until they were coming in to land.
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  The tour concluded on the ground floor, which was far more homey than the rest of the house. It was clear that this was where the Bones really lived. A second kitchen looked out upon the vegetable patches, much smaller than the one upstairs but well used, with muddy boots next to the back door, half-melted candles on the kitchen table, and jars holding tea leaves and coffee beans by the stove. The kitchen was connected to a cosy den heaped with cushions, blankets and board games, and that in turn led to a small library, the shelves overflowing with generations of accumulated books.

  [...]

  They had some juice and biscuits---shortbread from a Muggle bakery in nearby Eley, which Mr Bones made them promise to keep secret from Arthur Weasley---before going outside to explore. Susan led her past carrots and cauliflower, rhubarb and raspberries, Victoria's Muggle trainers getting increasingly muddy as they made their way towards the river.

  [...]

  The afternoon was spent outside. They wandered down the river, several times having to hop across mossy rocks to the other side when the east bank became too steep. They climbed trees, played pooh sticks, and looked for frogs, shrieking and running away every time they actually found one. Eventually they doubled back to the house, where Susan rooted out a skipping rope so that Victoria could show her how to hover in the air.

  [...]

  “Customer!” Mr Bones called out of the kitchen window, “and look at the state of you!” They were splattered with mud, with grass stains on their dresses and messy hair. “Upstairs to clean up, before your mother arrives for tea!”

  The girls retreated back to their bedrooms, where they washed and changed while Mr Bones was meeting the new customer. Victoria took her time about it: the day had already been eventful, and it all caught up with her as she lowered herself into the hot water of the bath. She explored the toiletries that had been left for her, scrubbing her face with half a sugar-lemon and washing her hair thoroughly with Sleekeazy's Hair Potion , which smelled strongly of coconut and left her long, dark hair gleaming in the fairylight.

  She decided to dress up for the evening, wanting to look nice for her birthday and make a good impression on Susan's mother. She selected the same velvet green dress robe she had worn to Dumbledore's party, slipped Mrs Malfoy's silver charm bracelet onto her wrist, and put up her hair up into a waterfall braid. After vacillating on the matter, she even used the tiniest amount of the makeup Pansy had given her for Christmas, applying some lip gloss and, after several failed attempts, eyeshadow.

  It was fortunate that she'd gone to the effort, because when Susan bounced into her room (knocking was apparently not known to Hufflepuffs) she was similarly attired, wearing an embroidered white dress robe and daisies in her hair.

  [...]

  They made their way to the ground floor kitchen, where the table had been laid for dinner.

  “Really, Bruce, you have a perfectly good dining room,” Evelyn complained as they were climbing down the spiral staircase, “why not use it?”

  Victoria preferred the kitchen. The candles were lit and the door had been left open, a gentle summer's breeze drifting in with the distant sounds of cattle lowing.

** I enjoy the small things, not whole new dimensions or worlds. But the subtle difference between everything. Like I really like the whomping willow and I think more magical plants are needed to be explored. Like why are there so few magical trees? You think there be hundreds just as a way to build better wands or brooms or something. Or maybe magical insects like butterflies that can change the shape and color of their wings to mimic stuff or crickets with the ability to create enchanting lullabies. I think that would be cooler than one giant man-eating spider species.

And you're right if the worlds are already seperated why are the building not more extravagant. Where are the floating houses? Or shopping plazas built on a cloud or something. I imagine in times before planes and hot air balloons there would be at least some sort of floating city just cause wizards could.

Another thing I would like to see more is the religious aspect of the wizarding world. Like its fine and dandy for some of it to be Christianized because cultures change. But you think some of the old pagan religions would be prominent as those religions are very cult base and have rituals that could take on powerful meanings in the wizarding world. The few fanfics I see touch upon this always do it well and I just want more of this.

That is my take on a more magical wizarding world.

*** Yeah, those could be cool. Like a garden where the flowers sound like wind-chimes, or someone straight up Alice-in-Wonderland's the whole thing with gossiping flora and a sapient caterpillar as a gardener, or something.

Or, imagine if on Halloween the dead actually stopped by, to look in on their descendants, like an extra-large family gathering. Religion, I think, would be very different, in a culture where literally anything is possible, with enough effort and the right knowledge.

** There are a couple of things I can think of to make the Wizarding World more 'magical'.

The first is simply, give it history. I swear that J.K.Rowling decided to make the history professor such a dull, unimportant figure so that she could get away with students (and by extension, the reader) not having ANY interest in the history of the magical world. Merlin and Morgana both existed in the HP universe. So therefore one can reason that other myths and legends did as well besides just the creature. What about Norse mythology? Were the Aisir, Vanir and other figures of Asgardian legends real? Was there actually a giant magical tree that Muggles would see as the 'World Tree'? What about the Greeks? Romans? We know that there were ancient Egyptian wizards but did they take the place of what would become muggle legend?

Even beyond that, there are hundreds of mythical artifacts of legend in the real world. What about having them be real? The fanfiction 'Partially Kissed Hero' did a good job on that aspect. Though it is a bit of a crack fic.

I've always felt that Harry Potter could have been better served if there was some ancient family magic that died out in his family. Only to be revitalized by the inclusion of his mother's blood. Harry could go out on a quest trying to identify these ancient secrets with his friends and comrades in an effort to learn this magic to be able to beat Voldemort.

​

Another way I like to imagine the Wizarding World is to make it grander in scale. Basically, Earth is significantly more massive than Muggles think it is. Much of the world is hidden behind unplottable tracts of land known as the 'Wild Lands' or the 'Ancient Lands' In these lands lie the ruins of ancient magical civilizations, much of the wild magical creatures of the world lie within it.

The Ministries of Magic that exist throughout the world are the representative government for the "civilized" portions of magical peoples. However, those that live and wander through the wild lands are known as "Wanderers" or "Wildermen" if they're being nasty about it. Magical civilizations live outside the boundaries of the wild lands because magic is so much more raw in the wild lands. So things can happen outside of Wizard's control because the very land itself is magical.

In this kind of world, magic would be more epic in scale. Magic is sort of like a muscle but the truly powerful are capable of remarkable displays of magic, though the more connected to the 'Wilds' you are, the more primal the magic is, because as you channel magic in the wild lands, you are trying to push magic to manipulate something that already has a good chunk of magic in it.

I've imagined a fanfic (never written, I'm trash at writing and lack the patience to complete a fanfic to give the idea justice) where Harry, gets abandoned in the woods, nearby one of the access points to the wild lands. Harry gets picked up by a Wanderer who teaches Harry the basics of survival, along with essential skills so he can read/write and all of that. There is a bit of an interesting issue when he gets back to England in time to go to Hogwarts where Harry and his peers both think that the other is absolutely daft in regards to how they do magic. I feel it could lead to a lot of interesting interactions. One such example is that Harry would be absolute pants at fine control. He simply has too much raw magic to be able to manage the fine tuned control required for small tasks. However, in terms of battle, he's insanely strong as you WANT to throw out huge amounts of power, and he enjoys it too. School for him would be more about learning how to do the finite things, while his peers struggle to manage the power needed for things.

** I would probably mishmash a bunch of different magic world fictions together. So like stuff from TYPE-MOON, Ancient Magus Bride, Supernatural, The Magicians, Shadowrun, etc. So I like a bunch of stuff from TYPE-MOON but its generally far to grimdark far to much, so I would tone it down a bit in terms of amount. I would probably keep like 20% grimdarkness. Ancient Magus Bride has an incredible mystical/otherworldliness quality that I don't really see in much fiction. Magic ends up becoming pretty standard in a lot of fiction. The Magicians has an excellent whimsical quality to it while still being mature. Other fictions like Supernatural and a hidden magic version of Shadowrun are more flavor.

I would probably cut out a bunch of definitively high-magic aspects. Like with supernatural parts I would absolutely cut out stuff with Gods, angels, and demons or at least make it more vague so it doesn't literally have messengers of god but rather good natured spirit beings. I wouldn't want actual god to show up. Something more ambiguous.

** I think a nice little touch of magic is the idea that things don't have to be done because of logistics but because of comfort. Like a house that's completely round or a basement without supporting pillars. Windows in the kitchen that show the front yard or a beach in Tahiti despite the kitchen being in a basement.

The ability to house endless arrays of nonsense. Because every wizarding home would have a icecream maker and a a bread maker and all those other kitchens what's it's because the drawers are endless.

At the same time certain things should be made more structured off of dates of equinoxes and lay lines. Oh we can't make bread today the moons of Saturn are alight and all the flour will sprout.

Magic having seasons or times of day could be an interesting idea with little rituals or jigs one has to do.

Another thing is a change to how powerfully magical things act. What if everything with magic embed in it attained a very minimal level of animation and perception.

The invisibility cloak would be a trickster trying to help you in amusing pranks but might also have a mischievous streak where it waits to reveal you at the most inopportune time.

A near constant beauty and the beast thing.

Simply magic being a constant thing to navigate. A force in the world you would have to constantly be wary of.

A good example is the use of fae or spirits. Needing to treat the world with vigilance. Learn the rules and play fair while trying to get an edge. Like having to grab your toast while looking away from it because the toaster like it when you get surprised and will get moody and burn your toast if you haven't pretended you got spooked once in a while.

An ancient filing cabinet who was smitten with a girl named Sophie from accounting and so steals her files despite it being housed in another building.

A neat idea is that Hogwarts is safe not because of defenses or its teachers but the castles ability to soak in the rampant magic of generations of magical children without becoming too sentient especially in unfortunate ways.

** That's what Twilight did, and that's the reason I don't like it (yeah, that, not the sparkling vampires or whatever) - it doesn't provide an alternate /society/ I can escape to.

There's no reason you must have a normal boring life in the wizarding world as it exists in canon - in the same way you are not forced to do it in the real world :)
