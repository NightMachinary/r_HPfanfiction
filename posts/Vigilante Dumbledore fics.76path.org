  Elks

Now I've got the mental image in my head of Dumbledore killing elks as stress relief. Students are getting petrified, the board's about to oust him from Hogwarts, Hagrid's being looked at funny by the nervous Ministry, so Dumbledore takes a quick afternoon off to Canada and comes back with somewhat tattered robes, his wand in his hand, crooked glasses and a smile on his face. And then the Great Hall eats elk steaks that evening.

** Wait what? What did the elks do wrong?

In all seriousness I have read a fic like this, where Dumbledore just says ‘right, enough's enough' and starts killing Death Eaters. But I can't remember the name. I think it was a one shot, and I've posted here with a LF before to no avail.

I'm just commenting in the hope that someone will know of it.

May be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9079271/1/The-Last-Straw-Oneshot][/The Last Straw./]] Though the killing in it is more of the implied variety.

  A chance encounter leads Dumbledore to finally make the decision to confront his demons. Or more specifically the one demon who started it all - Gellert Grindelwald. No slash!

In [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa at least earned their redemptions. Dumbledore didn't kill them, but a tons of other Riddle minions. As someone requested, Riddle was indeed trying his best to kill Order members in this story. But Order's (and Hogwarts students') brutal effectiveness put him in severe personnel shortage and logistic bottlenecks.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
