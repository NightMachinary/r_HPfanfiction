I apologize for my ignorance but every now and then I see the trope brought up around here, yet I don't think I've ever read it. What exactly is gamer Harry? Does he play video games a lot? How would that be relevant to the plot?


** It's a cross over genre with the Korean webtoon The Gamer.

The main character goes thru the story much like an rpg with levels, stats, and quests with rewards and such. Usually the story turns into overpowered characters since they can "grind" levels and boost their powers.

#+begin_quote
  The Fates of the MCU have written for Harry Potter to die during a failed Obscurial Transformation. A drunken conversation between the heads of the Marvel verse has changed that and Harry has ended up with Gamer powers among other things. Watch Harry go through Hogwarts, Kamar-Taj, and Xavier's institute as he learns to use his powers and level up. Contains a Flerken. Harem by Arc3

*** I mean, it is an entire genre. There are a whole bunch of 'LitRPG' stories (I read one, and then Kindle recommended decided I wanted nothing else) that vary from 'only protag has RPG superpower' to 'set in an MMO' to 'Earth becomes an MMO overnight' (normally post-apocolyptic).

** His live becomes like a RPG he gets stats which he can increase quests to do and usually only he realises his life has become like a video game.

*** Thank you! Sounds like "I am Lord Voldemort?" in which the character constantly labels his magic by mana consumption and levels of power. Something like that, no?

**** Sort of, but in the Gamer world the main character can has access to a menu screen, character screen, inventory, skills, and can see character levels and hit points. So its more like an rpg or mmorpg superimposed over his life.

** Working in from the big picture. /Gamelit/ is a genre of spec fic in which RPG mechanics of some sort are an explicit part of world building. Gamelit is really common in East Asian fantasy.

/LitRPG/, which is sometimes misused as a synonym, is a subgenre of that in which someone is taken into an MMORPG. There's a lot of overlap and borderline cases between the two. The term LitRPG was coined by a Russian writer, and that's from my understanding the dominant subgenre of Russian fantasy over the last decade or so.

To use some examples with anime adaptations: /Konosuba/ and /Death March to a Parallel World Rhapsody/ are both Gamelit, but not LitRPG. /Sword Art Online/ and /Log Horizon/ are LitRPG. /How Not To Summon A Demon Lord/ leads to arguments on if it actually counts as LitRPG.

/The Gamer/ is a Korean Gamelit Webcomic. Some, but not all, Gamer!Harry fics are crossovers using the same system and style. Others just use it as a handy tag for Gamelit stories of another stripe, and may use original systems, tabletop rpgs, clones of other rpgs, dating sims etc as their enging.
