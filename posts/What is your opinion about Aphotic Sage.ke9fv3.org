It's Professor Dolohov/Hermione fic. Hermione is just barely legal age when they get together amidst chaos of war. Did y'all read it? If yes what y'all think about it?

I really liked it but generally I'm against such age gap even in fics.


** I didn't read that fic specifically, but I've read quite a few age gap fics.

I think, best case scenario, age gap fics can make good---even wonderful---stories. Especially in the context of there being a war going on, which has a tendency to make people hook up who otherwise wouldn't. After all, you're not necessarily looking for something long-lasting, 20 years down the line. You're looking for someone who treats you decently, who can warm your bed and make you feel alive /now/. There's not too many better aphrodisiacs than the thought that death could come tomorrow, or the day after. All you want is to take a tiny bit of happiness and pleasure while you can.

Then from there, I find it interesting if feelings do get involved. Sure, ordinarily these folks may have nothing in common, or at least not enough to build a relationship on---but when you have someone by your side, willing to fight with you, bleed with you, someone who will have your back and you have theirs through /everything/---that sort of thing can start to trump whatever decade you were born in.

And then afterwards---how do things hold up? Is the love and bond from the war enough to see a relationship through much more mundane times? Is it enough for a 40 year old to be patient with a 20 year old as they go through experiences the 40 year old is long past? Can the 20 year old get over the fact that a lot of the things they're seeing and experiencing for the first time---the 40 year old has been there and done that? Will the bond these people have already formed by enough to see them through these very real difficulties that tank most of these age disparity relationships?

So, done that way, can age difference romantic relationships in Harry Potter be some of the best, most well-written, most realistic romance stories out there?

Yes, absolutely.

On the other hand, are 99% of age difference romances written by 20 year olds who have no real concept of the tremendous difference in life experience between a 20 year old and 40 year old, and therefore don't engage with it at all in any sort of meaningful way besides the main characters spouting, “Age is just a number! Why is everyone so against our love???”

Yes, absolutely.

*** It is a well written story and buildup is nice. It isn't rushed or love at first sight thing. It starts with them being intrigued about each other in a casual way. It takes years for them to get together/express their love. Dolohov liking a 12 year old was kinda problematic to me but he was very ashamed and kept it to himself.

**** Oh crap, it starts at */12/*??

I'm not sure exactly where the line is, but crushing on pre-pubescent girls is /definitely/ on the wrong side of that. I was thinking maybe Hermione was 16 or 17 at the least.

***** She's 14-15 when they first kiss (he was drunk and terrified bcoz of voldys return) but he's like it's not good and tells her they shouldn't do it again. Nd she ages to 17 in 5th Year in this fic because of time Turner. The relationship starts at 18-19 if I recall correctly.
