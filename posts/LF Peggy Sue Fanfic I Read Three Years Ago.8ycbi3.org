So I've recently been re-reading NoFP and my mind has been exploding with blurry references to other time travel fictions I know I read back in Summer 2015.

I spent all of last night scouring and searching but I couldn't find anything, so this is where I ended up I guess.

The story in question has the usual Harry goes back in time, but the pairing changes. Harry, instead of falling for Ginny, finds himself liking Luna (which is really the main reason why I want to re-read this), and also has the ability to do wandless magic I'm pretty sure. It was one of the fics I couldn't help but like and compare to Nightmares of Future Past, and if I could remember even vague details of it this far back, it must be good.

When I read it, it wasn't complete.

I'm not quite sure about this either, but it might have something to do with the Department of Mysteries as well.

If anyone can even direct me where to start looking, that would be fantastic.


** Here's a fic where harry goes back in time with the Harry/Luna pairing although it was written more recently: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12868582/1/Easier-than-Falling-Asleep]]

** Are you completely positive that he goes back in time? Or could it be one where he just manipulates time a bit?

*** No, I'm positive he goes back in time because I remember he muses how he was now with Luna when he was once with Ginny

** Fuck it's on the tip of my tongue, if I'm not wrong it also features him in an argument between him and his parents + albus and it comes up how they basically used snape to fullfill their goals.

** Story: The Very Best [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12026631/1/The-Very-Best]]

Not what you are looking for, but it is harry/luna, wandless magic and time travel. It is one of my favorites light-hearted fics.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.
