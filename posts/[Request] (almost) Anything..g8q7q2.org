Hey everyone!

I've found myself(along with most) to have far too much free time recently and therefore was looking for recommendations for fics to read. I'm open to most things, with the only 100% no being Harry/Hermione, Harry/Ginny and Harry/Draco.

I'm a big fan of Harry-centric stories, ranging from completely new stuff like Emperor, to remakes of canon (The R-series, or 'They Shook Hands' for example); I also enjoy political fics and Slytherin!Harry/Cunning!Harry, but as I said, I'm open to almost anything, from super-mega-OP Harry to a muggle military Harry that never knew magic, or the daily goings of Random Ravenclaw #34. The main thing is that it's wellwritten.

Thanks in advance!


** I think there's a good chance you've already read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] (best Slytherin!Harry I've ever read by some distance), but I have to recommend it just in case.

linkffn(4745329)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] is also a favourite of mine.

linkffn(4912291)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] also has a pretty politically savvy Harry.

I was going to recommend Blindness but then I remembered it has Harry/Hermione.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

** If you're open to marvel crossovers, the two best I've come across that aren't finished or abandoned are Child of the Storm by Nimbus Llewellyn and Vimesenthusiast's A Third Path To The Future.

Child of the storm has James Potter being Thor as a mortal, with Odin having pulled the whole strip his son of his power and send him to earth to grow the hell up before. Only with him being forced to remove Thor's memories of his life as James after he dies and returns to Asgard to prevent Thor from destroying the earth in his rage. Loki restores his memories when he senses his nephew crying out for help while being attacked by dementors during book 3.

Also features Jean Grey as Harry's cousin, Wanda Maximoff as both his godmother and the former apprentice of Dr. Strange, a bad ass, more or less immortal, time traveling dr. Strange who more or less fits the trope of a Magnificent Bastard.

Oh, and also a crossover with the Dresden Files, the namesake of which begins dating Wanda and becomes her apprentice, as well as some elements of the DC comics. Dresden being a mentor to a teenaged Bruce Wayne, for example, as well as harry's 'cousin' on his dad's side, Diana. And mentions of John Constantine being a ruthless bastard.

Third Path has a post war harry walking through the veil and winding up in the negative zone. With a half insane harry rescuing a baby Franklin Richards from a kidnapping attempt by Annihlus sometime later, leading to him befriending the fantastic four and eventually the x-men

Also, Tsu Do Nim's star wars crossovers are pretty amusing. They feature a rather jaded harry potter running into a young anakin Skywalker and taking him under his wing. Also, a well written HK-47. Not nearly enough of that going around.

** Here are two I've read recently that I think everyone should read:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][“A Very Secret Diary”]] - one of the best fanfics I've ever read, really quite haunting as it goes along. Chamber of Secrets but told through Ginny's writings in her diary. Some mentions of Ginny having a crush on Harry, but it's not particularly important part of the plot and should absolutely not dissuade you from reading it. Genuinely terrifying, especially towards the end.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][“The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks”]] - Another haunting one. Harry remembers a small girl at his sorting called Sally-Anne Perks, but he seems to be the only one who remembers her. He and Hermione (not HHr, don't worry) investigate, and eventually discover a chilling but also heartwarming truth about love and loss in equal measure. Set during third year, a brilliant mystery.
