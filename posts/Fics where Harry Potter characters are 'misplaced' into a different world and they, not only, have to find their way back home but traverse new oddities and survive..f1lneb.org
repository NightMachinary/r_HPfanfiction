** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire]]: After TWT1, a damaged portkey transports many students from multiple schools to an island.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10061782/1/][In Atlantean Caves]]: Ministry 6 take a wrong turn in the Department of Mysteries. Weird little unfinished story that didn't quite go anywhere but still holds a place in my heart.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/][Shadow of Angmar]]: Harry in Middle Earth, but a 1000 years before The Hobbit/LotR.
