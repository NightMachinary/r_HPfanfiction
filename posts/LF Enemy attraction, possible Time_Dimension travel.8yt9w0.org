Harry (or some other character) has to team-up with a female enemy to defeat an Enemy that threats them both. I would like it to be Epilogue compliant, so Harry is as old as he is in said passage or further than the epilogue. So yes, i would like to have some sort of "infidelity" fic. Both of them find the other attractive over time, despite they are actually enemies. They might have Sex with each other. Whether it is to blow off some steam or because they really love each other doesnt matter, also if it is a detailed scene or if its skipped and the happening is refered, but i would like the first one.

Time/dimension travel fics without knowing if he can travel back are also fine.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  In the aftermath of the Final battle a misplaced spell sends HP and Bellatrix to an alternative world. It holds everything each of them have lost to the war and yet they find themselves inexorably drawn back to each other. HPBella done right.
