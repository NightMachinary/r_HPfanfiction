What if, instead of Harry surviving the killing curse be user of done love bs, he survives because he literally nullifies magic cast at him. If any magic comes with 1 cm of any part of him it just cancels. Poof gone. No spells work on him, no hexes or jinxs, no potions, no magical creature affects him. This of course means he can't actually cast magic himself, making him excellent at classes such as astronomy and potions but failing miserably in transfiguration and charms. He still attends hogearts, gets his wand and everything.


** Not with Harry, but something similar happens in linkffn(12738075).

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

** It's not quite an anti-magic field, but Harry is essentially immune to hostile spellfire (and most other hostile things) in Enter the Dragon.

Despite Harry's ridiculous OP-ness, it's actually a thought-provoking read. His powers are frequently played for laughs, and they /don't/ allow him to curbstomp all the world's problems, not when those problems are things like international human trafficking powered by extensive mind magic compulsions, ancient sites of sufficient stored power to crack the Earth's crust located in the territory of nations with almost no formal diplomacy nor open borders, and the prospect of Harry someday becoming ridiculously, magically, "potent" and potentially impregnating every female within several miles the first time he has a wet dream.

** Something like this happens in the Veronica Weasley series by Hyaroo on ffnet, although I can't spoil the details.
