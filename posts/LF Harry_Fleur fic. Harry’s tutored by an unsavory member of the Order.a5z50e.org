** I'm not entirely sure since it's been a while since I read it, but Harry/Fleur having an affair happens in linkffn(The Half-Blood Romantic). I can't recall a confrontation in Diagon Alley, but it's the only thing that comes to mind.

*** Afaik, he's also not tutored by an unsavory dude, just Dumbledore and Fleur herself right ? Isn't it linkffn(A Beautiful Lie) ? Though that too doesn't have an unsavory dude, iirc.

#+begin_quote
  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.
