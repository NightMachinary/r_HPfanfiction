My contribution(s): “The Other Champion” and “The Champion's Legacy” by Srikanth1808

This series is very interesting to me for a couple reasons and is actually a bit of a conundrum for me. It's an alternate fourth year, with strong OC characterizations, but it also is very Canon “rehashy” which I typically don't enjoy. That being said, the author did a magnificent job with their OCs. Cassius Warrington, The Slytherin Champion who is central to the story and replaces Cedric Diggory as the Hogwarts Champion, is especially well done. Furthermore, this fic has one of the most well thought out and executed Daphne Greengrass characterizations - this also bleeds into the romance she eventually has with Harry which is also well done. The author goes out of their way to explain canon situations from the OCs point of view to try and prevent things from being too familiar, although sometimes it still comes off as canon rehash.

What really was the cherry on top however, was Ron. Ron never gets enough credit in Harry Potter fandom, he's a magnificent character and Goblet of Fire almost made him seem like a parody of himself. This fic fixes that. Ron is incredibly well written, and really develops as a character. This is especially evident in the final chapter of the first installment, “The Other Champion.”

Here is a link to the author's page where you can fine the aforementioned stories:

*** OMG this is my biggest problem. That story isn't mine, up there, but I swear one of my first jobs after I write a chunk of any story is to go through and examine every M-dash and see if I can re-write the surrounding sentence so I can take it back out. I dish them out like rewards, lol!

**** I used to have this problem so bad, and I've been actively working on it but I probably still use a few too many, mainly in dialogue. Re-reading after the chapter is completed is definitely more helpful to me personally than to try and re-format on the fly when writing

** linkffn(7525570)

/Here And There/ by /Jackdawess/ is a fairly cute Ginny/Hermione fanfic set mostly in the mid-1940s during the Second World War.

--------------

linkffn(1724293)

/The Family Clock/ by /Jan. McNeville/ is an *incomplete* canon-flavoured fanfic about an OC clockmaker in Diagon Alley who is well characterised and likeable.

--------------

linkffn(11922890)

/Harry and Hermione Starring in: The Digital Revolution/ By /Forthwith16/ features nerdy!Hermione's quest to build a magical computer. It uses a lot of actual CS theory and is quite interesting if you're into that sort of thing, although it hasn't really got going yet. It also contains H/Hr.

--------------

linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds by Seselt)

/Six Pomegranate Seeds/ By /Seselt/ features Timetravelling Hermione, a sentient Hogwarts and interesting Slytherin/Death eaters who still manage to be evil. It's currently canon-compatible up to book 7.

--------------

linkffn(7937889)

/A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles/ By /Rannaro/ is a canon-compatible biography of Severus Snape from his birth to his death. It's really quite depressing, and also manages to feature the death eaters in a way I quite like without either portraying them in a positive light or making them cartoonishly evil.

  Being petrified and having one's absurdly lucky best friend kill a big snake really gets a girl thinking. Where could they go from there? A midnight conversation leads to a promise to do better, regardless of breaking one, two, or a dozen laws along the way. With a definitely safe wand, allies expecting her to be the next dark lady, and a free summer, what is a girl to do?

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
