Hello!

I would like to know if there are any fics where Harry uses Parseltongue. I would like if he has a snake or basilisk as a familiar or something like that. And not just as a pet, uses it. So, no Harry paragon of the Light and good please.

Fics where Harry uses Parseltongue that I know are, Heir of the Blacks, Thanks to a Snake.

Thanks!

he makes use of parseltongue and basilisks in this one and it's good for a few laughs as well.

Not only Harry, but multiple OCs using parselmagic in this one. It has: * parseltongue conclave * Adder stones * Multiple snake familiars/pets (with amusingly distinct personalities) * Personal parseltongue dialect * Snake animagus forms

However, as the title indicates, the focus of the story is the relationship, so it's not to everyone's taste. The author freely admits Harry is a little Harry-Stu-ish, since she wrote it in her early twenties before editing and posting significantly later. But it's very well-written. And epic-length.

**** Oh, and to expand on one of your points, he uses his snakes as spies. And later, a different one to cast a ward in a ritual.

Harry is put in Slytherin and makes extensive use of his Parseltongue abilities. He doesn't really keep a familiar, but he regularly chats with specific snakes in Hogwarts

The Parseltongue really picks up around Christmas

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
