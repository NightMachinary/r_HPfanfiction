** Trevor seeing such a juicy meal couldn't resist and ate it whole.

After a second you could think that Trevor transformed into an ugly woman which now stood in its place but no. Trevor just unknowingly ate more than he could chew.

***** Yikes this is my new favourite prompt. A crackfic of Umbridge living lowkey with the Longbottoms as a spy and having a habit of disappearing to live her double life which of course Augusta blames on Neville for being forgetful & careless.

*** I don't thinks so. If that were the case, Marauders becoming animagi would be pointless. And also Peter must have got hurt at least once during the twelve years he hid in his animagus form.

** Trevor eyed the strange beetle. His instincts were telling him not to eat, but he was hungry enough that he didn't care. He stretched his tongue out and swallowed the juicy beetle whole. His hunger saturated, he hopped over to his sleeping master.

Rita was panicking. In all of her snooping, she had never seen a toad around the Gryffindor boys. She tried to run away, but was quickly stuck to the toad's tongue. Rita tried to transform, but in the process, Trevor was taking a bite of the beetle.

Neville woke up, and screamed when he saw the half-eaten body of Rita Skeeter next to the bloody toad that was split into pieces.

** This is absolutely not how I expected to spend my afternoon. Definitely a good excuse to break in my new keyboard, though!

A fire crackled in the grate. It was a good thing, thought Rita. She'd never seen such a quiet bunch of schoolchildren! Without that fire, they'd surely have been able to hear her. It did, however, mean she'd have to get much closer to her prey.

Glancing around to ensure she wouldn't be seen, she took her shot. Luckily no one heard the skittering of her spindly legs across the stone floor. From the relative cover of the potted plant next to the fireplace she could hear a quiet murmur from the Golden Trio, who sat on the rug with their heads bent close, all reading intently from the same book. Rita crept to the edge of the pot, straining to hear, or to see what might be on the page.

Suddenly, she was startled by a wet slap on the soil right next to her, she flew up, careful to keep covered, and saw a fat toad sitting in the pot. How had she missed that! The toad seemed confused, if such a thing had any thoughts at all. Just then, the Granger girl announced "I found it!" before being shushed by her friends. In her haste to hear just what the little overachiever had found, she forgot about the toad, which struck out again, and this time, his aim seemed to be improving.

Rita darted around the plant, trying to find another safe spot away from that wretched beast. Spotting a closed door on the other side of the fireplace, she took a chance and flew up and over and slid under the door. It was small and dark, but in her current form, that suited Rita just fine. From her new vantage, she was too far to hear, but she did have a much better view of the book. She inched closer, cursing her insect eyes for making it so difficult to read, when her view was suddenly obstructed by that damned toad.

Rita skittered backward, sure that the gap was too small for him, but to her annoyance he was able to easily pass under. He hopped lazily, like he didn't know she was there She flew quietly to the other side of the door, knowing that she was about to miss her chance at a scoop. When she saw that she'd gotten there just in time to see the redhead and the Granger girl canoodling on the sofa while Potter was nowhere to be found. She chittered angrily and started looking for a chance to fly out the window unseen, but before she succeeded that beast struck again! This time he caught her right in the mandibles. Had she been a mundane beetle, that would likely have been the end of it, but Rita was able to fly up, dislodging the sticky, wet appendage. She was safe, but the beast had left an awful taste in her mouth that she desperately hoped didn't survive her transformation. She landed halfway up the wall, and looked back at the toad.

He was still sitting in the same spot, with his tongue lolling stupidly out of his mouth. Her antenna twitched rapidly, and she felt the unmistakable tingle of powerful magic in the air. The toad began to stretch and change until before her sat the form of a young man. He couldn't have been a day over 15. As she looked closer, she noticed a distinctive nose and a near unmistakable jawline. He opened his mouth and shouted, his voice weak and croaking, but his cries for help were quickly answered. The door swung open and a dozen curious faces peered inside. All eyes were on the boy, so Rita slipped easily overhead and back out the window into the darkness.

/"And the identity of that young boy? Patience, dear readers./

/Many of you surely remember Algie and Enid Longbottom. After the horrific events of the war, and the tragic, heartbreaking tale of the heroism of his nephew Frank and Alice Longbottom, Algie played an important role in their young son's life./

/In addition to being famously childless, Algie was known to hold unusually uncharitable opinions about squibs. According to my sources, he was never shy about professing such things publicly, but never so bad that anyone raised concerns./

/Don't worry, lovelies, I haven't forgotten about the boy./

/Upon being found in the closet, the boy was whisked straight to St Mungo's, where he was found to be a halfblood squib in good health./

/It also found that he's the grandson of none other than Algie and Enid Longbottom./

/Dear readers, I was as shocked as you./

/It seems that the pair was not as childless as they led us to believe. They had one daughter, a squib. She'd been dropped in a muggle orphanage at a young age. She grew up, got married, and had a son of her own before suffering a terrible car accident which killed both her and her muggle husband./

/According to sources close to the family, Enid had kept tabs on her daughter, and when she got word of the accident, she brought the news to her husband. The fact that the boy survived gave Algie hope that the child was magical, and collected him from his muggle grandparent's house with the help of a few memory charms./

/He remembers quite clearly being only 7 years old when Algie, after weeks of increasingly distressing tests to try to tease the magic out of the child, turned him into a toad. He admits that his memory is quite fuzzy after that, but the healers expect that he'll make a full recovery."/
