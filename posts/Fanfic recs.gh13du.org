HELP!!!!! Desperate need of marauders fanfic w/ wolfstar and jily. Was just reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1110486/chapters/57853384#workskin]] but that is 124 chapters and is yet to be updated on the next chapter so I need something to read while I wait for updates. It's a bloody brilliant book and has kept me captivated and driven me to the brink of insanity when I realised I had to wait for a new update /sigh/ please help a sad desperate soul out.
