** *Inverted*, linkffn(4849382), is completed. It features Dumbledore as the dark lord with very evil Weasleys and an insane Hermione, and Tom Riddle as the headmaster of Hogwarts trying to fight them off.

*Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925), has a well manicured and nice Snape with Sirius as his best buddy. Draco was also a cute nice kid.
