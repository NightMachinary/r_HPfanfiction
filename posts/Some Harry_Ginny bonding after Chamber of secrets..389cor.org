Seriously, if we're going for the canon ship, I feel like this is a more logical place for it to start. They've both just been to hell and back, after all.


** I've always thought it sad and surprising that he saves Hermione from a troll and they become best friends, but he saves Ginny from Voldy and they don't really talk again for 3 years. JKR kind of dropped the ball on that one. She could have done much more to develop Ginny.

*** I always find this is especially obvious in OotP, where Ginny calls Harry out on not talking to her:

#+begin_quote
  “Well, that was a bit stupid of you,” said Ginny angrily, “seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.”

Harry's response, as far as I'm concerned, covers not just his character, but the author and most of the readers, too: "I forgot."

*** You're using the wrong sort of logic. The actual reason is quite simple. The plot needed Hermione, therefore she and Harry became friends after the troll attack. The plot didn't need Ginny until year 5, so we barely see her till Ootp.

***** From Harry's perspective, Hermione was a pretty big asshole before the troll incident, yet they still became friends.

It's just weird to me on a meta level. Rowling said there are some experiences you can't go through together without becoming friends, yet spending a frightening night in the middle of the woods and encountering some crazed unicorn killer isn't one of them, while knocking out a troll in the bathroom is. They're only a few chapters apart. It was a weird writing choice.

****** The difference is that Harry/Ron/Hermione came away from that interaction after having acted as a team. When you look at the way that scene played out, it's very clear that Ron/Harry's first priority was Hermione and their second priority was the troll. After the troll was knocked out, Hermione lied to take some of the blame from Harry/Ron. Basically she made their problem her problem, just as they had done for her by going after the troll in the first place. So Harry/Ron/Hermione were a team, bound by a common adventure/experience.

Whereas with Draco, they were split up into two groups (it started out as draco/neville/fang and hagrid/harry/hermione), Draco actively made the task harder by teasing Neville, and Draco turned tail and ran (leaving Harry behind) when push came to shove. So they didn't go through the experience "together."

****** Hermione wasn't /trying/ to be an asshole though. Remember Harry's experiences with Dudley and his friends? And besides, Harry and Ron confronted the troll in order to help Hermione. In the forest, Malfoy just ran off, leaving Harry to fend for himself.

*** My thought is that Ginny basically had no friends first year because the diary made her drive everyone away. So second year she comes in as basically a new person, but everyone already has notions about her. Her only friend is the nutter in Ravenclaw who knew her before, and her brothers. That is why we see Ginny develop through her chasing of boys. Intended or not I think it is actually good character development in a lot of ways. I've known a lot of girls that enter that stage in their life without strong friendships and they always look for friends with their hormones.

** Things like this are why HP Fanfiction is the largest collection on the internet. Amazing characters and settings and brilliant history.... giant gaping plotholes and main characters with way too little facetime.

Also because JKR sucks at romance.

But we all love her for it, without the original we'd have no sandbox to play in.

** I've always seen Ginny as 'invisible.' It's strange that most of her mentions in the final book (120) occur as a result of Harry pining after her and that cringe-inducing epilogue. Her only character growth occurs in the area of Harry: first she's too bashful to speak around him, then she gains the magical power of speech.

She also fails miserably at a [[http://www.springhole.net/writing/marysue.htm][Mary Sue test]] with a staggering 113 points (>50 is the highest category).

Edit: I fail at taking simple internet tests as I did not see that one of the sections was labeled fanfiction. The other scores posted for her are more likely to be accurate, although since JKR has defended Ginny several times as Harry's 'soul mate' I think that provides an insight as to the author's unhealthy views on the character.

I took the test again and selected 1d, 4a/b/c, 5a, 7, 9, 15, 25a/d/e, 27a/c, 28, 29a/b/c, 31, 32, 34, 40 (one box), 44, 46a/b/c...

This got me to 51 points so I stopped.

She has five big things working against her:

- her enemies comment on her good looks despite her being a blood traitor

- she gets away with insulting her future sister-in-law without repercussion

- never suffers any fallout/is rewarded for hexing others

- saved from Carrows' Cruciatus by Snape for her part in the insurgency

- extremely proficient at Quidditch and several charms (Patronus at 14, etc)

*** I can agree with your first point (I wished she would have played a bigger role in the last book), but not the Mary Sue test. What did you do, base it on a really bad fanfiction?

EDIT: I just went through it, and if I was ever hesitant about an item, I gave it to her. If you were curious, I only filled out parts 1, 2, and 5. It was actually pretty hard, and I don't know if I trust it, because A) I didn't write the books, B) it's from Harry's POV, and C) she's a minor character! My score was 57, which is still pretty high on the test...but 50 points lower than your score. You definitely read some bad fanfiction. I might do Harry and Hermione in a second, I'm curious.

Some things I think you forgot: 1) Harry did not like her Valentines. 2) In "Order of the Phoenix" she stomped her feet and stormed all the way up the stairs after being told she couldn't go to the Order meeting. 3) Same book, she got thrown out of the library after bringing Harry chocolate. 4) In "Half-Blood Prince", Harry was a little shocked by her imitation of Fleur, and he did not think it was warranted although he found it funny. To which she replied something to the extent of, "do you like the way she says 'arry?". 5) Same book, there was that absolutely nasty fight with her brother, and although Harry was having a bit of a personal crisis there, both Ginny and Ron threw some pretty harsh words at each other.

Also, I didn't really count any of the romance sections because their relationship lasted less than a month, and had about two pages of screen time.

*** Most of the options you marked are either ambiguous or just plain wrong.

Ginny isn't a prodigy in Quidditch. For one, she made the team only in her fourth year. Plus, both Harry and Angelina noticed that she wasn't as good a flier as Harry in book 5, and it cost them the match against Hufflepuff. She is good at Quidditch, yes, but not unusually accomplished, and certainly not prodigious like Harry.

I would also hesitate to count Quidditch as 'extremely desirable and/or useful' in the HP universe. Magical ability trumps everything else in the HP world. Oh, and Ginny never produced a corporeal patronus in the books, let alone at fourteen.

Fleur is hardly an innocent victim in the her feud with Ginny/Molly/Hermione. There's a reason why so many generally sympathetic characters dislike her. Plus, Ron tells her to stop it, and Molly reprimands her when she calls Fleur "Phegm".

I fail to see how 29 a/b/c are at all applicable in the Sword of Gryffindor scenario, seeing that the stealing thing is clearly meant as an amoral act in the poll, which the heist was anything but. Also, Snape had no reason to punish her, seeing that they were on the same side.

25 isn't applicable either. Ginny didn't have any outspoken political/social beliefs in canon. Somehow, I don't think "non-rascist" counts as a belief (like, say, liberation of house elves is a belief), and it isn't as if she was shown to care for it much either.

15 isn't applicable, given that magic exists.

A pygmy puff doesn't count as an extaordinary pet. /It's a fucking Pygmy Puff/. They're for sale in the market. Not remotely useful/extraordinary/exotic/whatever.

**** Agree to disagree.

Ginny plays for the Harpies. Seems like exceptional talent to me. Everything else is solely your opinion.

The problem with Fleur isn't that she's unlikeable. It's that Ginny chose to act out instead of confronting her sister-in-law about any perceived character flaws. Neither Molly nor Ron's reprimands were sufficient. Ginny called Fleur 'a cow' and accused her of only interesting Bill because she was 'glamorous.' An awful attitude that receives no substantial punishment.

29 is in reference to her Bat Bogey Hex. Quick, quote me a passage that deals with her being punished for using it on George. Or one that shows her brother being anything other than awed or cowed by her use of that oft-mentioned ability.

25 stands in my mind. You're certainly free to disagree.

For 15, explain Moody's scars, Fred's ear, Bill's face, or Charlie's burns. Are they just too stubborn to seek treatment?

After 1996, I'd agree with you that Pygmy Puffs aren't special. There is every indication in HBP, though, that the miniature Puffskeins are unique.

*** That test is retarded. Many of the questions are ambiguous enough that the answer depends purely upon personal opinion/interpretation.

In any case, a Mary Sue is a character the plot bends over backwards for. Ginny has very little to do with the actual plot of the series, and as such shouldn't even qualify for the title.
