I want Harry to rescue Snape from Death Eaters, captivity or something dangerous like that.

I don't think saving from dying in Shrieking Shack counts (unless Harry literally protects Snape from snake). I've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2559745][Learning to breathe]]. It is mentioned in the beginning that Harry rescued Snape:

#+begin_quote
  Their double agent, Severus Snape, had proven 100 reliable in the War. It was too bad the Death Eaters caught on. Harry took on the rescue mission himself, sneaking into the Parkinson's Manor and dragging the spy out. He'd earned the Order of Merlin, First Class for that. Not that the medal was important. Mr. Snape's work as a double agent saved countless innocent lives and led to the death or capture of well over 60 of Voldemort's Death Eaters. Saving Severus Snape from a life destined for endless torture and a brutal murder was the least that Harry could do.

Though I'd like to read something more detailed.
