Harry really is immortal because he becomes master of death or the prophecy or both. The story would focus on the struggles of what that means and the pain Harry faces watching everybody around him grow old and die. Likely to be a short story and in the end Harry searches the world for a way to die but he fails. He sits at the trunk of a tree at the top of a mountain and watches over the world as it grows around him and encases him in its trunk.
