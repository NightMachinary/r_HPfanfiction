Katie "Katheryn" Bell is a normal, half-blood witch.

She's popular, kind-hearted, sweet, and one hell of a chaser.

She, alongside her family, are also members of a cult of some Eldritch horror that wouldn't be out of place from Brutal Legend (Ormagoden?) mixed with Lovecraft, and have been for generations.

At home, she swaps those stuffy, old-fashioned wizarding robes for blood-splattered jeans and t-shirts and her wand for a sacrificial dagger. Poor goats and not-so poor abducted criminals.

But except for those, ah, minor foibles, she's just an every day, normal girl that keeps her home-life and school-life completely separate, and her tendencies neatly compartmentalized.

That is until Harry is somehow drawn into the Cult's ranks by sheer chance, and they meet outside school at a gathering.

At Hogwarts the next year, people are confused why they're spending so much time together and are being so secretive.

Some presume they're dating: others believe she's just tutoring him and taking him under her wing like a Big Sister.

Harry's confused why Hermione, Alicia, and Angelina give them "knowing" looks and giggles, and why Ron just looks awkward being around him as he talks about her.

In truth, it's a little of both as they're both bonding over their membership and her being supportive.

The only person who sees the truth is someone no-one listens to or expects: "The Boy-Who-Lived, a murderous cultist? Absurd! Katie Bell, a killer? A sweet, popular witch like her? Utter hippogryph dung!"

Hell, even "Loony" Lovegood thinks they're nuts!

Maybe it's Cho or Marietta, or Pansy or one of the lesser-used characters like the Carrow Twins.

Unfortunately, their attempts of exposing Harry and Katie are comical misadventures at best, and constantly gives people the wrong idea (e.g. they're jealous, obsessed, work for the Death Eaters, et cetera), and this causes ripples.

Harry and Katie, in the meanwhile, are too caught up in their little dynamic to notice: aside from the usual teen drama of growing feelings for each other, they're also doing rituals and other Cult stuff that are completely adorifying.

So, yeah. Wholesome cultists? I guess?

...Yeah, no idea where this came from. But, it's unusual so I thought "Eh, maybe someone will find the idea entertaining/unusual".


** Eh, what the heck? I need a break from my Kingdom Hearts long-fic. It's a bit different than what you might have had in mind, though.

--------------

"And as the moon rises high, and the night is long, so we shall see the glory of our--"

Katheryn "Katie" Bell paused in the middle of her recitation of the vows. The defensive charms along the perimeter of their safe house had been breached. Not for the first time, Katie wondered at the practicality of having their safe house in the middle of Little Whinging, but that was a conversation she knew better to bring up. The last time she had questioned the decisions of the superior, they had taken away her mouth for two nights.

Katie crept quietly from the basement, to the front door. It was late in the evening, but the late summer sky still gave plenty of light to see by. The intruder could not be far.

Given that it was the summer holidays, she was forbidden from using her wand magic. She'd have to rely on more mundane tactics. Katie slipped out of the safe house soundlessly. Or as soundlessly as she could--the drought had made the dead grass very crackly, even under the soles of her bare feet.

The stranger was a boy, not quite a man but still older than a mere child. Katie crept closer--the stranger did not seem to notice. That would make things easier--Katie was not what one would call "strong," at least in the context of Muggle dueling. But if she struck fast, that would not be an issue.

Another step, one bare foot in front of another. The strange boy paused and Katie froze, willing with all her might that the boy not notice her presence.

She had worried not. The boy continued on, aimlessly. There was great tension in his shoulders. She crept closer and closer. Only three feet away now. That was close enough.

Katie knew better than to shout when she attacked someone--that was a classic mistake that compromised more than one promising initiate. She did not intend to kill this boy, merely figure out how he had managed to cross the barricade. Capture, but not klil.

She struck.

Luck was not on her side however. Katie was skilled, but the strange adolescent boy reacted with lightning fast reflexes. She attempted to punch between his shoulders, but he side-stepped her and grabbed her arm, twisting it back. He was taller than her, and Katie found herself standing uncomfortably on the tips of her bare toes.

Yow! That was her Quaffle arm he was yanking!

"What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?"

"You're trespassing on the property of the Guild!" Katie declared. "Unhand me at once, and you'll escape with your life, boy!"

"What the hell is the Guild?"

"That is nothing of your concern, trespasser!" Katie squirmed helplessly but the strange boy pushed her to the ground.

"Who's trespassing? I live here!"

See! This is exactly the sort of thing Katie had tried to warn her superiors about! But no--the rituals had to take place in the most boring town in all of Britain!

Katie bucked her head backwards, grinning in satisfaction when she heard the /crack/ of the boy's nose breaking.

"Dammit! My glasses! My nose!"

The boy said several other words, but they were far too inappropriate to be spoken on hallowed ground. Katie rolled onto her back, only for the boy to pin her arms down.

"By the fire of the comet, by the shine of the stars--" Katie began, glaring at the boy's green eyes.

Wait a moment, green eyes?

"Harry?!"

"Katie?!"

Oh, bollocks.

*** Part 2

--------------

Katie was more than a little frantic as she dragged Harry back inside the safe house and down the hall to the room she had been studying her vows in. She closed the door behind her and let go a breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding.

"Katie, what in the blazes are you doing here?"

"Harry, please," Katie bit her lip. "This is kind of a big thing, but you can't tell anyone. This is even bigger than Voldemort!"

"You said his name?" Harry blinked in surprise. "I don't think I've ever heard you say his name."

"When have we ever talked about anything other than Quidditch?" Katie asked.

"Fair point...but I didn't know you lived in Little Whinging!" Harry sounded excited. "It's brilliant, really, having someone from the team here. I've gotten awfully bored, not knowing anything that's been going on."

"Oh, Harry," Katie shook her head. Friendship had to take a back seat for the Guild. Once you knew about it, you either had to join the Guild or take an Unbreakable Vow never to speak of the Guild--most opted for the latter, once the Guild had started using Memory Charms.

"Mind telling me what's going on?" Harry asked. "What's with the green cloak, it's summer. You must be roasting. And who else lives here? And why did you attack me? Oh, I'm sorry if I hurt your arm--that's your Quaffle arm! Oh, and can you get your mum to fix my glasses?"

By the Good of the Guild, Katie had forgotten that Harry never shut up once he started asking questions.

"Harry!"

"And do you have your hair done up like that? And why aren't you wearing shoes?"

"Quiet!" Katie covered Harry's mouth with her hand. "Harry, if you're discovered, then I'm going to be in so much trouble!"

"Like how?" Harry asked, this time much more quietly. "If you're in danger, then we should both get out of here."

"I can't abandon the Guild!" Katie protested.

"What would they do to you?"

Now there was a good question--there were various punishments for various infractions, and they tended to be thematically similar.

For speaking out of turn and questioning her superiors, Katie's mouth had been charmed off for two days.

For an infraction like this, letting a stranger into the chambers, Katie would most likely be subjected to interrogation to determine how much information she had allowed to be compromised.

Katie felt her knees knock together. Being at the mercy of Interrogators was one of the worst fates she could think of.

"Harry, we need to get you out of here. Do you have your Invisibility Cloak?"

"You know about the Cloak?" Harry blinked in surprise. Or maybe because without his glasses he was blind as a bat.

"Well, how else would you be able to sneak out all the time?" Katie groaned.

"I don't have it with me," Harry said. "But Katie, I can't leave you to get hurt."

"You always did have a Saving People Thing, didn't you?" Katie couldn't keep the fondness from her voice. "Okay...I have another idea."

She darted to the wardrobe and produced her old cloak, Apprentice Brown.

"It's gonna be a little small on you, but I think we can make this work!"

"Make what work?" Harry asked, though he put the cloak over his t-shirt and jeans without complaint.

"Trust me," Katie whispered. "They'll be calling me in soon. Don't make a sound. You'll be my Initiate."

**** Part 3

--------------

Getting Harry to wear her old Apprentice Robe had been easy. Getting him to take his shoes off was hard. Katie hadn't expected that.

"None of the Guild wears shoes during rituals!" Katie hissed. "Bare feet allow us to contact further with the Old Ones."

"The /what/?!"

"Just shut up and do what I say!" Katie begged. "Pretend I'm Hermione! She bosses you around!"

"You're bossier than Hermione!"

"We both know that's not humanly possible!"

"Alright, alright fine!" Harry toed off his old trainers and stepped awkwardly. "I still expect a full explanation!"

"I'll let you ask me as many questions as you like, about whatever you want, even questions that have nothing to do with the Guild if you just be quiet for a little while!"

It wasn't a perfect disguise by any means. Harry's borrowed robe just went past his knees, while Katie's robe, properly fitted for her, reached her ankles. And of course there was the scar to worry about, but the robe's hood covered that up well enough.

Katie linked her arm with Harry and she marched him in tandem down the stairs to a hidden chamber in the hidden cellar of the safe house. A dozen other hooded figures were there already--Katie's relatives, all of them older than she.

The cellar floor was earthen, and pleasantly cool compared to the dry, crinkly grass outside. Katie dug her toes into the earth. Its texture was the perfect softness to draw in, but not so soft as to sink into.

"My friends, my family," Chief Superior said. "Today we are gathered to rid the world of a great evil!"

"Huzzah!"

Two hooded figures dragged a snarling man forward. The man swore in a language Katie was pretty sure was Russian.

"You have committed seventeen murders, of this we know! And you have obtained the most dastardly of knowledge to further your crimes!" The Chief Superior declared. "You have stained this world completely."

"Raaah!"

"Swift as a river, force of a tempest, blazing fire and pale moonlight, we seek to know which fate is best!"

Green glowing light emerged from the Chief Superior's hand. The two hooded figures holding the prisoner began to glow pale blue.

"So it is said, so it is done! We banish you to the Outer Gates!"

The criminal screamed a terrible scream and then vanished. There wasn't even the tiniest trace of him left.

"Peace my companions, for I see we have a newcomer. Katelyn, step forward."

Katie stepped forward and knelt before the Chief Superior. Harry took hasty steps forward and sat beside her.

"Katelyn, you have brought a newcomer?"

"I have, Honorable Chief Superior!" Katie declared. /Please work, please work, please work./ "I bring forth, Harry Potter!"

As she expected, there were excited murmurs from the other cloaked figures.

"You speak of his valor?"

"I know none braver! I tried to dissuade him, but he insisted on participation."

"He gained knowledge of us?"

Katie's stomach jumped into her throat. She would most certainly be sent to the Interrogators now. Her toes curled into fists in dread.

"It wasn't Katie's fault!" Harry protested. "Please, don't hurt her. She's a very good friend!"

"You speak of her honor?"

"Yes! Anyone who knows her would do the same!"

"And you, Katelyn, speak well of him?"

"I do!" Katie declared. She was doomed to the Interrogators anyway, but she would plead for Harry all the same. "At the age of twelve, he slew the mightiest of Serpents, a Queen Basilisk!"

"Is this true?"

"Wait, the Basilisk was a girl? Bloody hell."

"Such a coarse tongue you have brought to us, Katelyn!"

Katie hung her head. Subjection to the worst torture from the Interrogators would be mere child's play to what she was in for now.

"That said," the Chief Superior said thoughtfully, "It has been long since we've had someone new join our ranks, much less someone so accomplished at such a young age. Rise, Initiate Potter."

They had accepted him?! This was wonderful!

"Katelyn, you shall be in charge of him. You shall instruct him in our ways. Any infraction that Initiate Potter commits, the punishment shall be inflicted on you ten-fold."

Oh, double bollocks.

***** Part 4

--------------

Katie didn't see Harry again until they were to ride the Hogwarts Express together, for Hogwarts. He had gone off to see the Quidditch World Cup with the Weasleys, and had stayed the remainder of the summer. It was a pity--Katie had no other peers close to her age in the Guild. Having someone to talk to would have been nice.

This was going to be her fifth year, Harry's fourth. Fourth year had been a good year for Katie, but she wondered about Harry. He had always attracted trouble, like a moth to flame. Or a Gro-lao to the Guild's Moors.

Her parents were with her at the platform. Katie hugged them good-bye and kissed them both. Her father, Papa, ruffled her hair and pressed his lips to his forehead.

"My little Katie, do take care of the Initiate. He's going to need your guidance."

"Yes, Papa!"

"And be sure to write us, and study hard for your O.W.L.s," Katie's mother patted her cheek.

The bonds of family were sacred to the Guild. Perhaps that was why Katie didn't mind affection.

Or maybe she was just a Daddy's Girl (And so what if she was? Her Papa was awesome!)

Katie tugged at the collar of her Hogwarts robes--she far preferred the ones she wore in the Guild, but she had to conform to the dress code.

Harry was, predictably, sitting with his two favorite people in Hogwarts, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Oh, and Hermione's cat Crookshanks, a valuable ally for the Guild.

"Hi..." Katie felt herself blush. Why was she blushing? It was just Harry. And it wasn't like Ron or Hermione were strangers either. She knew them...sort of. "Can I sit with you guys?"

"Er, sure," Ron nodded. "Wait, my brothers didn't feed you anything did they?"

"No, no...I just wanted to sit with Harry. And you guys too...If that's okay?"

Hermione didn't look up from her book, but when Katie sat down next to Harry, she was sure Hermione flashed them a smile. It was an odd sort of smile.

Harry pulled a large book from his bag and held it up. He had pinned a note to the inside.

/Is this to do with the Guild?/

Katie gave the tiniest of nods. It wouldn't do to let Hermione and Ron in on the secrets of the Guild. She'd barely escaped the Interrogators with Harry--letting in anyone else, without permission, would surely result in prolonged punishment.

Harry met her eyes--his bright green eyes to her blue--and turned the page. There was another note pinned to the pages of his book.

/We meet at the statue of One-Eyed Witch. I want answers./

****** Part 5

--------------

Katie stepped from one foot to the other, as she waited for Harry to show up at the statue of the One-Eyed Witch. A promise was a promise and Harry had earned his right to have answers.

Harry showed up a moment later, with his wand and a piece of parchment in hand.

"Alright, quickly, through here," Harry said. He tapped the statue, muttered a password Katie couldn't catch, and pulled her through to a passageway.

"Thank you, Initiate Potter," Katie said formally. "It is good that we will not be overheard."

"Katie, start talking normal," Harry said. "Or I'll jinx you and leave you here."

"Alright, alright. Look, the thing of it is," Katie sat on the floor and patted the spot beside her. As Harry sat down, she continued. "My family, going back seven generations is part of the Guild. We are loyal to the Venatori."

"The what?"

"The Venatori exists to hunt down and destroy the relics of ancient evil creatures," Katie explained. "We assist them by banishing those who try to control these creatures. But it's absolutely, positively, top secret. You cannot tell anyone about us, not even Ron and Hermione."

"And you drafted me into this?!"

"You were spying," Katie put her hands on her hips. "It's not my fault the safe house happened to be in your neighborhood."

"I was there first! Who keeps a safe house for some secret society in a Muggle neighborhood?"

"That's what I said," Katie shook her head, "Before they took away my mouth privileges for two days. Harry, I know you argue with...pretty much every authority figure ever, but you need to respect the superiors' decisions on this. Otherwise, you're doomed, and I'm double doomed, because you're under my charge."

"What happens to you if I mess up?"

Katie shuddered at the thought. The Interrogators had various methods of punishments, each more unpleasant than the last.

"You're not gonna mess up," Katie said. "I'm going to help you. We're in this together, for the Guild! I will stand by you, Initiate!"

"Katie, I asked you to stop talking funny."

******* Part 6

--------------

There was something definitely suspicious about the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, but Katie had bigger things to worry about than that. Teaching Harry the ways of the Guild were her priority for the moment.

For the last week, they had met in the Common Room, under the excuse that she was helping him study. That actually was true--Harry needed a few pointers in Transfiguration and Astronomy. Potions was a lost cause, but that was beyond Katie's ability to assist in. Severus Snape was one of the meanest people she'd ever met.

But in between homework, and in Katie's case, outlining for her O.W.L.s, she was able to pass on information about the Guild. Usually tiny notes handed to one another as they studied face-to-face.

It was as discrete as could be, but despite this, it still seemed to attract attention. Hermione and Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet--Harry's best friend and Katie's fellow Chasers--seemed almost suspicious. But that wasn't quite the right word to use. They seemed to know something, but they hadn't said anything yet.

Katie couldn't help but feel a bit of dread. She liked working with Harry, but she also didn't want word getting out. One night she had had nightmares that the Guild had been revealed and that she, Katie, had been captured by the Interrogators. That they had taken away her wand and subjected her to all sorts of horrible tortures so she would divulge every secret she knew.

Perhaps they should find a better place to study...

--------------

The next explanation of what the Guild was, and the monsters they fought took place on Saturday. Katie had been prepared to use her "puppy eyes" to coax Harry into having the lesson outside, away from wandering eyes and peering ears. She needn't have bothered. Harry had needed no persuasion to get out onto the grounds of Hogwarts.

They walked down to the Lake. Katie glanced over her shoulder. So far as she could see, they were alone.

"So, in the Guild," Katie explained, "there are certain rules that must be followed at all times."

"Like the robes?" Harry said. "You have to wear the robes during the ritual?"

"Yes," Katie said. "The robes are woven with special fibers from...someplace else. They provide protection from the insidious effects of the Outer Gates."

"Right...and that's where the monsters live?"

"Anything that does not belong is this reality," Katie nodded.

"And not wearing shoes is another rule?"

"You're such a city boy!" Katie rolled her eyes. "Merlin didn't wear shoes, so neither do we. I find that my best spell-casting is done when I'm barefoot. I'm connected to ley lines that shoes block out that way."

Harry looked at her skeptically, and Katie sighed. He could be a bit pig-headed at times, but she'd been the same way when she first started. Best to give a demonstration.

"Watch closely," Katie said, pulling out her wand. She pointed it out towards the lake.

/"Aquamenti!"/

A thin jet of water shot out of her wand and then fell into the Lake. Not bad, but not overly impressive either.

Katie knelt down and pulled off her shoes and socks. She dug her bare feet into the soft grass and focused on the magical energy present in Hogwarts' very core. She wiggled her toes and bit back a laugh--she could have sworn the grass was tickling her.

/"Aquamenti!"/

A wave of water erupted from her wand, far longer and wider than the previous jet. It soared through the air and twisted itself, as if it were dancing, before it dove into the Lake.

"See my point, Initiate? The superiors' rules are usually there for a reason."

"Uh..."

Clearly, they had a long way to go.

******** Part 7

--------------

Katie was being watched. She was sure of it. Somehow, enemies of the Guild had discovered her. This was not good news. The Guild served the Venatori and sought to destroy ancient evils. But in order to destroy ancient evils, there had to be ancient evils to destroy in the first place. And that meant practitioners of these evil.

Voldemort was a schoolboy with daddy issues compared to some of these groups. Katie still had occasional nightmares of the monsters her father had told her about--Kemmler and his undead army and how he sought to bring absolute destruction to reality itself.

She had to be especially careful with teaching Harry now. She had elected to give him new instructions at a new location at Hogwarts every time they met.

Katie was on her way to the Quidditch Pitch. It was her favorite place in Hogwarts and she was pretty sure it was Harry's favorite place as well.

Harry met her at the Entrance Hall and together, they walked out towards the Pitch.

"So, Harry," Katie said in a particularly loud voice, "Tell me, how is your fourth year going?"

"It is fine!" Harry said in an equally loud voice. "I am learning a lot!"

"That is good! I am sure you will be able to be Hermione on every exam this term!"

No response. Huh. Clearly, Hermione was not one of the people following them, because she'd have certainly protested otherwise.

Katie brushed her hair behind her head and linked arms with Harry. They took an extra long path to get to the Quidditch Pitch, but Katie didn't mind. She liked being with Harry.

--------------

"So what happens when the Guild catches someone?" Harry asked.

He and Katie were lying on their backs, watching the clouds go by. They were trying to be as still as possible. Katie said it was good training for the Guild, to learn how to watch even the smallest changes in an environment, while making sure you weren't affecting the environment yourself.

"We destroy the relics they may be using. Make them collect all the offending documents, so they can be destroyed. Offer to recruit them, if they're remorseful. And if not..."

"That's what happened over the summer?"

"Yes, he had been harnessing the power of an Old One to commit murders. Fifteen Muggles and two wizards. There wasn't really any other way to deal with that one."

"It's kind of sad," Harry said.

"It's hard...but it's necessary. Harry, if you knew what that man had done to his victims..."

Harry stared at Katie. They'd been spending so much time together, he had begun to notice things about her he never had before. Katie wrinkled her nose whenever she admitted something she didn't like to think about. She played with her hair whenever she was concentrating very hard. And whenever she wanted to calm down, she made fists with her toes--she said she got that idea from a Muggle movie, but it was still a helpful part of training.

Quidditch had been canceled this year, in favor of the Triwizard Tournament. That had allowed them to come to the Pitch undisturbed. It was strange though. Harry wondered whether he and Katie would have spent this much time together had Quidditch not been canceled. They were teammates after all. And now they were part of a Guild...but, were they becoming friends?

********* Part 8

--------------

Buggering bloody bollocks!

Katie wasn't sure if she should be furious or terrified, but somehow Harry had been selected as a participant in the Triwizard Tournament. How? How?!

The answer was obvious. Enemies of the Guild had infiltrated Hogwarts and placed Harry's name in the stupid Goblet of Fire.

This was clearly an attempt to destroy Harry. Katie bit her lip. She suddenly felt like crying. Harry was her friend. A good friend. They studied together, for Hogwarts and for the Guild. And sometimes, they spent time together for no reason at all. They would watch clouds. And Harry put a flower in her hair once...

Katie looked around. Up and down the table, people were whispering their theories of how Harry could have tricked the Goblet.

"He didn't do it."

"It's brilliant, is what it is," Seamus Finnegan said. Lee Jordan and the Weasley twins nodded enthusiastically.

"He didn't do it!"

Across from her, Ron Weasley chewed his lip. /Please...you're Harry's best friend./

"I thought he might have, but blimey, he spends all his time with you these days, that if you say he didn't, I don't see how he could have."

"Ron, thank you," Katie said. "Wait...he spends plenty of time with you."

"Not as much as before," Ron sounded a little disgruntled, but also a little proud. "He's not as sneaky as he thinks he is."

"I'm...not sure what you mean," Katie stammered. "Really...we need to focus. Harry's gonna need...us."

"Sure," Alicia smiled. "We'll be happy to help Harry. By the way, you have a daisy in your hair."

xxxx

"I didn't do it," Harry said.

"I believe you," Katie put a hand on his shoulder. "I really, really do. They'll pay for this. I promise."

They were outside the Gryffindor Common Room. Katie had refused to participate in the party going on in there.

She felt so queasy. So, so queasy. Despite all her attempts to make fists with her toes, it wasn't calming her down at all.

And Harry...he was taller than her and bigger, but right now he looked so, so young.

"Do you think it's the Guild's enemies?"

"I do," Katie nodded. "I really do, and I promise, I swear to you, for the Good of the Guild, I will stand by you. As fire glows and green grass grows, by the shine of the sun and the light of the moon."

"Katie...thanks."

Regrettably, I have to go to work. See ya tonight everyone.

********** Part 9

--------------

This was the first time that Katie had ever seen Harry's Invisibility Cloak up close. She wasn't sure why she was surprised when Harry pulled the Cloak over her head and together they began walking to Hagrid's. Harry said Hagrid wanted to show him something and he wanted Katie with him.

Katie hadn't needed convincing. The Triwizard Tournament was among the most perplexing events she'd ever seen. It was taking all her training from the Guild to keep her sanity, for her own sake and for Harry's.

Despite having never gotten a late-night detention, Katie was no stranger to patrolling outside at night. But she'd never done so with Harry before.

The grass was cold under her feet, but being barefoot enabled her to walk far more quietly. Which was good because Harry was stomping in his boots and almost certain to get them caught.

They were seriously going to need a lesson on sneakiness. It seemed that Harry thought all there was to spying was his Cloak. And while it was a very nice Cloak to be sure, there was more to it than that.

And so they walked to the forest, first stopping at Hagrid's Hut. And there was...Madame Maxine?

"Bojour, Hagrid."

"Bong sewer."

Quadruple bullocks.

*********** Part 10

--------------

There was no time to waste. Katie had to throw everything she knew from the Guild into training Harry together past a dragon.

A dragon! Of all things, he had to get by a dragon. It was infuriating.

Katie and Harry were back in the Quidditch Pitch. It was isolated here. It was safe here.

They were lying on their backs, side by side. Katie wiggled her fingers slightly--If she wanted to, she could hold Harry's hand. That would...probably feel nice. There were many rituals and ceremonies in the Guild that required the members to hold hands.

"Breathe in as much as you can, and hold the breath for ten seconds," Katie said, trying to keep her voice steady.

Harry did as he was told and Katie watched as he inhaled and exhaled. Good. Steady breathing techniques would serve Harry well.

"How am I going to fight a dragon?"

"I'm not sure." Even if she harnessed every bit of power she could from ley lines, Katie wasn't sure how long she'd last against a dragon. Harry was probably better at martial magic than her, if they were on equal footing. And he was better at hand-to-hand fighting...

But this was a /dragon./

"You can't out fight it."

"So what am I supposed to do?" Harry asked. He looked like a scared rabbit, that wanted to flee.

Flee...

Fight or flight...

"Harry!" Katie said eagerly. "I have an idea!"

xxxx

Harry soared over the Quidditch Pitch on his Firebolt while Katie stayed on the ground. He was the greatest Seeker Katie had ever seen. The question was, could he outfly a dragon?

They had to see if he could outfly her first. Katie wiggled her toes in the grass of the Pitch and felt for the power of the ley lines of Hogwarts. She felt her magic grow and grow and grow...

Jet after jet she sent from her wand. Wave after wave. She concentrated and harnessed more power and Harry still was able to outfly her spells.

Excellent. He was better than she could have imagined. Was this was pride felt like? She had felt proud of Harry before--flying alongside him, but this was a bit different.

xxxx

Complete and utter terror was not an emotion Katie was entirely unfamiliar with--It came with the territory being part of the Guild. She still had nightmares of being attacked by a shoggoth when she was ten, and there were still the Interrogators that haunted her dreams.

But seeing Harry fly against the dragon was something else. Something else entirely.

Beside her, Neville was covering Colin Creevy's eyes. Seamus and Dean were covering Neville's eyes. Ron was cursing with such creativity that Katie was pretty sure the phrases had never before been uttered. Hermione was tugging her hair.

/Please. Remember your training, please, please, please./

She should be on the field with him. The rules of the Triwizard be banished to the Outer Gates. Guild members stuck by each other. Shame on her for leaving Harry alone to this. Katie couldn't swallow--she deserved the worst terrors the Interrogators had to offer for allowing this.

Harry dove and snatched his egg and soared, just outside of the Horntail's jaws.

He'd done it! Not even a scratch! Katie's legs felt completely like jelly, but she had to get to Harry. She ran from the stands, Ron and Hermione at her heels. Katie flung her arms around Harry's neck.

"Don't you ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever scare me like that ever again!"

Harry patted her back and Katie sat on the cot next to him.

Ron and Hermione were staring at them. And smiling. Why were they smiling like that? Those weren't excited smiles. Those were sneaky smiles.

Two of the other Champions, Victor Krum and Cedric Diggory were staring at Harry.

"We are also Seekers. How did we not think of flying?"

"Oy, Harry. You still up for that rematch?"

************ Part 11

--------------

"Potter, for goodness sake," Professor McGonagall said tiredly. "You're making this far harder than it needs to be!"

"I'm not sure what you mean, Professor. And really, I don't dance."

"The Yule Ball is tradition, whether you like it or not, you are going to the Ball!"

"Yes...well...um..."

"If this is about not having a date, Potter, you're not fooling anyone. Virtually everyone knows about you and Miss Bell."

"I...what?!"

"You're not nearly as skilled at avoiding detection as your father was. Nor your mother for that matter."

"Er..."

"Potter. Ask Katie Bell to the Ball, and then get on with your homework! I will not allow anyone, Triwizard Champion or not, not to make good marks!"

xxxx

Katie was a member of the Guild. The Guild fought against the denizens of the dark. It had been an honorable life, but one fraught with danger. She had attended seven funerals before she was five.

So when two sets of hands grabbed her, her mind immediately went to the Guild and its enemies. Katie swung her fist backwards and her captor gave a loud "OW!"

Katie whipped out of the grasp of her other captor and drew her wand. A thousand different combat spells flew through her mind to use against these vile foes. To use against--

Alicia? Angelina? And...oh, she'd given Fred a black eye. Oops.

"Didn't know you could punch like that," Fred groaned. "Oooh...Angelina, can you kiss my eye and make it better?"

"Why did you grab me like that?" Katie snapped. "I thought I was being kidnapped!"

"Katie, we're wizards. If someone wanted to kidnap you, they would have stunned you."

"We," Alicia said sweetly. "We wanted to know, what you thought of the Yule Ball."

"It's a tradition, dating back hundreds of years, hand-in-hand with the Triwizard."

"Nooooo, it's your chance to go on a real date-date with Harry!"

"I would hardly consider a traditional ball a date--and who says I'm dating Harry?"

"C'mon on," Angelina giggled. "You don't have to pretend. We know you like him and he likes you."

"Well of course...I like him...he's my friend," Katie said. "My...best friend. But...who says that we're...even...what are you implying?"

"OOOH! You like him a whole lot!" Angelina and Alicia giggled and those were evil giggles! Evil! Evil! Evil!

"I have to go."

"What? No, Katie come back!"

"We want to help you with your date with Harry!"

"He hasn't even asked me yet! He could ask someone else!"

"We want to help you get asked by him then!"

"I want someone to fix my eye!

xxxx

Katie sat in one of the armchairs in the Gryffindor Common Room, sulking. Alicia and Angelina were ridiculous. She crossed her arms and legs and for all intents and purposes, had folded herself into a ball. A ball much bigger than a Quaffle, but a ball nevertheless.

Harry walked in a few minutes later, looking dejected. It didn't take a genius to figure out what had happened.

"Didn't go well?"

"Yeah..." Harry said. "There was a girl...well...never mind. Hmm...so who are you going with to the Ball?"

"Nobody."

"Who's Nobody? Is he in your year?"

"What? I...shut up," Katie giggled. "Besides, as a member of the Guild, I have far more important things to worry about than a date to the Ball."

"Yeah..." Harry said. "But...you know, I bet there are some rituals that require dancing in the Guild."

"There are...the Dancing Dragon is one such maneuver."

"Maybe we should go to the Ball...as friends?"

"I think I'd like that...as friends."

That giggling Katie heard behind her had better just be the wind!

************* Part 12

--------------

Harry was dressed in robes of bottle green, and they brought out his eyes. Much as Katie's pale blue robes brought out the color in her own.

Such was the nature of the Guild. The eyes were the most powerful weapons, the windows to the soul.

Katie never really thought about it before...but Harry had very nice eyes.

He had nice eyes, but Harry was not a very nice dancer.

"Ow!"

"Sorry!"

"Ouch!"

"Sorry!"

"Harry, don't look down at my feet!"

"But I want to make sure I don't--sorry!"

"You're more likely to step on--ow! My feet if--ow! Look in my eyes, Harry!"

"Sorry!"

Katie couldn't understand why Harry was so nervous. He performed flawlessly on his broomstick. What was dancing to that?

"Harry, let me lead!"

"Um...right!"

xxxx

There was a break in the dancing, so Katie and Harry took a walk on the grounds.

"We need to learn to work together," Katie said. "Partnership is a critical element of the Guild."

"I understand," Harry said, his head ducked.

"I'm sure you do," Katie said. "We just haven't had as much practice just us two. Even me training you so far this year...It's mostly combat. But there's more to partnership than that."

"Right...we're partners."

"In the Guild," Katie said. "And on the Quidditch Pitch...and...well...anywhere else really."

"Oh! Move along, won't ya?"

Katie and Harry both jumped. Standing behind them were Hagrid and Madame Maxine.

"Run along now, it's cold. Yer dress robes aren't goi'g to be keeping' ya warm. And yer feet will freeze wit'ou boots."

"Right, Hagrid," Harry said. "Sorry!"

"Yes, we're sorry Professor Hagrid!" Katie said. "We'll just be going now...Harry, let's go someplace warm."

"Since when d' ya call me 'Professor'? And not too warm!"

"Oh yes," Katie said. "Thank you!"

xxxx

Getting back to the Common Room was harder than either of them had anticipated--wearing heeled shoes hurt like a bite from an Werr-nipper when going up staircases. Especially staircases that moved.

Katie wasn't sure whether or not the Guild's enemies were behind the staircases moving every time she and Harry were halfway a flight, but she wouldn't have been surprised.

"I had a really nice time with you Harry."

"I had a nice time with you too. And I hope we get to work together more. In the Guild," Harry added quickly.

His eyes were so green...and his smile so gentle...Katie pecked Harry's cheek.

"Meep!" Katie squeaked when she realized what she'd just done.

"Meep!" Harry said at the same time.

"You're so cute together!"

"Alicia!"

"The way he pulled you from the Lake was so daring!"

"Alicia, /please!/"

"You're gonna marry him!"

"Knock it off!"

"I know that you're in love with him! I saw you dancing in the gym! You both kicked off your shoes!"

"Aaaaah!"

Katie gathered her books and papers and left in a huff. This wasn't a tantrum, it was a huff. There was a difference.

She was late for meeting Harry anyway. She was going to Hogsmeade with him, and Ron and Hermione too.

"Your first double date!"

"ALICIA!"

It does make me wonder about things down the line:

Would Rita, spying on Harry, overhear Guild stuff and try to expose them?

Will Ron, encouraged by Harry's 'example', try to get a girlfriend, too? Act on whatever early stage feelings he has for Hermione? Or would his attempts with other girls cause drama?

How would this butterfly with Krum?

It'd be hilarious if, to Malfoy's perception, Harry's like, "yes, yes, very witty with the badges. Excuse me, have to find Katie" levels of dismissive.

I strongly recommend you *do not* read /Rise/, unless you're caught up on KH3.

If nobody knows the reference, babysitter pretends to babysit, but uses it for easy access to virgin blood and does ritual sacrifice in the living room while the kid sleeps.
