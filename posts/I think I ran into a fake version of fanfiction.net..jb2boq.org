So I was googling around for a story to read and clicked on what I thought was a fanfiction.net turns out it was fanfiction.ws it looked just like ffn. I don't know if it has viruses but it did seem wierd thought I'd post let people know just in case it is a dangerous fake ffn.

Thanks.


** Sadly these is common. There are some sites that just copy ffnet stories without permission on their sites.

** That could work to our advantage: It could serve as an archive for stories deleted off the real site.

**** More importantly it could well likely be full of viruses, trackers and others nasty stuff you do not want in your phone, tablet or computers.

If you want an archive that does not delete stories, A3O was create exactly in answer of FFN deleting stories, and so never ever would in a million years delete any stories. Go there. It's way safer.
