Basically what the title says. Canonically, time turners can basically break everything, up to and including 'bringing people back from the dead'. So the "good guys" would do something like go back in time to when Dumbledore died, and then use a switching spell on him right before the AK hits him with a polyjuiced volunteer. Dumbledore can then show up in the "present" which is really whenever whenever Dumbledore shows up, because thats when they know that its safe(as far as the laws of magic are concerned) for Dumbledore to show up. Deatheaters also go back in time to try to stop it by doing something... If the good guys don't know about them they could swap Dumbledore back with the polyjuiced person, hire someone to impersonate Dumbledore in the "present" in which he was "revived" until he dies again... etc. As long as none of the people actually belonging to that time period notice any change it both fits canon rules and could technically be canon compliant.


** There's a fic where Harry and Voldemort can breach the wards of both sides because they have the same blood whereas their allies can't which causes trouble in a drawn out war. In the end I think Harry breaches Voldemort's latest hideout and ends up time turner duplicating himself like mad to make an Army of Harrys behind enemy lines. Can't recall the name though...

** I mean there was an anecdote in HPMoR where a someone used a time turner to commit a crime so they gave an Auror a time turner to go after them. It ended with both of them permanently in St. Mungo's.

** In linkffn(Faery Heroes) The Lunar Harmony trio steal Rookwood's Time-Turner and use it as a backup, since the Potters had one in their manor. They end up using it to ambush Voldemort before they attack his hideout.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
