  Everyone knows the story, the Potters attacked and little Harry left with his relatives. But what happens when the last Potter stumbles upon something left behind? What does someone with no preconceived notions about Magic do when they find out that it's real? Do they follow along just like everyone else? Or do they find their own path? Harry Potter did always like to make things!

**** lol who cares. Those rules are all stupid anyway. 90% of fanfiction involves sex with minors. It'd be like making a rule that you can't post links to fanfiction that bash dumbledore.
