** There's a lot of variability to it - the main one being, honestly, power. Does this fanon Harry keep his previous power, or is he put in at the level of canon Harry? Does he keep his knowledge of various spells?

The second is exactly what kind of Harry it is - since you mention powerful ones, that runs a /very/ wide gamut of possibilities. Is it a smart one? An OP one written as author fiat? One that relies on fanon spells/power ups? Etc etc.

Combining those two major points is what gets us a wide range of outcomes here. It could be anywhere from everyone looking at this version of Harry and laughing, finding him outrageous and foolish and alienating, to a version where a powerful Harry takes charge of things, beats Voldemort, and engages in a fix-it of the canon universe.

From the title of your post, though, I think you mean the more cliche'd versions of each of those, typically written fairly childishly in attitude - in which case it'd probably work as a crack fic to have a fanon Harry keep failing at all the fanon things he's used to and getting explained why he's wrong/laughed at.

** Indy!Harry is quickly fucked when he finds his money running out after one shopping trip for excessively expensive stuff and no other vaults to rely on.

Slytherin!Harry is dead almost immediately when he goes to see his poor, misunderstood DE friends.

Slash!Harry has like a 1 in 100 chance of surviving, because it's so damn hard to find a decent slash fic where he isn't fucking a DE or old Voldy(And yes, book riddle/deaged riddle still count as Voldy).

Powerful!Harry has a good chance of actually winning the war, the problem is that noone else survives the war because Powerful!Harry accidently drained the leylines and cracked the planet to the core.

And finally, Gamer!Harry cries pitifully while playing on a PS because his neat abilities are all gone and he misses them.

** You guys are forgetting about assassin op Harry who was trained by someone and who ignores Hogwarts to just kill Voldemort. You know, the one who fiendfyres whole buildings to kill horcruxes and steals the elder wand to make killing everything easier. If he is there at the same time as Canon Harry then he eventually kills him to finish the job. Then he goes to retire to the unplottable island Sirius hid on.

Actually, dimension hopping assassin Harry with no morals just a goal might be kinda fun to read. Like a magical version of the Deadpool corps.
