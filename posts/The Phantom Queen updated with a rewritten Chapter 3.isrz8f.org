After many discussions with my Beta about the direction of the fic, we decided to change it a bit so it gains more depth and becomes more than a godly power boost story. The outline is reworked, chapter 3 rewritten. I'm excited about it!

  The Morrigan -- The Great Queen, The Phantom Queen. The Goddess of war, fate and death. To have her fate tied with The Morrigan was nothing Rose Potter ever expected to happen to her and yet, here she was. Her journey would take her into places long forgotten and her role would not only decide the fate of the wizarding world but of humanity as a whole. --Fem!Harry--
