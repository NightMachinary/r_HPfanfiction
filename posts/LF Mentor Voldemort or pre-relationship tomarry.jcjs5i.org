:END:
From what I remember Harry somehow ended up in a Parallel Universe, where Voldemort has a lot of power, but he's not a bad guy. Harry has difficulty accepting this. While Voldemort is researching how to send Harry back, Harry is put in an orphanage on Diagon/Knockturn Alley. He has a notebook, with which he can communicate with Voldemort. Every kid in the orphanage has a mentor of sorts and a notebook, but Harry is special, because it's the first time Voldemort has mentored a kid. I think he had trouble getting along with his roommate or another boy in the orphanage? No time travel, Harry's still in the 90s.

The fic was posted on Ao3 a few years ago. I don't know if it was tagged Harry/Tom or Harry/Voldemort, but the fic was abandoned before it came anywhere near to the beginning of a relationship. I don't know if the fic was deleted.

Thanks in advance.
