Any fanfiction focusing on a Death Eater?


** I wrote this from Narcissa Malfoy's point of view... I know she isn't an officially branded Death Eater, but it still tells the story from their side. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13747780/1/Ophiuchus-The-Serpent-Bearer-The-Story-of-Narcissa-Malfoy]]

  Submission to the Bring Back the Bastard fest at the Deeply Horrible comm on LJ. For margi_lynn's prompt: "During the first war, Snape pulled shifts at St. Mungo's to make up for their overwork. Most of the time he does help the healers. But what about the times he doesn't? Why those people?"
