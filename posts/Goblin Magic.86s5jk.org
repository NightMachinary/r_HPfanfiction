** linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone) is your safest bet. If you're very brave you might give linkffn(Harry Crow) a look.

*** Don't scare the OP! Harry Crow isn't a horrible story, it is a perfect story for young girls who love reading about charming princes having a romance with an insecure common girl! I'm sure the OP will love it!

...right?

  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.

** linkffn(Sympathetic Properties) has my favourite portrayal of Goblins in general, but it's more culture and politics focused and I can't think of much in it to do with their actual magic.

*** Small word of warning though. It's a freakishly long fic, and according to its author (I've spoken with him a few times) he's just written maybe 10% of what the complete fic will eventually be, so it'll be a 5M words fic that maybe will never be finished.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon. (Now at Hogwarts)
