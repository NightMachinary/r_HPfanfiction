So, I'm looking for the story where all pure blood heirs only have to follow the traditions and up hold their family values after they turn 16. Harry somehow gets tipped off and starts reading about the subject before Dumbledoor officially tells him at the end of the summer... Also mentions how a Potter's word is admissible in court because their family value is honesty?

Something along those line, the first point being the most important, since I may be mixing up fics here, but that's all I remember of it, and would like to find it again!

Thanks in advance!
