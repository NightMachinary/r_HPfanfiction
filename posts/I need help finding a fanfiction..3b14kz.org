  I remember reading this once, but I can't find it for the life of me. It's a Weasley/Dumbledore bashing fanfiction in which Harry and Hermione are fed love potions for Ginny and Ron respectively. I know that it involves them running away, and that somewhere in the first few chapters Molly having access to Harry's vault is mentioned. Any help is appreciated.

There are literally thousands of fics that fit that description. Some specific details might help.

** Is it one of these? There are so many that are very similar. Some of these are awesome and some are bad guilty pleasures that I'm constantly "fixing" in my head.

** If it's a Harry/Snape slash, then I believe its "It All Started With A Trip To Gringott's"

** I'm just throwing a couple links out there as a guess. As the other op says, there are so many of these it's hard to pin it down.

  The Semiclassic 'everyone has been lying to Harry about everything' plot. Very AU. Bashing of pretty much everyone. Mind Control Sex. Language. Dumbledore decides the Old Families won't tolerate the Chosen One being with a mudblood. Sucks to be Ron Ginny
