Here's the summary...

The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

*** It depends on what you mean. If you mean from a technical writing standpoint, then it's average. If you mean from an entertainment standpoint, then yes, it's entertaining. Keep in mind that I'm speaking from a nostalgic perspective. I recommend you click the link and try it out. You won't know if you'll enjoy it until you read some of it at the very least.

**** Thank you for re-upping the fic! And that's a very fair appraisal - it's not really written a tense or mode I'm comfortable writing in, and I think it can come off pretty clunkily at times as a result!

******* My first answer was in regards to you using all caps, the second was because I can't answer that, it has been a while since I have read it but at least OP and someone recommending it (when you search for it) seem to believe that it's at least good enough to be read.
