** Canon Harry has a habit of praising or dissing girls in his thoughts. Since he has never commented on Daphne, my expectation is that she's a plain looking girl who either does not stand out or knows how to hide her talents.

*** This!

Pansy is identified as the principle /Heather/ of the Slytherin girls in Harry's year, the next notable one is Millicent Bulstrode, who ditched any attempt at wand work in the 2nd year Dueling club to grab Hermione and wrestle her to the ground.

Less-notable girls in Pansy's posse would have to be less remarkable in looks, strength, and demonstrated smarts for them to blend in.

**** But Daphne might be very smart, a traditional Slytherin to the core:

- She mastered Occlumency before turning 17
- She fooled the Draco-Pansy gang into believing she was one harmless follower
- During Year 7, she was the one who passed inside dopes of the Inquisitorial Squad to the DA, without ever coming under suspicion
- In the Final Battle, she went with Slughorn to gather reinforcements, and she convinced her parents to join
- She, Tracey, and her sister Astoria were the “handful Slytherins” Harry saw in the fight
- In the immediate aftermath of the Battle, Greengrass family bet everything on the Kingsley administration and secured a senior position in the new government
- Astoria became the new leader in the Slytherin House the following year. She and Slughorn faced the difficult task to rehabilitate her house.
- Daphne later made some wise investments in Muggle world, one of which was the Amazon.com. She became eventually one of Jeff Bezos's secret advisors, through the use of her unique ‘competitive advantages'. As a form of gratitude, [[https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/][AWS Greengrass]] was created.

** I don't picture /Harry Potter/ characters in live-action at all, more in a slightly exaggerated artstyle caught somewhere between Mary Grandpré and Don Bluth's animation.

That being said, the Wiki says that common fanon wisdom holds [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/c/c7/Order-of-the-phoenix-daphne.jpg/][this background walkon in the movies]] to be Daphne, and, I mean, yeah, that works. Obviously it's a slightly cartoonier version of her in my head, but someone along those lines. The disinterested expression's just right, too --- my way of playing with the fanon "Ice Queen" trope is to take it to breaking point with a Daphne Greengrass feverishly obsessed with never being seen to care about anything whatsoever, be interested in anything, have the slightest warmth for any other flesh-and-blood creature, or generally hold any opinions of any sort.

** Not really. Since I've read the books a long time ago (before I even watched the films) my expectations are totally devoid of any actresses. And because we're talkign about totally fanfiction (after all, we don't have anything about Daphne in the books) I usually try to imagine her with the scant details that the fanfic authors usually provide.

Most often it's either blond or black hair and a pretty face. Thankfully that allows a lot of leeway for my imagination.

I prefer to imagine HP characters as real people, rather than Hollywood 1M$ faces.

** Just to be clear this is my headcanon and won't concord with many actual descriptions from fanfics. I always imagine Daphne as a tall (taller than average) girl with long (just passed the shoulders), straight (but with a bit of wave in it) silver blond hair held by a black headband. Her eyes are very green (like you don't realise how green they are, her family has a green eye dominant gene because magic). She's fair-skinned and I guess she's above average in terms of looks. But I usually imagine the characters as semi cartoonish/anime/fan art-like since descriptions in fiction are way too exaggerated for humans. I've never seen someone get the slightest bit of red in their face for anything less than screaming in anger. And people usually have to be very sick or anaemic to become paler (in my personal experience. No one turns green or grey, either).
