Tom Riddle grew up reading Batman comics.

His favorite villain was The Riddler.

Tom is inspired by The Riddler and wants to follow in his footsteps.

I got this riddle lined up for ya:

"What walks on 4 legs, betrays his friends, and is the reason for your end?"

"A Rat."


** He also keeps hinting to Dumbledore about Horcruxes: "What has a soul but is not alive, can talk without a mouth and think without a brain?"

** He could have very well read Batman comics because Batman debuted in 1940, when Riddle was 14 years old. But Eddie Nigma didn't debut until 1948 when Riddle was 22 years old and had committed the murders of his father, grandparents, Hepzibah Smith and god knows who else.

Sorry for the knowledge bomb. I'm a comic book nerd. I can't help it.

*** Maybe in this timeline the creators of batman had the idea a few years earlier and the riddler himself was created earlier

** Lol would be amazing if it turned out he just wasnt very clever with riddles, but didnt know that because wizards are canonically awful with them, but any muggleborn just takes a look at the threatening note he wrote and says, "oh hes going to teleport harry to riddle seniors grave to complete a resurrection ritual".

***** If you wanted someone to be Riddle Riddler for in between those two on age, I'd go with Edward Norton, because he could play anyone.

Also, Ben Kingsley is my go to actor for pretty much anyone who needs to be smart and Evil. He would be my casting choice for Quirrel if HPMOR was ever made into a theatrical presentation. Or if Disney ever decides to make any of the Star Wars expanded universe books into movies and need someone to play Grand Admiral Thrawn.
