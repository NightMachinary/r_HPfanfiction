:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically all I remember as a part of this fic is their was a tradition or competition between animagus (pretty sure it's between noble houses or pure blood tradition but I could be wrong) where some run away and try to escape and the others hunt them down/ try to catch them in teams to see who wins. I believe James and lily are still alive in the story but I could be wrong.
