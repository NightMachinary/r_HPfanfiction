*** Looks right. One of robst's more readable ones, if I remember correctly. Here's my half-remembered review.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]], by robst

Hat Tipping: minimal

Absurd but compelling early premise rating: 9/10

Complete: yes

Cringingness level of minors' sexualities: err, don't...remember? I think it is all over in first year, and it is rated "T", so I goddamn hope nothing happens.

**** I suspect this will probably date me, but what is "hat tipping" in this context?

***** Robst's Harrys usually come off like how a stereotypical anti-social basement dweller fedora wearing neckbeard imagines himself to be when he is being a stereotypical white knight and attempting to act 'chivalrous', as if being nice or polite to a woman automatically grants him access to her panties. If you've ever been on the default subs you see it referenced all the time where you just have to cringe at people who use words like "m'lady" and "sir" a lot.

It's hard to describe because it's kinda something you have to experience. The "hat-tipping" part of that comes from said fedora wearers literally tipping their hat and saying "m'lady". They see themselves as being heroes when really they're just awkward and weird.

It's like the uncanny valley of social interactions. There's nothing wrong with what is being said or done but it just doesn't fit with every day interactions so much that it is appalling, revolting, and/or disgusting to normal people.

In the context of robst's stories, Harry is literally just a normal level of nice to Hermione and she fawns all over him. The "hat-tipping" level is just how much Harry acts abnormal and awkward, much like someone who has no social ability. At least in my opinion, you'd have to ask TLPG for theirs.

**** I wonder how much my recollection of A Different Halloween is colored by having read it immediately after Methods of Rationality's version of the troll scene...
