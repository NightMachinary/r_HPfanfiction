I remember almost-literally nothing else about the fic. I know the baddies find out and are seriously not-happy with the fact that their targets are being popped away. I'm almost certain it wasn't a Dumbles-bashing fic, and it may have been Harry/Hermione but don't take my word for it. It's also the only fic I've found that did that, so if you know a fic like that chances are it's the one. Thanks so much.


** linkffn(2290003) - Pet Project uses house elves. Not sure if it is the one you meant as it is Hermione/Snape

  Hermione overhears something she shouldn't concerning Professor Snape and decides that maybe the House-elves aren't the only ones in need of protection.
