Since romance is such a big deal on here, and romantic relationships, I think it would be cool to see a story with a character who just doesn't have sexual desire or no desire to act on them. Bonus points if the character is in a situation that looks like it may turn romantic, but the character has to confront their asexuality. I just think these sorts of characters are such interesting concepts


** This is generally what the "genfic" tag means. No romance.

Unless you are more interested in fics exploring people who have little to no sex drive, and then for example explore trying to date but nothing works out because they don't feel anything for anyone. That might be neat and I swear I have seen it once or twice, but then i never searched it out either. The fic that jumps to mind like this is "The Art of Self-Fashioning" linkao3(5103614) about a transfiguration master Harry who is completely asexual if I recall correctly.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

*** You mean aromantic asexual? Interesting, but romantic asexuals are more common. Wouldn't it be interesting to see how asexuality complicates dating?

** Hey I just want to point out that you are talking about two orientations here. Asexuality is the lack of sexual attraction (not desire I will point out) while aromantics don't feel romantic attraction. This means asexuals are often more than willing to date and be in a relationship! People who are aromantic however don't feel crushes or romantic desires so will not enter a relationship. People can of course be both which is shortened to aroace but it can be harming to just say asexual as it causes misconceptions and means asexuals struggle to be in a relationship as people think they can't feel romantic feelings towards someone else.

** “[[https://www.wattpad.com/37216658-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation/page/2][Dursley's Daughter (A Harry Potter Next Generation Fan Fic) by writerer]]” ... note that it is kind of high-school afternoon TV series type of story: no big drama, nobody gets killed, normal teenage drama. It doesn't mean it is bad: I like Kipling's “Stalky & co” after all. No, and don't worry it is on Wattpad, it is actually rather decent.

  When Harry Potter sorts into Slytherin, Parvati hears whispers.He should have been a Ravenclaw, she hears, He's gotta be a smart kid, right?She recognizes the way that people underestimate Harry Potter, the way they downplay his bravery and cunning and stubbornness in favor of focusing on his brain, his grades.Sure, he may be the Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived, but he is expected to be a very certain kind of Chosen One. He is expected to be a smart one, a brilliant one, not a brave one or a valiant one.She knows their expectations of Harry just as well as she knows the expectations that she and Padma and Cho and every other Asian kid get. It's the same thing everybody expect when they see the slant of Remus Lupin's eyes, the turban Parvati's father wears, the sari wrapped around her mother's body.

** Do you actually want a story where sexual attraction and romance just don't matter, like the aforementioned "genfic" or any of the many childrens' stories, or do you want a fic that obsesses about sex and the protagonist having none of it?

** Here's a story about Rowena Ravenclaw. It's part of the Of Linear Circle mega-series, but I think it works as an independent story too.

** Can't really go wrong with [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13132217/1/Pranking-The-Tournament][Pranking The Tournament]], there's some stuff with Neville that could imply possible romantic interest later down the line, but the story doesn't go into it (and honestly it's flimsy at best). Romance is the furthest thing from being on Harry's mind here.
