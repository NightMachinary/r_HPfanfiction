I'd like to read a fanfic story where soul bonds aren't seen in a romantic light, but as an affliction (being forced to "love" someone by magic doesn't sound like fun, to put it mildly, aside from how it's used/misused as a shitty deus ex machina for characters to have an relationship without having to write the beginning resp. origin of the romance), but the story shouldn't be /too/ tragic, either (e.g. the bonded committing suicide or something like that).


** That just reminds me of all those "you are not allowed to be more than three yards apart" bond fics.

How are those so afflicted gonna go to the loo? "Hey, get off the sofa and wait in the corridor. I need to take a dump."

**** Never seen any good ones. Even the ones trying to invert the trope were trash in their own way. But then, I never really sought them out. So there may be one or two out there I don't know of.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

** So, the best in this space have already been mentioned (Error of Soul and Playmate). Error Of Soul is particularly is particularly fascinating because it is a merge fic, so it is entirely non-romantic. (Eventually there will be no Harry or Hermione, just Harrmione as a single entity with two bodies).

There are a lot of cool ways a 'soul bond is bad' could go. Here is my list:

- Non-Romantic, Merging: Bonded merge into a single person, suffer loss of identity

  - Error of Soul is this. Sadily it is abandoned and hasn't gotten past the preliminary (what is going on?) stage.

- Non-Romantic, Friendly: Friendly bonded deal with a bond. Maybe working together but fighting the magical world's assumption that being bonded means they have to be a couple.

  - None that I know of don't cop out to romancing the pair

- Non-Romantic, Horror: Enemies are bonded and fighting against it.

  - I know a bunch that start this way, but they all turn into sick 'love thy abuser' fics. *There is something wrong with a segment of the hpfanfic community. Seriously*

- Non-Romantic, Tragic: Classic magical affliction tragically effects the bonded.

  - Playmate fits this and is good and complete.

- Romantic, Friendly: Romantic couple is bonded and does NOT want it.
- Romantic, Horror/Tragic: Romantic couple is bonded and either has to unwillingly break up or suffer some penalty from it.

** I always like the subversion that soul-bonds are supposed to be romantic/a blessing in theory or from magic, such as finding your ideal life-partner, but to a human perception/the reality is that it's completely horrifying in that it brain-rapes/manipulates the people involved.

Perhaps even to the point of altering personalities to have the two involved becoming two halves of the same whole.

That would be horrific beyond measure, especially to friends and family of the afflicted as it could be like two strangers walking around in, say, Harry or Daphne meat-suits with their memories.
