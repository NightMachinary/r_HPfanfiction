Don't know if this is the right r/ for it or not, but this is by far the one where Daphne is discussed the most. We have countless Haphne fics but not nearly the same level of fanart to match, art of Daphne is pretty rare, but I don't think I've ever seen art of the pairing together at all.

What's the deal with this? Is it out there and I've just been missing it, if so where do you go for it? Links to any y'all know of below please !

** I feel you man, there are a lot of fanart of Daphne and Harry but not the two of them together which is a shame really, If I knew how to paint/draw I would make one every week until I ran out of ideas.
