Looking for fem!Harry stories where it is believable that he's turned female after being male for 13+ years. Like SoPDoB, it's what I have in mind, female Harry with political power. Also femslash and over 60k wording. Decent plot and good writing. Please no Rose/Harriet/Jasmine/Hope/Holly/Iris Potter stories! I'm sure they're awesome, but I can't bring myself to read them.

Thank you!!


** I believe the term you're looking for is 'genderbender' but i might be wrong. Searching for fem!Harry will just give you all the fics with Harry being born female.

Anyway, here you go:

linkffn(9928419) unfinished IIRC, also heavy on the Lady Black stuff but otherwise enjoyable.

linkffn(11862560) Probably the best fic that considers the psychological impacts of a gender switch on an abused child. It can drag on occasionally and the linguistic stuff can get annoying but if you want a story about character development, Voldemort being an actual person instead of a caricature of evil and a well thought out wizarding society, this is definitely the right fic.

I also found this list on ff.net | I haven't read most of the stuff listed so you'll have to wade through it yourself: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Potter-and-the-genderbender/107439/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/]]

**** I have a rule where if it's not been updated for over 1 year I move it to an "abandoned" subdir.

That was painful.

*** What's the primary pairing for SoC? 'Cause femslash or not, I won't touch Harry/Ginny with a ten foot pole.

**** It's been a while since i read it, I don't think a pairing was ever decided but Ginny isn't even in the contention. IIRC the tags are fairly accurate, Fleur, Tonks, Luna and i think Hermione play bigger roles but don't quote me on that.

**** Nah. At the moment, it's Harry(Alya Black)/Fleur/Luna. Although it's not exactly a polygamous relationship as I don't think any of them are actually /dating./

Trust me, I hate Ginny/Harry too.

  There were only a few things in Harry Potter's life that were absolutes. He was the son of Lily and James Potter and that he was born male. What happens when he discovers the truth. AU Strong/Independent, Gender-Switch, Fem!Harry, Fem!Slash Mature Themes

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)
