*** More that I didn't realize reddit would only allow posting a URL or text. When posting, I filled out the "Link" tab (with the correct link) and then the "Text" tab. And then I neglected to verify that my post worked as expected. Regardless, thank-you for posting the link.

  Looking for something different? Something compelling, with a plot that isn't cookie-cutter and predictable? This is the epic for you. 1981 didn't go as it was fated, leaving the world of 1994 a crumbling, fractured apocalypse. Between runes that promise the end of the world and the possibility of magic dying entirely, Harry has a difficult path ahead of him.
