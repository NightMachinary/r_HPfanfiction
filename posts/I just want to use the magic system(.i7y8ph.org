So I've been making a hp/ marvel fic and was trying to think of a different magic system cause the regular hp one seems so limiting to me. Anyways when I was think of new systems my mind drifted to that fic ‘Core Threads'. I was hoping to use that and I pm'ed the author but he hasn't been active for years. Would it be wrong for me to still use and post the fic?(I'd still give credit of course) is there anyways to still message him?


** Can you explain how the canon magic system is limiting? I'm genuinely curious because, from my perspective, t seems like one of the most utilitarian and versatile ones I've ever seen.

*** I agree. Canon implies all sorts of laws of magic, and students write long essays about how magic works, but we don't actually see what those rules are, save one or two. Therefore as an author you can make them roughly whatever you want, and as long as you don't directly contradict canon it'll count as canon-compliant-ish. And if you don't care about canon compliance, then do whatever you want -- it's fanfic not structural engineering.

**** I agree, the canon magic system is versatile, but only for hp. Maybe the word limiting is the wrong word, but I still feel it has potential to be even more and that's what the author did in his fic. In marvel almost all sorcerers and wizards don't use wands or staffs unless it's to amplify the effect. In ‘Core Threads' Harry is able to send his own magic into different materials and shape them to his will and it lasts forever . Changing the materials the way he does it isn't transfiguration because it's stays. No wizard in canon is able to use pure magic. I just feel that the magic system in strictly hp is versatile like you said. I just don't feel the same about other fandoms.

***** I would counter than transfiguration being temporary is /not/ canon (or rather, not explicitly canon), and you could well interpret things Dumbledore does in HBP as using 'pure magic'. That's kind of the beauty of it: Harry could have easily had a Transfiguration class or many classes about sending magic into objects to shape them to his will, and Canon would pass over it for more passages about Harry being mad at Snape or something. Or had to write a long History of Magic essay about "great wizards" that used "pure magic", and got bored and unsuccessfully asked Hermione to finish it before reluctantly bs-ing it last minute ("Binns doesn't read them anyway"). It's pretty open-ended.

****** Ok I feel I'm starting to understand your point. My mind is making more connections with the abilities described in the fic, and I can see almost entirely how the systems of magic used in other strictly hp and more canon fics could be used to describe, at the very least, most of the abilities shown. I think it really just comes down to the wandless aspect and the way the magic is described in the fic. Like when I think of canon hp or even some other fics, I feel the magic is described in such a lifeless way and ‘Core Threads', instead of doing that, plays better to my interests and imagination.

*** It's also one the strongest systems I've seen. Magic affects both large and small scales. One can conjure shooting stars or conjure yourself a chair. This is unlike other stories where you can only do small things or large dangerous things.

It's also one of the only systems where mundane forces (like kinetic projectiles) always lose to magic. Unlike many other magic systems, an idiot with a gun won't pose a threat to a skilled wizard.

** I haven't read the fic you're on about but I'm pretty sure it's fine to reference other fics in your own work, so long as it's clear you're sharing their idea and you credit them accordingly? All accepted fanon started off as one person's headcanon after all.

Yes I do think it's OK if you use it but you should still credit it

*** Well, that's the thing, I'm still working on it. I want at least a couple of chapters before I post anything, just so I have some lee way when it comes to more later down the line. I mainly posted this so I could get some more opinions on the matter and I'm mainly mapping out the plot rn, at least the broad strokes of it. So when I am finished and I posted a couple of chaps I'll come back and link it. As for right now I need like another week or two. It's my first fic and I want to see it done to at least an above average level.

** I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] wrote an extensive theory about how magic in Harry Potter works, without it being of the "core magic" and "magic is quantifiable" tropes. Maybe that could be useful?
