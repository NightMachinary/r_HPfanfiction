I would like a list of quotes from the books, arranged by relationship/interaction.

E.g. All the interactions between Draco and Hermione, listed out nice and easy from all seven books.

Does anyone know of anything like that? Anywhere that isn't just a wiki, but actually arranges the source material around themes?

(I know the answer is probably no, because copyright. At this rate I might need to buy all seven as e-books so that I can do a digital search for character names through them.)
