there are a lot of dark Harry stories as well as Draco redemptions so why not a cross of both. A Harry who for some reason or another grows up to be ruthless and cares only for himself. Yet during the war he learns by himself to understand the value of the people around him and change for the better.

What I don't want is Dumbledore or some other to say "Other people matter, don't be a dick" and Harry change wholeheartedly, it needs to be his own realisation.


** I want this.

On your Dumbledore note, I agree but I also want Dumbledore as a mentor helping him when Harry decides he wants to change

*** You could couple that with a Dumbledore who feels a lot of guilt and regret because he wonders if Harry turned out the way he did because of his family situation. Dumbledore himself is evaluating his own choices, while also trying to help this troubled young man, the boy who is supposed to defeat Voldermort, the boy who is the legacy of two bright, young people Albus cared about.

** linkffn(Renegade) has this BUT it's abandoned and the story is non-linear, so you only find the redemption arc at like the last two chapters. He initially makes friends with Ron, Hermione and Neville because he thinks they'd be valuable followers, so he blatantly manipulates them, only to realise that he came to care for and even love them.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.
