:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi all! Sorry I couldn't give more details, but I'm trying to find an older fanfic, that might have been a WBWL story with a Harry/Daphne pairing. I don't remember much more other than a scene at the train station where Lily sees Harry give Lady Greengrass a hug, or maybe it was a smile, and she starts to regret the neglect that Harry received.

I know it's not an entirely unique situation given the WBWL setting, but I've been meaning to find it and I've read so many Harry/Daphne pairings that I can't remember which ones had that scene.

Edit: It was Harry Potter Rise From Dust! Glad you all were able to help me find it so quickly, bummed on the other hand that the story was abandoned haha!


** Harry Potter, Rise from Dust by Bluezz-17 ? Might be that one.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

  He's not the Boy-Who-Lived. He's not the Chosen One. He's not even a hero. Quite the opposite in fact. He's a being of such terrible greatness that at one point, those who were hated as devils and worshiped as deities, saw fit to seal him away. Now he's back and he wants his throne. Let Order reign...

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

  Neglected in favour of his younger brother, Harry Potter always was dissatisfied. His Parents and their friends fawned over Thomas, no matter what the older brother did. Harry upped and left; why would he have stayed? 6 years later, Harry Potter found a new home. The boy is in the middle of it all, though. What will his role be? Where will his allegiance lie?
