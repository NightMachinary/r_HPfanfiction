So here's the scenario. Dumbledore is well-meaning, the Dumbledore that JKR meant to portray. You have your own opinion of Dumbledore's good intentions, and you have the opportunity to try to change his behavior by providing him with fanfics. That's it, that's all you can do, just provide him with fanfics (they magically appear on his desk or something). At any point in his life.

Which fanfics do you give him?

Obviously, lots of fanfics will give him an incredible wealth of knowledge about the future (Quirrell, diary, Sirius, etc.). Would it be simply enough to give him the canon stories and hope he'll use that knowledge to make Harry's life easier? You'd probably want to stay away from any stories where Harry goes dark, giving those to Dumbledore probably isn't going to help Harry. But some Dumbledore-bashing might be useful, pointing out the ways he's let down Harry so often?

Just an idle thought late at night.


** linkffn(9824342) Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure is one of those time-travel fics where an AU "good" Dumbledore gets the opportunity to fix the mistakes made by the canon "bad" Dumbledore.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon).

** The Blood / Tears of the Phoenix fics by MidnightJen. It portrayes a Dumbledore who is not bad, but is too set in his ways and doesn't see that he gradually loses control of Harry, the Order and the War (in that order).

  Albus Dumbledore gets an unexpected visitor in his office one late summer night. The Headmaster finds himself talking to a monster he never knew could arise from his actions. Darkish.

*** That's pretty good. It emphasizes the mistakes of Dumbledore's "illogical compassion" over his mistakes with Harry, concentrating on the damage he did to the Wizarding World over the damage he did specifically to Harry, which is probably a better argument to make to him.

Hmm, but then it claims Harry is his monster, not the society he created. Hmm.

**** How would that affect him? The first chapter is the only place where his actions are examined, but only up to 1945 and he's already aware of his miss-steps with Grindelwald (it barely mentions Riddle). The rest of the story only shows Harry being successful, /with Dumbledore's "influence"/, and thus only validates Dumbledore's actions?
