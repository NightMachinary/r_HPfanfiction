It recently occured to me that the silence of the lack of wizarding culture was deafening as soon as I noticed it wasn't there. What details of wizarding culture would you expect to find? Minor details are preferred as they seem to be more grounded in society than simple large ones.

A minor one that sparked this idea is the idea of looking in someone's eyes being rude especially in higher settings. It could be a statement that they are so far beneath you that you have no fear of *legilimency to insinuate both their lack of power and their relative status.

Or that you shouldn't use your right hand to gather things on your person in stores as that could be seen as grabbing for your wand.

These things don't necessarily have to make sense, and I would think that the less logical they are the more realistic they are. Social norms don't always make sense and usually don't. I've read a few stories that go into some detail about pureblood/wizard culture, but the lack of minor details makes it seem shallow in retrospect. Even something as simple as leaving your shoes at the door would be something special.


** How about, being invited into someone's home is polite. Usually only to the 'public' part of it's a old manor type place but the point is there.

However being invited to stay over at night is a big difference (not in the euphemistic way) due to the various ways of instant or near instant transportation, staying over at someone's house because it's difficult to get home or it's too late isn't a thing. As such being invited to stay over is a major sign of "you are accepted into our household and we want you around"

******* You flatter me with your words. This delicacy is made by the most highly paid minimum wage workers. The meat is cooked as efficiently as possible while also taking preventive measures to ensure the meat is pure. The origin of this meat is questionable, but it is one hundred percent of some specimen. The main meal consists of pure rice seasoned and flavored by a man with the outward appearance of a Japanese chef, but with the heritage of the southern neighbors of the free land of America. To top it off, the meal is then brought by a woman with an extraordinarily high pitched voice that isn't unpleasant even if out of the common range.

But yes, I always enjoy reading stories that contain some amount of pure blood political manoeuvring and etiquette following. Especially if it's just the kids taking themselves too seriously I just find it adorably amusing. "Oh you helped me with my homework question that means I owe you one favour of lesser or equal value. But only one"

But Ron having to nudge Harry or Hermione because they either made or are about to make a social faux pa does sound like something that should have happened a bit because they are knew to the world.

I think my favourite one that I saw (obviously played for laughs) was that 'Family Magic' is of course only shared with people in the family. So asking to see someone's family magic, or sharing the magic, was basically proposing to them. So Harry accidentally married hermione by asking for her interpretation of something he was reading in the Potter family magic book

** I don't think the "looking in someone's eyes" thing really works (at least in the canonical universe; some AUs have more widespread Legilimency) because Legilimency is very obscure lore. What you describe may be a power dynamic that could play out between two Dark Wizards, perhaps; but it wouldn't be an ordinary everyday thing.

Other than that, though, you're thinking in the right direction. I like all this.

I think the basic reason not too many social norms are mentioned is because the Wizarding World doesn't /have/ that many --- they're not /that/ removed from the Muggle world in that respect; to a British Muggle a British Wizard is a little eccentric, but not /foreign/. Another reason is that wizards are too eccentric and independent-minded to have much in the way of norms in the first place.

Nonetheless, a few stray ideas:

- It's rude to ask someone what House they were in at Hogwarts if you don't know. If they don't choose to advertise it (i.e. by wearing a green tie to indicate they were a Slytherin), it's not for you to know.

- Do /not/ touch someone else's wand. Even if they've dropped it and picking it up for them seems like the proper thing to do.

- Keeping your wand in your pocket indicates loose manners and a devil-may-care attitude; a proper wizard never parts with his.

- Don't talk to a Portrait-Person about their "original" as a separate person. It tends to throw the poor thing in existential crisis.

- If a witch works with the Ministry, she is to be addressed as Madam, not Mrs or Ms. This goes regardless of her marital status.

- It's extremely embarrassing to stop a British wizard in the street asking for the time; since being gifted your own pocketwatch is a symbol of adulthood for British sorcerers, admitting you've forgotten it at home is a show of immaturity. (Note: Minister Fudge always forgets his pocketwatch at home.)

- Normal people swear by God or Merlin. If you say things like "/by Morgana/" or "/for Salazar's sake/", you're trying to call attention to yourself, rather clumsily. Purebloods will, however, occasionally swear by their ancestors, and /that/'s okay (among purebloods; everyone else thinks it's pretentious and silly).

- How expensive a bribe a Ministry official will ask for depends on their rank within the Ministry rather than on the favor being asked. Even if it's to get you off a murder charge, a Hit-Wizard would be uncouth to ask you for more than 50 Galleons, whereas it'd take at least 500 to sway a Department Head into overlooking that you handed in your report late.

- Wearing the pointy hat outside of Hogwarts (or, for that matter, /inside/ Hogwarts on non-special occasions) is as old-fashioned as owning a toad. Worse, perhaps.

Not necessarily. Since wizards have super-duper healing magic, you could extract half a toad's blood without killing it, etc. Living organ farm.

Plus, some people have pet chicken. We obviously domesticated chicken to murder the heck out of them, but eventually someone went "hey, that's cute, I want to keep it". It likely won't happen to us with chicken now, but it's imaginable that in a hundred years pet chicken may have become accepted as an everyday pet.

No, as funny as that would be, we do know toads are (well, used to be) popular wizarding pets. cf. Neville and Trevor, toads being sold at the Magical Menagerie.

I really like the idea that Neville's Trevor is basically like if decades after owning a dog goes out of fashion, someone wanted to revive the tradition of dog-owning and gifted their kid a wolf. Then wondered what went wrong when the wolf failed to be cuddly, and, indeed, actively tried to eat the kid.

On the other hand,... Dumbledore is /also/ a really upstanding member of society. Wizards, collectively, are a cartoonishly eccentric bunch where Barty Crouch Sr is the weird one because he wears a gray suit and a tie to work instead of plum robes and a lime green bowler hat.

******** Here's a theory:

Wizards first started keeping toads when some brave or unfortunate soul discovered the hallucinogenic effects of licking certain species. After this, some of the more "spacey" wizards began carrying their drug-toads everywhere, so they'd always be able to trip out on demand.

As with anything, over time the true purpose of the tradition was forgotten, and now many simple keep the toads as standard pets.

You'd get no closer to tripping balls if you licked Trevor than if you licked Neville himself.

*** To add more detail (and a bit of copy paste a response on another comment):

I would expect the eyesight to be more about the formality of the setting as I hinted towards. Lucius Malfoy talking to another noble family rather than Joe talking to Dorphy about the turnips this season.

Like your own example of swearing by ancestors. If the ability to use legilimency is indeed extremely rare, then the assertion is "You are too weak to use legilimency, and I could knock it aside without the slightest effort."

If you want canon support for this example, Narcissa Malfoy taught Draco occlumency. That at least shows that it is known among the more noble families both how to use it. You could even extrapolate deeper in that Snape said that you needed a legilmens to learn occlumency unless you want years of work. Snape's comment to Draco implies that this is a recently gained skill for Draco. Bada boom, we have a decent fanfic idea that even has some canon support.

***** Everything was fascinating. I never knew about the watch which actually makes a lot of things I've heard make sense. I had actually previous considered the "point hat" on the Hogwarts requirement list to be a prank as they were never worn except by the fabulously fabulous Albus Percivial Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.

I especially liked the Hogwarts houses, the not touching of the wands, portraits as not being the same person, and the method in which they hold their wand. Malfoy uses his fancy staff for example. Moody also spoke of wand holsters although that could just be his constant vigilance.

The portrait thing greatly depends on the fanfiction. My own headcanon is that they may be sentient, but they are more of an outline of the person. Over time, the magic can get more magicky and the portrait becomes its own being totally apart from the original. The Fat Lady Portrait would be nothing like the original person all those years ago for example. They would never be the same person, but they were them too. A mild caricature of the person perhaps. Also, Dumbledore was opposed to living on after death. I highly doubt he would make himself live on after death as a portrait which implies to me that they aren't truly the same person. I imagine the person in the portrait is just a goofy old man who wears funny robes and occasionally spouts nuggets of +nonsense+ wisdom.

EDIT: I imagine the wizard equivalent of the stopwatch would be being incapable of casting a spell (if it exists).

****** Yeah --- the Portraits are canonically "sentient, but somewhat two-dimensional". That is to say that they're more than illusions, but they are artificial beings who outwardly resemble what the painter thought the person was like, but are their own person whose personality may or may not be that close to the original. (The original can choose to use Pensieve-like magic or simple conversation to give some of their memories to the Portrait, but they don't have to.)

** One of the things that always strike me as lacking is that there seems to be a lack of entertainment. In modern societies you will always find that certain hobbies have a certain status.While things like Quidditch or Football is everyone / the masses, other sports like Duelling would be for the upper classes. People who watch TV are seen as less educated as people who go to the theatre. What about the wizarding world? What does the clark on Diagon Alley to after work or at the weekend? What does a Ministry worker or healer do? Are there clubs and hobbies for adults? Is there some sort of additional qualitfication institution?

Also questions about social status are rarely addressed besides Squibs and blood status. How are adults seen that didn't go to Hogwarts? Or stopped after OWL year? Is working for the Goblins considered a good job?

******* But /why/ is it an extremely obscure art?

For horcruxes it makes sense that they are obscure because it makes sense that many people would be deliberately trying to suppress the information. However, despite that it was only Dumbledore who removed all mentions of horcruxes from the Hogwarts library, and there are even references to the concept in Beedle's stories so the information blackout is far from perfect.

However, for leglismency the exact opposite is true because the idea of someone tearing confidential information from your mind without you ever knowing is fucking terrifying and it's far better to learn to defend yourself than to rely on the fact that probably only a few of your enemies know leglismency.

Do you really think it makes sense that Dumbledore, leading a secret resistance against Voldemort (who he knows is a leglismens), would not warn his followers that all their members and secret hideouts and plans can become compromised at a moment's notice without anyone realizing if anyone knowing them encounters Voldemort? And you know, maybe train his inner circle to at least recognize an intrusion even if they won't be able to fight it.

Or that Voldemort wouldn't tell his followers that Dumbledore can do the same?

Or that in the entire history of the ministry not a single ministry worker or unspeakable ever knew about the art and realized how much of a risk it poses to the department of mysteries and the entire government in general?

Considering how Dumbledore expects Harry to learn Occlumancy in just a few months it can't be that hard to learn and it just makes much more sense to tell people about it, so they can learn to shield their minds, than to just idly hope no one bad ever learns anything important.

You are missing the most important thing. Nobody knows about it. And that's the way it should be. If someone learns there's a method to defend against mind reading, naturally he will research it as well. The less people know about occulmency, the less people know about Legilimency.

#+end_quote

Well, someone knew enough about it to write a fucking book about it. And we know about at least three different people who learned about and then mastered both Occlumency and Legilimency probably independently of each other so it can't be that well hidden of a secret.

#+begin_quote
  And that's the way it should be. If someone learns there's a method to defend against mind reading, naturally he will research it as well. The less people know about occulmency, the less people know about Legilimency.
#+end_quote

No because even a single person capable of untold damage using legilimency if no one knows to watch out for or defend against it.

If no one in the ministry knew Occlumency, a single Legilismens could topple and take over Fudge's entire government in a matter of months just by digging out the right secrets from the right people and using or revealing them at the right time.

Keeping the art a complete secret would eventually almost definitely end in total disaster. It would be much smarter to just break the power of Legilimency by just teaching everyone how to defend themselves enough to at least recognize an intrusion.

If everyone knows Occulumency that wouldn't work. Either Legilimens would train himself to be stronger or would have already be prepared to stun you if you do anything like break your eye contact. Besides, say you do manage it. You'd be punished for assault. And not everyone is going to even be able to recognize an intrusion if the legilimency user is good at what he does. There was a similar debate here around a few years back about Horcruxes. OP argued that telling everybody about them is a good idea because people would know how to destroy them. Everybody else argued that that would only increase the number of 'immortal' wizards seeking power. And what good is the knowledge how to destroy them if you can't even find them?

Society gathers baggage over the years. To those inside the society, a short bow is something you do in greeting dozens of times per day. Or maybe they tilt their head upwards when they see a friend and downwards when they see an acquaintance. The normal things in society can be absolutely pointless yet still hold value. As you pointed out, left-handed people exist, but /social norms make no sense/ therefore it doesn't matter. Wizarding culture seems extremely far removed from modern culture as we are from the 18th century. It isn't realistic for such a culture to not have odd ideas like avoiding eyesight.

It is my opinion that the more illogical the norm, the more realistic it becomes. Like an old shirt. The little details such as stain drops from coffee or small rip at the bottom make it look more well-loved than a brand new T-shirt with two or three massive rips across it.

As a side note, I would expect the eye contact to be more about the formality of the setting as I hinted towards. Lucius Malfoy talking to another noble family rather than Joe talking to Dorphy about the turnips this season. Even if the ability is rare, the intent and meaning prevails.

Legilimency may be unheard of to most, but Narcissa taught Draco occlumency as stated by Snape in the 6th book. What Snape says implies this is a recent occurrence, and we also can gather from Snape that it takes legilimency to quickly learn as seen when he attempted to teach Harry. This at least shows that it is prevalent enough for 1) A non patriarch of a family to know and 2) common enough that the training for occlumency seems known. This is ignoring the possibility that Narcissa herself was a legilmens and was at least proficient enough to train Draco to defend himself from Snape /with the intent of him being able to defend himself from the Dark Lord/.
