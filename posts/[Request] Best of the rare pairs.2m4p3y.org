I'm looking for your best recommendations for your favorite rare pair fics. Especially and Bill/Remus (all that wolf mentor angst -- but really any Bill stories), Neville/Draco...Basically anything, doesn't matter if it's slash or not. Suggest 'em here! Thanks y'all!!


** A Black Family Comedy was a decent fic. I think that Bellatrix/Remus counts as odd and it is as the title suggests, a Comedy.

***** Specifically the whole subplot about Bella and Remus that Sirius starts as a joke.

And of course the Remus as Tonk's adoptive father finding out about Canon Remus's relationship with her...

** [[/u/__Pers]] is known for weird pairings that somehow work. For instance:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][A Mother-In-Law's Love]], the quintessential Harry/Molly W. Soul Bond fic.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7165521/1/Don-t-Disrespect-the-Queen][Don't Disrespect the Queen]], his Harry Potter/Highlander (first movie) crossover, manages to make Harry/Helena Ravenclaw a thing.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/6/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Two-Thirds Blood Prince]] manages a Harry/Eileen Prince (as well as a Snape/Lily) pairing through the wonders of time travel. (Yes, each is the other's father.)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games][Number Games]] is awesome. A short(ish) Ron/Padma story.

I read a Snape/Sinistra one which was rather awesome (post war, they meet in Tokyo or something), but I can't find it.

** If you want Neville/Draco, then you want [[http://lop.shoesforindustry.net/][Lust Over Pendle]] and all the related stories. Enjoy.

**** I was unfamiliar with Mist Over Pendle, but some wikipedia research and skimming of [[http://robertneill.info/][robertneill.info]] suggests that some of the fanfic stories are perhaps inspired by the style.

From the website: "Neill's work is based on detailed research in original sources as to the periods in which he set his stories -- frequently in periods of upheaval, or the aftermath of upheaval -- when people are trying to build their lives under the shadow of events that threaten peace, in one manner or another."

And now I have some books to find and read - thanks!

** as to not post without any sort of linkage... i liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2750775/1/The-Code][the code]] series all right. a bit rough (seriously, do you need to tell me how much of a genius draco is over and over?) but had a nice bill and the premise was good. pairing-less but bill as mentor. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3848378/1/Untold-Weasley-Tales][untold weasley tales]] was a pretty good generic bill weasley story as well.

** I haven't read it in a few years, but I remember reading Minisnoo's [[https://31.media.tumblr.com/7a72644ab4e68cbb92e2b188192bd98a/tumblr_inline_nds955OlUF1ss4nfu.jp][Finding Himself]] and loving it. I've read it twice, I do believe.

It's Hermione/Cedric, where Cedric didn't die in the tournament, and there's a sequel.
