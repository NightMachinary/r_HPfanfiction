#+TITLE: [STORY IDEA] Male Potterhead gets transported into the world of Harry Potter in his eleven-year-old body. The twist, the year is not 1991, like one would expect, or even 1971. No, the year appeared to be 1892, the year Albus Dumbledore and Elphias Doge would start their first year at Hogwarts.

The idea is that a gay Potterhead is transported in 1892 with their full and extensive knowledge about the world of Harry Potter and attend Hogwarts with both Albus Dumbledore and Elphias Doge. I say gay because ideally the love interest becomes Albus himself around their N.E.W.T. years. The main plot wouldn't be the possible romance between our MC and Albus (although it could be a subplot) but our MC trying to Change history, both wizarding and Muggle.

The first changes would be stealing the Elder wand from Gregorovitch before Grindelwald does it which should be around 1899. Once acquiring the wand, the objective would probably of killing Gellert since I doubt our MC would be able to convince a perfect stranger from not going at war with the world and breaking the Statute of Secrecy, too many chances of it backfiring. He would also need to make sure Albus and Gellert never meet, too many bad things come from this, perhaps by arranging the world tour right after graduation or even inviting Albus and Elphias at his home instead of Godric's Hollow if he didn't appear in a complete shit hole or an orphanage.

Jumping to 1914, we have a hopefully still alive Arianna or at least died by 'natural' cause and not potentially at the hand of one of her brothers in a fight started by them and Albus and Aberforth having a better relation than in canon (and Albus without a broken nose). The MC would probably kill or stop Gavrilo Princip from assassinating Archduke Franz Ferdinand, but ultimately only delate the Great War. As only a literal savant historian could possibly realistically prevent the Great War, it's simply not possible for a young adult who only lived seventeen years in 21st century to prevent the starting moment of the 20th century. The Treaty of Versailles also couldn't be directly affected by MC since nothing short of First Wizarding War Voldemort could manipulate so much people by themselves.

WW2 would also happen but wouldn't be known as Grindelwald's War by the wizarding world unless MC chickens out of killing Gellert or simply really wants that position as Supreme Mugwump and Chief Warlock and having an Order of Merlin First Class and a Chocolate Frog at his name, which I completely understand. They would totally prevent the Holocaust, though, with Albus or no, and maybe get a Muggle and/or wizarding prize for it. I would make MC adopt Tom Riddle Jr shortly after his birth so as to prevent the existence of Lord Voldemort and the Knights of Walpurgis. Honestly, it'd be a fun read to have Tom raised at Hogwarts by two gay dads, one of them being Albus Dumbledore. I'd have MC either teach History of Magic so Binns doesn't get to cause every British witch and wizard to not know history and repeat the errors of the past or Defence so you have one less teacher to invent from scratch except for the name.

With the Voldemort problem having been completely erased, MC wouldn't need to steal Hufflepuff's Cup or Slytherin's Locket, but he would still go track Ravenclaw's Diadem and the Gaunt Ring/Resurrection Stone and study them. Just imagine MC giving the Resurrection Stone to Albus as a wedding ring or as an anniversary present. They never would have the full set, but at least they would have two out of three.

Finally, after a long and happy life full of adventure and research and teaching, Albus and MC would happily die of old age while their adoptive son, Tom Albus (MC's name) Dumbledore-(MC's surname) leads wizarding Britain as the longest serving Minister for Magic. What do you think? Does it seem just a bit interesting or is it complete garbage? Anyone is welcome to write a full-fledged story about this, I'm already busy writing one.

*** Unfortunately, no. This was an idea that popped into my brain at the time because everyone seems to only go for the small picture when doing self-inserts and OCs from the real-world stories.
