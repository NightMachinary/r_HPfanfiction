I read a fic some months ago where Voldemort ended up in *space*, so he would be frozen and immortal forever. That's a pretty tough end for Voldie haha. So, what's the worst end that Voldemort you've read?


** I remember a time travel fic called Wind Shear where Harry trapped Voldemort in a piece of quartz and left it in the ceiling of the cave from Half Blood Prince.

It is common in fanon, but that's never mentioned. Outside canon, Rowling stated (iirc in an interview) that transfiguration /is/ permanent.

** I found that to be one if the dumber ends of Voldemort. Author put Voldemort on the moon with all his Horcruxes, the elder wand and a portal to the earth. Stopped reading shortly after that, but that's just asking the universe for everything to go wrong.

No fanfic jump to my mind, but I'm a fan of having Voldemort kissed. It's a method that is slow enough to cause him terror and gets the job done neatly.

** Voldie never kills the Potters because James realizes he can cast the Cruciatus faster than Voldie can cast Avada Kedvra because it's a shorter incantation, and right in that moment he has enough hate for it to work. This gives Sirius time to arrive (who rushed there as soon as he realized he knows where the Potters live). Sirius then helps James cut off all of Voldie's limbs, so he's an immortal limbless torso. linkffn(13088160)

I read a Dark!Harry fic once where he transfigured Voldie into doll-size and kept him petrified in a bucket that was down inside a well. Being immortal, Voldie can't die, but that doesn't mean it's comfortable for him to feel like he's drowning. Every now and then he hauls him up talk to him and see if he's changed his attitude. I don't remember what this story is, and that's not technically the "end" of Voldemort, but I can't say the guy didn't deserve it.

** Huh, I'm currently reading a fic that has Harry planning to do just that. Pretty sure it's the same one.

Generally speaking, it's hard to find an ending that's worse then canon, in my opinion at least. However, some honorable mentions:

- Some fics have Harry join Voldemort, build up his status in the dark side and suddenly turn against him in the last chapter.

- I once read a fic where Harry had extensive, well-written training, building of alliances and forces, only to kill Voldemort with an expelliarmus as he did in canon.

- A fic, I believe it was linkffn(Earl of the north), had Harry pull out a fucking handgun out of nowhere and shoot Voldemort

During this time they discover and alternate dimension that allows the to essentially remove themselves from reality, walk through an area, then return to reality at the spot they walked to. They develop magical explosives, create new spells, they get fucking obsidian wands with a dementor's arm as their cores. How do they finally stop Voldemort? They enter his base, clearing out the mooks and setting off explosives, until finally reaching Voldemort. He's on his throne, sneering down at them. Words are exchange, then Voldemort casts his favorite spell. Harry manages to dodge, then he returns fire. With a diffindo... an early year charm that lets you cut fabric... and cuts off Voldemort's head instantly...

****** I get ya. Recently finished reading linkffn(Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe), an Avengers crossover with similar issues. It's 500k words of Harry building amazing technology and weaponry with Tony Stark and cultivating alliances all over the universe. It's really well written, from the characters personalities to the magic-science meshups (although it's probably the only piece of media that ever made me hate the Black Widow, mostly due to the author somehow managing to turn the world's best assassin into Daphne Greengrass). And yet, every single story arc ends in an extremely underwhelming manner that boils down to either Harry making friends with the villain, or literally just destroying them with one spell while profusely apologising more then a Canadian who just spilled a bag of milk. And when Thanos comes, guess what?! They just call in Captain Marvel, despite her literally not even being mentioned before that point in the whole fic, then drop a black hole on the enemy army while Harry burns the rest of it with Fiendfyre. Seriously, reading that fic felt like what I'd imagine edging feels like. Incredible build-up only to fall flat, repeated for the plot of every single MCU movie.

** Methods of Rationality is a controversial story to mention on here and I dread what the results of this mention are going to be, but the end Voldemort meets is pretty existentially-horrifying. Spoilers for obvious reasons.

He couldn't actually be /killed/ because he'd made so many random things into Horcruxes that there's no way to get them all.\\
Instead, he gets Obliviated of nearly all his memories, and then the shell-of-a-man that's left is Transfigured into jewelry (using the Philosopher's Stone to overcome the in-story limitation that Transfiguration isn't permanent).

linkffn(5782108) for the maybe one person who hasn't read it yet and hasn't been scared off by the fic's reputation on this subreddit.
