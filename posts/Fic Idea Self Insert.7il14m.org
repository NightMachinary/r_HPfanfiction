So I've read a few self inserts, they're okay, nothing amazing but nothing bad. But I thought about it and wondered if maybe they weren't that interesting because of the person that you were self inserted into.

You normally get characters like Severus Snape, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger or whatever being self inserted. But what if the character you were self inserted to was a bad guy? Or a person that wasn't very well liked.

I give you my idea, a self insert of someing becoming Dolores Umbridge. Just think about it, especially if the self insert is done after the Dementors were already at Privet Drive, the self insert would have to deal with it as well as suddenly being in the body of a well hated character.

I just think it could be a cool idea, if anyone takes up the idea please let me know. I'd love to read it.


** Hmm, I wonder if anyone ever did a Umbridge self insert. I remember two Lockhart self insert, one of them never finished. I remember a Dudley one, but I was dissapointed because the Dudley self insert got to be magical and a non-magical character trying to help out Harry with only future-vision/book-knowledge would have been so much more interesting.

Let me have a look if anybody ever did an Umbridge self insert.

There is at least one:

It looks like this one starts well before the point you would like to start at, though.

  Ending up in the Harry Potter world sounds cool right? Not really when one ends up as Dolores Umbridge and has to figure out how to change things without being found out. A mentor fic.

***** Read the first couple of chapters, seem to be going a little too fast; plus the author is purposely spelling Dolores' name wrong, the fact that he/she even said that they were going to spell it differently just kind of takes me out of the story a little bit. I mean it's not bad, but maybe not quite what I'm looking for.

** My favorite Harry Potter SI is inserted into Crabbe's sister. Sadly it hasn't updated in a while. Called Scourgify.

There's also one where it's Draco's sister that seemed interesting but also hasn't updated for a while, forget the name of it.

** This is a very good idea that I would love to read! :) Yes I would love /rare self inserts/ like Umbridge or Quirrell or Peter Pettigrew or Shacklebolt or Seamus Finnigan or Dudley Dursley! :) It would be so interesting to see how they would maybe change or fix canon and save the world without being around the characters that everything important happens to. :) They would maybe have to get in close with the Order or something to be close enough to make changes.

** I think Umbrige would be overpowered. The SI could literally order dementors to kiss all the death eaters and they would have no way to defend themselves because death eaters except Snape cant use the patronus charm. With the Ministry she could acess all the horcruxes.

**** word of god, Rowling said that in an interview.

#+begin_quote
  Samantha: Was snape the only death eater who could produce a full patronus

  J.K. Rowling: Yes, because a Patronus is used against things that the Death Eaters generally generate, or fight alongside. They would not need Patronuses.

***** I hate how she answers questions. I take this to mean that the answer is really, “They've never bothered to learn it because it's only known purpose is to hold back an adversary which they're allied with.”

Which, honestly, is a poor reason to not even attempt to learn it.

** Self inserts typically have several huge problems, especially if you are inserting yourself into a cannon characters brain.

First, I would recommend against just becoming someone already in the HP universe. You are probably not as interesting or beloved as whomever you take over. It might be passable if you become background Hufflepuff #107, but even then you have the problem that people have a lot of fanon surrounding those characters and them being you will mess with peoples heads.

Second, people typically want to do self inserts so they have the power fantasy of living through Hogwarts and experiencing all the events that come with it. You want to live through the troll, the mirror, the chamber, the whomping willow, the tournament the graveyard ect ect. This is quite frankly boring to read. Your SI should drastically and dramatically alter the world just by being there, forget acting on your detail knowledge of events. Say you really love Hermione, and become her BFF in the first year. Instead of going to the lav on Halloween, she finds you. Then she never becomes friends with Harry and Ron, because she thinks they're dunder heads and they never act bravely to save her. That's only a minor example, but basically six months after your SI shows up if it still follow cannon closely you're doing a crap job.

The last problem I'll talk about is that SI's need a reason to exist other than a power fantasy or escapism. Why, exactly, is your character in the world? Is there some message or important story you wish to convey? Avoid giving your SI super awesome magical powers. If anything, this should be a terrifying and disturbing experience for them, unless they are somewhat mentally ill and are that dead set and seeing everything they know and love vanish into mist. Have your SI really explore some aspect of the world outside of the narrow confines of the book. Think about what themes and experiences you want to convey so that your readers are invested in the story.

Now, after all that, I'll say that I have written an SI, and while it's still early days I could very well be falling into the very pitfalls I mentioned, so take what I said with a grain of salt. And remember, at the end of the day, what really matters is if you had fun with it. Some people may not like what you write, but as long as you enjoy the journey the reviews don't matter.
