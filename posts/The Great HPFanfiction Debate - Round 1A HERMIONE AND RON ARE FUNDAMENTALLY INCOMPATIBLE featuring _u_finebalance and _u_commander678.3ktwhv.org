** Considering that we're evaluating fictional characters, the domain of the question of Ron and Hermione's 'fundamental incompatibility' cannot merely be limited to exacting textual evidence, but must also include how people perceive and construct these two characters, thus allowing for the influence of the movies, of various fandom tends and tropes and so on.

And once you've widened the sphere of your inquiry, the reasons for this incompatibility become pretty evident: Hermione is, despite her faults and often Mary-Sue-like characteristics, a character many of us can and do aspire to; Ron, however, is not. In real life, such personalities may become romantically-inclined - there is no shortage of Type-A & B spouses after all - but the HP world is one of dramatic battles and power struggles, and in the context of such, a mostly average bloke like Ron has a much smaller part to play than the other two leads.

The text, and definitely the movies, support this (albeit sketchily sometimes): while in the glossed-over everyday life at Hogwarts Ron may have been the more agreeable of the two, Hermione has, far more than Ron, contributed and assisted Harry in his quests. She has, overall, played a far more proactive role, either via her knowledge, her spellwork, her trust in Harry, etc - in the HP world. (That is not to say Ron doesn't have his pros: camaraderie, sports, family etc are all things Ron brings to the table.)

This enormous difference - between an active Hermione and a reactive Ron - creates the fundamental incompatibility. This is why their pairing seems as if Hermione is inexplicably settling on Ron - a fact that Rowling attests to, saying that the R/Hr pairing is a holdover from an earlier stage and lacks "credibility"(1)

And honestly, Ron doesn't seem to have grown much beyond the whole “emotional range of a teaspoon” assessment back in book 4: in book 7, he once again abandons them, and in the epilogue it's shows that it's taken him 19 years to get a muggle licence -- something you can be sure Hermione's been pestering him a long time for. And even that has been half-arsed because he had to assault the examiner.

Ron's a fine secondary character that has been done a huge disserve by being paired with somebody like Hermione -- their destructive resonance dims both their good qualities, and highlights and exacerbates their faults.

*** I have two major concerns I have with your argument. First you assume that Hermione is "too good" for Ron. Then you totally dismiss Ron as a valuable member of the trio. This is where this argument falls apart if you take the canon as books before movies. I agree that movie Ron isn't as valuable and a good match for Hermione, but book Ron is. But still even after you take that into consideration they still work as a couple.

First lets take Hermione is too good for Ron. Hermione is no perfect catch herself. She is bossy, nosy, and shows no interest in anyone academically inclined as she is. She pines after Lockhart because of his looks and accomplishments (normal school girl crush). Goes out on a date with Bulgarian Bon-Bon Viktor Krum (who only achievement is Quidditch and could be said is the worse of the Tri-Wizard competitors. And specifically goes out with Cormac McClaggen just to get back at Ron. She is also at fault for never telling Ron her feelings, assuming that he should be the one to make the first move. (Which he does in the end). So Hermione, while an amazing academic and a good witch. She isn't the be all end all perfect Mary Sue people make her out to be. Ron completes her and brings her back down to earth. Makes her realize that there are other things out there than academics.

Ron does grow as a character throughout the books. While he may be a typical teenage boy and make mistakes with a relationship he eventually makes up for it. Ron is a very insecure character because he is the youngest of a very successful family. That shows through when the Horcrux plays with his emotions. Its canon that the Horcrux will do enhance any emotion that it can manipulate. With Ron that is feeling that he isn't good enough for Hermione and that she should be with Harry. That is why he leaves. He is trying to do the noble thing and get out of their way. He feels like an anchor. BUT he comes back. He is a bigger man than that and comes back. He doesn't sit and be all angsty like Harry. He recognizes that he made a mistake and does everything he can to fix it.

Book Ron and Hermione belong together. If James Potter can be an asshole for so many years and be rejected by Lily. Ron can win Hermione's heart.

**** Your accounting of Hermione's faults is not at all convincing: adult witches (and their profs) were enthralled with Lockhart too, and it's silly to assert that Ron's potential invite should have taken precedence over Krum's. You're setting up stawmen by claiming that I've made Hermione a perfect Mary-Sue, while dismissing Ron, when I've done neither.

Regardless of their more irritating personal attributes - many of which have rather ambiguous textual support - what I'm claiming here is this: this world of "dramatic battles and power struggles" exacerbates the enormous differences in temperament and opinion between a proactive Hermione - who's spells and knowledge essentially make book 7 possible - and a, relatively, reactive Ron. Consequently, Ron fails certain prerequisites that I feel that a romantic interest of such a primary character should have in the later HP setting.

Let me give a concrete example before moving on to the meta-level of the discussion: one of the reasons why certain Harry Slytherin romances are engaging is because both Harry and Daphne/Tracy/etc are working towards a similar goal, just in different (brashness vs deviousness, etc) ways. This makes them clash in arguments that have thematic & moral consequences. Ron and Hermione's clashes, in comparison, are merely a tedious result of differing personalities.

Tedious because they have limited weight and importance to the overarching plot. You've argued and implied that Ron's laid-back character often gets her to relax, calm down and have fun, but there is actually little textual evidence of that. More often than not, when he skivvies of work, he's engaging in activities that Hermione doesn't quite enjoy, and rarely (if ever) do we see her actively participating. And it's not really like she's any more laid back in book 5 than she is in book 1, suggesting that he's not quite had much influence upon her. What then is his function?

Here's where Ron becomes a romantic non-contender for me, personally. He does not offer her much support. He is not working in opposition to her in any real way-- which is something that can create fiery romances. While they share a lot of goals in book 7, they are more comrades on a quest than anything. Aside from Ron's jealousies, and Hermione's pinning, which Rowling herself has stated was not credible, there is nothing that really seems to deepen their romantic relationship. He abandons them in a fit of anger, and the only reason he's able to return is because Dumbledore had somehow anticipated that he'd have the need to much more than Hermione. Growth is all well and good, but the trust which he repeatedly breaks should not have been mended so easily.

To writ, Ron's a perfectly fine character -- more rounded and human in many ways than the rest of the trio. But what he's not is a romantic partner for Hermione: he's just not interesting enough to be worth reading in such a role.

An enormous part of being an elite players - at least in the muggle world - is memorizing the openings & endgame, which is tedious and def. time consuming. We don't see Ron do any of that, though that is possibly more because of Rowling's ignorance. (Kinda like how to show a player is elite, he or she somehow defeats their adequate opponent in 10-12 moves.)

** Question for both [[/u/finebalance]] and [[/u/commander678]].

Which canon character would you put Hermione in a long term relationship with, if not Ron?

I disagree with Ron being suitable because his good traits aren't really things that Hermione indicates a need for. Without his closeness to Harry I see Hermione only being an acquaintance of his. If the only connection was physical attraction I don't see them lasting beyond the first few years in a relationship.

Harry seems a better match to me, certainly needs fewer personality changes to be more like Hermione. Although I am not sure if that would be good or bad, the differences they hold onto could strengthen what they share.

This is [[/r/HPfanfiction]] so I will just mention a popular fanfic choice. Draco Malfoy. Nothing against people that write fics placing him in the spotlight but I don't believe he is redeemable enough to pair with any non O.C.

** In terms of Ron and Hermione being “fundamentally incompatible” is just laughable. The only people who could think they aren't a good couple are people who either don't like Ron as a character or who only watched the movies. In understanding why their relationship works, you have to know the characters themselves.

Hermione is a Type-A personality; someone who is driven, rigidly organized and ambitious. Readers can see this through-out the books. She always has a study plan, to the point of buying other study aides as gifts. She memorized the books before her first year, and she tried to free house elves in just her fourth year.

Ron however is almost a perfect example of a Type-B personality who eschews stress for fun and tries to minimize stress. He shows these characteristics by skiving off homework till the last minute and trying to play chess and talk about Quidditch instead of studying. Hermione doesn't love him because of this but loves him in spite of these traits.

Hermione stakes her claim in Ron early by going to Hogsmeade together without Harry in the third book and they have an enjoyable time. In The Chamber of Secrets readers can tell that Hermione has had feelings for Ron since her petrification because she “Hugs Harry but awkwardly shakes hands with Ron.” Hermione is also jealous when Ron asks Fleur out to the ball but only asks her out when he is desperate. She obviously wanted him to ask her and is upset not only because of his rash words but because she is going with someone who is not her first choice. During Order of the Phoenix Hermione doesn't show much interest but she still is willing to cheat on homework for Ron's benefit. Half Blood Prince is the book where she starts to show that she can be vindictive and goes out on a date with Cormac McClaggen to upset Ron after he acts like a prat. She also goes against her core of a character to help Ron make the Quidditch team. Her relationship with Ron obviously culminates in the last book where Ron makes a grand gesture with the house elves and Hermione and Ron finally share their first of many kisses. But their relationship peaked out from their petty coats earlier in the book with their closeness in Grimmauld Place and how upset she was when he left during their hunt.

Ron, well Ron is a typical boy. He is quite thick when it comes to relationships and doesn't see the tree in spite of the forest because he is a typical young male. He does show sparks of interest in Hermione at a young age such as being a jealous prat. He is jealous of Lockhart, Victor and just about anyone who shows any interest in Hermione. He pines after her during the Yule Ball and has a terrible time because of it. When she brings McClaggen to the Slug Club Christmas party he is upset and it's clear as day that he is sad that she would rather go to the part with McClaggen than him. During the Deathly Hallows he finally gets his foot out of his ass and shows Hermione the man he is. Without prompting and without trying to impress anyone he is the only one to think of the house elves. He wants to get them out of the castle and free not because Hermione wants him to but because it's the right thing to do. And that's at Ron's core. He tries to always do the right thing. It may be wrapped up in insecurity and he may make mistakes. But he always tries to do right by his friends. But he makes mistakes and that is human.

If you think this relationship is flawed, it is because you think that Ron is unlovable. Because I think that other than Molly and Arthur these two are quite possibly the best couple in the book. You have a girl who tries her best and doesn't know how to unwind and a guy who is fun loving and can show her a good time. Hermione is Ying and Ron is Yang but together they are complete.

Despite what yough-adult books prattle, jealously is hardly a positive attribute here. I mean, in real life, if you're friend who's never made any real romantic overture towards you were to get suddenly loudly and maybe even violently jealous when somebody else does - would you call that a healthy situation? Because I certainly wouldn't. And we know that he doesn't grow out of it - his impulsive decision to abandon them in the forest of dean would certainly have separated the trio had Dumbledore not had the foresight to give Ron what he needed to return. When a deus ex machina saves your relationship - and that relationship would certainly have been doomed had he not returned. So, when a deus ex machina from beyond the grave saves your relationship... you need to start questioning things.

I'm not trying to vilify Ron - he does have many good qualities. But Hermione, given her prominence in the story, her natural abilities and her drives needs, I feel, a different sort of partner rather than the undoubtedly brave slacker that Ron is. And, yet again, so does Rowling.

Oh, in regards to the Lily James comparison: whatever issues James had, he was intelligent and extremely motivated, quite unlike Ron (and Harry), despite having faced far fewer existential threats than Ron. So, if you're trying to compare the two couples, R/Hr don't come looking quite so good.

**** The crux of the debate is that they are "fundamentally" flawed as a couple. They just aren't, they can work as a couple. While Ron is lazy as a student he isn't a lazy person. He works hard a quidditch and other things.

You say that I interpret canon loosely but that is required. everyone sees and interprets actions differently. I see Ron as an insecure young boy who is trying to climb out of the shadow of having such a successful family. I see Hermione as a bookish know-it-all who only has a few friends in the world. Hermione isn't some goddess among women who is an unobtainable perfect 10. She has faults and Ron looks past them.
