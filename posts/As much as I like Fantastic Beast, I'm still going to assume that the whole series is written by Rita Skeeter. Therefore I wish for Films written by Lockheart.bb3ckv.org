I do love the New movies since it's more HP films but at the same time I hate it. I still think whole thing can be more. As well as the fact that now I'm a whole lot of confused with the timeline of the whole Potter series. So, I'm going to assume that it is written by Rita... Some facts are technically true but everything else is twisted for a sensational story. I'm treating the cursed child with the same head canon.

Therefore, I'm waiting for stories about Lockhart's books.

Marauding with monsters - someone fumbling around and finding out that simple spells can bused against a lot of monsters. A fantastic beast-esque story but less about dark lord creeping about but more about actual creatures in strange places like some muggle's backyard so they have to somehow get rid of it discreetly.

The Travel trilogy ( holiday with hags, voyages with vampires and wandering with werewolves) - a story about a village being saved by a werewolf by an ugly Armenian warlock , sea fairing vampires, and a hag that looks remarkably like Millicent Bulstrode.

Year with the yeti - because there's a yeti.

Gadding with gouls - a mimic type of zombie, chameleon ghoul. Occasionally flying or attack. ( It just bite and growl) but is just a xx beast so I think its probably a short. But imagine it being a horror suspense story, like it being affected by muggle toxic waste or in magic leyline making it like the mimics in prey.

Imagine a film noir like opening. Like some magical investigator hired to look into things more closely due to what happened to a close friend of the family. Then a series of flash back when peices of the story fall together. Figuring out the truth, handing it all to Albus for them to conclude that the bastard has too much reputation and money for "good lawyers". A Lucius like individual this the proof is circumstancial at best. It ends according to canon, That Dumbledore Encouraged Lockhart to teach DADA by baiting Harry's popularity in hopes of getting back for two of his friends who were victims.


** Dunno if I've been reading too much but that sounds a lot like the Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher. Wizard detective, half film noir, half fantasy. Worth a read if this sort of thing interests you

*** Not really the detective stuff. Heck I really added the last part as an afterthought... It's more of people WB wanted to add Dumbledore so I mentioned it. Like something familiar will make things more okay, which I believe is the biggest failing of Fantastic Beast. It tries to Hard to marry the series to HP by shoving a familiar character. Instead of the usual, It in the same world, let people speculate how it ties in.

Actually, I never liked Dumbledore in general. I prefer the world and culture and the parallels it has to our real world. I just think that part as after credits like marvel does.

**** Adding Dumbledore was definitely a grab for the fans of HP who want to see who he was when he was younger. And yeah world and culture are very fun to explore with. Things like the American revolution and even darker shit like colonialism and it's fall over the last 100-150 years would be really interesting to see paralleled in the wizarding world.

***** Yeah. I read the story of Ilvermory in Pottermore and wondered why it wasn't made into a movie instead. It has magic, love story adventure and furthermore a story of an abused girl who grew up into a hero. It was realeased after FB and I'm still wondering why not a good feminist story but realized that it's a colonized America and Isolt was stated to seven some tribes, so a white woman helping tribes of natives Americans would look bad so studios wouldn't want to be racist or something.

** Regarding the two Fantastic Beasts films, I think WB and JK Rowling went about it the wrong way. I mean, it's cool we're getting films that exist within the Wizarding World, but in my opinion, the Dumbledore/Grindelwald storyline should've been its own separate trilogy, and in between the release of the three films, do a standalone Fantastic Beasts film, and perhaps another film (that Rowling could create on her own) that further involves exploring the Wizarding World or aspects of it.

â€‹

I only saw the first Fantastic Beasts movie, and I didn't like it all that much. It felt like two different storylines Rowling forced into one. She tried to make up for it by showing the Obscurial when Jacob saw it in Newt's briefcase but the marriage of it and Newt's escaped creatures wasn't harmonious. And then there's everything in Crimes of Grindelwald that mucked up canon even more after The Cursed Child debacle. It'll be interesting to see what the audience reception is of the third Fantastic Beasts movie. Since the second film is a hard-sell, I wonder what the turnout will be for Fantastic Beasts 3.

*** True.. I was expecting exploratory of the world or mythos. But I do like the added beast and creatures, I just think they should have cut the Grindelwald part because he's not plot relevant. Like any character fits... In fact you can remove him freely and he obscurial the beasts and the oppressive nature of Salem people work well.. there's absolutely no need for an overt antagonist.

It's not a typical heroes journey. Infact it is the opposite of the prophesied journey of Harry. But they kinda semi forced it into a Harry mold when Newt clearly embodies a different view on masculinity. The emphasis is not heroism and bravery but empathy and fear. It's a good film to analyse but it feels that it tries too hard. Hence the Rite Skeeter view.

Like the premise of magical beast are free they have to get it. They encounter an obscurial along he way, Newt attempts to save the person since he failed to save the girl. It's a good contrast of the light side and the dark side of creatures and the idea that are they also beasts to be put down. The fact that newt "failed" to save the obscurial makes the story tragic and still meaningful without the Grindelwald sub plot. It all stands on it's own

gellert and the rest are unnecessary. I feel they tried to do so much that they failed to deliver. If they cut out the Grindelwald plot line, they could have gone to character development more. They could have reference the events in the next film which gives a kinda plot twist, it was Grindelwald's plan all along, you foiled thus you made a great enemy. If they really wanna tie it in.
