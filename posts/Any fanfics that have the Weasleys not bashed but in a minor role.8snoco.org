Just curious as to if there are any fics out there that don't bash the Weasley but have them in a minor or non existent role, like where Harry is friends with other characters instead of Ron. I saw a Fanfiction community called No Hermione Allowed that did something similar but with Hermione and wanted to know if there were any for other characters.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** I'd throw in my own "No longer alone", which has a strained friendship with Ron at the beginning because he and Hermione were at each other's throats all throughout year three and Harry got tired of the constant fighting. They patch things up for a while but the friendship will eventually fall apart over Harry becoming a Triwizard champion. There is one scene where a little shade is thrown at Molly however.

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius has ever made.

** AFAIR these don't have Ron Bashing.

linkffn(11669575, 5782108)

This one might have mild Ron Bashing considering it's based around Triwaizard tournament where even in canon Ron and harry had a split.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
