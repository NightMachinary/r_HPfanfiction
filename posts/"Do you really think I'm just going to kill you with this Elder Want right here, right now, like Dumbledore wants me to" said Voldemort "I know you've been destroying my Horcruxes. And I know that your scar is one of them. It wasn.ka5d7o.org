And I know that your scar is one of them. It wasn't an accident that you survived when your parents didn't."

**** Now we just have to think up dozens of plots to take out his anger on wizarding britan via mildly annoying scheme blown vastly out of proportion, only to be stopped by his new nemesis, Jerry the Rat, (Pettigrew with an axe to grind).

How reedemed hero balance saving the world from petty inconveniences, whilst keeping his secret identity away from his overbearing lord? Find out next week, the an all new episode of: "Tom and Jerry!"

***** Now imagine a the relationship between Vanessa and Doofensmirtz translated to Pettigrew and Voldem0rt respectivly, Voldy, the overbearing father figure interested in taking part in his defacto sons life, while Pettigrew is silently sweating bullets as Voldy has just come within seconds of finding him out. Also we get to see Pettigrew in a 1970s fedora.

** I remember reading a fic somewhere where Voldemort figures this out, and instead of the long, costly battle for Hogwarts he brings down the wards then uses an item of his own design: A boulder the size of van that is essentially a giant-ass stunning spell. Harry wakes up in an unknown location, with 'keep him in' magic backed up by the elder wand. LV's plan is something about keeping HP too happy to break out, throws witches at him, basically every female friend he has.

Later, LV uses the Elder Wand to Fidelius 'Harry Potter is the boy-who-lived.' I think he pretty much wins at that point, cause Prophecy says only they can kill each other, and Harry is too busy being a teenage male for the first time in his life.

** There's a really interesting WIP fic where LV figures out HP is a horcrux and does indeed use the Draught of the Living Death on him. HP wakes up centuries later in a world ruled by LV. It's eventually supposed to be HP/LV pairing but so far it's really subtle. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18851794/chapters/44742046]]
