Hello there! I've been looking all over for a fanfic that I read some time ago but can't remember enough to find it myself!

Harry, and several of his friends, create a new school and all leave Hogwarts. I'm pretty sure several teachers left to teach at this school too? - Mascot is dire wolves - School logo is black direwolf with yellow moon in background I think? - There ends up being two uniform designs, one for the school itself showing house colors. The other one is for out in public that is white with black trim I believe. - Harry and friends design the courses offered, the uniforms, and so on. - This school becomes an elite school that is huge on privacy and is known to be the best of the best. - This school ends up also having 4 houses, like Hogwarts, but the houses are named differently and have different values and colors. (One is colored white and gold and is for leaders?) - Harry hires goblin to build this school, I recall the new school description being stunning! One of the houses has a glass floor and fire underneath?

If anyone knows this story, I would be ecstatic! I've spent ages looking and just can't find it. Thank you!!

  A mysterious green inked letter banished Harry from his cupboard. But does taking the boy out of the cupboard also mean that you've taken the cupboard out of the boy? A first year fic.
