I know the Ministry is incompetent and all that. But this was more of a question of how there just didn't seem to be anyone in the Ministry that night, and that seemingly you could just apparate/floo there anytime you wanted.

I had this idea that Death Eaters were actually there the whole time (say hiding with disillusionment charms or the like) and had imperiused/knocked out/killed anyone at the Ministry that night. So the group would be able to reach the prophecy unhindered and unaware, and then they could surround them and take the prophecy. But all of that is not really canon, or if it is I cannot remember it ever being mentioned.

So my question regarding this is how was it that they could get through the ministry so easily? Even if they didn't believe the Death Eaters were back, theft and political bribery seems enough of a reason to have /some/ protection for the Ministry at night (or at all).


** Death Eaters got rid of anyone that would have gotten in the way.

*** I understand that. To be honest, it just strikes me as odd that they are able to infiltrate the Department of Mysteries so easily, when such a big point of the 5th book is that no one really knows what goes on there (except for other Unspeakables like Rookwood).

Additionally, I realized it would sort of make sense that there would not be anyone there to Harry and the group since they think Voldemort is there. But what about the Order guard who was supposed to be watching the Hall of Prophecy? Thats never mentioned. Maybe they stopped watching after Arthur got bitten, but Dumbledore doesn't seem to have been deterred by Podemore being sent to Azkaban either. Maybe they killed or removed them, but its harder to catch someone under an invisibility cloak.

** Well it's canon that it was a trap, so the idea that the death eaters would have opened the way for them is really very likely.

Alternatively, JKR just didn't consider that. It's a pretty common issue with the series.

** Fudge didn't seem to take security seriously.

Also, even Harry pointed out how eerily empty it seemed, iirc, so the DE's probably had something to do with it.

*** I get that. Personally, I live in an area like that: people leave their houses unlocked and nobody chains up any bikes and things like that. Stealing and serious crime just doesn't happen around here, and its in an area with more than 60k people. I sort of wonder if its that sort of mindset behind the Ministry at the time (what could go wrong, don't bother with security), or if its that security has genuinely /never/ been a thing for the Ministry.

Are there any forms of defenses on the Ministry building at all? If not, why didn't Voldemort stage his coup d'etat earlier than he did? One answer seems to be Dumbledore and/or preferring to operate in the shadows with hit-and-run tactics, but if he gained the Ministry quickly through alternative tactics (e.g. liberal use of the Imperius and legilimency) Voldemort could take the building and apply protective spells to stop apparition/portkey/floo travel. And, if you believe that gaining power over the Ministry grants new authority powers, this would give Voldemort an advantage over Dumbledore, who would need to operate exclusively from Hogwarts.

The biggest issue though with the whole thing is specifically /where/ in the Ministry they are going: the Department of Mysteries. This is supposed to be the Ministries top secret research facility that no one is allowed to know or really even talk about (although Dumbledore and the Order do seem to know quite a bit about it). The fact that there was no protection around this particular area is a gaping hole in the entire idea of the DoM. The only real protection seems to be in the Hall of Prophecy, and really that is only if someone attempts to remove a prophecy in the first place.
