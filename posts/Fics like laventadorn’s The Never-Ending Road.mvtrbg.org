I just finished the (unfinished) sequel and I NEED MORE. It can be any pairing with Snape, not necessarily Snarry, but I want something with beautiful prose and a slow burn romance with characters that aren't ridiculously OOC. Most importantly, it needs to be complete.


** I often see linkao3(Rapture by mia_ugly) recommended for beautiful prose but I haven't read it myself. I love linkao3(The Boy Who Died A Lot).

Also you might want to post on [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] too.

  Harry's always been known as The Boy Who Lived. Only Severus knows that this is a lie. (Or: a portrait of Severus Snape, in seven acts.)
