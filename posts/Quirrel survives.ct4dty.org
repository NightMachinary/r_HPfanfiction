After the fight in the Philosopher's stone chambers, instead of abandoning Quirrel, Voldemort takes Quirrel with him somehow. Quirrel recovers, and becomes a Death Eater of the likes of Lucius Malfoy / Bellatrix Lestrange.

i dunno i'd just like to see something where quirrel becomes and intimidating character. imo he had a lot of potential.


** Other possibility: Voldemort abandons Quirrel but Quirrel doesn't die for some reason (maybe Dumbledore stopped him and has some Phoenix tears on hand, he probably has a vial full in his pockets), gets interrogated by Dumbledore on what he knows about Voldemort, and Dumbledore spends the next year hunting down Voldemort's spirit in Albania while Harry and the team deal with the Heir of Slytherin at Hogwarts.
