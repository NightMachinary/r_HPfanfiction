*The Headmaster's Office, Hogwarts, 1981*

Minerva McGonagall daintily wiped her fingers clean with a tissue, before putting down the latest piece of parchment and reaching for the bowl of lemon drops.

While Albus was away, it was her job as Deputy Headmistress to take on all of the Headmaster's responsibilities. And, eyeing the bowl of lemon drops, she was quite determined to carry out /all/ of those responsibilities.

Before McGonagall could touch the bowl, however, the door burst open-

BOOM!

-and a purple-and-white blur shot into the room, crashing into a cupboard holding several books of ultra-obscure magical theory.

"/Shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit.../"

"Albus!" McGonagall snapped, "Language!"

Albus Dumbledore only shot a quick glance at McGonagall (/What on earth's gotten into him?/ she wondered) before he turned his attention back to his book collection, furiously rifling through them for an answer, any answer.

Her irritation at Dumbledore's vulgarities slipping away, Minerva slowly stood up and came over to look at the books Albus was pouring through.

"Albus, what's wrong?" she asked worriedly, "Did the Dursleys...?"

"YES! No! It's complicated!" Albus shut the cupboard without bothering to reshelf the books, before he ran over and opened a gratuitous treasure chest labelled 'Even More Ultra-Obscure Magical Theories', diving in headfirst and disappearing into its depths.

Minerva McGonagall blinked before she slowly made her way around and sat back down in the Headmaster's chair, waiting a few seconds before taking a large handful of lemon drops.

--------------

*Later*

"Albus, what's this about?" McGonagall asked again, as the exhausted looking headmaster collapsed on the softest couch in his office.

"I made a tremendous mess, Minnie..." he moaned, "I had a great idea but it went all wrong..."

"Yes, but /what happened/?" she stressed.

Albus Dumbledore raised his head to look at McGonagall, "The blood wards. They were supposed to protect Harry until he was 17. I tried to improve them to make him safer and make them last longer..."

Minerva tilted her head, "Did you accidentally cause them to collapse?"

Albus shook his head, "No, no...Harry is absolutely safe now. He couldn't be safer. Absolutely nothing can harm him now...from a certain point of view."

McGonagall narrowed her eyes, "And...what precisely does that mean, Albus?" she asked warningly.

"I froze him in time, Minerva! He's in temporal stasis! It's how the magic of the blood wards decided to protect him!"

Dumbledore laid back and covered his eyes with an arm; McGonagall waited for an explosion or meltdown of some sort, but it didn't come.

After a few seconds, Dumbledore raised his head to look at Minerva again.

"I didn't want this to happen...Harry was supposed to be safe, but...not this safe. I wanted to see him grow up, Minnie." he said mournfully.

Minerva McGonagall blinked, then..."How long will this stasis last?"

Albus waved a hand, "Until his Aunt dies, which might be four or five decades from now. She is, fortunately, not in stasis as well."

The aged headmaster chuckled despite himself, "I suppose that if there's one silver lining, its that the Dursleys will have no trouble caring for Harry now...and I suppose there's..." he hesitated.

McGonagall narrowed her eyes again, "What is it, Albus?"

Albus smiled a little, "Well...I wouldn't actually say it's a good thing, really...but I believe that the modified blood wards are having another effect on Mr. Potter...they might be altering his body while he's in stasis, making him healthier, improving his Wussels, augmenting his resistance to magic, that sort of thing..."

McGonagall rolled her eyes; /Only Albus would use 'Wussels' as a name for someone's magical core,/ she thought, before speaking out loud, "And how is that not a good thing?"

Dumbledore looked directly at her, "What happens when he comes out of stasis? A one-year-old child. Accidental magic. Except approximately fifteen-thousand times more. Most likely immune to suppressants, limiters, restraints, or most other magic."

McGonagall blinked, "So much for the Statute of Secrecy."

--------------

*50 years later*

The door to #4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging burst open, and a wheezing, scorching, thoroughly frazzled Dark Lord stumbled through.

"Stupid guards. Stupid Shacklebolt, kinky bastard living up to his name. Stupid Fenrir Greyback and flesh of the servant and his damn fleas. Stupid STUPID blood wards." Voldemort grumbled as he dusted himself off.

He bent over to scratch an itch on his bottom, before his wand shot up and pointed at the doddering Aunt Petunia, who had stopped in the middle of setting the table, "But I've finally found you! You and your damn Potter! And after I've gotten of you, I'll get rid of him! And then nothing will stop me, prophecies and blood protection be damned!"

Petunia Dursley just blinked owlishly, before slowly picking up a teapot and holding it up, "Cup of tea, Simmons?"

Voldemort sighed, "Of course the old biddy's gone bloody senile.../Ebulito!/"

The Dark Lord jabbed his wand, and Petunia's face went bright red and blotchy, before her entire head suddenly exploded off her shoulders in an eruption of bone and brain and boiling blood and other gooey things starting with B.

Voldemort winced, casting a brief cleaning charm on his robes, "It's no fun when they don't beg for their miserable little lives...now where is that Potter...?"

*5 minutes later:*

"A cardboard box under the bed?!" Voldemort said incredulously, staring at where his detection spell had pointed him to, "Not a shrine or a fancy tomb or even a space in the cupboard under the stairs, but...a box? What the heck, people."

Sighing, he opened up the box, looking down at the 51-year-old-and-still-a-baby Harry Potter.

Harry had been changed a lot by the blood wards while he was in stasis. His skin, rather than being peach-coloured like a normal human, was instead some kind of metallic gold. His little arms and legs had elongated, his eyes were big and blue and too large for his head, his ears were long and pointy, and the former scar on his head had well and truly vanished.

In short, he looked like a metal statue, created by a very rich artist, who had no idea of proper human proportions.

Voldemort looked over the tiny, giggling Harry Potter, taking in his new appearance, before he winced, "Ew."

The Dark Lord raised his wand again, "And now, to do myself - and by the looks of you, the rest of the world - a favor. Avada Kedavra!"

The green ray of light shot towards the baby Harry...and splashed against his golden skin, doing nothing whatsoever.

"Figures," Voldemort muttered, "It didn't work the first time either."

And then everything exploded.

--------------

Kingsley Shacklebolt, having recovered from his encounter with Voldemort and having donned another black latex catsuit, hurriedly Apparated back to Privet Drive, and stopped. The house at number 4 was in ruins, covered in rubble and...vines? And flowering blossoming trees?

Cautiously stepping through the destroyed front door, Kingsley held his wand at the ready, wondering what could have possibly happened.

"Goo."

He looked around. That was definitely the sound of a baby. But, Harry was supposed to still be in stasis...

Kingsley stumbled, before looking down. Underneath him, covered in vines, was the headless body of what looked to be an old woman.

/Petunia Dursley. And if she's dead, the blood wards.../ he thought slowly.

"Goo-ga?"

"Oh, shut up! Bloody Potters!"

Kingsley's eyes widened, and he rushed to what used to be a bedroom.

Bursting in, wand at the ready, he looked around; the entire place looked like a wetlands, with vines and trees and lilypads and a giant, grumpy-looking green frog with red eyes...

"What are you looking at, you old bastard?" the frog growled.

Kingsley stared at the frog, "V...Voldemort?"

"No freaking duh, twinkle-toes. Courtesy of your stupid bloody boy-who-lived." the frog answered before sticking out his tongue.

Kingsley ducked, narrowly missing having his eye taken out by the misanthropic frog's tongue, before he waved his wand, conjuring a small steel cage (with anti-tongue wards) around the amphibian before turning his attention to the source of the 'goo-ga's' and raising an eyebrow.

"Ugly little shit, ain't he?" Voldefrog piped up.

Kingsley's eyes flicked in Voldefrog's direction briefly, before he returned his attention to the baby Harry Potter; carefully pocketing his wand, he started to reach out with both hands to pick up the 1-year-old...

"Goo-ga!" There was a bright flash of light.

"What? What happened? Lemme see!" Voldefrog called.

When the light cleared, Kingsley looked around at the surroundings; nothing seemed changed...

"You look nice in a dress, Shacklebolt." Voldefrog helpfully pointed out.

Kingsley looked down; true to Voldefrog's word, his previous catsuit had been turned into a frilly pink muumuu, not unlike how Petunia Dursley was wearing a short time ago.

"Better than being a frog, I guess." he muttered under his breath; Voldefrog scowled, and began to swell up.

"Oh yeah? Hey, Potter, listen up!"

The Dark Amphibian let out a tremendous /ribbet/, loud enough to disturb the water surrounding his cage; Harry Potter's face scrunched up in fright.

Kingsley whipped out his wand again, pointing it at Voldefrog, "/Silencio!/"

But it was too late; baby Harry Potter had been startled by the noise, and there was another bright flash of light.

"Oh, /shit/."

*** Huh? No, this isn't a crackfic, it's a serious extended prompt (some might say 'first chapter already written for you') that looks at a possible scenario for a young Harry travelling forward in time rather than the HP fanfiction staple of an older Harry going back in time, as well as presenting a rationale for his having some kind of advantage in the future.

*** I suspect some people didn't get the memo that there's no such thing as a stupid question.

'Wussels', as in 'wizard/witch muscles', are something I came up with a little while ago as an alternative to the overused concept of magical cores. They're basically magical muscles, you flex them when you cast a spell, you can get tired after casting too much but then you're stronger later, et-cetera.

Although in this specific 'prompt', McGonagall comments on them just being another word for magical cores in her thoughts, in the sentence right after Dumbledore mentions them. Try Ctrl-F and searching for Wussels if you can't find it.
