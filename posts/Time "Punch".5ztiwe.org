"Severus, to what do I owe the pleasure of your visit" exclaimed Albus Dumbledore from behind his desk.

"Mr. Malfoy!" Snape bit out. "He has once again complained about someone punching him in the face. And once again he seems to think its Harry Potter!"

"Does he have any proof of this Severus?!" exclaimed Dumbledore

"No, but hes been getting punched for weeks on end now in various locations. In a class, in the hall, on the grounds, and he claims even while sleeping once!" Severus said as he paced the floor. "And yet he has seen no one each time. He says he simply is being hit by some /invisible/ force that feels like a fist. But no magic is seen."

"No magic?... how interesting" Albus mused.

"Perhaps it is a fist hidden under some sort of "/INVISIBILITY CLOAK/!" Snape roared.

"Severus, we have been over this. Harry Potter has had an alibi for at least a dozen of these instances over the past few weeks. He simply cant be the one punching Draco Malfoy."

"Well who else would wish to punch Mr. Malfoy in the face repeatedly Dumbledore, and be able to be invisible while doing so!" Severus raged.

"I don't know Severus... I just don't know" Albus said quietly while steepling his fingers, sitting back, and thinking.

Hermione giggled to herself as she turned the time turner once again, hidden within the borrowed invisibility cloak. Harry knew she had borrowed it for a while, but thought she was using it to study in the library undisturbed. What would he and Ron think if they knew she was using it for a more... nefarious purpose.

As she finished traveling back in time, she quickly hurried to the dungeon stairway. She knew Malfoy would climb out of it alone on his way to lunch. Once again she had an opportunity.

Ever since she had first hit him it had become almost an obsession for her. She knew it was wrong but it felt so right. And so she had devised a plan and for the last few weeks had been making Malfoy's life hell.

As he came into view she crept forward, and with a burst of speed, jumped forward and landed a solid punch to his face, knocking him on his butt. He never saw it coming of course.

Quickly turning and and ducking around the corner, she vacated the scene giggling quietly to herself. Her thoughts were soon on when she could next catch him with a solid punch in the face using the time turner and Harry's invisibility cloak.

It was going to be a rough year for Draco indeed.

"Three-thirds of the 7th years?" Albus asked, smiling slightly. "The Disillusionment Charm is part of the curriculum, after all, and young Mister Malfoy's attitude has made him quite unpopular with everyone who does not share his views."

*** I'm pretty sure three thirds is everyone, but then again that does sound like something Dumbledore would say.

*** That would have been amusing too. I am not a writer or Fan Fiction writer by any stretch, but this was just a funny idea I had (based around the idea of Hermione using the time turner to repeatedly punch Draco) based on a reddit thread that showed up in the Harry Potter subreddit containing [[https://i.redd.it/c72e2o36bkly.jpg]]

*** For a brief, shining instant, I thought that was where it would lead. It's funny as-is, but the image of Dumbledore being so dickish is hard to let go of.

** Hee. I've often thought about the discreet use of Time Turners to make very-hard-to-beat alibis.

Also, did I start a trend of custom Mini-Fic flairs or something? Not that I'm complaining, I made a beeline for this post as soon as I saw the flair.

*** Well I can honestly say I had never thought about the idea of a Mini-Fic before the "If Dobby worked smarter, not harder..." thread of yours. (still one of my all time favorite things I have read btw - anyone reading this if you have not read it go read it now [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5gzk1j/if_dobby_worked_smarter_not_harder/][here]])

I love time travel HP fics so I too often think about using a time turner or playing with time to change the HP world and have alibis. When I had this Hermione uses a time turner to repeatedly punch draco idea, I had several different ideas for how it could happen, and finally gave in to just posting one of them and utilizing the Mini-Fic tag/idea. :)
