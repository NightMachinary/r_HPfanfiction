a Fic where harry decides to leave the magical world?


** linkffn(1291535).

Probably one of the few Azkaban!Harry stories I've enjoyed so far. It's pretty well-written with great character development.

The story has some angst, but it's not overblown (unlike others of this genre).

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

** linkffn(2784825) Old Soldiers Never Die by Roschach's Blot It's a longish(94k) fiction that is well worth the read. It's not true Muggle!Harry but it's just shy. Some of the best OCs that I've ever read. Very well written and up to par on the Author's usual work.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8257400/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Power-of-Paranoia][Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia]]: The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5655156/1/The-Day-the-Magic-Died][The Day the Magic Died]]: Set during Book 7.
