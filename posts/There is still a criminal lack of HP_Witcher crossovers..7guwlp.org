[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3zu0nb/there_is_a_criminal_lack_of_witcherharry_potter/][Title is a reference to this.]]

But honestly, anyone have some good suggestions? I'll take Witcher fics in general, I guess. I really want a HP/Ciri fic that's finished, or at least gets to the good bits.

I've seen most of the stuff on ffn already, but don't worry about that- it's entirely possible I missed something, so go ahead and link me whatever you found decent.

I couldn't find anything on AO3, but it's sorting/filter system confuses me pretty bad.

*** I'm not sure yet- I've not been looking for long, but I've found a couple pretty promising ones.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12094498/1/When-We-Were-Invincible][When We Were Invincible]] sounds /fantastic/ purely off the summary and the title, but I've not even read the opening paragraph so I've little idea of the actual quality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12008618/1/A-Witcher-s-Tale][A Witcher's Tale]] also looks decent, though short, but that may just be because I expect it to scratch my OC(or xover character)/Ciri itch.

***** Awesome.

Does it link into the main Witcher stuff at any point? Do they meet Geralt/Ciri/Triss/Yen/whoever else?

****** No, not yet although there have been references to minor characters. Most of it so far has taken place on skellige

** I started one once that used the typical "OC takes Harry away from Dursley's at a young age and raises them without Dumbledore knowing" plotline. Except, it was a witcher taking Harry away to raise him as a witcher. It was an interesting story that I wish I had worked on more before abandoning it, though perhaps it would have been better served with me following the typical pattern of just throwing Harry into the witcher world.

  Having a deranged dark wizard after you is not too great. Having something you cannot quite explain after you in a strange world where the kindest fate is to find yourself on the wrong end of a sword makes that first thing seem like child's play. Geralt/Yennefer, Harry/? Rated M. Because there's no other way to write a Witcher story.

** I agree and sadly al lot of those that do exist "diminish" Harry and make him look incompetent (more so than canon IMHO because in canon he at least has magical ability and just doesn't do very much with it, so he's unrealized potential - but at least he had potential!) by praising Hermione (she's taken in by the sorceresses who see her great potential but Harry (who drove away hundreds of dementors before Hermione ever tried a patronus charm!) is obviously too weak and has to settle for risking his live again and become a witcher (risk his life? Yeah, witcher mutagens kill most who try to become witchers, it's practically rolling the dice/playing russian-roulette to do so!))

**** Eh, it's supposed to be alike a 3/10 chance. I imagine not being a normal fellow gives you a higher chance, too. Since witches and wizards are supposed to be significantly more durable that regular humans I'd guess that bumps their odds up to at least 5/10. So now it's basically a coin toss, instead of a game of Russian roulette where you've got several bullets in the gun.

*** I dunno, I couldn't really get into it. Wasn't a fan of the fact that it was pretty much an OC witcher that happened to be named Harry. And it seemed to have little to do with the overall plot of the Witcher, and was more just self contained stories in the Witcher universe. But I didn't even finish the first short story segment with the Leshen

I'll give it another shot, I guess.

  It goes without saying that a witcher's life is one of thankless peril: brutal training, mutations, vagrancy, and all they get for it are insults and a few coins to tide them over to the next contract. Still, to be a witcher is to lead an fascinating life, and Harry tries to make the most of his. Heavy AU.
