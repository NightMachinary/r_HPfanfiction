I've seen stories where her mom is saved, but I don't think I've ever seen one where it was the dad who passed on instead of the mom.

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.

** I haven't seen this before, and I'm not sure how well it would work. Whoever wrote the story would pretty much need to create Pandora from the ground up as an OC, since we don't know much about her personality. Xenophilius, by contrast, is an easier character to write because we already know him.

That said, I'm interested to see what stories might surface from this discussion.
