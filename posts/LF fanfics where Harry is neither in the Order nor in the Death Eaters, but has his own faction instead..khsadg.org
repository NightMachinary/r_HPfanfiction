  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.

  Harry is determined to root out the corruption in the Ministry and the Wizengamot, and to bring to justice those responsible for the tragedy of the previous year. It won't be easy. The law protects the rich and powerful, at the expense of the innocent. The only way to win a dirty fight is to fight dirty. Book 3 of The Cry of Freedom. Sequel Up!
