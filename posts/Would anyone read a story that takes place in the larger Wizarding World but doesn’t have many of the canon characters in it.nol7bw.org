I'm writing something like that. It was meant to be just something fun to pass the time for me but now I'm wondering if anyone might be interested in reading it once it's more polished!

Edit: thanks everyone! Glad to know there's interest, I uploaded the first 3 chapters on fanfiction.net and wattpad (waiting on ao3 to accept me but I'll put it up there too !) if you want the link I'm happy to post it or send via dms


** I have been writing one like this and getting a lot of interest/readers. It was also supposed to be just something I was working on for fun that turned into a lot more.

But yeah, don't worry about how many people will read it or stuff like that. It sounds like you wrote the story you wanted to, which is what is important. If you feel comfortable sharing, post it.

** Heck yes. This is what I always look for. While I love HP, I've read too many FFs that are canon with a twist. New characters, new plots, new ideas, new magic---I'm all there for it.

*** Yes!! That's what I wanted to make, something a little more fresh! I want to explore different eras too so my story is set in the early years of Voldemort's rise to power which I think would be an interesting time to be a witch/wizard for sure! Glad people are on board with this kind of story!

** Genuinely surprised no one has mentioned the Alexandra Quick series yet. It also has a podfic/audiobook. The beginning is a little slow but the writing is 10/10 and it gets the medal for the well written diversity that jkr doesn't deserve. It also has a sub [[/r/Alexandraquick][r/Alexandraquick]]

(Think good black, asian, and especially awesome Native portrayals.)

***** Lol that's totally ok! At least I found something fun to get into and I know it's kind of a genre all it's own too

*** Interesting! This one actually takes place pre-Harry so I don't really think there's a way he could be in it. All fanfics aren't for everyone though!
