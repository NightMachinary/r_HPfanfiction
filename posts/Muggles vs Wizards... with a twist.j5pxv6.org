The muggles have an AGI. No, not Skynet, an [[https://youtu.be/tcdVC4e6EV4][actual, realistic AGI.]] Assume the Alignment Problem is solved, or else this gets boring quickly.

Who would win? On one side you have a race of people with the ability to bend reality with no hard limits for free, and on the other you have a being that is essentially as close as a god you can get to in a universe made of matter, that is able to simulate eons of time in hours and is hundreds of times smarter than the entirety of the Wizarding World combined, with its intelligence scaling exponentially with time.


** Boring or interesting? Muggle humans want war and think they have an AI aligned with them. But does it make sense that a super intelligence would fully agree with us? A little misalignment would make for a richer story, I think. Too much and bye bye Humanity.

Wizards would have to act quickly, and they seem a leisurely, medieval lot. However they can read and manipulate minds, teleport, create all kind of objects out of thin air, become quasi invisible, impersonate others, etc. If muggles were unprepared it is a great initial advantage. The problem is families of muggle born students would know, and something this big would leak inevitably many generations ago. The whole premise of the HP series is, in fact, completely implausible (disregarding magic), because of this.

An interesting prompt, though.

That's what I mean - an unaligned AGI means a boring, 'AI wins Humanity loses' story. I don't know about you, but I'd much rather read a story where the muggles win than a Terminator knockoff.

True, but not only are there likely sources of data that haven't been fully censored by the wizards (incomplete editing of video, text documents that slipped by an Obliviator, etc.), the central government has already been infiltrated by the wizards. This would not only provide a valuable insight into the world of Wizarding Britain (Things like body posture, clothing style, how they speak, mainly things that the muggles know how to do normally could be exploited by the AGI to track any magical that happens to pop up on radar, so to speak) but potentially provide an inside agent if the AGI manages to... 'convince' them to spy for it.

** I think it all comes down to one question: Can the AGI detect magic? If not, it will lose no matter how smart it is. All the intelligence in the world would be useless if the wizards stay hidden behind their undetectable protections.

For the rest of the "war", are the humans still part of the system? No matter how good the AGI tactics and protocoles are, if the war is still fought by humans, there is still a chance of "human error" which can be exploited by the Wizards to at least fight back. Though I doubt any side would be able to deal a decisive blow to the other.

Considering that (IIRC) Collin's camera is unmodified and works perfectly fine taking photos of magic, I would say yes. It might not work with radar, but stuff like optical cameras and lidar should function fine.

At the beginning probably, but eventually the AGI will realise that relying on slow biology and imprecise language is very non-optimal, and switch to complete robotics.

** The exact moment you introduce an AGI with no hard cap to it's processing power/speed, that side wins
