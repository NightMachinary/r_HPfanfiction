That reminds me, I lowkey loved the author's other fic "Nymphadora's Beau". Not sure if it disappeared off FFN or I just can't find it.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer prior to fifth year, Andromeda Tonks finds out her daughter Nymphadora has set her sights on Remus Lupin. She's not happy with this, and tricks Tonks into going for Harry Potter instead. What starts out as a way to "get back" at her parents, turns into an uncommon romance... Canon until the start of Book 5 'Order of the Phoenix', mild lemons. / No updates, on hold.
