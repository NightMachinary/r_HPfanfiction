I have read a few GoT fics wherr thr actor who portraits a character takes over, but i havent seen any HP fics with this trope. Has anyone seen any ? Like Daniel Radcliffe taking over the roll of Harry or someone else.

**** Okay, in the future I won't suggest well-written, complete fics that are exactly on point with you request. No worries.
