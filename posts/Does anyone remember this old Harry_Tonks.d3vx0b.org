A long time ago (like, before the books were finished) I read a Harry/Tonks fanfic series. I dont remember much of it, but i remember a few parts such as Fudge getting assassinated by death eaters while throwing a parade, and the Dursleys being killed when Harry a accidentally breaks the protection spell around their home. I was too young to remember if was any good, but it was definitely long so i feel like other people must have read it.


** The only old Harry/Tonks series I can think of is the R-series from 2004. Not sure if it fits your memory, but here's the first part.

*** I only read up to book five, since the series went to shit during that one, and I don't recall any of that happening up to that point. Could have been during book 6, 7, or 8 (I think there's an 8th).

**** It's age does it no favour. The last or maybe last two parts are original and came out before their canon counterparts. I think that they are a good example for early fanfics, but doesn't really hold up anymore.

It's the only H/NT series I can think of though.

***** I remember really enjoying books 1-4 despite a lot of the issues (I was on a Honks binge at the time, though), but the contrived drama that occurs during book 5 that seems to have just been caused by everyone holding the idiot ball and acting out of character was what killed it for me. Which is a shame, because I was looking forward to how the series really diverged during book 6.

I tried starting it again but couldn't find it in me to go through even book 1. Also I've read quite a few H/T fanfics (series and ome-shots) and this doesn't ring a bell for me. Hopefully someone finds it and it's good, I wouldn't mind checking it out.

****** Yeah, Andromeda is written rather badly, the Dursley abuse was through the roof and I never got further than you did. But it certainly had an influence on my shipping and family preferences.
