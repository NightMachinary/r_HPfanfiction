A while ago (exactly a week ago), I read a story where Lily gave birth to twins with Scorpius as her husband. Eventually they adopt a boy named Zachary who possesses no magical powers and is from a wizard family that tossed him out into the street. can anyone give me the name of it please?


** Excuse my nitpicking and normally I wouldn't comment on it when I can't help your request, but this is a major irritation and you misspelled it three times so I know it's not a mere typing error: Lily only has two l's, not three.

Oh, actually, I do have a small hint that might help your search. If you recall the website the fic was on and you're certain about it being a week ago that you read it (odd definition of "a while" by the way) check your history. Obviously, this only helps if you haven't cleared it in the past week and weren't reading in incognito mode, but Chrome and Firefox both let you view your history by date, so you might find the fic there.

*** Sorry, I will go back and edit the name. I would check my history. However, I was on my mothers laptop when I visited her and as per her request every time the browser is closed the cookies and browser history are deleted. So I am hoping that some one can give me a hint. I have been on FF.NET and have put in the usual filters with the characters and I am about to give up hope as there is a lot of fiction on there.

** Never mind I have found it! It was right under my nose. Fell free to downvote this to oblivion. And if anyone is curious here is the link to the story. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7503315/8/Daddy-I-Have-an-Announcement]]

*** Not sure what you mean as I have no idea what Farscape is. All I know is this is a second gen Harry Potter Fan fiction, pairing Lily L. Potter and Scorpius Malfoy.
