Are there any good fics where harry is raised by someone other than the dursleys? a couple of Rorsach's odd bits and pieces have them, but i am hoping more for a full story.

Sly, cunning, street-smart, sorted into Slytherin where his housemates have been raised to hate him, will Harry survive? Or maybe it's the House of Snakes that doesn't stand a chance.

*** I am currently making my way through /With Strength of Steel Wings/. The story seems promising, if a little heavy on take-off.

Another one not mentioned yet is *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4894268/1/Sitra-Ahra][Sitra Ahra]]:*

- Words: 363,743, updaterd a year ago

- On the night of Halloween 1981, Harry Potter vanished for eight years, reappearing at a Muggle orphanage with no recollection of his past. The deck stacked heavily against him, Harry arrives at Hogwarts, his past the key to the present's brewing storm.

**** Steel Wings is among my favourite fics. It's extremely evocative, especially in the rune-carving scenes, and the whole thing's shrouded in shades of grey and difficult choices.

That said, I'd never accuse it of being fast-paced.

** Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them - Harry runs from Dursleys, lives in the forest and convinces himself that he's an elf. A bit odd but interesting premise and good character study of Harry. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them]]

Innocent - Harry raised by Sirius. I really like the new universe constructed by the author and the good take on a variety of characters. It's more focused on character building than super plot drama, but I quite like it. Two sequels, the second of which is currently updating. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]]

**** I can't decide if it's really good or really bad. As a novel (or the majority of a novel) it's pretty terrible. As fanfic, it seemed pretty good (to me, which doesn't really mean anything).

Concept that I like: take 11-year-old Harry Potter, about to enter Hogwarts. Make him an incredibly astute and science-minded young boy, and then see just how he'd react to all of the situations that J. K. Rowling threw him into. Written with a unique sense of humor. That right there is pretty good all around, and that's what the first few chapters are. I recommend them to anyone that is familiar with the Harry Potter universe.

Concept that I hate: author proceeds to drag it out over 80 chapters, getting more and more serious. Turn Harry Potter into some weird Machiavellian scheming adolescent. Combine that with poor writing that tells rather than shows, and the signs saying: WARNING - AUTHOR IS MAKING UP PLOT AS THEY GO ALONG and next thing you know it's all fallen apart.

Just my two cents, but again, what does that matter.
