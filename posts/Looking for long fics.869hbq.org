I devour fics, and as much as I try to slow myself down, it is just impossible. So what do you recommend? My personal favorite things in fics are: Grey!Harry, Smart!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, or Powerful!but not godlike!Harry. I like long fics, minimum of twenty chapters, good plots, good grammar, and any pairing is good, and would prefer it to be on fanfiction.net since I have the app, but I'll read from any site.

Anything anyone recommends?

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** I just finished this the other day and I whole heartedly recommend it. One of my favorites for sure.

*SPOILERS*: I'm not a fan of the ending however. I understand the reasoning for not writing any type of 'wrapping-up/conclusion' chapter due to the story being focused on Harry but I felt like there could have been a final Fleur chapter that showed her point of view during the story climax, considering the final part was significantly more confusing then I was comfortable with.

******* Glad you liked it. Yea I wished there was at least an epilogue to tie up that confusing last chapter, even if I do understand why it was being intentionally confusing.

Have you read the Albus Potter series yet? It's 7 books long and VERY good. I will admit that the first book is a little slow going but it's entirely worth it to continue on in the series.

Here is book 1 linkffn(8417562) Check it out üòÅ

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.
