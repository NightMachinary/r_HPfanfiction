You know that crazy fan theory where Dumbledore is really a time-travelling Dumbledore? Did anybody right that? Even just a oneshot would be cool.

*** Made me think up this.

--------------

The thing about time travel is that it is a lie. The only change you affect is the path that you walk. The future you remember is still right where you left it, minus yourself of course. You've set your path somewhere else. Im on a mission to find the path that I left.

I've seen many Harrys in my time. They all have one thing in common. Their natural predilection is toward the worst of entitled superiority. You ask me, Harry, why I did what I have done. The truth is that given a loving home and a warm upbringing you would be a monster.

The Dursley's, monstrous in their own way, have seen that Harry done in. He is gone. Like a phoenix you were reborn from the ashes of your burned childhood. A hero if there ever was one.

The greater good, these are not just words. Not just excuses of old men to justify bad doings. Was I wrong to sacrifice another Tom Riddle to the deprivations of mad muggles so that they would birth his opposite?

  Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore straightened his spectacles and looked about him at the wreckage of the girls' toilets. Well, now. I had hoped we could avoid this sort of thing... but maybe it's for the best. Life isn't a chess game, and people aren't pieces. After all these years, I should be used to that. For the most part, the scene was as he expected. The three children had clustered in the corner, as far away from the massive wart-covered humanoid figure in its crude loincloth as they could get without leaving the room. There was more than fear alone involved, he knew. Merlin's stones, he thought, I'd forgot just how awful a troll can smell. He pushed his boyhood memories aside, concentrating on the present. Hermione Granger and Harry Potter had their arms about each other. Ronald Weasley looked as if someone had shoved a pail of reeking fish scraps under his nose. Then again, it might have only been the troll.

** I KNOW I read one somewhere, ugh I can't remember the name but I believe it was more then a one shot and it was probably still Harry centric as that's what I tend to read. Other then that I can't remember anything else sorry :(
