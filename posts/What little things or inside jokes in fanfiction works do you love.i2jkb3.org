I was reading Path Diverged II, by hp_fangal on SIYE, and I just love whenever they mention small things invented in that work, mainly "Hermione's Rule" and "Ginny's Rule". What do you read that has something like this?


** Moody's Rules For Successfully Reaching Retirement in Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass. They're so in character and Tonks quotes them so naturally and they all have such brilliant "I'm too paranoid to give this up and I'm way too old for this shit" vibes.

They're also just... pretty good advice, really. Bit much in places for a regular life, but good advice nevertheless. :D
