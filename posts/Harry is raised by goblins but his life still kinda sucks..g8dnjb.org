The other goblin children are told not to play with him, goblin society refuses to teach him any goblin secrets (except for maybe the limited skill set of his adoptive goblin parent(s) and even they have been ostracised for it). Or maybe it's just that they don't teach goblin secrets to /any/ children until they reach a certain age. Harry can't do goblin magic because that's not how goblin magic works. Goblin chores are harder and a tad more dangerous than muggle chores but at least he's getting a fair amount when compared to the other goblin children (Which is still a lot). They can't just erase or detect horcruxes on a whim. He's raised with goblin values and maybe is even instilled with a little predjudice against wizards. But since he doesn't have the magical power or the backing of the goblin nation to make ridiculous demands he can't just steamroll over every wizard who doesn't follow his goblin morals. When he gets to Hogwarts he has to make friends and maybe reach a better understanding of his human roots which leads to internal conflict.


** All of the goblin children, used to laugh and call him names. They never let poor Harry join in any Goblin games.

** What if he showed up to Hogwarts with whatever the UK wizarding equivalent of a CPA is instead of any kind of physical or magical training.

-He tries to explain investing and sound business practices to the twins and is very cross when they lose all their startup money gambling with Ludo Bagman.

-He reports Draco for selling the 'Potter Stinks' and the 'Weasley is Our King' badges and not paying taxes on his small business that he's clearly started.

-Dumbledore thinks that he's 'gone dark' at first, but he's really just networking for new clients and started with the Purebloods because they have more assets in the wizarding world.

Bonus points if Professor Binns crosses over when he realizes that Harry was raised by goblins (due to his obession/fear of the bloodshed and brutality of the goblin rebellions) and Harry blithely asking if they should be concerned about Hogwarts finances if the teachers are that afraid of bankers.

** I get really excited for this kind of fic. Where it's set up with one of the same old beaten to death powerwank concepts (master of death, inheritance test, goblin and elf magic, etc.) but then flips the whole premise upside down to prevent the expected power wank.

A few examples of what kind of plot I mean (no specific fics in mind).

Harry is taken from the Dursleys as a child to receive specialized training from a pureblood. But the pureblood is a moron and thinks Lumos is the best spell to have in your arsenal so Harry doesn't actually learn anything special. Cue illusions of grandeur when he shows up to Hogwarts and being swiftly beat down by all the other students he's been irritating.

Harry takes the inheritance test given by the goblins. He's heir to the Potter family, which has about 1000 galleons in the vault. Turns out inheritance tests just see who your parents were. Harry takes a "buy all the cool stuff" shopping trip. But instead of buying all the ancient artifacts of infinite usefulness and silk robes he buys secondhand robes and secondhand books. Even gets an ordinary trunk which doesn't have an apartment in it.

Raised by goblins certainly but if you think Harry had a shit life in that fic then you need a reality check. Besides, engaged at 13 years old?
