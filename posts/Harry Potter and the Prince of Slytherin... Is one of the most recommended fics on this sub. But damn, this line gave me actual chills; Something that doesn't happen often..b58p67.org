  "You've completely ruined my social standing. I thought I was picking the winner with you, Potter. Instead, you just roll over to that little ponce at the first real threat?"

  Harry continued to stare at the door. "Roll. Over." He said the words slowly, rolling them around in his mouth as if they were foreign and alien. "Rooooll. Oooveer."

  Then, he turned to face Blaise with an amused look on his face. "Is that really what you think just happened, Blaise? My acting must be pretty good if I fooled even you." He turned his burning gaze back to the door. "In just a few hours, Malfoy is leaving for Easter break. That's six days he'll be away from the castle. Six days beyond my reach. So, naturally, I pretended to roll over and then promised him a gift suitable for his ego to ensure that he keeps his mouth shut until he gets back."

  Blaise relaxed a bit at Harry's words. "So, you've got a plan?"

  "No," said Harry casually, while still staring at the door, "but I do have six days. *God made the World in six days. Surely, I can come up with a plan for dealing with Little Lord Bad-Faith in that amount of time. And on the seventh day, we'll rest. And Draco Malfoy will never trouble us again."*

Harry's eyes glinted with determination. He took out his wand.

“/Diffindo!/”

Hermione shrieked. “/What the fuck, Harry!/” A stream of blood was dripping from Harry's wrist. Directly into his glass of pumpkin juice.

“Hermione. I swear on my life and magic that I can do wandless magic. So mote it be.” Harry then downed the now bloody glass of pumpkin juice, his wrist still leaking with blood.

“Does that even work?” Ron asked. “That's /so/ broken.”

The blood was spilling into her personal space. Hermione panicked.

“You need to go to Madam Pomphrey! Do you even know any healing spells!?”

With a sizzle, Harry cauterized his wound. He stood up, leaving the silent table.

*** To be fair, in this story, alot of this is implied to be caused by the horucrux shard (though it's not confirmed so that's just a theory) and even in story i think they bring up how harry knows the meaning of words that hes sure hes never heard before, it actually shakes him up a bit when he realizes it.

Ps While my theory of it being partially caused by the horucrux isnt confirmed or denied, i just remebered that theres also another in story explanation of it that is confirmed, but if you hadn't read the fic I'm not going to spoil as it's a pretty good plot point

PPS Also the potions, forgot about those honestly lol, but yeah the commenter down below got it right as well with the Author Notes just flat out saying he didnt want to write 11 year old dialogue, but the "pretty good plot point" I referenced is more about Harry's speech specifically but yeah please dont spoil here if you know it, PoS is a really good story so I want as many people to want to read it as possible.

**** The explanation is actually /really/ neat but, ultimately, just a way for the author to explain away his lack of desire to write 11-year-old children's dialogue as if... they were 11-year-old children.

Which is fine, and well done. I only mention it in that way because I don't think it's a "pretty good plot point." An interenting concept, but certainly not anything which, so far in my reading of 150k words in, of much import.

The idea is that wizarding children do /not/ go to any kind of schooling before Hogwarts. Instead, there are potions which have been designed to instantly impart knowledge of certain subjects to children. The drawbacks being that potions cannot impart any /magical/ knowledge and that the knowledge they impart is rather limited to the time period that they were created. For instance, a knowledge potion for physics would be almost entirely pointless as the understanding of the person who created it is outdated by about 200 years.

The potion which teaches children literacy, writing and language for English was... well, designed in the 1800s, so their language (at least, for those who aren't very social children and therefore cannot evolve it through natural communication) is rather formal and, obviously, not like an 11-year-old at all.

They also mention that these potions exist for other language such as German but that they have very old (1800s) accents, or some such.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
