- this can include any self inserts
- preferably in the first war/marauders era


** I don't have any during the Marauder era, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) has a hilarious OC as its protagonist. linkffn(Whats her name in Hufflepuff) is an SI which is also pretty funny.

** linkffn(Grow Young With Me) is post-war, not marauders, but I saw it here earlier this week; it's Harry/OC, and one of the best OC's I've read so far

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

** linkao3(Flying by trynathink) is superb. It has a grounded oc main character and really great characterization all around. Plus it's first war/marauders era and captures both of these settings really well
