I just finished reading Druid of Holly and Yew and although its not complete (not sure if its going to be completed), I loved the portrayal of Harry in it. Especially how he is not really looked at as the "savior" of the wizarding world even if he may become that. He is not all that famous even if hes known. He is not fawned over or protected in the traditional sense, nor is his life planned out or tied to some prophecy. Hes also somewhat separated from the traditional characters or those who might become friends. But he is still powerful and a force to be reckoned with in his own ways, and while perhaps hes not light, hes also not dark. He is his own individual and follows his own creed and path. Ive read a few other stories with a Harry like that but none that seemed to quite satsify me like Druid of Holly and Yew did. And I suspect it was because he was not the "boy who lived" to the Wizarding world itself (which many other stories keep as an element).

It was nice to read about a Harry that was more stand alone and not so tied to the original plot elements (like the golden Trio or the prophecy, or even traditional magic), but still a powerful force in the wizarding world in some way (be it interesting magic or political power or whatnot). So I would love to find more stories like that. I do prefer stories that have romance but its by no means a requirement. I prefer no slash for Harry (or the main character) but apart from that don't mind it. Mature oriented fics prefered but not required.

Thanks all! I am often in the hospital for cancer treatments and I pretty much exclusively read fan fiction at such times and its always nice to get new recommendations. Looking forward to a few more.

  Instead of attending Hogwarts, Harry Potter was taken as an apprentice by a druid who taught him a more archaic form of magic. Now fully trained in the mystic arts of water and wood, he comes out of isolation to rejoin magical society and wage guerrilla warfare against Voldemort through ritual magic and alliances with the fae creatures of ancient Britain.

*** I always hated the Prophecy to begin with, but accepted that it was the driving force in canon behind much of the plot. I always enjoy fics that step outside that device and allow the wizarding world to develop without it either before or after we step into the story setting. But there are certainly far too few that take this approach and yet still keep the world itself intact in some form. Of the very few I vaguely remember reading I am not sure I have ever read any completed ones that did it well enough to be recommended.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  As Voldemort's traitor apprentice, Harry finally escaped his guardian's torture and into freedom. Picked up by Tom Riddle, he discovers the true meaning of being a Horcrux and the consequences of freeing Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Voldemort's established society is brought crumbling down as the two powerful wizards reunite...and even Harry is unable to stop it. Sequel to Ice Crux.
