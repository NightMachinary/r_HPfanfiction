I prefer male protagonists as I can relate to them better. But female protagonists are fine too. For the love of God, please don't recommend that Hufflepuff story though. I love it but I've read it at least four times already.


** Gotta be honest...I have no clue what you mean by chill protagonists. Do they not care at all about Voldy? Care casually? Only care about raiding Professor Sprout's private store of 'medicinal' herbs.

*** "Here Harry, try this brilliant thing we knicked from Professor Snape's stores," Ron whispered, waving Harry closer. He reached out and offered Harry a grotesque looking mushroom with a red candy shell-like coating.

"What's this rubbish? I thought we were going to be brewing Polyjuice," he said, trying not to sound too annoyed. Ron had tried, after all.

"Nah, mate. This is even better. It'll make you /feel/ like a different person."

Well, that couldn't be all that bad, then. Harry sat down beside Ron and accepted the strange mushroom.

He looked over at Hermione and frowned. She was curled up in the corner, muttering furiously to herself. That was somewhat worrying. Exams weren't until next month, so he wasn't sure what she was worked up about. "What's gotten into Hermione? Does she feel like someone awful?"

"Oh, she's seen the nargles, is all," Luna said, walking by with an airy smile. Harry noticed that she had a necklace of smaller mushrooms around her neck. "Though I'm afraid she's still denying them. They don't like that. Not at /all/."

Harry shivered, but then he looked at Ron again. Ron looked relaxed. Perhaps the best way to go about it was to accept the nargles, and not try and fight them as Hermione had. That sounded reasonable.

Before he could change his mind, Harry took a large bite out of the mushroom. He would be calm, collected, and he wouldn't let this thing beat him, as it had beaten Hermione. He would be stronger than that.

He would be... /Chill/.

**** "I can see the nargles, Harry," Hermione muttered fervently.

"That's great, Hermione. Is there anything to eat around here?" Harry asked with an easy smile as he leaned back and stared at the ceiling.

"No, you don't understand....I can really /see/ the nargles...and they're beautiful," she repeated, reaching at the air in front of her.

*** I think canon Trio is as chill as they can get, considering their circumstances.

I really would like to see how "chill" you can be, when:

- You grow up in an abusive household because of your 'protection'
- You have a sadistic genocidal maniac with superpowers coming after you
- You have to fight a 10 foot tall monster when you are still 11
- You realize sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums are actually part of the government and among society's elite
- You have to fight a 60 foot long super monster when you are still 12
- You realize that the government is totally malicious and incompetent, and will use soul sucking demons to 'protect' the only school in the country
- You find out that the government is engaged in systematic torture and injustice
- You have to fight 100s of above mentioned soul sucking demons when you are still 13

Things will get even worse from here, and I think canon Trio deserves a lot more credits.

If you want "chill" characters, you can't have totally incompetent plot device adult good guys so kids have to do everything. One good example is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raiders]], linkffn(13052802). In this AU, a BAMF Petunia raised Harry in a loving and exciting environment. Harry made friends with Weasleys early on and is strongly influenced by Bill. He can be considered really "chill". Later, Petunia, Sirius, Bill, Fleur, and Dumbledore have done most of the heavy lifting vs Voldemort, while the Trio helps along with their own adventures.

  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
