Okay, so I'm looking well-written fanfiction with Tom Riddle and Harry Potter as the two main characters. No slash, please. I'd really like to read a story that shows Tom as a clever and manipulative villain, but in his youth, before he killed the Potters. So time travel fics are totally fine as long as they're done well. I just want good, solid writing with solid characterization.


** Unfortunately solid writing and characterization can be hard to find in such a niche spot.

Hopefully someone come along and recommends something awesome without harry falling in love with him lol.

  Harry is taken the night Dumbledore is about to leave him with the Dursleys. With forces meddling in the timeline, Harry and Tom become the Riddle brothers. Follow the boys from the 1930s, WWII & Grindelwald, to canon years and a much changed future. Slash.

** I don't know of any story like that, but I do know of one that is well-written, though it is romance between Tom Riddle and Hermione Granger; Harry isn't the main character, though he does have a part in the story (it is time-travel, by the way). If you're interested, the story is called "Fourier's Flaw" by SiriusBlacksGodDaugther.
