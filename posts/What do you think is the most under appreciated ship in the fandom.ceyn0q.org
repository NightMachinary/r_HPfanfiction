  Lists had never failed Hermione before. So when her feelings for Ron get out of hand, it's only natural for her to write a list to clear her mind. She would come up with a list of boys most objectively compatible with her, detail the reasons why, and choose someone from the list to serve as a distraction. Of course, she never dreamed that her notes would all magically get sent out. (Inspired by To All The Boys I've Loved Before)

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** I'm not sure if I would call it under appreciated but I think Harry/Susan Bones is tremendously under represented given the potential there.

Given her Aunt being the head of the DMLE and the fact that she dies in such a tragic way there is a ton of interesting things to work with as far as the character is concerned and how she comes back from that. Most of the stories I've seen treat this is a sad footnote that she quickly gets over...I'd really love a compelling story that saw her working through that loss. She and Harry seem like they could be kindred spirits as far as that is concerned.

Moreover (without him knowing before) it would neatly solve her need to learn how Cedric was killed.

- Hermione/Viktor -- perhaps not as a forever pairing, but I think the actual young crush stuff gets pushed aside in fanon. People assume they went as friends/because Hermione didn't treat him poorly, but I think they could genuinely have liked each other
- Ron/Hannah or Ron/Susan -- I think Ron has some Hufflepuff tendencies that get overshadowed bc he's "not loyal" and I think a Hufflepuff relationship would help bring that out in a fic

Really good Harry/Luna stories are rare, but exist. I like linkffn(Help of a Seer) and I'm currently reading linkffn(Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy) which is apparently Harry/Luna later on.

Unfortunately, most are written like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Truth), which has Dumbledore and Weasley bashing, stupidly fast paced development of spurious plot points, godlike Harry, etc.

** Probably a slightly leftfield choice, but given the amount of time it's brought up in canon, I'm not sure I've ever seen Draco/Pansy in a fic, even as background.

In a similar vein Hagrid/Maxime and Dobby/Winky don't seem to crop up very often either. (!)

On a more serious note, I've rarely seen Hermione in femslash. fem!Harry/Hermione has interesting potential I think. fem!Harries I've seen generally shipped with Ginny, Ron or Draco.

There's a lot of parallels between the characters to be explored (Voldemort killed both their parents or as good as, Harry had the Dursley thing and Neville was thrown out the window by his uncle, they both have problems with Snape) so they'd have a lot of things to bond over, potentially. Neville in general is an under appreciated character that I'd love to see more of in fics. And imagine, a Harry slash pairing without the other party being a Death Eater!

*** Unlike the others, I'm not sure I would call Harry/ Daphne "ridiculous". I mean, Canon only says she is a girl in the same year as Harry (I'm not even sure that canon mention she is in Slytherin or if it's something Rowling said later).

So yeah, she is in Slytherin and for all her talk to say there is no "bad House", Rowling did a good job making Slytherin one, but unlike the other ships, this one doesn't have a very big age gap or, you know, the whole "I am the second in command of the guy who want to kill and potentially the mother of his spawn).

​

Daphne is definitively over represented compared to her canon importance though, but people like to ship Harry with a Slytherin and the other canon choice are very dissapointing so here she is, the perfect option to not have to make an OC, (plus it's a really nice name).

Also, why in the hell Muggleborns just didn't step on Eurostar? They knew how to use muggle transportation! Yeah, I know, people suggest Death Eater in Saint Pancras station, but what is more difficult, dose Muggleborns with Polyjuice Potion or change them sufficiently with the human transformation, or doing whole crazy flying-on-broomsticks-to-Callais thing? However, if you suspend your unbelief about this thing, it is really lovely story, with really nicely written characters.

I'm also a bit surprised over how rare Harry/Neville is -- to me, it always came off as the most plausible Harry slash pairing, with them being able to relate to their similar pasts and develop a friendship that eventually turns into more (I've never been able to see Harry&Ron as anything more than friends).

** I've always like to imagine that Draco was secretely fond of Hermione, especially after she punched him. Maybe he only called her a mudblood all those times because he was secretly envious of how smart she was. Then as the years passed, and her hair straightened, and her teeth shrunk, and Pansy's clinginess and stupidity begane to grate at him, he glanced over at Hermione in Potions class and saw her face tight with concentration, her eyes glowing as she stirred her cauldron. As she reached up to sweep a stray hair behind her ear, he saw she was the most beautiful girl in Hogwarts.

Haven't seen much on Dracione, but if i did, it would be my favorite....

  No one knows that they are missing. No one knows where they are. No one knows that they are trapped. No one knows that they are dying. Dramione.

*** I can also easily see Draco developing a slight crush on Hermione, especially after his own world crumbles and crashes around HBP and DH. BUT I never saw any realistic chance of Hermione seeing him the same way, that's why the pairing never did anything for me.

*** It's the 6th most popular HP pairing on AO3, with more than 7700 fics, and it's probably even more popular on FFN. There are so many that you're probably best off making a separate post in this subreddit to ask for recs, because just diving in might be a little overwhelming and people here can recommend you some of the classics. Or you can browse past requests: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=draco%2Fhermione&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all]]
