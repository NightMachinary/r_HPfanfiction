** I have been inconsistent- I used to thank reviewers for every review, but then there were a few where they'd posted several reviews in a row for successive chapters and I responded once to cover all the comments worth clarifying. Other reviews like 'nice job; update soon' are welcomed but I don't feel a need to respond to them- it's a greeting card. It'd be like sending a written thank you for someone who sent you a coupon for their business.

That's the way to get a response from me, by the way: ask a question about the story, aside from 'when's your next update?'

I also will reply to negative reviews if the reviewer seems open to discussion. [EDIT: ... and sane. So many addled people are open for discussing their madness with you, whether it relates to the story or not]

From the reader's side, I will review incomplete stories that I like with encouraging commentary, especially if the story has 'gone stale'; no recent updates. I have reviewed one-shots and completed fics if something in them really provoked an emotional response, even if the author hasn't been seen in years. Sometimes a voice from the wilderness saying 'you are valued' can be a real inspiration.

** I try not to leave solely negative reviews, if I post a review I must have liked something about the story or I wouldn't have bothered to leave a review. I would have just stopped reading the story.

I don't expect replies, and when I get them I'm a little shocked and gratified. If I've left what I think is a constructive review, I get a thrill if an author acknowledges it, even it's in rebuttal to a (in my mind) justified criticism.

Not really. My FFN Outbox has almost a thousand PM conversations and most of them are replies to reviews. I reply to as many people I can.

*** Just so you know, I do my best to reply to reviews that ask me a direct question, but I don't always catch them all. I also try to reply to long reviews, but this has slowed as the number of long reviews has increased. It pains me not to, but if I did I'd spend far less time writing actual chapters and I figure that's what people would prefer I do.

** I never expect a reply to a review. If they responded to every review, or even half of them they would have no time to write. I mean, I might feel shocked or pleased that they felt my review was interesting enough to respond to it. I think most of the people who ask questions through a review are really just coming off the high of reading the chapter and don't actually want it spoiled.

** Generally, I only leave “reviews” if I think there is something in the story that doesn't quite work properly and I think the author can make it better, so I expect them not to completely ignore what I wrote (because it's actual feedback). That's basically it. If I get a reply, it simply happens; if I don't but the author clearly did take what I wrote into consideration, that's fine too; if they neither reply nor give any signs that they actually care then I treat it as a red flag.

**** As I already wrote, I post reviews very rarely and when that happens they are feedback of some sort about something that is broken compared to the rest of the story and warrants attention from its writer. As such, I am doing it to pull the attention of the writer towards the problem. Those are big things, like a gaping plot hole that probably wouldn't have seen the light of the day if the writer wasn't quite sleep-deprived when they wrote (happened) or feedback about a never-used-before-in-the-story change in perspective and style of writing that doesn't work well and really isn't needed.

I do not require the authors to “bend to my whims” or anything, but those are things that do look like big things and obvious problems so if the author does absolutely nothing with feedback given, be it go back and see if they can't fix whatever problem I saw, or be it write to me and say that they don't see it as a problem for whatever reason, it means that they either do not care about the quality of their writing and are not open to feedback of any kind, or that they don't read reviews and have nobody proofreading their work. /That/ is a red flag because it means that the story might very well go to shit quickly.

** I don't really expect a reply but it is always a pleasant surprise when the author does reply. And I don't really review a lot of the stories I read. Something must really bother me with the chapter or if it's a story that I want the author to keep writing.

I don't think I have ever flamed a writer. My reviews tend to be encouraging with a little bit of criticism here and there.

** If I post an actual question, then I appreciate a response. But no, I don't normally expect a reply. Most of my reviews are just commenting on how much I enjoyed the fic, so that really doesn't require a response lol. It does make me pleasantly surprised when I do get a reply, but it's kind of a "Oh look! They actually read my review! Awesome!" thing.

** I don't expect a response, usually because I don't leave /that/ detailed of reviews, usually just a few sentences at the most. If they do reply, I normally don't respond again, because it's normally just a quick thanks, and I don't mind the brevity. However, when I get reviews on my stories, I always reply because I think it can help build up a reader base. If it's a longer review, I'll respond to more specific parts, but again, most of the times, it's just quick thanks on my part because the original review is short.

** I review for other potential readers.

Unfortunately, since reviews tend to be utter garbage, I can't /read/ reviews to determine if a fic is worth my time. For a fic that I think is terrible, I can read a dozen reviews from different people that call it awesome. And then I see one person reviewing /every single chapter/ with spoilers half the time...

If they renamed it to "discussion" or "author feedback", that would capture it a lot better. Maybe just scrap it for PMing the author.

** Never reply to a flame. a flame, by nature, isn't constructive. they're jsut trying to get a rise out of you. IF you do... in my opinion the best thing to do is to jsut be polite. "I"m sorry you feel that way" "maybe my fic isn't for you, I'm sorry." "I don't live giving out spoilers, however, that thing you don't like will change in a few more chapters, if you feel like sticking with me. I understand if you don't." -- Yo'ull generally get three replies -- 1) more screaming (they're a troll, jsut ignore them) 2) silence (they didn't know what to make of it) 3) shame-- some people don't 'get' that other people are real people, and the moment you push it in their faces that not only are you a person but that you're polite , despite their rudeness, they become way more polite.

But often times, it's just nto worth replying to a flame. and never, ever argue with them. don't let them upset you and don't let them see you upset. it just fans the flames.

as for me... when I review... I'd like to get a reply, but I don't expect it -- but i toss my words out there anyway to offer encouragement. :) and getting a reply just encourages me to leave more reviews :)

** Usually when I leave a negative review, I try to frame it in a positive light by adding, sometimes ratger artificially, something they did well. But, the only times I've goven negative reviews is when stories I've been enjoying go completely off the rails after promising starts/a lot of good content. I'm struggling to think of specific fics, but things like:

- adding new characters and ignoring the old ones who've been with the main character through thick and thin (Looking Beyond, for example)

- building a great world or having a very well described premise that devolves into smut and no plot

- surprise soulbond/lord potter age 11 stories

- the writer loses their beta or stops caring about grammar/spelling/good dialogue (this annoys me the most)

- Suddenly overly cheesy writing

Anyway, these are just some of the situations, and I guess i expect a reply sometimes, but generally no. After reading the way some people get hugely discouraged by any kind of negative feedback, I often find myself deleting my longer reviews because, on balance, I'm worried they'll call me out negatively in author's notes, which is super awkward.

I love fanfic and want to make other people's better. I don't want to be harsh but the "safespace" and other review rules some people insist on mean I try to avoid backlash. But if people ask for brutal feedback and engage wirh me I absolutely love it

I like to get a reply to reviews I leave. Seems like basic good manners to me. If I review and don't get a reply, I'll assume the writer doesn't really care.
