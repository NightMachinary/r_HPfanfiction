I remember reading a fic a while ago about James and lily in the after life and I can't remember what it was. That is probably no where near enough information to go on but I can't remember anything else ü§£

  What if Sirius had the other two-way mirror on him when he died and Harry found that he was able to talk to his godfather and parents though it? Not to mention, meet all those others who went before? "Sirius Black? Sirius Black!" "Pads, is that your pocket talking to you?" "I dunno, but it sounds like...no way, it couldn't have been there the whole time...Harry!"
