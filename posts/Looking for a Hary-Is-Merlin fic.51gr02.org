Perhaps, this one comes borderline decent although I am not sure about it: Linkffn(Myrddin Emrys Returns by General Kenobi SIYE)

*** I only meant not to post fics where Harry suddenly wakes up, and is like "HOLY SHIT IM MERLIN! LETS GO BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF DUMBLEDORE! BUAHAHAHAHA!

Yeah. No insta op Harry (unless the enemies are on an equal level). So basically, I wrote all of that, to basically say:

1. No terrible grammar. (Fuck you my immortal)

2. No insta op Harry without increasing the crisis

  Souls don't always live just once. They can return, typically in a time of crisis, if they are deemed worthy. This is about two such souls. Separated by houses. Will they find each other again? Will they even know? One Gryffindor, one Slytherin.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** Off the top of my head. This one is a Harry(Merlin)/Morgana. It's short and incomplete but a very enjoyable read.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12063706/1/The-Strange-Case-of-Merlin-s-Identity-Theft][The Strange Case of Merlin's Identity Theft]] is a spinoff (or maybe just another chapter) of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]], a fem-Harry fic that is a little odd to read.
