I've long felt like Harry could have really done well in Hufflepuff, getting the support and patience he needs with less pressure to be a "hero" and a Head of House that actually does her job. Other than BajaB's series on FFnet, though, I haven't seen all that many fics that put Harry in with the badgers. Are there any good ones out there? No slash or abandoned works, please.

  I breath in her intoxicating sent. Fire. Burning, raging fire that had destroyed any pain I had the moment I met her. Her fiery hands, never frozen like Edward's, creased my chin and led it back to the source of the raging lust as I kissed her with the passion I felt. All I could think of was how I gave in to the fire, once a single flame, that melted my heart. Being written.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

***** Likewise. I don't get why Hufflepuff!Harry is so rare; he's certainly loyal and accustomed to hard work. It's not even like there's a dearth of canonical Hufflepuff characters for him to interact with. Maybe it's just not glamorous enough, for lack of a better term?

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts) has a Hufflepuff Harry who could really be in any of the houses, and ends up in Hufflepuff because of his willingness to really put in hard work. He isn't particularly supported by other Hufflepuffs (even though he does use them from time to time, and they're generally helpful when asked for help) as he's a bit of a loner and a bit of a cynical prick, but he'll take care of his own when they're in trouble, and he's a vindictive, manipulative bastard.

It's kind of a "Hufflepuffs aren't doormats" type of characterization of the house.

  Harry Potter discovers the Player Handbook for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd Edition after experiencing accidental magic and realizes he may have magic. Directed to a hobby shop, he develops his own style of magic based on tabletop RPGs and comics. Then, he gets his Hogwarts letter. Dark!Indie!Sarcastic!Paranoid!Pragmatic!Harry. Rated M for language and graphic violence.
