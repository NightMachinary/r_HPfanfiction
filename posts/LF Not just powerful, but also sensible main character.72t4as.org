Hello! More often than not if a character is overly powerful he/she lacks a certain wisdom, sensibility and maturity. Some examples: Linkffn(the Darkness within by kurinoone) Harry is very powerful and knowledgeable, but he makes a lot of stupid decisions and sometimes is consumed by bouts of senseless angst. Linkffn(too young to die) An obvious one, as Harry in there is basically pointlessly destructive, but I do believe it goes well with his young age, so it makes sense. What I am looking for is a character that is as wise as they are clever. And has more dimension then in your usual fanfiction. Examples: Linkffn(changeling by annerb) Linkffn(the long journey home) Linkffn (time to put your galleons where your mouth is)

Any pairing is fine. (Yes, even slash) Sorry, if I am not very clear on the request.

Thanks!

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

**** Not the original person who rec'd it, but yes a basic knowledge is all you'd really need to understand the story (Light Side/Dark Side). There might be a few Star Wars Characters that you don't know, but it shouldn't hinder your enjoyment of the story, at least from what I remember.
