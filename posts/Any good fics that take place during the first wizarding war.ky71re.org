Preferably Jily, but can also be about other characters.


** Well, linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) is a Severus-redoes-his-life story, so it's Snily, and he's working to bring the war to a shorter close. But James is present and (mostly, eventually) a sympathetic character, and it does depict how the conflict outside the walls of Hogwarts makes it feel a bit like a siege.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.
