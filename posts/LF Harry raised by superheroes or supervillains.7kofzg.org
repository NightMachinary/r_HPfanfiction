Because who does not want to see Harry raised by the likes of Pamela 'The Green' Isley or Bruce 'WAAAAAGH' Banner, hell fucking Khephri is far from the worst parent I can think of. Further, Superhero culture meets magical Britain either leads to glorious chaos or delicious fluff.

So give is all the diabetes giving fluff and sitting on a gargoyle wangst good or bad worm through Superman and all the bits in between cuz dammit why not!

Also goodnight comrades

  The world first saw Harry Bailey in a photo kneeling on a road before the Endbringer the Simurgh. The Simurgh's psychic scream drove entire cities mad. In Harry, it woke something else entirely. He never told the heroes what happened. After all, how could a young boy explain memories he could not possibly have, of a powerful, ancient sorcerer from a universe that preceded his own?

  When the Dursleys die in a car crash, Dumbledore is left with a quandary as to where to place the Boy-Who-Lived. That is, until he remembers another relative of Lily's: a cousin in Japan. Rated M just be safe.

  Amy "don't call me Amaryllis" Potter never went to Hogwarts, but the Goblet of Fire makes her a compelled competitor in the Triwizard Tournament. Will three years of tutelage by the Dynamic Duo see her through the treacherous tasks? Will being Batgirl help her beat the villainous Voldemort? And what's with that bewitching yet bothersome, bushy-haired bookworm? Tune in to find out!
