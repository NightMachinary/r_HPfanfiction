Acts like Tom Riddle or something. I've got this idea in my head and I want to know if anything similar exists.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11305455/7/Boredom-Is-Deadly][Boredom is Deadly]] is about a MoD!Harry and Tom Riddle being bored, so they create a parallel reality of Harry's first year to fuck with everybody. Probably my favorite crack fic. Only 7 chapters at the moment, but it was started in June and just updated in January, so a pretty decent update rate.

  For Harry, the 'next great adventure' isn't really all that great. After two-thousand years of dealing with the whining souls of the dead, he decides to spice things up a bit...by returning to his first year at Hogwarts. Crackfic! MOD!Harry Darkish!Harry GaryStu!Harry with a twist. NO Bashing!

** For a while I've wanted a situation where an apparently eleven year-old Harry is in Dumbledore's office talking to him. He keeps asking for more lemon drops and secretly vanishes them from his mouth until the entire bowl is empty.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

*** Hm. I'm not certain this fits the "messing with Dumbledore for fun" request. Harry's motivations and the results of his actions are rather serious and that part of the story is rather dark. Harry's also not really a child there.

******* If you've already read the story, [[/spoiler][It's a reference to Harry arriving in that dimension. He settles into Jessica's body and when he tries to talk with her, her soul basically gives up and passes on because she's so broken from the massive abuse inflicted on her.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
