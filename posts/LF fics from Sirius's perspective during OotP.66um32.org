The darker and angstier the better, although I'm open to a laugh as well! Doesn't have to be a pairing, but if it is I prefer RL/SB. Would love to find a fic about Sirius's feelings of imprisonment at Grimmauld Place, PTSD from Azkaban, resentment towards Dumbledore, guilt about James and Lily, etc. I just want to wallow in his misery, don't judge me ya'll.


** I'm going to shamelessly post mine here because although it doesn't meet all your criteria (It's Sirius/OFC but there's a very brief bromance moment between Sirius & Remus), it does meet most of them. linkffn(11171435)

  Twelve Grimmauld Place; early summer 1996. Sirius Black is on the brink of self-destruction when an unwanted and uninvited guest is foisted on him. He just wants her to go away and leave him in peace, but she's got a job to do and she won't let a bad-tempered wizard bully her.
