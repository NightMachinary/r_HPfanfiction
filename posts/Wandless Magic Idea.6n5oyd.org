I was thinking about wandless magic, and thought it might be an interesting plot device to have it so that without a wand, magic is simply direct manipulation of physics, and is constrained by all of its rules. So no conjuration, not fireballs unless you are sucking the energy out of another object, and you have to be careful with what you are doing.

I personally like it, because to the vast majority of wizards, it would seem like wandless magic is immensely hard for some things, and very easy for others, with seemingly arbitrary rules. It also means that traditional magic like a stunner or AK would not work, because they don't use physics as the method of causing the effect. You could almost perfectly mimic the effect, but it would be mechanically different in nearly every way.


** So, how exactly are turning turning a teacher's wig blue, teleporting, inflating one's aunt like a hot air balloon, etc. constrained by the rules of physics?

*** I would probably just separate wandless magic from accidental magic. Otherwise, back to the drawing board.

*** Subconscious reconfiguration of hair particles so that light reflected is blue, Einstein-Rosen bridge, transmutation and rapid and contained condensing of matter to form a black hole stabilized by magic, etc.

What you are missing is the fact that damn near anything is theoretically possible with physics and magical manipulation as described allows for closed systems as well as direct manipulation of variables in a manner that may or may not be affected by conservation of mass and energy. This means that rather than fireball out of no where you rearranging particles in the air to make fireball rather than red light your down you get invisible punch to the temple etc. with this system of magic magic is only limited to intelligence and imagination with accidental magic being the fact that one has basic instincts as to how the world works which magic can act on during states of high emotion.

I find Clarke's three laws to be noteworthy and applicable.^{^{^{gotta}}} ^{^{^{love}}} ^{^{^{sci-fi}}}

**** "Science says it's theoretically possible" doesn't mean it actually is, and especially not with the ease you're talking about. If you're seriously telling me that Harry could convert one compound into another (especially without a chemical reaction) or create wormholes with his mind...

Well, the Earth would not exist for very long after the first wizard/witch was born. Transmutation exists... in particle accelerators and nuclear reactions. Do you seriously think that a child would somehow be able to manage a nuclear reaction without blowing her- or himself up? And where the heck are the massive amounts of energy required supposed to be coming from, exactly?

You're very excited about the idea that somehow "physics = magic," but you're really ignoring how impossibly complicated things are, not to mention how, exactly, a witch or wizard is supposed to be controlling these things. Because that would be magic, not physics.

***** The thing about magic being and I quote "simply direct manipulation of physics" means that any existing variable can be manipulated but not created. This does not mean an absence of magic, rather it is a change in the nature of magic from some nebulous say the word move the stick and want to cause something to manipulate the items and values to cause an effect.

you are also forgetting that as a general rule of thumb more shit becomes apparently possible as science advances and will likely continue until we have a perfect understanding of the universe. You are also forgetting that the scale of magic is set to roughly intelligence of imagination meaning that anything too small or too large cannot be completed without intelligence and imagination in tandem. following this explanation a child with high imagination instinctually manipulating the world would likely create roughly closed loop systems that end in a basic nullification of non-apparent and/or harmful effects; this means that when a child transmutes something without thinking about the individual particles intelligently he or she is also instinctually removing or nullifying any hazardous effects with the same applying for damn near anything else.

what you are implying requires for instinct to be geared to only effect and not self-preservation or intelligent and intentional accomplishment of such goals. Instincts are generally tied to self-preservation meaning that instinctual manipulation of physics in a manner that can harm oneself is damn near impossible though magic would be heavily limited.

It is also of note that any wizard getting of age to try intelligent rather than instinctual manipulation of physics has a magic stick that make shit happen so long as they say the magic words and /believe/ ^{^{^{imgonnabesick}}} hard enough.

this system basically means that a dull wizard is completely non-threatening while an imaginative or intelligent wizard is scary and an imaginative and intelligent wizard is absolutely fucking terrifying.

tldr: wizards wandless magic is instinctual based on an instinctual understanding of things meaning that it is limited by imagination and intelligence. this means that wormholes dissipate apperation is magic flight reaction etc unless a wizard actually understands the world and can manipulate it intelligently rather than instinctually which none do because they are unimaginative pricks living in the 17th century or have wands to make trippy i believe in fairies magic so they don't need to

** Selections from my notes:

Conjecture in Magical Evolutionary Biology (Closer perhaps to HPMOR-verse, can also work for canon)

Observations:

- Population of magical species seems small (both in terms of wizards/mundanes, and in the sense of that if magical animals had a great abundance, one would expect a high probability of the Statute falling, at least in the camera/video/internet era).
- Wizards in the past did things that modern wizards cannot (raising of Hogwarts, ancient powerful artifacts, Wizengamot building (HPMOR), etc.)
- Even Mundane mythology has a theme of a highly magical past falling into a mundane present.
- The universe does not 'look' magical.
- There exists one non-magical type of sentient - mundane humans. There exist many types of sentient magicals.

Conjecture 1:

There is some variable space-pervading magical scalar field, such that a given instance of magic requires a minimum local value to occur, and said field either cyclicly strengthens & weakens, or the strength thereof is fixed to points in space and varies accross it, or there exist some bodies that influence its strength (i.e. sources of magic) that do not mantain a constant separation from the Earth.

There are various survival strategies employed by magic-capable species to survive the no-magic times:

- Sporulation: Creatures that are entirely or mostly magical, like Dementors, cannot function or even exist as they are without magic. They create or contain some non-intrinsically-magical part that survives the mundane period, inert, and rebuilds the magical portion when magic returns. For example, a Dementor might have a small rock, that it etches with 'runes' that, in the presence of magic build a Dementor (they can then reproduce by creating a duplicate).
- Base Form: In the absence of magic, the physical body of the creature functions well enough mundanely. For example, a Phoenix without magic might be a regular bird. In fact, perhaps the Phoenix is virtually immortal in magic times, and it reproduces only in mundane times (or its population is constrained by losses in such times, hence their rarity)...
- Mixed population: Presumably, the tissues, organs, or organelles that enable use of magic have some cost to grow and mantain. Thus, the 'Base Form' strategy imposes a cost on the species during mundane times. Here, all members of the species have some variants of the magical genes, but there are a number of regulatory genes that turn the actual magic-genes on or off, with the 'decision' being made during meiosis or at a very early stage after fertilization. Having most or all active yields a wizard. Having fewer yields a Squib. Having few or none yields a Muggle. [This way, de novo mutations to the activator markers explains some percentage of muggleborns & squibs.] This could work as follows: There is some innate magical mechanism (that functions only in times of magic, and in those whose magical genes are acive) that does as follows: In times of high magic, the sperm or egg of the magical alters the genes in the complementary cell to have more of the magic-activating sequences, so even Wizard/Muggle parents have a high chance of having magical offspring. In times of falling magic, they are tweaked to have fewer magic-activating sequences, so more offspring are squibs or full muggles. In times of no magic, the entire mechanism is not constructed. Thus, in times of no magic, the squibs are carriers for the magical genes, at no cost to their own survival. As magic returns to the world, the small number of 'muggleborns', have a massive survival advantage - and as we are a social species, they confer that advantage onto their entire tribe, which likely has a large proportion of squibs (thus increasing the absolute number of their children that survive to adulthood). This, together with the mechanism previously discussed, cause these tribes that have higher-than-average numbers of squibs to become the founding populations of the returning wizards. Furthermore, the observed correlation of very high living standards to having, on average, 1 child per person (2 per couple), coupled with that magic grants such even in very low-tech settings, causes there to be a brake on the growth of the wizarding population, keeping them at a relatively stable population, all else being equal.

Thus, the scenario we see in Harry Potter, that magical couples, with a handful of exceptions, are at or below replacement, suggests to me that the current situation is one of fading magic. Merging the magical world back into the mundane is likely the only hope of preserving magical knowledge for the future, unless science!wizards can determine the cause of the periodic magic swings and ameliorate them.

First magic users were entirely wandless (original 'human' magic). Magical tool use evolved over similar timeframes as mundane tool use. In particular, humans found they could craft various bits of magical plants and animals into tools that would enhance their ability to use their magic. Magical alphabets originated from copying from the spore-producing magical creatures, and are somewhat shaped by the collective intent or Jungian overmind of all creatures on Earth.

'Accidental magic', and 'wandless magic' are both manifestations of the same thing - humanity's natural magical abilities. Tool use (wands, staves, etc.) allows us to form our magic in almost any way we desire.

Human natural magical abilities: Teleportation (apparation) (HP to top of school building), resistance to injury (Neville bouncing) & healing/regeneration (Harry's hair and popular fanon with physically abusive Dursleys), telekinesis (which covers much more ground than one might think), telepathy (including inducing sensation of pain, mind control, etc.).

Wizards pull in ambient magical energy from their environment and store it within themselves, or produce it from their own bodies just as we burn sugars for ATP.

Original focuses were large staves. They are comparable to using spear-throwers to throw spears - they make it easier to do the thing you already did (telekinesis) just getting more bang for your buck (ie more efficiently). They needed to be grounding in earth to function properly (otherwise there's random magical discharge or something). Complex spells can be cast, but it takes a lot of time (as you still need to shape each magic-monomer consciously and directly)

Wards were first invented by the ancient Egyptians. Much of their magical tradition was lost in the collapse of the Old Kingdom, and much of the rest was lost in the collapse of the Middle Kingdom, around which time Moses, claimed by the Jews to be, among other things, more powerful than Merlin, defeated the last of the Egyptian battle-sorcerers at the Sea of Reeds, finalizing the collapse of the former Egyptian Empire. What was left was lost to history with the loss of the Egyptian language and religion, precipated by Hellenization, then Christian and Islamic religous forces.

** Kind of clashes with WOG, Rowling has said that there are communities outside of Britain where wandless magic is common - people use it with plausible deniability because unlike wand magic there's not item you can cast priori incantatem on (so no finding out what spells were used last!)...she said nothing about it being super hard either, I believe!

** How's this:

Wand spells are easier to learn. You can learn 5+ wand spells in the time it takes to learn 1 wandless spell.

Since you can now learn so many spells you need schools to teach people. In the past you were only learning one or two spells a year so there was no point in school and wandless magic was just passed down through families.

In turn that spiraled into social dominance of wand magic while wandless atrophied from common usage in many places.

Wand spells are falsely considered stronger than wandless but that's simply because the wand also doubles as a magnifier. There are wandless magic magnifiers but they're less common because they're usually in the form of expensive enchanted jewelery.

Wandless magic can potentially be stronger than wand magic if you're packing enough magnifiers on your person. Unlike wand magic you can pass wandless magic through more than one magnifier it just takes ever increasing amounts of skill not to blow yourself up for each magnifier used in a single spell.
