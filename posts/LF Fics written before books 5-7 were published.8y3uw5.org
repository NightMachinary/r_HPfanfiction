Are there any good long adventure fanfictions written before OOTP came out, that took the story in a totally different direction from what ended up being canon? No M rating or slash pairings please. Bashing is ok as long as it's not too over the top and exaggerated. My preferred pairing is Harry/Hermione but as long as it's not slash or creepy, other pairings I'm ok with.

Thanks!


** Lightning on the Wave's Sacrifices Arc. 2.6m words of it. For their time they were nothing short of incredible. There are a lot of truly unique ideas and the way the author uses the people to create an ideal setting. I absolutely love Lucius in this fic, he is captured so well.

There is slash, however it is far from prevalent and only begins near the end of book 5. I don't read slash and I've read this series multiple times.

** This is a series of 4 fics written before book 5 by Chadsgirl824 [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/205010/chadsgirl824]]. They were amongst the first fics I ever read. I have not read them in 11 years but totally loved them. I don't think there is any slash, but it has been a long time and since that never bothered me it wouldn't register either way. Not H/Hr but other het pairings for Harry. First fic is Harry Potter and the Secret of the Blood.
