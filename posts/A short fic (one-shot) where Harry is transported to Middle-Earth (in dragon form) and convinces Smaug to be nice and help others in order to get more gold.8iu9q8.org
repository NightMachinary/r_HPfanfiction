It's only a few thousand words, tops. I don't remember for sure if it's its own one-shot story, or part of a collection, but I'm very sure it's not in the Infinite Loops collection.

I would link to the Ao3 account, but somehow it doesn't connect currently... so instead I link to the authors tumblr.

**** Esama has written many stories in many fandoms. I didn't know that particular one, but after looking at the profile on Ao3, I have to say yes. Well, if you mean [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3236603/chapters/7050041][this fanfiction]].
