Bit of backstory. It's a Naruto/HP crossover. Sasori ends up reborn as Harry. He uses magic to puppet his own body, allowing him to move far better than an 18 month old should and his parents think he's a super prodigy because of it. He's also begun getting fond of having parents again. For those who don't know Naruto: Sasori is a genius. He fought with puppets in his past life and was generally very cold, though immensely talented.

Edit: I edited it based on suggestions.

"Harry! Run!" His mother tried to push him but he jumped away, hooking his father's wrist with a string and yanking him out of the path of a sickly green light. He didn't know what it was but it didn't look good. "Harry!" The shrill panic in his mother's voice burned but he ignored it. He wasn't a child. He would stand and fight alongside his parents.

Out of the kitchen swarmed knives, controlled by careful movements. He sent them individually at first, but they were blasted to pieces before they could do much, so he sent the remainder as a cloud of sharp metal. Only a few sunk into flesh before a scorching fire melted the rest. He was forced to leap into the air to avoid a spell that shattered the floor where he'd stood, muscles protesting the sudden, strong movement. From the ruin rose a gnarled hand made of spikes of splintered hardwood. It tried to swipe at him, but quick work from his father turned the hand into a lion that wrenched free of the foundation and charged Voldemort.

Sasori landed and immediately sharp pain tore through his legs. He ignored it in favor of connecting to the bookshelf behind Voldemort and dragging it to try and crush him. Voldemort whipped his wand around and it exploded into fiery debris, setting portions of the living room alight. His mother switched from sending volleys of spellfire at Voldemort to putting the fire out and his father took over pressuring Voldemort. When Sasori saw Voldemort's wand snap up he grabbed it from the man's hand, only to grunt when it was yanked back by a much stronger magical force. Voldemort snarled and then everything was on fire. His throat burned with dryness and his eyes stung from the smoke. His arm was burned from his mother not pulling him back fast enough.

"Harry, please! Run!" His father begged. The stone wall he had used to shield them exploded without warning, showering the three defenders with sharp shards, leaving stinging cuts. Sasori dove to the side to avoid a bright white spell, hearing the wall behind him crack and rip. His muscles that had previously ached dully now screamed with sharp pain each time he moved. Struggling to stand on shaking legs, he saw his mother hit Voldemort's robes with something that sent him to the ground. Sasori exhaled once then dragged over the doll he'd been working on, the sharp glass embedded in its fingers shredding at Voldemort's prone form. A wave of the man's wand and the doll crumbled to sawdust. Then the wand was pointed at him. He tried to dive to the side but his legs suddenly seized and spasmed, sending him to the ground with a cry of pain.

Voldemort's wand glowed and he struggled to get his body to obey his magic, only washing himself in more pain. He heard the rush of air from the spell and braced to die again. Instead he was nearly crushed by a heavy weight crashing down on top of him. Immediately he could feel hot, sticky blood and smell the familiar coppery tang. His mother was screaming, a broken, enraged sound and he looked up to see his father slumped over him, most of the right half of his torso sprayed over the floor.

His heart thudded in his chest, agony unlike anything he had ever felt filling him. Expert movements connected him to his father through strings of magic and brought the man to his feet, wand clenched tight in a pale, bloodless hand. As he pushed magic through the strings they became visible, glowing brightly. He didn't know combat magic and all the spells during the battle were cast in silence save for one.

"Avada Kedavra!" A green light shot from his father's wand and Voldemort barely dodged. He was already casting again, cold determination reminiscent of when he was in the Akatsuki spreading through his body like a poison. Again and again he fired off the spell, Voldemort dragging furniture and debris in the way now even as he blocked and countered everything his mother sent at him. It was as he took a breath to cast again that Voldemort struck, a grey light he had no hope to dodge fully clipping him in the side. Blood sprayed from the deep cut and he cried out in pain, collapsing again.

His mother leapt in front of him but another spell and her wand was wrenched from her hand. Sasori looked up, watching her plead for his life, a horrific dread making his stomach churn. He was exhausted, limbs screaming and unresponsive. He couldn't protect her. Tears pricked in the corners of his eyes, burning his vision. He couldn't watch but couldn't bring himself to look away. Voldemort gave his mother one final chance to move, then the green curse shot from his wand and struck her in the chest. He couldn't hold in a gasp when she crumpled like a puppet, dead before her body even hit the ground.

Voldemort kicked her to the side and stood over him. A final, weak attempt to defend himself was brushed aside with a laugh.

"It's a shame, boy. I would love to know how you did all that, truly I would. With your genius and mine, we could have ruled the world together. But alas, that will never happen. Avada Kedavra."


** Your prose flows pretty well, but the typography and "writing-tone" (for lack of a better term) doesn't seem at all like a action packed fight scene. Same as the cinematography in film, the typography when writing should also reflect what's going on. The way you have written this sounds more like some kind of objective, calculated analysis..., but it seems to be written from Harry's POV who is not at all in a calmly measured state of mind during the events. It lacks any sense of urgency and needs a much more rapid pace.

In any case, a scene where 2-3 people die really shouldn't look like [[https://i.imgur.com/651XseD.png][this]] - irrespective of the actual words.

I'm not a brilliant writer, but here's my attempt at editing one of these long paragraphs:

#+begin_quote
  "Harry, please! Run!" his father begged. /[It's almost funny how you back-doored all the information on how James defended himself into the part of the sentence where you describe from where he begs... if James defense is important it deserves it's own sentence/action somewhere else]/

  Suddenly the stone wall exploded, showering the three defenders with sharp shards, leaving nicks and cuts. Sasori dove to the side while a bright white spell carved through the wall behind him as if it was butter. /[how is he even aware in which manner the spell carves through the wall behind him? Not to mention that a heated battle is hardly the time to document these things. You can make it much more visceral, by him hearing a loud explosion behind him or getting hit by debris, from the wall being destroyed or heavily damaged]/

  His muscles now screamed with a sharp pain each time he moved. Through sheer force of will he managed to stand up, just in time to see his mother hitting Voldemort's robes with something, sending him to the ground.

  Sasori took a breath and dragged over the doll he'd been working on, the sharp glass embedded into its fingers shredding at Voldemort's prone form until it was crushed with a sweep of that damn wand /[I can't fix this, this sentence is too complicated and it's not 100% clear what's going on physically]/. Again he made to dodge as the wand was leveled at him, but his legs suddenly seized and spasmed. He fell to his knees with an involuntary cry of pain. /[get rid of all the redundancies, the reader can probably infer that Harry is trying to move here, no need to explain that dodging a spell involves movement]/

#+end_quote

Tell me, why did you feel the need to use a passive voice, why did you consider to detach your readers from the events by emphasising on that Sasori did /feel/ pain to be preferable to actually describing what he feels?\\
What in "he felt pain" does in your mind make for a better story than something like "a spark of white-hot agony raced up his thigh" or "every nerve in his calf screamed itself hoarse as a spell carved its way through the flesh and left behind a coarse mince"?

*** I mean I didn't "feel the need". I'm a very wordy, describe not show the action type writer which is why I asked for critique.

**** Point being, you are NOT describing anything, you are just telling, you are actively disengaging your readers from the character by using this un-emotive and mechanistic phrasing.

** I just want to say that this concept is really cool. I can really imagine him controlling an army of dead puppet wizards, each able to do magic.
