Stories where Harry can do unheard of magical things like apparating across the globe or breaking the transfiguring laws because he was never told that you can't do that with magic.


** I absolutely love these fics. I can just imagine someone like Ron cottoning onto this very quickly, and just covering Hermiones mouth when she goes to tell him that Magic doesn't work that way because Harrys odd way of doing magic could potentially win them the war against Voldemort.

"So you know how a Protego can stand up to most spells but can get broken by solid objects? I figured if I conjured a metal rod or a spike and layered it with a stunning spell or something, the rod would break through the shield and the spell on the rod would hit the person!"

"But Harry, magic doe-MMPH!"

"What Hermione was about to say, Harry, is that sounds like a great idea and you should get started with that right away!"

*** Do you know any like that? I love when Ron is used like that, though it doesn't have to be Ron,, just as long as there's no Ron bashing in the story since I love his character.

And really, Harry learned the Patronus charm at age 13, something that is suppose to be super hard to learn. He also managed to cast it in front of Dementors, which is something he fears the most, he definitely has a lot of this kind of potential.

**** Sorry mate. Normally when I see a request thread for something I dont know any fanfics for, I'll write a little scene or mini-fic for the OP to enjoy while they continue looking for a complete fic. It's my way of slowly getting back into the swing of writing after a five year hiatus. Hope you manage to find a good fic tho

** "Why do brooms have a maximum speed at all? Can't you just make one that can go as fast as you want? If muggle planes can fly supersonic, why can't we?"

"You can't, hover charms act on the ground, they need to be more powerfully cast with the square of the desired velocity, it'd take several ridiculously powerfully wizards just to get to mach 1. It's arithmantically proven."

"Then we don't use hover charms. How about we take /Arresto Momentum/, invert it to continuously generate momentum over time, dp/dt = F = ma, thus creating acceleration that allows us to accelerate faster no matter how fast we're already going?"

Five years later:

"This is the /GSN King Ragnuk/ of the Gringotts Navy, requesting permission to dock with Tycho station. We found something weird in the Phoebe mine."

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts) has Harry use a complete different style of magic, because nobody told him he couldn't do it, and he continues to use his magic even after he begins to attend Hogwarts.

Things he does because he wasn't told he couldn't include flying without a broom and taking the form of other people without Polyjuice.

**** I really enjoyed the first book, but towards the end the Pragmatic!Harry really starts to fall into the trope of a Harry that doesn't understand or fully desire human relationships. He sees people as useful or not useful and resists seeing them as people. A shame for me as that has started to become one of my pet peeves. I really enjoyed the premise but I kind of lost my desire to keep reading about that kind of empathy lacking Harry.

***** I think Ron and Lavender could have worked out if Lavender chilled on the PDA and Ron actually cared (because I do agree that Ron did take advantage of her feelings towards the end). For all Lavender's faults, she showed obvious, consistent interest in Ron which is more than I can say for goddess Hermione. Ignoring the bickering aspect of the 'ship, Hermione never saw Ron's potential and constantly put him down - [[https://www.quora.com/Isnt-Hermione-somehow-harsh-to-Ron][see this link for more]]. If my crush complimented our mutual best friend, calling them 'fanciable' and 'scarred' and 'tall' when I'm all those things as well, I'd take that as a sign of disinterest.

If they had talked things out and made more of an effort, they could have gone somewhere. Even if they still broke up, it could have ended more amicably. It's really sad that their relationship was played for laughs and so that Ron could become 'deserving' of Hermione.

** reminded me of a scene from Tenhawk's Shadow Council series (probably difficult to find, since Tenhawk Presents no longer exists, apparently). it's a Harry Potter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Addams Family crossover. the basic premise is Xander and Wednesday at Hogwarts, occasionally interacting with Harry due to their friendship with Hermione.

​

anyway, at one point, they have harry practicing a shield spell, where he somehow summons an actual metal shield rather than just conjuring a temporary version. and then not remembering how he did it, causing Xander to have to resist the urge to strangle Harry.

good read, overall.

edit: actually found a link to it:

** The entire premise of linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) is based around Harry believing he can do things with transfiguration that no one has ever done before to heal his parents, who were crucio'd instead of Neville's. Very dark Indy Harry, but there's some neat stuff in it.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  After finding a torn comic in the trash when told to clean Dudley's room, four year old Harry Potter puts it together with some odd things that have happened around him, and concludes that he's the Avatar. - Not a crossover so much as a fic in which Harry Potter is convinced that Avatar: The Last Airbender is a historical documentary.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

*** Not necessarily. If they were raised in a very practical environment like I imagine Hermione did, they would know that things have limits and therefore magic would have limits too.
