** linkao3(147439) *Into the Fold* is the first one which comes to mind. It's a great (and long) look at the years leading up to the first war.

** linkao3(Hatching Robin by Teao) is exactly this (and more believable than the canon in his motivation to spy for Dumbledore). It is the prequel to linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao), which is too smutty but otherwise pretty good fem!Harry story.

  A young Severus makes yet another mistake, and discovers that it's not only joining the Death Eaters that has far-reaching consequences.This is a prequel to 'Becoming Harriet', dealing with Robin's early life. It's going to be episodic and fluffy, and will probably be most interesting if you've read at least a bit of Harriet!

  Harry gets a surprise on his seventeenth birthday when he discovers a secret Lily Potter took to her grave; a secret that will change his life forever.He must learn to interact with the wizarding world all over again, and discovers the darker sides of inequality and misogyny. Not HBP compliant.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
