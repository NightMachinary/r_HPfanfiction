In England, wizards are not integrated into the muggle population but rather live between them. Diagon Alley and the Leaky Cauldron are on Charing Cross road, not some rural road. We also know that the headquarters of MACUSA is in New York. If we assume that this is a trend for first-world countries, what would the effects of dropping atomic bombs be? We don't know if there is shielding or protective enchantments that can withstand an atomic bomb. Even if major wizarding settlements or places survived the dropping, the radiation would still harm them (even if to a lesser extent). Also, wizards not in a major settlement, and just among the regular public would probably be killed or evaporated as well.

Also, what would the response of the ICW be? If the japanese wizards know about it, would they share it with other countries?


** I would think that unlike the British, the Soviet wizards and MACUSA did pay attention here. They implemented magical protections for their countries' nuclear arsenals and defused several near misses, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** Remember, Japan was not exactly what we would now call a first world country during WW2. It was just transitioning out of isolation (and a good part of the war was about securing resources/it's place in the world during that transition)

A better candidate for your question would be 'what did wizards do during the bombing of london'. The assumptions there are much smaller...

But that's the issue precisely. The bombing of London only caused "small" explosions that are well within the borders of what magic can reasonably withhold, from what we've seen in canon. By contrast, a /Nuclear explosion that wipes out an entire city/ is on another level entirely, and it's far less certain wizards could have protected themselves from it. As for Japan just transitioning out of isolation at that time --- that's /muggle/ Japan. The wizarding community of Japan could very well have been a first-rate world power and we wouldn't know.

**** Sure, but they could also very well have been established after the war, instead of being an old magical community.

Or (given the relative lack of 'swords and sorcery' mythology in eastern countries) it could be that they never had the integration with the non-magic world that happened in Europe.

My point was, unlike the rest of Europe, which shares a common history (and situation of generations of European conflict), Japan is far enough removed from England in WW2 that the assumption that they share a common situation with England.

(Of course, I would fully expect cannon to have a school there eventually, as it is a global franchise and Universal Studios Japan has a HP theme park there :P )

I think my favorite idea about why Japan doesn't have the same 'Medieval Magic' concept that you see in the west is that "Medieval Swords and Sorcery" is used because it is something (Medieval setting) that is familiar to the population but not too familiar, so that they pick up the environment quickly but don't balk when you add fantastical elements. For Japan, you often see these types of stories set in 'ancient china-like kingdom', which has a similar familiar but not to familiar status (And given that HP is just a 'modern' version of S&S...)

**** There was no way magic could contain a blast like bomb going off. From what we saw in the movies and books blasting curses threw off very little shrapnel and a lot less energy. Bombs like that a direct hit there's nothing left. Shrapnel could easily punch through a shield. Even Dumbledore could not stop all the glass he had to transfigured it into sand. The bomb would simply kills the wizard. Even if none of those things made it through there would still be enough force to liquidate organs and move them around.

***** The glass-sand and all that, that's all movie-only. The best interpretation of /Protego/ I've seen is that it's not a "deflector shield" sort of thing, it's a magical barrier that will /protect you no matter what/, except from Dark Magic especially designed for piercing a Shield Charm (i.e. the Killing Curse). A Shield Charm could thus sustain absolutely anything non-magical, no matter the force behind it. A /Protego/ could protect you from a nuclear blast --- only, you couldn't keep it up forever and the radiations and heat would get you.

**** Forget London, Tokyo was basically leveled by Firebombs. The atomic bombs, while significantly more psychologically damaging, were certainly not the only means of complete destruction. (This is the argument you often hear in defense of dropping the A-Bomb, that it wasn't really more horrifying than anything else happening in that war)

If you are worried about the magical response to Hiroshima, Tokyo is just as questionable. And if you handwave that magical Japan was based out of the old capital (Kyoto), then you could say the same about Hiroshima...

****** To be fair, even if you ignore the insane destruction that is WW2, it is highly unlikely that anyone with that level of integration into the world could ignore it being wartorn. Europe was certainly wartorn for much of the previous 1000 years before WW2. I don't care if you can shield against it: Stopping falling rocks and avoiding sieges will require some thought.

Of course, you could go with "When it gets tough, the magical community retreats into itself and closes off access from the Muggle world". Then you are arguing more for 'It isn't that magicals didn't notice, but they didn't notice it was significantly worse than the previous conflicts', which does fit in with the books. But you are assuming when the fighting starts the Leaky Cauldron shuts itself off behind magical barriers till it is over....

*** I'm not sure I would agree with Japan transitioning out of isolation during/after WW2. Many analysts/historians believe Japan's isolation ended in 1853 when Matthew Perry led American Black Ships to force the opening of Japan to America.

**** I guess I was more referring to their attempted transformation into a colonization power. They way they were dragged out of isolation shattered their perception of their own power, and they then tried to imitate the successful nations to reach their level of power. Of course, the problem with being the last one to the game of Imperialism is that the countries heading into post-imperialism start to take a negative view on it. Particularly with the result of WW1.

It wasn't the immediate effect of the end of isolationism, but Japan's transformation period (which was remarkable) was certainly informed by it.

Besides, for the sake of this conversation, 80 years is really nothing. If you continue with 'magical community is behind the non-magical one', ...
