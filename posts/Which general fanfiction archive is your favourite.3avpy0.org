Of course, there are shipper archives dedicated one or more particular ships (my favourite is SIYE, obviously), but between things like FF.Net and AO3 (and others, which I'm probably unaware of), which one do you prefer?

AO3 is good enough, IMO, especially since you can directly cut down to the pairing you like, but I prefer FF.Net, especially since I feel it's more "entrenched" into fandom (it's been around for much longer than AO3 if I remember correctly).

Thoughts?

Yeah, no. This is the kinda thing you tend to find when trying to search on AO3:

*** And it's an abandoned story with only one chapter, 2000 words long, that ends in a cliffhanger. Sounds like ao3

**** I feel ya, but even on ffnet, how many fics are incomplete and marked your OTP even though they don't interact in the 2000 words posted? I think this a user error not an archive error, personally. Annoying though.

I know some authors on ao3 add pairings as they go, which is nice. But what annoys me more on some is the fics tagged 2000 fandoms when the author uses the post as a catchall for their 62 word drabbles. And when they update, the story is at the top of all 2000 fandoms. That really pisses me off, when 1 of the 739 chapters is in a fandom I care about remotely and the rest is 1d or something.

** Once you figure out how the tag filtering on AO3 works, it's easily one of the best fic sites if you're looking for something specific, but it has only been around for a few years, so most of the "classics" are on ffn.

That said, I'm glad the filtering on ffn has gotten better over time, though you still get abandoned fics marked as complete no matter which archive you use.

** Since I've been reading recs from here rather than trying to search on my own, I have to say I really like the download feature on AO3, 'cause I can put stuff on my kindle to read. I am also partial to FF.net just because it's so familiar to me.

** Feature-wise, everything looks stuck in the early '00s; that's my web dev side talking. AO3 would be perfectly fine with a tag limit. None of the sites have good search, which is a pity, but after a decade of trawling fic sites, I'm used to it. For the community and overall writing quality, nothing beats HPFF for me. That's where I started writing.

*** *web dev fist-bump*

One of these days I'll finish that fic metadata aggregator and review site I've been "working" on. I get into that cycle where I work on it for a while, wander off, eventually see some new library or something I think looks cool and start over to experiment with it.

**** Oh /same/. I really want to help out HPFF, but I'm just way too exhausted after work, and I still want to write! But looking at these old archives, it seems easier to start from scratch than to work off old ones (what every dev thinks, I'm sure :P). My ideal as a reader would probably be something formatted like Medium. Bottom bar with all the fixings, easy to read, inline commenting.

** Ff.net is my preferred archive, but I'll occasionally check ao3 and sites like Granger enchanted for new/recently complete novel length stuff.

One thing I do prefer about ao3 is being able to sort by word count. Wish I could do that on ffn.

** FF.net has a bajillion fics, so I tend to get my stuff there. The percentage of good fics is the same, but the sheer number of fics makes the number of good fics go up.

** Its pretty close between FF.net and Portkey. If someone could give me the search functionality of FF.net combined with the archives of it, Portkey, AO3, and the deleted stuff from the FF.net purges, I would pay for access.

Throw in a decent download system and you may as well delete the other sites.
