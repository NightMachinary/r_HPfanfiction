Hello everyone,

linkffn(12869808) linkao3(13984629)

a few days ago I published the second chapter of 'The Avalon Project', which is my first foray into writing Fanfiction myself. So far the responses were very positive, much more so than I expected, especially for a newbie like me, as well as for fic in a niche that has barely any submissions. So I guess I am feeling bold now, and I'll take the plunge to show it to a bigger audience by posting it here.

If you're feeling like leaving a bit of feedback, I'd be very grateful :) I published the fic on ff.net, as well as on ao3, so you can choose to read on whatever platform you like better.

Thank you in advance. Cheers!
