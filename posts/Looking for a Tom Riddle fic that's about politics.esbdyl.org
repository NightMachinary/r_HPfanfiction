:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember much of it, I think the main it was that after leaving school Tom opens a shop in diagon alley and absolutely fucks over the ministry by bending the rules but still staying within the law. At some point he starts giving drugs to teens and saying it's a "centaur ritual" by having centaurs there. Then the teens start lobbying for legalising this drug? And other shenanigans of the same vein.

#+begin_quote
  New legislation mandates all individuals campaigning for the post of Minister of Magic, must be a Pureblood of at least three (3) generations. Tom Riddle is a genius, and originally he was planning on just murdering his way into this, but now?Well.Tom Riddle was a very very petty man,and nobody discriminates against him.OrTom Riddle decides to fuck with the Ministry of Magic, becomes Lawful Evil, and somehow, accidentally, gets a literal goat in office.
