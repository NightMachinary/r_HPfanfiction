SM Stirling's Draka series takes place in a world where the Dutch supported the American Revolution, and the British claim the Dutch Cape Colony, and send American loyalists there.

The American Loyalists begin to expand throughout Africa, and are joined by Ex-Confederates after the American Civil War. They develop a warrior-like society, along with a strong slave culture. They conquer all of Africa by the end of the 19th century, and join WW1 on the side of the Entente. They conquer the Ottomon Empire after the war.

During WW2, the Draka conquer the Nazi empire, along with Russia and China.

To give you an idea of just how awful they are, they rape nuns and impale entire villages. Their enslave all of Europe, and intend on conquering the world. They're so awful, you end up rooting for NAZIS because they aren't the Draka. They liberally use nuclear weapons. Technology is more advanced in this timeline, though, since the Draka invested their mineral wealth into R&D.

The end of the Final War in the 1990s between the Domination and the Alliance for Democracy ends with the Draka unleashing a zombie plague on the Alliance, and conquering it. They enslave mankind, and genetically engineer their ruling class to be dominant over their genetically engineered slaves, who are incapable of rebelling.

A remnant of the Alliance does escape to Alpha Centauri, though.

Mind you, this scenario is not realistic, at all. Most of it is laughable, but Stirling intended it to be sort of a 'What if the Villains had the same plot-armor as the heroes' kind of story.

What might the Wizarding World look like in this timeline? Would they try to help?Would they beat the Draka or vice-versa?

TL;DR: The Wizarding World in a universe with a wanked South Africa that conquers the world because reasons.

EDIT: Messed up the title.
