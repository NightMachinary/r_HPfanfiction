My favorite is Draco/Hermione, Dramione. I don't know what it is but I seem to be drawn to fics with those characters, I'm on the look out for any good fics starring them. I feel like I've read all of the good ones already.


** I'll read just about anything, but my favorite non-canon pairing is Hermione/Snape. I also like Hermione/Harry and Ron/Luna. And I love to read Snape-as-a-mentor stories (not a pairing, I know, but I gravitate toward fics with Snape as an important character.)

** I like lots of non canon ships.

Hermione / Snape - seriously some of the best writing in the fandom and often angsty meaty fun stories.

Hermione / Draco - more fun and just opposites attracting.

Non romantic Snape / Harry, mentor fics rewrite canon in so many ways.

Harry / Draco - there always seemed a touch of something more in their obsession with each other, but these are very hit and miss.

** Harry/Pansy

The possibility for stories with these two are endless, but what usually happens is they change Pansy too much. I've read one of the more popular fics where she was acting stupid for Draco and was really smart, wearing a glamour to look ugly when she was really beautiful, hated Slytherin, etc.

I want to make one where she still has all her flaws. Ugly, selfish, bully, all that stuff gosh darn it!

Right now I'm reading through every novel length Harry/Tonks story I can find.

When it comes to slash, I don't know. I can't really read it unless it's very pg13. Any explicitness just kind of turns me off of a story. Although when it is slash, I prefer Harry/Draco with a Snape mentor.

** H/Hr, also H/Daphne or possibly H/Fleur. I can't read H/G stories /shudder/ Also, Snape as a mentor (no slash) and H/Draco friendship only.

** I'm exclusively a Harry reader so I have no real concern for pairings between other characters. I'm also not finicky about who Harry's paired with. I figure as long as he's happy, I'm happy.

** *Tomione.* Hands down.

I'm currently reading "precious mudblood" for the third time. There simply aren't enough dark LV/HG fics out there...sigh..[[http://members.adultfanfiction.net/profile.php?no=1296886882&view=story&zone=hp]]

EDIT: Since you like Dramione, I should mention there is some light Dramione in the story.

** Harry/Hermione mostly because I love Hermione and no one else seems right for her. Harry/Ginny also isn't too bad.

Rose/Scorpius is the one I read the most of probably. At least it is the pairing I read when I am looking for romance. Any other ship that I like demonizes certain characters (Weasleys or Dumbledore). These two people are so perfect for each other, even though we don't actually know what either of them is like based on canon. They are still great, especially if both of them are smart, and their dislike eventually leads to liking each other.

This morning as I lay in bed I came up with a new idea for a Scorrose story. One of the main reasons incest is bad and the reason it has developed to be frowned upon is because of the potential for birth defects. Wizards have perfect prophylactics against pregnancy so there is no need for there to be a stigma against incest. In this story, Rose and Albus are in a relationship that is completely accepted by everyone and not stigmatized at all. Rose and Scorpius dislike each other, just conflicting personalities. Albus and Scorpius are friends, mostly centered around Quidditch. Eventually Rose and Scorpius have their normal trend from enemies to friends to relationship, with the help of Albus. Since he is friends with both of them, he understands it more and is able to get rid of any jealousy and so they have a poly relationship with Rose being with both Albus and Scorpius. They have a few moments of threesomeness at the urging of Rose, even though neither Albus or Scorpius is truly bi. They just aren't opposed to it enough to shut it down. Rose has a need to match people up and eventually more people are added to their group, at which point Scorpius and Albus, as well as some other people, become uncomfortable with the gay and communal aspects, talk to Rose about it, who is understanding, and the relationships become more private. They are still in a poly clique at school who everyone views as a little weird, but not as much as it would be in a school in the normal world. The relationships between individuals are still just as loving and emotional and everything as they would be in a monogamous relationship, there are just multiple. The people have managed to control their jealousy and possessiveness, if necessary with the help of magic. The end. Or they could go fight a war as a squad and have some of them die, but that's depressing.
