I have been on a bit of a time travel story binge the last few days and I keep coming across the same Gary Stu/Mary sue boring/perfect characters and I'm sick of it.

I just want a story with an intresting complex characters, strengths and flaws.

I usually prefer Harry centric stories where he isn't dark and that focuses on action/story more than romance. It doesn't have to be time travel or anything, I just want good characters.

Thanks!


** !linkffn(Stages of Hope)

Some pretty amazingly broken characters, as I'm sure many in this sub will attest to.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** You might enjoy [[http://hpmor.com/][/Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/]], also available [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][on fanfiction.net]]. Pretty much every character is more complex than their canon counterparts (because they're /smarter/ than their canon counterparts), even if Harry doesn't notice because of his own flaws. And Harry has a lot of flaws along with his strengths. Don't let "Harry's not acting like a normal 11-year-old" put you off - he's really not supposed to act like one, the author did that on purpose.

As for your preference descriptors:

- Harry-centric: check!
- not dark Harry: check!
- focus on action / story over romance: not all that action-heavy (although there are some great action scenes), but has lots of plot and very little romance

It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's worth taking the author's advice and giving the first 10 chapters a shot.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
