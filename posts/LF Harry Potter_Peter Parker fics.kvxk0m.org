  “Just tell me you've got somewhere to stay kid.” Stark practically begged.At least this one Harry could answer positively.“Oh yeah, it's fine. My house came with me."...“I've changed my mind. You're not Oliver Twist. You're Dorothy.” Thanks to good old Black family paranoia, Harry finds himself stranded in a world full of superheroes.Peter's got a crush, Harry's oblivious, and Tony thinks his kids are hilarious.

  It was all gone.Magic was gone.Even two decades couldn't possibly wipe out the Wizarding World without a trace. Harry didn't know what this world was, but he knew it wasn't his own.He was alone.---------------Harry Potter wakes up in an alley in New York City to a world vastly different than the one he knows. Apparently muggles can fly in Iron suits, super soldiers exist, and his neighbour might be that spider-man fellow.
