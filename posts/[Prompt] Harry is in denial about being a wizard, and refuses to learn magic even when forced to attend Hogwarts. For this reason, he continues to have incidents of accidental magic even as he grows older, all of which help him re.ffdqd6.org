Bonus points if, whenever he has an incident of accidental magic, he finds increasingly ludicrous (but not magical) ways of justifying what happened.


** So basically every situation involving Harry is a Deus ex Machina.

** Reminds me of Sanya from The Dresden Files. Wields a literal Holy Sword given to him by the Archangel Micheal. He's agnostic. Yes, he has a powerful sword delivered to him by 'someone'. But an Angel? Micheal could've been an alien. Or something.

*** Eh, not exactly. It's supposed to be a sort of hatred and/or repression of one's magic. Hard to do those if you actually think it's not real.

***** No, JKR explicitly said the reason Harry didn't become an Obscurial is because he didnt know magic existed, and so he had no way to know that he needed to repress anything. The idea you're suggesting makes no sense. It's a performative contradiction.

****** But you're forgetting OP is saying Harry will be in DENIAL. Not that he's ignorant of its existence. But refuses to believe it exists. Completely different mindsets.

******** Reread the prompt and then my statement. He's in a magical school learning magic. While refusing to believe is real. It's black and white. People around the world suppress and are in denial. And even then by nature people are contradictory.

********** The way I understand the OP is that Harry don't denial that something happens whenever the Magic happens. He just says it's no magic and finds more and more ludicrous seemingly logical explanations why it happens. Because can't be magic 'cause there is no thing like magic ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‰
