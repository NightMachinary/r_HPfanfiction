Ok so I assume most of us here read fanfiction fairly often, however I there a portrayals in fics that we don't like. I was recently questioning if this came down to film portrayal or even book portrayal.

For instance if you look at the portrayal of Remus Lupin by David Thewlis especially in POA his performance outshines cannon depiction and I think its one of the reasons Remus Lupin is portrayed fairly well in Fannon. I mean it is a brilliant performance.

I was wondering if there are any other performances from the films that change how you see the character.

PS. I love how nearly all of the characters are portrayed in the films I just think Remus Lupin's is one of the best :D


** Snape and Draco wouldn't be remotely as appreciated by the fandom if it wasn't for the movies.

******* But the films solidified Harry Potter, and you cannot deny that.

Hell I came onto this franchise becuase of the movies, my older sister preferred the books but i couldnt read a full novel when I was younger so I watched the movies instead. Than I got a little bit older, read all the books apart from DH and watched the films in cinema than read it.

The films made Harry Potter

** First things first: canon, not cannon; fanon, not fannon. I see this so many times I can't help but cringe. Sorry.

Now then, here are some obvious ones I have interpreted from the wider community:

- Films made magic much more simple - fireworks and sparks due to the visual nature of it being more conducive to film as a visual medium. The FB movies are a /bit/ better in this regard, but they sort of also make magic seem much more easy (casting AK like its nothing).
- Snape and Draco are the obvious villanous standouts. Both are portrayed with more charisma while toning down their respective viciousness. Snape's behavior as a teacher comes across more as an overtly strict teacher than as a sadistic jerk, while Draco is portrayed more as a arrogant but popular rich kid than as 'New Money classicist product of nepotism' that he is in the books.
- Sirius is way more sane. I mean, the portrayal in OOTP by Oldman is such a contrast that its almost staggering. And I think that tends to bleed into a lot of fanon.
- Dementors as being physical beings with literal effects on people and the weather. I mean, it looks good in PoA film, but the dementors only affect perception, they don't fly so much as hover, and they certainly don't lift people into the air.
- Ron and Hermione in particular get this treatment. Their respective good qualities (and even memorable lines and moments) ended up being compounded into Hermione while diminishing Ron with their bad qualities. Thats probably the worst one out of everything - that they made the two more caricatures than anything.

*** Mostly agree, but:

-The books represent most spells as fireworks and sparks, the movies didn't create that. As early as Chamber of Secrets, Harry and Malfoy are described as shooting colored lights out of their wands at each other. Some spells aren't described as having them ever (Body Binding Curse), but Rowling seems to have thought it a better choice for her magic (I agree, tbh).

-Its not really easy to see how the portrayal of at least Draco you're asking for is possible. He mostly did act as an arrogant, bigoted rich popular kid until really HBP, where he had to do something himself. He hadn't had much opportunity for much directly vicious before OoTP. All that's left is his petty name calling and bullying before.

-The Dementors are physical beings in the books. I feel like you've flipped it. Yes the film's make them fly (which actually makes more sense with things like them going at Harry on a Quidditch pitch, where people would otherwise outfly them), but the books have them mostly walk around and open doors and such normally (like on the train) instead of using telekinesis to open them and making the air feel cold while not actually lowering the temperature. If anything, the books just have them have less "real" affects on the environment and but as really tall, mysterious hooded figures.

** Ron, I think the hate he gets in fanon is due to his poor characterization in the films and the writer giving all his best lines to Hermione. Not bashing Rupert Grint, I think he is a good actor. Remus was OK, until he disappeared in Harry's 4th year, with all the shit Harry was dealing with he didn't even send him a letter. And trying to abandon his kid and Tonks in DHs doesn't endear him to me. His woe I'm a werewolf is annoying.

*** I don't think it's entirely the film's fault - I think a good bit of it is from the books. IMO, it comes from him being the most 'normal' of the trio - where Harry is the protagonist & literal chosen one (not a /huge/ fan of that narrative choice myself) and Hermione is the researcher/genius of the lot, Ron doesn't have any highly visible strengths in that same vein. He's important and great, of course - but of the trio he's the one that seems 'easiest' to replace with a character a writer might be more interested in (eg, Neville, Luna, etc). His actions in not believing Harry a few times stick out - eg, the one in 4th year (despite objectively being a minor spat) stands out as larger due to how it made Harry feel and how it was emphasized in the book.

The films being faster paced did hurt him a bit, IMO - past just giving some of his lines to Hermione, Ron always shone in the more relaxed parts of the books IMO, where his humor was the best fit. Not having as much time to cover the day to day situation - or to convey how Harry feels about finally being included in a family like the Weasleys, or how important his friendship to his best/first friend is - makes Ron take another backseat.

Oh, and of course - Ron ending up with Hermione does exacerbate the issue somewhat, because a lot of people don't see them as a great fit - and obviously, taking a side on the shipping wars is dangerous ;)

*** I hear you, it's why I love David Thewlis portrayal, and I hear you on the Ron part. There's definitely moments when the chemistry between Ron and Harry in the movies is there but it's 100% not a great portrayal mainly I think to the writing. I don't doubt, they are great movies it's just they could have given Ron better lines. I definitely think that the way Ron was portrayed in the films leads to his bashing in Fannon, but I also think it leads to wanting Harmony fics without alienating Ron (have read good fics where Ron also wants them together so I think it just takes a good writer). I also think it leads to the whole “Molly dilemma” as I like to call it. Both films and books portrayed her similarly which is a protective mother who loves her children unconditionally. But it leads into the whole “Weasley” bashing.

**** Can you recommend the Harmony fics that you read. I am a huge fan of the pairing but can't stand Ron bashing.

As for your question, I think Dumbledore was also affected by the movies. As impressive as his duel against Voldemort in the Ministry was; it failed to tell just how good Dumbledore actually was.

In the books the Order is getting curb stomped without managing to down a single Death Eater. Then Dumbledore enters, just flicks his wand and tada all Death Eaters wrapped and ready to be shipped to a cell.

The movies also made Ron a bit more unsympathetic in that scene in the scene in which he left the hunt. In the books he does not actually say that Harry's parents were dead and that he had no family. So definitely that.

The movies also gave Harry, Hermione and their relationship a new light with the scene where Harry says that he had known he had to die for a while and that he thinks that Hermione did too. Not to mention Hermione saying that she would go with him. That whole scene was one of the strongest in the movies.

** Movie Snape I think is one of the reasons why he's so popular in fandom. And it's not just that Alan Rickman is very charismatic and doesn't look and act half as unpleasant as book Snape, it's also how they changed some scenes to make him look better. PoA, for example -- in books Snape's at his worst when he tries to get two innocent (and he knows that) men killed and loses it so much that he has to be knocked out. But in movies he's a hero who shields the kids from werewolf with his own body. And it's the later version that I often see fanfic authors use.

** It's hard to confirm specific correlations between the movies and how they've affected fandom/fanon perspectives. With Snape and Draco, for example, the choice of actors and portrayal may have impacted the number of fans, but morally dubious characters with (potentially) redeeming characteristics are pretty much always fandom catnip.

There are a few notable exceptions, though, such as Hermione's Mudblood scar which is pretty ubiquitous. Same with the dementors and magic visuals.

Other times, such as with Ginny's characterization or with the ages of the adult cast, I find fanfiction usually sticks closer to the book.
