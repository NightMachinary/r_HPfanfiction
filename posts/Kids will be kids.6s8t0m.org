So, this request might be a bit tricky to fill, we'll see.

Does anyone have a goodfic featuring Hogwarts' children being viewed as, you know, children?

If you've never read [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4829807][Faith and the Devil]] I recommend giving it a looksee because the SI protagonist offers a rather splendid perspective on the goings on of Hogwarts. The thing to remember is that the first years are /Eleven/. Do you remember what you were like at eleven? I know /I/ was an idiot. Eleven year olds are dumb, and because we see things from Harry's perspective over the course of the books, we are strongly biased towards sympathizing with him. So, when he says one of the big mean Slytherins looks like a troll... /maybe/ he's just being a bratty fucking *child*.

One of the ways this gets problematically internalized in the fandom is the Hogwarts houses. Now, I didn't go to a boarding school, but apparently at the large English sort houses aren't uncommon. And the point of the house system, the /only/ real point, is to divide the children up into groups so they'll be easier to manage. That's why the four houses have almost identical numbers of students sorted into them each year. That's why the teachers don't seem to care too much for the house rivalry. Because, from an adult perspective, it is incredibly juvenile. The reason people in each house tend to act like their house's virtues is not because they actually have them, but because an authority figure, in this case a hat, told them that was the sort of person they should identify as. There have been numerous posts about things like Hermione's great intelligence (a Ravenclaw trait), Snape's bravery (a Gryfindor thing), and even Cedric's thirst for glory (another Gryfindorish trait). Hogwarts' Sorting Ceremony is not intended to sort out the nerds, the jocks, the preps, and the stoners into four tidy clumps, it is not intended to tell you who you are and who you are destined to become. It's just there to make it easier for the teachers to schedule classes for the kids. The End.

Now, it isn't entirely unreasonable for some of the things in Hogwarts to have lasting effects. These kids are legal adults when they leave school, and they don't have any sort of College to go to where they could forget about the jerks they knew in grade school. They are expected to be complete and fully functioning members of society the moment they get their NEWT scores in. So it makes at least a little bit of sense for the 6th and 7th years to be acting as if their peers are just, the most important thing in their life, omg dad, you don't understand me!

Does anyone have any fics told from a more mature perspective, by someone who looks at all the little pranks and snipings between the children and just rolls their eyes because, seriously, this is so unimportant and yet it is being treated as deadly serious?

*** It's easy to get caught up in the story, particularly if the tone is more serious, and forget that we are looking at children, in a school, interacting with other children. Like, come on guys. Seriously.

While I say here I don't like that kind of portrayal of children, it won't cause me to stop reading a story.

The first years are all little cunts in this one, iirc.

** That would be a breath of fresh air. It's always painful to read through a staff meeting where they go around the table asking about their 'lions' and 'snakes'.

Even worse when they identify -- /into their eldest years/ -- their virtues and flaws from a house in grade school.

*** I actually think that after seven formative years at Hogwarts, people will remember one's house, and will attribute a lot of character traits to that house, whether they really fit the character or not. So, when a former Gryffindor and a former Slytherin do something smart and brave, people will say "He's a Gryffindor" and "He's a Slytherin" resp., even if both did the same.

**** Sure, I can see that within the world. I personally enjoy the fantasy aspect of it all, but I definitely do not look at my past self from 11-17 and think 'that's what made me who I am today'.

In such a small community like Wizarding Britain though, I can see people looking at traits in such a way.

** linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided). The Sorting Hat literally tells the kids that they're overreacting to their sorting, and a big theme is that anyone can really go anywhere (and that houses are mostly arbitrary).

Also minor spoiler, but [[/spoiler][it's revealed at the end that the adults pretended to care a lot of the children's drama, when they really didn't.]] which you might like as well.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?
