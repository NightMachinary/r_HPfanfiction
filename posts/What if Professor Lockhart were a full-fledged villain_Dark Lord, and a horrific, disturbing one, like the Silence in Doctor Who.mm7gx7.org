You wonder why it's suddenly so late in the afternoon after you had that really short conversation with the Professor. It's because he had a conversation with you multiple times and wiped your memory until it came out in his favor. He has this weird, psychotic smile as he teaches his class, because he just raped a student while the other students were forced to watch.

Many people feel uncomfortable around him, but they don't know why, since he obviously seems like such a nice guy. In fact, he seems to always know just the right things to say.


** That would be really scary!

***** No, I don't. Do you have any ideas? Would strategy skills help? A hidden pensieve? Occlumency?

I'm thinking my fic would have Ron be a strategist, and maybe also an engineer who is fascinated in the way things work. But I read somewhere that one should write the villain first. Lockhart would also be a strategist, a strategist of manipulation. And he wouldn't be outed and laughed at in the same year he is introduced, he would continue teaching in the following years, events somehow building up as it is revealed how horrifying he is.

And I definitely want some kind of Antimemetics Division style horror in it.

****** One thing to build it up could be Ron slowly noticing the discrepiences in his memories(like how he loses time.) If the student that's raped is close to Ron, they could start having nightmares and scream out things, but never remember the dreams when they wake up. Ron himself could have strange dreams too. Eventually Ron could slowly put together the pieces through Lockhart's behavior and the lost pieces of time and memory. He could learn occulmency to try to protect his mind, or use a hidden pensieve like you said. He'd probably build a strategy from that.

What's Antimemetics?

******* Antimemetics is the fictional field of research/warfare that specializes in understanding and fighting:

- infohazards (things that are dangerous just by knowing about it, like Roko's Basilisk if you are unfortunate enough to know what it is)
- cognitohazards (things that are dangerous to perceive, like the eyes of the actual basilisk in HP)
- memetic hazards (memes that are supernaturally self-propagating)
- anti-memetic hazards (things that delete/hide information supernaturally, i.e. self-keeping secrets or the Fidelius charm)

A competent, villain Lockhart that could reliably erase memories en-masse would be both an infohazard (knowing about him and changing your behavior accordingly would tip him off, since he thinks his actions are secret from everyone) and an anti-memetic hazard (since once he thinks you know, you'll forget everything).

** I think you could get Lockhart to be that way outside of Hogwarts, but I don't really see that working with two Legilimens on staff. He would get caught VERY quickly.

Magic in general is rather scary for muggles, since any wizard could do things like this to any muggle, any time, anywhere, and they have no real recourse. The whole concept of "muggle baiting" is pretty dark when you stop and think about it.

If you really wanted to do this, I would suggest expanding his skillset beyond just the memory charm, because he would need more than that to get away with this. The confundus charm is a strong candidate for a secondary spell, because while memory charms can erase memories, they cannot convince people to ACCEPT that memory erasure. We know from Dumbledore and Slughorn that making believable fake memories is actually extremely difficult and requires considerable skill with magic, and even the best fakes don't really pass muster when examined closely. Slughorn was able to live with his fake memories, but that's because he knew the real truth and did it to himself to cover up what he had done: it is far less likely that you could do that to someone else and have them not catch on that something is amiss.

However, one of the hallmarks of the confundus is that it makes people ACCEPT what has been done to them, it's like an offensive version of the Notice-Me-Not. Snape was able to claim that Harry, Hermione, and Ron had been confounded by Sirius to discredit them, which means a confounded person would even go so far as to defend their attacker if the spell is done correctly. And Crouch!Moody effectively confessed how he got Harry's name into the cup on the very night he did it: it is possible to confound the cup to believe in the existence of a fourth school, and Harry's name was subsequently submitted as the sole entrant under that fourth fictional school. While we, admittedly, don't know much about the confundus charm, what little we get told about it implies that in the right hands, it's an incredibly versatile and frightening spell: you can confound someone to not question contradictory facts or outrageous happenings, and you can even confound inanimate objects that harbor enchantments that allow them to make decisions and choices, like the Goblet of Fire.

You mentioned rape. While a memory charm would indeed allow Lockheart to "get away with it" by erasing the memories of all the students involved, consider that by using a proper confundus, Lockheart could rape a student in front of the other students, /and they would accept this as normal/. They would not question it, any more than Harry and Ron were allegedly confounded to accept that Sirius was innocent and that a man who had been dead for thirteen years was alive and the real criminal. Not only would the rape be seen as perfectly normal, acceptable, and reasonable, but the students would even actively defend Lockheart if push came to shove: that is the power of the Confundus Charm.

I have maintained for a long time that the more subtle arts of magic in Harry Potter are far more dangerous and powerful than the overt "bangs and smells." As much as I dislike Snape personally, I feel he is 100% correct: the wand waving and explosions magic is juvenile and petty compared to some of the things more advanced and subtle magic is capable of. Someone who is skilled in occlumency, legilimency, memory charms, confounding, and possibly one or two other 'soft' magics like the notice-me-not, could literally get away with almost anything, in broad daylight, in front of witnesses even.

Snape was right about what kind of magic is the most dangerous. And Moody is right to be as paranoid as he is. Canon Lockhart couldn't get away with the sort of things you're proposing, but you only need to add a few extra spells and skills to his arsenal to make it so he IS capable of doing those things.

Though, again, I feel as though he would be caught rather quickly if he handed out memory charms too freely, because Dumbledore and Snape would notice. Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, the memory charm honestly isn't the thing he would probably be using the most to get away with what you're proposing. That would be the confundus. The first targets would be Poppy, Snape, and Flitwick to make them NOT notice that students and possibly other faculty are clearly under the effects of the spell, because those three would be the most likely to identify that something is wrong with large swaths of the student body. After that, all he has to do is avoid Dumbledore, which isn't hard because the man is barely available in his own school. Step 2, if he's smart, would be to pick a 6th or 7th year student and implant false memories into them to set them up as the fall guy, so if the charade collapses it will all be blamed on them, and not him. After that, he can more or less do as he pleases.

It could even play into the plot of second year, where Lockheart is convinced that an older student is playing a similar game, the "Heir of Slytherin," and starts aggressively seeking them out to try and eliminate them.

The wild cards in play would actually be the Weasley twins, because they have the map. They're the most likely to realize something is deeply wrong, and that Lockheart is at the center of it. And at the same time, Harry is being blamed for what is happening by the school and is being called the Heir of Slytherin, and Lockheart is preying on students while simultaneously hunting down the 'real' "Heir of Slytherin" because he's afraid the Heir will expose him, or is otherwise setting him up to be accused of murder. And in the middle of it all is Tom Riddle, and nobody, absolutely nobody, suspects Ginny Weasley of anything.

** See, writing him as a rapist is very uncomfortable for me since with the exception of maybe the 7th years, all of the students under his care are underage. If someone were to write anything like that, it would have to end with his gruesome and agonizing death.
