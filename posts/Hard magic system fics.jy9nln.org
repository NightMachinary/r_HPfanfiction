Does anyone have any good hard magic system fics with some excellent world building? Epic length preferred but not required. I've hit a rut in my reading and need something fresh.


** linkffn(Blood Crest)

Fairly hard magic for a Harry Potter fic. Takes interesting directions with existing concepts. Harry is curious and explores branches of magic that you don't normally see in fics (divination, necromancy, unforgivables) It's not nearly as edgy as you might expect a "dark Harry" fic to be.

It's pre hogwarts and up through hogwarts. Fresh plot, 100% not cannon rehash.

  Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

****** It's maybe a bit sporadic, the gaps can be a few months and then you might get a couple chapters in quick succession. The last update was in October I think. I'd probably expect some chapters on December.

** I might recommend The Prince of Slytherin. I wouldn't call it “hard magic” but it does have a /lot/ of worldbuilding relating to magic. It's also very long (over 1 million words so far and it's only on the beginning of book 4), so it definitely fits your “epic length” requirement.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027][AO3 link]]

Also, a few notes:\\
* I personally am not a fan of chapter one. My interest was picked up much more so by chapter two.\\
* I have no idea how much this would matter to you, but it's a lot darker than canon (worse child abuse, some characters are suicidal at times, etc).

**** It should be noted that the whole /thing/ of "The Prince of Slytherin" is to take really overdone Harry Potter tropes and subvert them in very interesting ways. When describing it, the fic comes of as horrifically tropish, but in reality it drops some beautiful twists on you that really make you appreciate what the author is doing.

I also wouldn't go so far as to call it's magic system particularly "hard" but there's undeniably a lot of effort put in to worldbuilding and once a rule is established it sticks unless there's a very good reason for it not to.

** linkffn(Subversion by Myricle) has an extremely hard and inventive magic system and is also incredibly well-written. It's unfortunately dormant and probably abandoned, but it's worth reading.

linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation) is probably the closest thing to what you're looking for. A pretty hard magic system with much more development of magic than in the original series, and very fleshed out world building. It's also really long, over a million words for the entire series, and pretty competently written.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) might also be up your alley, many of the subjects have much more order and explanation than in canon. Also over a million words.

Alexandra Quick and Victoria Potter both have incredible scale, writing, and worldbuilding, but the magic in both (which again is inventive and expansive) leans very soft re: Sanderson's first law, possibly even softer than canon. Give them a shot though, the magic is not that soft and they are both exceptional.

The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside).

** The Arithmancer by White squirrel and its sequels lady Archimedes and annals of arithmancy. Best fic i ever read, i come back to it once a year at the very least.

Granger centric fic. Builds: magical theory, arithmancy, spell crafting, runes and even ritual magic. It is amazing!

Dont know how to link... Sorry

**** Aaaaigt Nice! The accidental animagus is fun, not as amazing as the Arithmancer but there is a very refreshing focus on international magic community's and thus also cultural differences and different types of magic. It is not completed at this time (sequal is ongoing as animagus at war) and the updates are irregular but still going. I would recommend it. They are writing other stuff at the same time, honey and magic is the most recent one and updated, i only read the first chapter at this time and i think they are going to dive in the wandless magic aspect. I love this writer. :)

**** Animagus is better than Arithmancer once you get to year three or so and it starts to really diverge and expand in scale. It's a much more universal fic, less about an individual character and more about taking HP onto a global scale. Abandons the stations of canon earlier IIRC too, around year 3.

It's been a while since I've read it, so I can't really articulate how magic works in there, but it still has very intensive world-building and magical culture/politics. The characters are interesting, intelligent, and lovable, and the pairing is Drarry. Have fun.

Professor Roberts has resigned.”“Good,” Draco says honestly, “Would you like a list of suitable alternatives? I know a number of competent potions masters abroad, but then of course you'd have to hire another teacher to act as the Slytherin head. I'm afraid you've dried up all the half decent Slytherin Potions masters.”“Not all of them,” she says quietly.He blinks. She can't be serious. “You can't be serious.”“Gravely,” she says, “Mr. Malfoy, I am not above begging.”What the bloody fuck. “I don't even like potions!”~Draco returns to Hogwarts. He has a duty to his blood and his name and his house, and he will fulfill it.
