:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
As seen in title: I can't find a fic I had seen a while ago using the trope of sorting characters actually according to their personalities (at least as the author interprets them). Harry and Ron were the only slytherin boys in their year, but Hermione was NOT in Slytherin (Ravenclaw, I think); Pansy Parkinson was in Gryffindor, Malfoy was in Hufflepuff and Narcissa asked Andromeda to have Tonks try to get close to him, which Malfoy was pissed about. etc etc etc

Any help would be appreciated! thanks


** More realistic? How is Malfoy in Hufflepuff more realistic? It's like the opposite is it not?

*** Is he brave? No, demonstrably not.

Is he cunning or ambitious? No.

Is he a natural scholar? No.

Is he 'all the rest'? Well, yes. This isn't him being loyal (though actually he shows loyalty to the Malfoys) or hardworking, it's about him not fitting anywhere else but still being accepted.

So, yeah, in mentally trying to sort Draco Malfoy to another house, I ended up with 'none of the above' and that's what Hufflepuff is. It makes sense to me.

Zacharias Smith is pretty awful too. They'd get along well.

**** I always thought the sorting hat sorts based on what you value most. You don't have to be brave but if you value it most then you could go to griffidor. It makes more sense than all these people extolling these traits at 11 and it not being changed.

***** He doesn't really value cunning or ambition though, he values being in Malfoy house because he thinks it's evidence of his unearned superiority. You could spin this as family loyalty but it's not quite that.

**** I'd say he was rather cunning when he invited Harry and Ron for that duel, and his main ambition is to be like his father, which he takes rather seriously.

*** I wouldn't say opposite. Hufflepuff is about hard work and Slytherin about ambition, that's pretty similar actually. But I don't see how that would be a more realistic sorting.

**** Well he's not exactly cunning, but I also don't see him as hardworking. He's definitely ambitious, but he seems to do this by running in taking action. The only real cunning thing he ever does is the midnight duel thing. The rest of the 'slytherin' things he does are openly cheating or insulting someone. This doesn't seem like slytherin, gryffindor or hufflepuff to me, so hopefully Draco's smart, or he doesn't fit in anywhere.

******* Malfoy was a prefect, learned Occlumency enough to keep out Snape, got into a bunch of NEWT courses, and he and his father were expecting him to do very well and disappointed to learn he'd been upstaged by a mudblood girl. He got an O in his Potions OWL at least.

Also, he repaired a Vanishing Cabinet on his own which was quite complicated magic.

He was also good at dueling, though not as good as Harry.

I'd say he was hard-working, the only bad mark we've known him to get is the one on his arm.

It sounds neat. A favorite canon line is about how they sort too soon, and it always stuck with me as to how 11 year olds are blank slates.
