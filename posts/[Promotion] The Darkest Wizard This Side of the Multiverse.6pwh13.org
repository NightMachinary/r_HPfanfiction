So, I'm late in posting this, but better late than GRRM-late, I guess. It's narrated by an "OC," which I haven't listed for a purpose since there's a [[/spoiler][twist to that that should be easy for everyone to get right off the bat -- one that was intended to be that way.]]

Anyway, this is what happens when you take a crackfic seriously:

  *The Darkest Wizard This Side of the Multiverse*

  By: mistermisstep

  What would really happen if a Slytherin Harry Potter became super independent, super powerful, and super dangerous, as narrated by his personal --- and very grudging --- minion, the marginally sane Violet Henry. Also features Snape, the world's worst mentor. (Dark!Harry, AU, dark comedy elements, no Harry/Snape.)

  Rated: Fiction T - English - Fantasy/Drama - Harry P., Severus S. - Words: 9,353 - Published: 12m ago - id: 12589566

One chapter up so far, another waiting to edited, still more others waiting to be written. No set schedule.

*** The premise you gave me somehow turned into a first-person send-up of countless Dark!Harry fics with a side of meta commentary and dream-like nonsense tangents (such as shopping trips), all delivered by an unreliable narrator and I'm not sure how it happened.

**** Well, this will either end up being one of the most influential Harry Potter fanfics of all time, or it'll be a glorious trainwreck of epic proportions.

*** Ao3 might end up including scenes that FFN does not allow, if the story goes that way.
