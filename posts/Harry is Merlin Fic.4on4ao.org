** The two closest fics I can think of are:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] linkffn(9860311) - Female Harry sent back through time. She isn't Merlin, but she is Morgana and incidentally, paired with Merlin. Would recommend reading this. I was a bit iffy about female Harry at first but I ended up really enjoying it.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6289435/1/Myrddin-Emrys-Returns][Myrddin Emrys Returns]] linkffn(6289435) - Not what you're really looking for but it is a Merlin Harry and I think Daphne is Morgana, but I honestly can't remember much about this fic. Its a pretty bland fic in my opinion but maybe you'll like it.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Souls don't always live just once. They can return, typically in a time of crisis, if they are deemed worthy. This is about two such souls. Separated by houses. Will they find each other again? Will they even know? One Gryffindor, one Slytherin.

**** Started reading Myddin but stopped when Daphnie Greengrass, a pureblood British witch, makes reference to Gary Busey.

Bland is generous.

** Also not exactly what you're looking for but this is an FF where there is no Harry (or maybe he died, I don't remember) and Merlin instead fills his role in the HP universe. It has been hinted at that he will return to Camelot at some point. Currently in 2nd year.

  AR. Merlin has changed Camelot forever but while that part of his life is complete, destiny has a new task for him. Now he has to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, hide the fact that he's the Merlin, and defeat a Dark Lord that's messing with magic he knows nothing about.
