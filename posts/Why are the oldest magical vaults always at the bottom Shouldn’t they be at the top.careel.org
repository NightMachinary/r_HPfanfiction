** Fair question, though it's not like Gringotts could possibly make sense architecturally without copious amounts of sorcerous spatial manipulation to begin with, so asking questions about why Gringotts is shaped the way it is may be a fool's errand.

First, tackling your observation on its own terms, we might deduce that the Goblin race may be of subterranean origins, and that Gringotts was dug /upwards/, not /downwards/. Why not? There's precedent for comparable creatures in folklore and mythology to come from underworlds or the center of the Earth, and the /Harry Potter/ universe contains much sillier things.

If I had to propose a more serious answer, though, how about this: the deeper magic vaults are /safer/, because it's that much more tunnelwork for potential thieves to cross while bypassing all security. It's also the only place Gringotts are allowed to keep Dragons and other monsters as increased security for their vaults, because the wizards would frown on the Dragons being just a few dozen feet beneath Diagon Alley, you understand.

Therefore, those high-quality vaults were seized up by the rich families long ago, and, being the rich families, they never let go of them. Whereas the lower-security vaults are /cheaper/ vaults, which routinely change hands rather than be passed on down family lines through the centuries. The actual building work of those vaults is therefore as old as any other, but the contents (and protective enchantments) are new, so for all intents and purposes the lower ones are the "old" vaults.

------------

(Note: I am hesitant to speak of "bottoms". I don't really think Gringotts has an actual bottom any more than certain corridors in Hogwarts have an actual end point to them.)

*** I appreciate the mythological/folklore references you put. It's Rowling, who makes those references in her books, so this being canon makes sense.

A real issue in fanfiction is Goblins being treated as this kind and benevolent species, with Merlin's and the Founders' vaults. Aside from being not canon due to the founding dates, their behavior is not nice in folklore. Goblin is not a nice word.

**** I hate this trope, even in canon Goblin are hatefull little bastard, I mean, from what we saw from Canon:

- Goblin won't make a wizard a friend of their nation if he recognize one, Harry did recognize Griphook and lot of good it did hi in the end.
- Giving back Goblin artifact won't make them friendly, Harry had a deal with Griphook, and the second he had the sword he betrayed them
- Goblin are asshole in general, just saw it while looking at how to write griphook. Gryffindor BOUGHT his sword to the Goblin (the king forged it), but the king liked it so much he decided to steal it back from Gryffindor, who fought anyone who tried to take it. And 1000 years later they say Gryffindor stole it.

​

Any helpfull Goblin story just make the Goblin extremely OOC, I know there is some discutable part to wizard society, especially how they seem to "rule" other species, but if there is one that deserve it, it's the Goblin. And while I am at it:

- Giving the Goblin wands won't make them peacefull. It will just make the next rebellion a lot harder to deal with (and it would happen soon after since they would probably see this gift as a sign of weakness).
- Goblin (and wizarding world in general), do NOT propose modern financial service. Gringott propose safe vaults, and that's all, you just pay them to keep your shits safe. There is no interest on the money stocked there, Goblin don't propose to make investment for you for 15% of benefice a year. And Gringott does not propose a fucking lineage service where they can see your ancestors on 15 generations and all your magical ability and block on your magical core with just one drop of blood.
- Finally for the founder vaults. Even if we accept that they already at vaults at that time (it was 1000 years ago after all). Slytherin had a descendance and any vault he had was emptied by them, there is a reason why the Gaunt lived in poverty. Hupplepuff also has descendants, and if a Smith had her cup, you can guess the galleons went the same way. Gryffindor was in conflict with the Goblin king for his sword, I doubt he had any vault in his bank. So that only leavers Ravenclaw who died with no descendance alive, that's the only vault that /could/ still exist, and it only exists on the idea that the founder were rich (doubtfull, Hogwarts seemed expensive to open after all), and that the goblin did not empty the vault to keep it open for 1000 years).

Don't go too far with that; neither is "werewolf". Or "witch", for that matter.

The Goblins of Gringotts certainly shouldn't be friendly to human clients in /general/, but to act like it is fundamentally in their nature to be hateful little blighters like in all the stories, that's Umbridge-type talk. Goblins are unpleasant to wizards because they are prejudiced against wizards, in much the same way that wizards are prejudiced against them --- and with better historical reason, since their people has, after many bloody wars, come to be forcibly subservient to Wizardkind.

Firstly, because after the lengthy wars between Wizards and Goblins, a compromise had to be reached, and if the Wizards were going to take away their wands and most of their associated rights, they /did/ have to offer something in trade.

Second, because most wizards can't do maths to save their lives and the Wizarding World's economy would collapse within five minutes if the Goblins stopped taking care of things for them.

We both agree the kind and benevolent goblin trope has no basis. The issue is that you state that they are a product of their attitudes. They have exclusive magic as well. And as with Ug the Unreliable, I could see a post Voldemort rebellion.

******* The movies are not Rowling's design choices, and does not pertain into a discussion on canon without Rowling's input. Seriously though,Considering she likened Nazi idealogy to blood politics, Rowling has the muggleborns as an allegory for the Jewish people.

I was reiterating my viewpoint, not attacking yours. I do apologize for the misconception and definitely should have put it in a different paragraph, but I was writing from a mobile client. There's some leeway on the interpretation of goblins in folklore and yours is valid.

But I disagree about the whole subliminal messaging thing in Harry Potter. It seems to be more an unfortunate design choice in the movies (Fun fact: Warner Bros was founded by 3 Jewish brothers). In the books it definitely does not hold true. We have the muggleborn as an allegory for the Jewish people. The Goblins might actually be closer to antagonistic Switzerland than anything.

*** IMO you could try explaining it in such a way that Gringotts is basically the first or oldest existing goblin settlement and goblins are subterennan creatures, even if they didn't dig their way upwards from hell's depths below.\\
After all we didn't see them exisiting anywhere outside of Gringotts, so it'd make for a fair explanation - they have one existing settlement in Britain as to not go around and scare muggles, and when it was later appropriated as a bank they simply agreed to rent the deep vaults for the highest price, thus they are only for the rich wizarding families.\\
And considering the goblin ideas about inheritance of goblin property by humans i'd say that those vaults aren't exactly inheritable - simply the family has to pay as long as the goblins keep their stuff down there - so unless you are rich, you don't get a bottom vault, and you aren't rich in the wizarding world if your family isn't some old pureblood bunch.

It's possible, but the extremist Goblin view on ownership of artifacts (and remember that it's described to as an /extremist view/ only held by a few traditionalist, moralistic nutjobs, not an opinion espoused by Gringotts as a whole) seems rooted in a particular philosophy of craftsmanship. It's very specifically about /objects/, taken as works of art. There's no particular reason it should necessarily apply to real estate.

Still, those down there have to pay for a powerful artifact (the waterfall) and a trained dragon, there is 0 chance the goblins let someone have a vault there if he doesn't have a dime to pay, and the theme through the books suggests only rich people in magic society are rich purebloods (which IMO is riddiculus, but whatever, maybe the muggleborns all really suck at capitalism)

Something that a lot of people overlook is that there aren't very many Muggle-borns to begin with. Lots of half-bloods of all kinds, but /Muggle-born/ are a tiny minority of the already tiny wizarding population.

See, if the Muggle-borns are only 1% of the wizarding population and we assume that, like the saying goes (and running the numbers on how many millionaires there are in the U.K. produces a similar result), the wealthy of the Wizarding World also represent 1%, then even with perfect randomization of who becomes wealthy or not, you'd still end up with only one percent of the one percent being Muggle-born. With a wizarding population of 10.000 as usually reckoned, that means that there should statistically be */one, single Muggle-born millionaire/* in the Wizarding World.

Therefore, if you admit that wizard-born have /some/ advantage to start with (they know the world, and consequently the economy, better, for a start), it makes perfect sense that we don't meet any really reach Muggle-borns.

******* I wasn't thinking in terms of someone being rich and muggleborn at birth, but being one and making it big thanks to being able to use (or 'misuse') magic to gain money in the muggle world. A half-blood could do it too.

As far as canon goes, we know that there is a substantial amount of wizards that leak magical artifacfts to muggles for discrimination reasons (and that's illegal) bu couldn't a wizard just launch a legitimate business that he'd aid with magic to make killer profits? You know, something simple - i.e. buying old, decrepit houses and renovating them with magic to sell for a nice price with minimal investment (there are propably other things they could do, but i can't come up with one just yet).

** It's worth noting that wizarding Britain likely went through the demographic transition centuries before Muggle Britain did. In so far as that transition is caused by prosperity, low infant mortality, etc. it's likely that the wizarding world has resembled the demographics of the modern western Muggle world for as long as anyone can remember (the main difference being wizards' extended lifespan).

So over time, there probably isn't an increasing demand for vaults, because the wizarding population is stable. So I doubt that Gringotts is continually adding more vaults - rather, the number of vaults in 1000AD is probably more or less the same as in 2000AD.
