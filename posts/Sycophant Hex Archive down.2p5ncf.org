Anyone else having issues accessing Ashwinder, or any of the other Sycophant Hex archives?


** Yup, I had issues with it yesterday, and just checked now (9am CST) and it's still giving me a '500 Internal Server Error' message. Sad times.

*** Yeah, I was in the middle of reading Breaching the Underworld, which I had started back when it was new but had decided to wait until it was complete. Just rediscovered it last weekend and I'm jonesing haha.

*** Awesome thanks! I admit I was a tad concerned. This just teaches me to download all my fave fics that don't exist anywhere else! Looks like I know what I'm doing today.

*** Are you able to actually access stories? I see the site appearing as normal now, but when I try to follow any link, all I see is a narrow text box, as if everything has been deleted.
