** I've got just the one. This Harry is a showman par excellence and it contains an expanded Tri Wizard tournament for him to show off in. Fair warning, the main premise involves him getting James Potter's memories, but its very well done and far from overpowered. This Harry is smart and powerful, but very much human.

*** Isn't it actually James in Harry's body, or no?

**** Not really. It's James's memories being given to Harry when Voldemort attacked and him finding them after POA. More or less it's a combination of Harry with James's memories and talents leading to a much more balanced, mature, and powerful Harry James Potter. He's essentially a fusion of the two in this story. He isn't James, but isn't quite Harry either.

It's really interesting to read about to be honest.
