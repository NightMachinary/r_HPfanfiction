Basically I'm looking for a dark!Harry/Hermione/Malfoy/whoever fic where dark means like Tom Riddle.

In canon TR was committing murders and performing dark rituals, but was careful and charismatic enough that only the genius Dumbledore suspected him, and even he only had gut feelings to go on. In every dark fic I've read the main characters seem to go out of their way to act dark, make enemies of everyone etc.

He wasn't some sort of deranged killer. Young TR and LV spoke about DD with respect. Both spent years being careful to avoid having to directly face him. Most dark!Harrys treat DD like a crazy old man it is trivial to outsmart, no need to plan ahead or conceal your intent.

As for evil, in canon the closest thing he had to a friend was Snape. He had lots of complimentary things to say about him, never doubted his loyalty and even said he regretted having to kill him. They were alone so there was no reason to lie.

But when it was to his advantage to kill him he did without a second thought and then just went on with his life. I've never seen that sort of indifference to everyone else portrayed in fanfic. Most so called dark characters only kill acceptable targets like Rita Skeeter, and try to justify their victims as enemies. Very few would kill some random Hufflepuff as part of a plot and even fewer would kill an ally for purely selfish reasons.

Sorry for the combination request/wall of text rant.


** linkffn(The Birth of Evil)

Haven't read this series in a few years, but linkffn(5827366).

linkao3(Dreams and Darkness Collide) isn't exactly what you're looking for, but it's a non-BWL AU where Harry ends up becoming a serial killer + Tom Riddle (kind of) mentors him.

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

  Major AU! SLASH LV/HP: Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned.

** linkffn(Worthy of Magic)

Harry is crazy and evil, and will kill anyone and everyone to achieve his crazy goal. He is quite intelligent, but he is definitely totally deranged and therefore sometimes isn't logical.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
