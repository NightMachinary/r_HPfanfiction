** - linkffn(11500936) is a straight version,
- linkffn(11961978) is a crack one.
- and I have deep suspicion that linkao3(14078862;14259786;14270739) is heading towards something like that as well.

#+begin_quote
  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

The Death Eaters are a lot more similar to the Nazis, the ministry tries appeasement politics and doesn't do anything to stop muggleborn discrimination, Dumbledore can't do much without antagonizing the ministry, and Hermione has enough, doesn't care what the ministry thinks about her any more and decides to blow up the pureblood summer ball at Malfoy Manor with a lot of muggle explosives. Muggles are helping, but only by supplying guns and explosives and by training the muggleborns in how to fight like soldiers.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

is kinda like this, Harry accidentally exposes the magical world to the muggles and the muggle governments have to deal with Voldemort in a similar fashion as Al-Qaida (which is controlled by a Death Eater after Bin Laden's death). Voldemort also gets his hands on some portkey nukes after taking over North Korea with polyjuice.

It's not Harry centric, the plot jumps all around the world to show the different reactions to the two words clashing, although the American Secretary of Magic is probably the character with the most chapters from his perspective.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
