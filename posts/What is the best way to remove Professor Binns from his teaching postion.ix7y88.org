I'm writing a fanfic in which Harry will want to remove Professor Binns so that he can make sure one of his friends gets the postion?


** If it were me, I'd have Dumbledore hire a new teacher and set them up in a different classroom. Binns is still there, doing his thing, but now he's just another one of Hogwarts's quirky ghosts. For a dash of comedy, maybe the odd student here and there voluntarily sits in on his lectures for lack of anything better to do.

**** In book 2 he answers Hermione's question and pays attention to the class, which means he is aware of his surroundings and is perfectly intelligent, just really boring and not a good teacher. He would notice that he doesn't have a class.

** The best one I know is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13285012/7/A-Fair-Life]] (it's fem!Harry, her name is Harleen, but it doesn't matter for this):

#+begin_quote
  Just as Harleen opened her mouth to say something, Hermione suddenly reached out and clamped a hand down on her forearm with enough force to make the raven haired teen wince in pain.

  “You! Exorcised! Professor! Binns!”

  Each word was bitten off in a shocked tone, bordering on an outraged shriek.

  “I did no such thing!” Harleen insisted, struggling ineffectually to retrieve her arm. “Hermione, you're hurting me!”

  The hand on her arm suddenly unclenched, releasing her and Harleen pulled her arm close to her chest amidst a slew of apologies from the girl beside her that she quickly waved away.

  “I didn't exorcise Binns, I just-”

  “Professor Binns!”

  “Wait, Binns is gone?” Cedric interrupted.

  “Yes, he's gone, but I didn't-”

  “Miss Potter?”

  Harleen let out a frustrated sigh, looking down at her barely touched plate before she turned to face Professor McGonagall.
#+end_quote

[... she leads him to the Headmaster's office ...]

#+begin_quote
  “Well,” Dumbledore finally began, leaning back in his chair with his hands folded atop his beard. “Miss Potter, I was wondering if you might explain what happened in class today?”

  Harleen started slightly, having almost forgotten the reason she'd originally been called into the office to begin with.

  “I'd like to point out that I did not exorcise Professor Binns,” she stated as clearly as she could. “I wouldn't even know how to go about trying.”

  “No one is accusing you of anything, nor are you in any trouble,” Dumbledore assured her. “I simply wish to understand the events that took place, nothing more.”

  Nodding, her brow furrowed in thought as she considered the lesson that had taken place earlier that day before she slowly started speaking. “Most of the class was asleep,” she said. “A lot of students tend to look at Binns' class as scheduled nap time since he was always so dull. Toward the end of class I was curious and I raised my hand and asked if he had ever considered retiring. I mean, I learn more from reading the book than I did in any of his classes really, and he just teaches the same things over and over, I figure that's got to get boring, even for him.

  “He seemed surprised at first, called me Miss Jameson for some reason, then said he intended to teach here until the day he died.” Harleen shrugged, “I didn't mean for anything to happen, but I pointed out to him that he was already dead. He was really startled to hear that and looked down at himself for a minute and then... he just sort of faded away.”

** Realistically Binns is there for comedic purposes. However headcanon was always that he somehow enchanted the position in such a way that he could never be replaced (such as Voldemort cursed the DADA position) but the enchantment was so powerful that it anchored his ghost to the living world. Otherwise Dumbledore could have easily done what everyone else is suggesting (i.e. hire someone else and move the History class somewhere else).

One way this enchantment could be broken would be to either find the counter-spell or talk Binns into retiring (thus finally moving on).

** I think that people who are saying to just teach in another room are ignoring or forgetting about several things.

1. Why pay a new professor, when you have a perfectly fine ghost who's teaching without pay?
2. History is perhaps the top contender for the most controversial subject taught at Hogwarts, maybe competing with muggle studies. It's one of those things which you draw a narrative from the facts, and open to quite a lot of interpretation. So it might be hard to get a new professor with new perspective, when you have boring old Binns with a narrative that's been approved at one point in the past.

These are the 2 major roadblocks I see with keeping Binns and hiring a new teacher.

I haven't thought much about how you would remove binns, but here are several options.

1. I've always gotten the impression that Hogwarts /allows/ the ghosts to be there, but that there are methods to remove them. Just think up a excorcism ritual or something.
2. Another impression I've gotten is that Binns doesn't even realize he's a ghost. Confronted with that, he might just decide to disappear.
3. This relates to point 2. You could try to make Binns realize that his info is out of date, or that he's hurting the subject he's so passionate about. By having a droning voice, he's making students disinterested in the subject. Maybe binns wants to be a ghost but stop teaching after he realizes this. Maybe he wants to go to the afterlife. who knows.

No one knows any history! It's a notorious nap class! In book 2 everyone is legitimately shocked when Hermione asks a question because no one has ever cared enough about history to ask! We could plausibly blame the rise of Voldemort, Fudge, and Umbridge on no one having any historical knowledge to draw on for the dangers of following charismatic sociopaths or the extremely unsubtly corrupt!

If Dumbledore gives any shits about the future of the wizarding world he's getting Venkman on the job ASAP

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
