It a H/Hr fic where instead of the protagonist going to a new dimension an alternate Potter family shows up. It's the only one that I've ever read with this concept. It's a post war fic that isn't very action focused but I would(am) recommending it for what it's worth.

Pretty good story, following Hermione traveling back in time and finding herself in the body of an 11 years old Rosier. The writing is fantastic, if a bit too close to canon is some places. This is technically complete, though the ending is pretty unsatisfactory IMO, but a sequel started recently dealing with all the fallout.

  What if you had the chance to travel back in time and change just one event in your life? What would it be?For Harry Potter there is no question; he would undo the events of Halloween 1980, when the Dark Lord Voldemort took the lives of his parents, both heroic fighters for the light side. Ever since he was a kid, Harry has dreamed of being able to stop the tragedy of that fateful day.Now Harry may get exactly what he wished for...... and much more than he bargained for.

That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder.

  The first outlines of an old memory emerged in Sirius's mind. Like breath misting on a cold glass. He remembered the strange dream he had, before he woke up in the mud, straight from duelling Bellatrix and fighting in the Death Room, of a place he didn't know but he remembered, he remembered a pub, and a storm in the 1960s, coming to see Alphard when he was about seven, and of some local muggles- what had that man said? Something about a place where the spirit world comes close. How Skye was a thin place.He just never expected to see the Isles again, after Azkaban, never mind his Uncle Alphard or his little brother Regulus... But that's the Other Side, so they say. It was the year 1966 and the Wizarding World he knew was gone. Some things seemed the same- like James and the Potters, they seemed normal, as normal as a six year old James Potter could have really been. But things were different. It was all different, and it terrified him- his mother was dead already, for one. And also, if Sirius could just stop forgetting about the other world and the way things went that time, that'd be just great.(Dimension-Travel AU)

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

  She had a life once, but she doesn't remember. All she knows is the ashes and blood she tastes as she wakes up yet again... She's got one more try to get it right. - Haesel hadn't quite thought of this when she'd accepted Death's 'chance to live with those she'd lost'. AU, time travel, fem!Harry, T for now?

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. Heavy on Remus/Sirius friendship. Some Black family dynamic; Harry/Sirius family dynamic; Sirius PTSD exploration. Tonks is a major player but not til halfway through. No bashing. Harry is present but not primary; these adults prefer not to ask teenagers to save the world.
