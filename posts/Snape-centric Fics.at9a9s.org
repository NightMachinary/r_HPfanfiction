After my love for fanfiction was recently reignited I was in the mood to read something about my favourite character for once. As the title says I will list down the fics I am searching for and what I would like to avoid

What I am not searching for - Creepy pairings (Hermione and Snape for example, unless the fiction is extremely good)\\
Slash (Same applies for the above but the fiction better be good if you do recommend it)

What I am searching for - Mentor Snape fics\\
Father Snape fics (think Blood magic deals with this but I haven't read it yet)\\
Adoptive Father Snape fics\\
Exploration of his life in the first and second wizarding war (fics can deal with one or the other, as well as both) as well as his years as a Hogwarts professor (who doesn't like a bit of character study :p)\\
Snape is flung back in time (Hogwarts days, or when Harry turns 11 either works)\\
Friendship with Mauraders (something happens that alters the events in first year, can also be later in their life, say their 5th or 6th year)\\
If Remus bit Snape (I have yet to find something on this topic)\\
Snape sorted into Gryffindor

Any length works so long as the fics are good, from one shots to over 100k+

â€‹

Needless to say you don't have to recommend a fiction for all of the above listed (even one is good, thanks in advance!) but I thought that the more variety I tried to include the more chance all of us may stumble onto something we have not yet met.

Thanks in advance!

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7079665][Slytherin Career Day]] linkao3(7079665) - oneshot, humorous

The rest fall into the the "Snape mentors/adopts Harry" category:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions]] linkao3(10588629) - follows all 7 years of Hogwarts, also has a WIP sequel where Snape has a daughter

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/278297][The Guiltless]] linkao3(278297) - set 6th year, also has a complete sequel

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1023625][In Care Of]] linkao3(1023625) - set summer after 5th year

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/598019][Digging for the Bones]] linkao3(598019) - set during 3rd year, Snape is Harry's biological father, note the trigger warnings

The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] trilogy, starting with linkffn(1795399) - Snape adopts Harry (the whole series clocks in at over 1.7 million words which proved to be too long for me, but I enjoyed what I read)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4564794/1/Second-Chances][Second Chances]] linkffn(4564794) - unfinished and probably abandoned, but I enjoyed it anyway

[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=3239][Summer of Bonding]] - set summer after 2nd year, incomplete

[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=2898][Prisoners]] - contains de-aging

[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=3048][To Trust]] - Harry is 10, note the trigger warnings

(The last three are hosted on [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/][Potions and Snitches]], so no ffnbot for them.)

  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
