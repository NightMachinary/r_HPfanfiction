Some time ago I stumbled over a fanfic that told the stories from Hermiones POV, without changing the story or adding stuff/romance... I bookmarked it back then, but shortly after my phone broke and I lost all my bookmarks...

Does anyone remember a fanfic like this? I would LOVE to read it again


** This one, I think?
