#+TITLE: LF a fic in which Hermione ends up befriending the troll (a female) first year and Harry creates clothes for the troll at her request. Not the canon Harry and maybe not the usual upbringings. Strikes me as very focused or aloof?

:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's a discussion in which Hermione tells Harry what colors would suit the troll best and later gets him to make winter clothes. In the meantime, Hermione and the troll--don't remember a name--have been having tea parties or something similar.

Also, somehow, word gets out that Harry makes nice girls' clothes and he gets mobbed. Makes up a set for a lot/all of them in hopes they'll leave him alone. Probably happening all in first and maybe into second year.

Thanks so much!
