Like would the stone have also cursed Voldemorts mind of his insanity?

Would it have done anything to heal his soul?

And did Quirell,or,Voldemort get the curse from,drinking unicorn blood?


** The simple answer is that we don't know enough about alchemy in HP to say anything for sure. Traditionally in alchemy, the creation of the philosopher's stone is symbolic not just of the perfection of physical substance but also spiritual perfection, which in gnostic alchemy is something like "enlightenment" and in Christian alchemy was associated with salvation. But the HP system of alchemy may be a bit more divorced from spiritual matters.

It's worth mentioning, however, that there is little evidence in canon that Voldemort is insane (in the sense of lacking rationality, as opposed to the sense of not being a psychopath). I'm not sure that there's anything to "cure", other than his freely made choices.

It's a popular idea in the fandom to claim that Voldemort lost some rationality which the younger Tom Riddle possessed. Mostly I think this is motivated by people who want to write Tom Riddle romances, or otherwise have Harry flirt with allegiance to the Death Eaters - to make that even semi-plausible, you have to make Voldemort more reasonable.

But really, there's not much evidence for this at all in the books - that Tom Riddle was more sane/rational/reasonable than Voldemort (as opposed to simply more constrained in how he acted due to his circumstances), nor that Voldemort lost sanity with each horcrux. Indeed, Dumbledore frequently comments on Voldemort's great mind. You'd think if he believed that Voldemort had lost mental capacity he'd mention it.

All indications are that Tom Riddle was always a psychopath, it's just that when he was younger he couldn't show his true character publicly because he was not yet secure in his power.

*** I think the movies really mattered into the image of Voldemort as insane. It's not as blatant as poor Barty Crouch, Jr., but Ralph Fiennes clearly plays him as unhinged, rapidly shifting moods, having this sort of blank stare a lot of the time, moaning or yelping or screaming whenever he does anything... He doesn't look /irrational/ per se, but he looks /demented/. And I think that's what the idea with the Horcruxes often is: that they didn't affect his intelligence as such, but made his moods and emotions much more unstable.

**** And considering how his appearance is described in HBP when he met Dumbledore regarding the Defense Against the Dark Arts position, the Horcruxes had clearly done a number on his looks, so just imagine what they did to his psyche.

** He would have a nose and human colored skin but that's about the only difference. He would also remain vulnerable to Harry's protection.

** at least voldemort thinks it would have given him a stronger immortal body and after he failed he had to settle with mortal life in his old body.

I think he would have used the philosopher stone to create a in his own opinion perfect homunculus and used it as his new body. but I dont think he would mentally change at all.

** It's a bit of a spoiler, but this happens in linkao3(The Anti-Heroine) and he's a little different from Canon Voldemort (post graveyard) as a result.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

I think you are misunderstanding the nature of that curse. Here is the key quote.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?”

    “No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.”

    “That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.”

    Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.

    “But who'd be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you're going to be cursed forever, death's better, isn't it?”

    “It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else --- something that will bring you back to full strength and power --- something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?”

Drinking uicorn blood doesn't save your life and curse you as two separate things. They are the same thing. The curse is the life and the life is the curse.

Drinking unicorn blood gives you a 'half-life, a cursed life'. This will save you from death but at the cost of being trapped in that state. It's not a curse in the same way as the Blasting Curse is a curse but in the classical meaning. You are forced to endure a hellish half existence.

This is backed up by what Firenze is saying. The philosopher's stone will end the 'curse' because it can bring Voldemort back to full life, out of the 'half-life, a cursed life' he gained from drinking the blood. His resurrection in fourth year would do much the same.
