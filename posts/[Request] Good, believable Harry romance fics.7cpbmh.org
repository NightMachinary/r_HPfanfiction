I'm looking for good, believable romance Harry fanfiction. I've read so many that I think there are none left that is actually good! Pairings: Harry/Ginny (preferance), Harry/Hermione, Harry/Daphne, Harry/Katie, Harry/Angelina, Harry/Alicia BELIEVABLE. That means no WeasleyBashing, no SuperPowerHarry (badass Harry is okay but over the top tricks and backflips are not acceptable), no harems, no EvilDumbledore! Preferably where romance is a big part of the story. No slash please. Thank you!


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there), is a very credible Harry/Ginny romance, but it's unfortunately extreme AU (no magic).

The fully canon-compliant [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), is a quite decent H/G romance.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

*** Thanks! I haven't read those, I'll definitely check them out. I actually don't mind AU storys as long as the writing is good.

** So I'm going to throw one out there that doesn't actually answer your request, as it is Harry/Tonks. However, since it has to do with a de-aged Tonks, it seems like it would fit with the tone of your request: linkffn(12188150): Tonks goes back in time (by accident) and pretends to be a girl Harry's age to keep him safe. Turns out she gets the teenage hormones with the morph.

Haven't found a good Harry/Katie romance fic yet. It is a damn shame.

How AU are you ok with? Most of the good H/Hr ones I have seem to be pretty far from Canon world....

Edit Actually all of the ones I read are 'Adventure/Action' first and Romance second :P. Including that one. Can't say I care much for the pure romance /cough/ ones

*** Hum... I've never gave HarryTonks much thought. Maybe I'll try it. The thing with the pure romance fics is that most of them are shit. Too much lovey-dovey fairytail. But when you find a good one, with strong charcaters, it is worth your while. I love HarryHermione but, again, a lot of them have RonBashing and WeasleyBashing for no reason... it kind of kills the story for me.

**** Well, Tonks does have significantly more character development than Dalph, Katie, Angelina, or Alicia. She is also young enough she could possibly date the main hero's without contrived magical circumstances (I mean the age difference between them was less than her Cannon interest). And that age range doesn't exactly have a lot of fleshing out in Cannon (We have Tonks, Cedric, Charlie... and that is it?), so lots of room for Fanfic, while still being during the book period.

The age difference does limit it to older years though (16 and 22 is a lot less creepy than 14 and 20).

Like Grains of Sand doesn't really bash, but it does suffer Ron!Neglect (Hermione and Harry get much more screen time, with Hermione being a third-wheel love interest).

Sadly most Honks isn't all that well thought out, often it is just to give Harry a morphing girlfriend. Although now that I have complained about using contrived magical circumstances to set up a romance /cough Tomione time travel eww/, all of the time travel fics with Honks I've seen I've liked. Grains of Sand is also gold, but I recall 1-800-Rent-A-Hero also being pretty decent. Although there was apparently online drama about that one. Also had a really awesome line in it: "I mean, sleeping with the mother of the child you're raising is kind of traditional, you know. I dare say it's even expected in most cases." XD
