Doesn't have to be the main focus of the story, can be a minor part.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be old or new, would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes and the like (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing).


** I swear I read something recently (though the fic probably wasn't written recently) where this exact scene occurred in the Great Hall...or the library, but I vaguely recall Ron stuffing his face either before or after. Hermione was fretting over not being able to find an answer to something about Pureblood rituals/customs and Ron piped up with an enlightening comment and both Harry and Hermione were agog.

** Can't remember the fic, I do remember Ron once saying profound and everyone staring, "What... I am a pureblood wizard. Some of that nonsense was bound to sink in."

** I know that happens in the movies, when Hermione gets the children's book from dumbledores will, only Ron knows the book

*** "You know, Tales of Beetle the Bard, bedtime stories... you know."

"No, not really. I didn't have bedtime stories. I was shoved in a closet and told to shut-up."

"Honestly, Harry. Now is really not the time."

*** Thanks, but I'm wanting fanfics that do this, not just from the books or movies.

** Sorry, just got a free association: “You seem to have forgotten, that I'm from WizardingWorld™!” Just couldn't resist.
