:END:
Hi, 1st post. This fic has really been bothering me and I can't remember the name.

Here's what I remember:

- Harry is pretty powerful
- Harry is sort of friends with theo
- This is set during the triwizard tournament
- Theo is the Slytherin liaison to Harry during the tournament. Slytherin is backing harry to win the tournament and theo constantly checks in on Harry to make sure that he is actually trying to win and studying.
- In chapter 9 I believe harry has a transfiguration battle with Lisa and Micheal(I think) but the crowd is broken up by Theo. Theo is super upset that Harry is not studying or taking the third task seriously. Harry tries to make him understand but Theo continues to make sure that Harry studies.
- Theo warns Harry that he might be in the lead during the tournament but it doesn't mean that he's won.
- Harry and Padma go on a date sometime in fourth year I think. The date has to do with a muggle movie. Padma is described as stunningly beautiful.
- After the date Harry doesn't really talk to Padma for a while
- She confronts him at the beginning of 5th year and is furious. Harry is a smooth talker and calms her down. She is no longer mad at him but she denies it and says something about the movie being interesting. Ron and Lavender and a few others (maybe Dean and Seamus) are at the scene when this happens and none of them can believe that Harry calmed her down.
- I don't remember what happens after that
- The fic may also have some years other than 4th and 5th but I don't know for sure.
- Like I said above, Theo is constantly on Harry's case about prepping for the tournament. I think there may be money involved?

Any way if anyone could remember this fic it would be great.
