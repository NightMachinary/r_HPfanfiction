Not wanting stories where Harry is the slave.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes. Doesn't have to focus on pairings.


** Not in the BDSM way but Mudbloods of the Death Eaters has a theme where Muggleborns captured during the raids are given as spoils of war to the Death Eaters that performed well. Hermione is taken by Nott but more or less ends up her bitch. AU after OotP.

  Theodore Nott has always been the overlooked Slytherin until he is forced into joining the Death Eaters by his elderly father. Now, with the new rewards Voldemort has given his followers, captured Mudbloods, he is in over his head with Hermione Granger. AU after OoTP.
