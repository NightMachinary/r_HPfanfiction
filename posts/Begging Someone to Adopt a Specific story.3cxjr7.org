** Also, can someone summarize the last 2 chapters? I tend to dislike action in stories that I read. Like the duels Harry had with the Knights of W. also why did that scene with Hannah happen?

Why did Harry get pushed backwards? I think Hannah did it on purpose but she loves him?!?!?

So many questions!

*** **** *In the 6th chapter:*

     :CUSTOM_ID: in-the-6th-chapter
     :END:
We find out that PNRP members have been massacred. This is a mystery, as we don't know who did it. Neville plans to sabotage the Greengrass party by blackmailing Harry.

Meanwhile, Harry finds some inconsistencies in the bodies he's examining. He speculates the PNRP bodies might have been dead for up to two weeks before the "massacre" and these might be polyjuiced fakes. He discards this idea as unrealistic, and the mystery continues.

Hannah reveals to Harry that Hermione is staunchly with Neville and is also sabotaging their relationship.

Harry, for reasons he can't yet understand, always looses control of himself near Daphne.

In that scene, Harry very nearly raped Hannah. He was oblivious to her protests, and did not care to pay attention to her.

Then, he succumbs to Daphne when he gets back to the Ministry. Yet another mystery brews - why would Harry act like this after demonstrating great care for Hannah earlier?

**** *In the 7th chapter:*
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: in-the-7th-chapter
     :END:
Neville sabotages the Greengrass party's speech with arrests, using Harry's information from the previous chapter. Hermione is acting weird, frighteningly mindlessly subservient to Neville. We find out she's Neville's wife.

Daphne sends Harry a note asking for immediate help. Harry rushes to her. A mysterious organization - the Knights of Walpurgis - attack. One of them shoots a killing curse at Harry - Harry grabs the arm of the Knight right before it strikes, and the curse seems to bounce to the Knight instead, returning magic to Harry - possibly removing it from the Knight to do so. Harry can pull off some awesome, powerful magic now. He kills the rest of the knights and seems to be multiple orders of magnitude more capable than anyone else we've seen so far.

We find Daphne knows legellimency. It's almost obvious by this point that she's influenced Harry's thoughts at one point or another - perhaps accounting for his impulsiveness for her.

*In canon*, Knights of Walpurgis were an organization renamed to Death Eaters in 1970. A great fic that expands on this is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][Master Slytherin's What Lies Beneath]].

**** Where is it implied daphne knows it? I couldn't read between the lines. This is amazing though although I don't understand why Hannah would react that way. I feel as if she wanted to be closer to him? I'm thinking maybe the curse doesn't allow her to be intimate with him?

Damn there is so much things going on :/ so much I missed. Your explanation actually made the story sound even better.

She does - because the /real/ Dr. Potter abused her trust. If you look through the earlier part of the fic, the actual Dr. Potter slept with other women and was a general asshole to Hannah. And in this specific scene, it's very obviously rape - Hannah doesn't want to do anything, but Harry forces himself upon her. It even says in the scene that he's forcing himself upon her and she's resisting. The way he's acting is probably different, new, and frightening to Hannah.

And on legilimency:

#+begin_quote
  Harry looked sharply into her violet eyes as she mentioned legilimency, watching her flinch at his hardened expression. [...] The magic was beyond obscure,
#+end_quote

The story is great, but the plot seems very tightly woven. While this can make for thrilling and fast-paced stories, it's almost impossible for anyone but the original author to continue, because it's almost certain that Amerision had the entire plot thought out beforehand. There's too many subplots, mysteries, and more for any other writer to effectively pick up on them and figure out what to do with them.

** It's a great story - thrilling and realistic, I loved it. One of my favorites. That said, I think you come off as a bit too desperate - and it wasn't /that/ mindblowingly good. There are many great stories, also "written for adults", also with a similar Harry in the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=2][DLP Library]].

Personally, I kind of liked where it was left off, actually, allowing for just enough imagination while not being a cliffhanger or falling flat.

*** I just found it to be amazingly good haha. I've read stories in the DLP library and most of them are indeed good. This story just has some themes that I'm really into in HP fanfics.
