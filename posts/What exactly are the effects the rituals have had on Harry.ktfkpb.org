Are the results of his mother's sacrifice obsolete if he doesn't live with her relatives? Or does living with them simply offer extra benefits (blood wards?)? If Harry hadn't lived with the Dursleys, would touching him still make Voldemort hurt? Had Voldemort used another person for his resurrection, would that person also have to be killed for his ultimate destruction (like an additional horcrux)?

I remember being confused and just going with it back when I first read the books. But there seem to be different understandings in fanfiction, so please enlighten me!


** Dumbledore in The Lost Prophecy, Ootp

  I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection...a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative...She took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you

Lily's sacrifice protected Harry from the initial attack and probably would have continued to shield Harry like his own did for others during the final battle. That is to say: spells might have landed, but they wouldn't have lasted long. Or they all would've rebounded like the killing curse.

So it was Dumbledore placing the Bond of Blood charm on him coupled with Petunia (begrudgingly) accepting him that prevented Voldemort from touching him and entering the place his mother's blood dwelt.

Harry had to die because he was housing a piece of Voldemort

** As I understand it:

1-Lily's Blood Protection protects her son. There is no chance that a loving mother would have wanted her son to live with her hateful sister, so there's no real reason for that Blood Protection to have anything to do with Petunia.

2-Albus Dumbledore decides that Harry needs to live with Petunia. By his own words in book five, he knowingly commits Harry to 'Ten Dark Years' instead of having Harry grow up with a decent family.

3-Albus Dumbledore uses some method to transfer/bind Lily's Blood Protection to Petunia's house where Harry will never be welcome. How does he do this? Cannon doesn't say, but logically stretching the Blood Protection to additional people would weaken it. Logically, if the Blood Protection had not been transferred to the Blood Wards, Harry would have been even safer.

Honestly, if the Blood Protection had never been altered and Harry just been given a dye job/permanent illusion magic and given to the Bones family or something he would have been a lot safer. The Blood wards don't seem to protect Harry from his family, nor do anything to promote his general health. Other than supposedly keep the Death Eaters away. I say supposedly because Harry still got jumped by Dementors likes a block from his house.

*** The protections are simply against Voldemort. I don't know why it's such a widespread belief that it should've/was supposed to protect(ed) him against all manners harm when Dumbledore only ever spoke about Voldemort.

*** Yes, because being unaffected by a decade of emotional abuse clearly shows that Lily's Protection didn't protect Harry from the Dursleys has well.

** I personally belive the blood protection on harry didnt require he stay with his realitives. him reserecting through the use of someone else shouldn't make anouther horcrux as it doesn't reqire killing and even if it did as he has killed afterwards but didnt cause a splitso we can assume its the rebound that caused the accidental soul tear.
