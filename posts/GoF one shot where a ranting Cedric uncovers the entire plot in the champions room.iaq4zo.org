:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Cedric flips the moment Harry walks into the Champion's waiting room and starts ranting that it's happening again. Goes on and on to everyone about how the professors are always letting it happen, someone tries to kill Potter in a stupid way every year, talks about what had happened previously, says something like "Let me guess, Moody's actually a polyjuiced known-to-be-dead death eater out from Azkaban who-" and goes on a long rant to outline the entire plot and all the exposition. Moody/Crouch thinks he's actually outing him instead of just trying to outline something insane enough to count, tries to stun Cedric, gets dogpiled.

I think it was on Ao3. Any suggestions?

** probably not the one, but it was a nice read and someone might like it.

harry makes it a rule to not trust the new defense professor, for obvious reasons. he figures the polyjuice thing with cedric pretty early on and when harry's name comes out of the goblet, cedric knows exactly who's behind everything. linkao3(32279778)

  Harry makes three rules to survive fourth year: 1) watch the new DADA professor like a hawk, 2) suspect all animals of being animagi, and 3) avoid Cedric Diggory at all costs. Shame Diggory didn't get the memo. For a tumblr prompt by johnlocked-starkid: maybe a Harry/Cedric thing where the Triwizard Cup isn't a portkey and Voldemort doesn't happen, and instead they just win together and are happy and celebrate together. (bonus points for shy confessions of a crush from one or the other)
