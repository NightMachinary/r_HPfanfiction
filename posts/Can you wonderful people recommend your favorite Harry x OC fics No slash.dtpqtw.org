** I'm digging Eclipse of the Sky by Firefawn on fanfiction.net. In fact I just re-read it. The OC is great, the best I've read, but it starts off weak. Don't get tripped up by those early chapters. The author tells you straight up the early chapters suck, but they took a decade and a half hiatus, came back, and hot dog I don't know what this writer did but in that time they got good!

Description is, "Horcuxes were the pits. Dark Lords with prejudicial god complexes were worse. Ones that abducted and experimented on every magical variant they could get their hands on to 'enhance' power were enough to make Harry outright murderous. It didn't help that his girlfriend was a variant, and Harry really wanted to hang on to the only girl crazy enough to snog him. Dark Harry/OC"

I recommend it, but you've got to stick with it. Believe me it's an over million word fanfiction so a few subpar chapters early on are worth it. They really fix all the OC issues masterfully. I almost didn't read it because of those at first, but glad I did. Harry doesn't start off dark or powerful but when he gets dark he gets dark!

They also got a Harry and Daphne one and their version of Daphne may as well be an OC so check that out.

Another excellent one that is low key is Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19. They've got a nice slow burn. I only have 2 complaints with this one. 1 the writing is too simple. It is almost too easy of a read and I enjoy higher reading levels. 2 the chapters are short and they only update once a year. I enjoy this, but the amount of time it takes for them to update with such tiny chapters isn't very impressive. It is still worth a read. A plus is this is good from Chapter 1.

The description is: "He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead."

*** Grow Young With me is great, I just wish there was an update. I also just checked out Firefawns Harry/Daphne story, the new one, it looks pretty interesting. I'm eager to see where it goes

** Like most people, I'd say that my favorite is Grow Young With Me, but since that's already been recommended, I'm gonna go with Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7069251/1/]]), if for no other reason than that it's the only shipping fic I can ever remember reading that ends as it does.

Also, just because I can: linkffn(Hocus Pocus Adele Polkiss).

  When muggle Kate Foster first met Harry Potter, he saved her...by breaking her fall. She knew then and there that he had a major hero complex. "I hope that you don't make a habit of this saving people thing. You aren't very good at it." She didn't know that he was a wizard, or that he was destined to save the world. Very slight Harry/OC.

  HPxOC. Runs along with the original storyline. Adele Polkiss is the younger sister of Piers Polkiss, a close friend of Dudley Dursley. This way she meets Harry Potter, a curious boy with a mysterious past, and a wonderful secret... Magic! COMPLETE

** Fuckwhotookmyname2 I think people down vote it because Eclipse isnt particularly popular and I recommend it in this post. People lack attention spans, and since it starts off weaker they hate it, bash it, and dub it awful. They could not be more wrong. The writer gets flames weekly it sounds like. People love to hate it and miss out on perhaps the best OC story ever written and their amazing writing all because they are part of an instant gratification generation and have no attention span. So what if the first ten short chapters aren't beautifully plotted? There's more than 900,000 words of perfection after that. People get mad I recommend it so much so down vote. Jokes on them since they're missing out.
