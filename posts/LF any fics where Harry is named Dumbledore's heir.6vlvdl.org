So we all know about the Lords trope. Usually this goes hand-in-hand with bashing fics. I was wondering if there were any where instead good!Dumbledore has a great mentor relationship with Harry and names him the heir to the Dumbledore name. Just a sleepy thought, but I don't remember reading this and thought it'd be cool if someone had written it already.

** linkffn(2163835) and its sequel linkffn(2460564)

It's not inherently "Dumbledore's Heir" stuff if I remember correctly, but the mentorship thing is DEFINITELY there. (It's implied that Harry is Dumbledore's Heir in the sequel if I remember correctly, but yeah.) It's more like... Harry accesses an incredible magical gift/skillset that Dumbledore had when he was a younger man, so Dumbledore mentors him.

It's pre-HBP/DH, so no Horcruxes or anything. These are the fics that got me into HPFFN. I liked them years ago but I honestly have no idea if they have stood the test of time. Refiner's Fire was published in 2004, completed in 2005. The Time of Destiny was published in 2005, completed in 2006. There are some tropes in there (Harry being Gryffindor's Heir, etc.), but these are some older fanfics so those tropes weren't QUITE as common back then.

**** I'm having difficulty figuring out the spoiler system, so I'm not going to say anything super spoilery haha. But... You are absolutely correct. I couldn't find any direct references to Dumbledore naming Harry as his Heir in the actual text, but it's definitely implied because of what you said in your spoiler. Comparative to being Gryffindor's Heir, being Dumbledore's seemed like a minor plot point of the sequel.
