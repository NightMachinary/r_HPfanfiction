** At first he was in the way for the 'perfect' HarryXHermione pairing.

Then people watched 'The Goblet of Fire' and saw that Ron could be a dick.

Mix the two and you get: A dick that is in the way for your 'perfect' plot.

** I think that the movies did a big disservice to the character, either completely ignoring things which showed his better side or giving it away to prop up someone else. For example in the third movie when Hermione stood between Sirius and Harry, and not Ron on his broken leg as it was in the book.

** The movies failed Ron's character. He's a prat in the books, but in the movies he's a dick. When you put the movies and books together as many people do in their fanfictions, you don't end up with a compromise of the two characters, but an amalgamation of the two. The films change a lot about the characters, because between the books, the screenwriting, the director and finally the actors it's one large game of Chinese whispers.

** Another user said awhile back on a thread similar to this that out of the trio, Ron is the /most/ similar to their respective personalities. Yet, when people read stories, they don't want to read a similar counterpart to themselves but instead of characters they wish they could be/become. Also, I think many prople's headcanons position Ron unfairly, in that out of he, Harry, and Hermione, he's the one that's an “everyday” bloke in the most Muggle way I could paint him as. He has no Dark Lord vying for his death nor does he have the academic intellect Hermione has. He's average, in a sense, and people have a problem because of that.

** For all the non-canon pairings Harry has to get rid of his canon friends. The easiest way is bashing.

*** This is the right answer. If canon Harry spent 95% of his time with Dobby, people would need to get rid of Dobby for their stories, and Dobby would be the one getting bashed all the time.

*** Well it's not true that he has to get rid of his canon friends to get non-canon pairings (simply changing who Ron is attracted to suffices in many stories). But it is obviously true shipping plays a large part.

** Pairings obviously play a role. I say this as someone who usually sticks to H/Hr. Ron is often just seen as getting in the way of this pairing.

That said, it's also just true that Ron's purpose as a character was almost entirely eclipsed by Hermione after Book 1; it's not /just/ the pairings. Oh sure, the Weasleys are cool with Muggles and even one of them is obsessed with all things Muggle. But Hermione actually lived in that world and has the natural understanding that gives one. Add in that she ended up knowing way more about the wizarding world than most also, and it negates that further.

With that, the series basically revolved around "Harry does the thing" with Hermione assisting and "knowing the thing". And Ron just kind of ends up... being there sometimes. He helps obviously but also can be kind of mean. I don't mean it in a bad way, everyone screws up and can be a dick. I think JKR just couldn't find a specific reason for Ron to be prominent after the first couple of books (his big thing was playing chess in book but we get no hint that he's some great strategist elsewhere). So he ends up being less interesting to write about because he wasn't given a "thing" in canon.

** Because if you're going to go against the canon for Hermione, Ron has to go. And it's so easy to see how he could act if she ended up with Draco (all the death eater comments), Harry (wanted the hero for boyfriend) or even another Weasley (always being overshadowed by his brothers)

But many people who have watched the films will just say that it's easy to make Ron the scape goat and turn him into the bad guy because he acts like such a dick.

** 1. Obstruction of OTP.
2. Insufficiently slavish devotion to Harry's leadership. (Only Harry is allowed to be Independent and to Question Authority.)
3. Insufficiently complete deference to Hermione's wisdom. (Whereas Harry is "redeemable" via the aforementioned OTP, there can only be one OTP, so no "redemption" for Ron.)

**** Thanks for the support, but that's just how it is with Ron. Luckily I've got karma to spare.

Love the "it's just because of pairings" replies in this thread btw. I have to wonder whether people would raise the same argument if Dumbledore had gotten together with Hermione: *"NO! *stomps foot* You just think he's a terrible headmaster, because he stands in the way of your pairing"*

***** Indeed. I do think pairings play a role (it never made sense to me who the main trio ended up with, and JKR seems to agree to an extent), but there's more than enough other things you could bring up.
