Presumably a time-travel and/or fix-it fic, seem to remember Harry at the Slytherin table. He's showing off, knowing where everyone will be sorted because he's seen it once before in the original timeline. Later on, he ends up developing some sort of empath-like power which takes him a while to notice. May remember one of the older Blacks (maybe Arcturus) playing a role in this but also that might just be me getting confused. Pls help

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

**** It's not a do over, there's no canon retrodding past the philosopher's stone being hidden at Hogwarts, but even then the fic doesn't follow book 1's plot at all.

Is it good? I always have a hard time answering that kind of question. It's well written and fairly original in some elements, but it has its issues. I'd say it's no masterpiece, but well above average and it was a pleasant read for me.
