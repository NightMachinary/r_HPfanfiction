I read Butterfly Effect on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.


** There are plenty of fem!Harry fics, but only about 1% of them are well-written, and fewer that really do something interesting with the premise. Three years after initial publish date and the painfully incomplete Butterfly Effect is still the best of the lot.

Equal and Opposite is excellent. It doesn't really fit into the traditional fem!Harry niche in that it focuses on Harry, rather than fem!Harry, but it's still absolutely worth a read.

Alexandra Potter is good... but it would be a lot better if it wasn't the author's soapbox for explaining their personal take on the intricacies of magical theory.

Question to OP: Do you have a preference between genderswap and genderfuck?

**** *Genderfuck* is an umbrella term used in conjunction with filling an established gender role with a character of the opposite gender. In the case of Harry Potter, a genderfuck fic might exchange the Boy-Who-Lived for the Girl-Who-Lived. AKA Harriet/Lily/Rose/whoeverthefuck is born a girl.

*Genderswap* is a highly specific term used to indicate that an established character's gender has, for whatever in-story reason, been 'swapped'. AKA Harry, an established male, /becomes/ female.

Genderfuck is sometimes used to describe genderswap situations... but that's generally a misuse. Genderswapped characters typically still self-identify as their original gender after the fact, thus no genderfuck has occured.

Hope that helps.

***** Thank you. I've heard both.

But what is it when the Entire thing gets turned around? Harry is a girl. Ron is a girl. Hermione is a boy. Ginny is a boy. What would those be?

****** I don't think there's really a term other than 'gender bender'. And gender bender applies to pretty much all fics in which gender is manipulated.

Genderfuck and genderswap really describe the mechanism of change, not the change itself.

**** Since you don't mind genderswaps, try [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4606270/1/Effects-and-Side-Effects][Effects and Side Effects]].

Harry is still very much 'male' despite his body being physically female. Not really my cup of tea, but you might like it.

** Taure's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] comes to mind. Amerision's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/1/Equal-and-Opposite][Equal and Opposite]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2897828/1/Across-the-Mirror][Across the Mirror]] are others of note. Yet another is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool]] by The Mad Mad Reviewer.

** The [[http://www.fanfiction.net/community/Miss-Potter/19146/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/][Miss Potter C2]] is a good resource for this, in that it has the most followers of a C2 in this vein and is still being updated. The trick is filtering out the shippy insanity. I'd suggest skipping any that list primary characters of Snape, Malfoy (either) or Sirius Black. Or Tony Stark (something of a recent trend in cross-overs).

I'd also specifically recommend [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4488250/1/Steps-Far-From-Paradise][Steps Far From Paradise]]. Though it's a story that might never see completion, the character interplay is worth a look.

Oh yeah. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1485356/wordhammer][I]] [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][wrote one]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6844334/1/The-Spiral-Path][too]].
