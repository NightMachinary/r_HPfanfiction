Maybe the day to day lives of Hogwarts elves, bonus points if they are set postcanon when Hermione becomes Minister.

**** Yeah a warning would have been appreciated, would not have clicked on it if I had known. His first rec is a great fic so I was too trusting that the second one would be similar.

** linkffn(Lady Archimedes) has Hermione find the Hogwarts Elves' quarters (and thus discover the elves' existence) much earlier. As a result, she forms a closer bond with them, especially one called Sonny. Much time is spent in the Elvish Common Room, the House-Elf culture is explored, and Hermione manages to form a more coherent plan of how to improve elvish wellfare. (It works well enough that Sonny /asks/ Dumbledore for her freedom; after that, she goes to work, for wages, with the Creevey brothers as an assistant in their semi-amateur photographing company.)

  Sequel to The Arithmancer. Years 5-7. Armed with a N.E.W.T. in Arithmancy after Voldemort's return, Hermione takes spellcrafting to new heights and must push the bounds of magic itself to help Harry defeat his enemy once and for all.

*** Following it, but it is hardly house elf centric.

**** Yes, but they do have quite a bit more exposure than in most other fanfics. It's very debatable whether /Fantastic Elves/ is elf-centric, too, after all.

***** I mean Fantastic Elves is obviously not house elf centric. It is however forest elf centric seeing as the main character is one.

** There is a lot of them in Pet Project (a long and quality HGSS fic) but I don't know if I would say it is house elf centric. If you haven't read it you might enjoy it though, there are some great house elf characters and they play a major part in the plot.

*** Read it, I liked it until the point where they get together lol. I finished it just to see how it ended, but that pairing just squicked me out.
