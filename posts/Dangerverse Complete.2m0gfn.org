FYI: The Dangerverse series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/691439/whydoyouneedtoknow][whydoyouneedtoknow]] is now complete (about a week and a half ago). The first story in the series is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109424/1/Living-with-Danger][Living with Danger]].

Is it any good? I'm a bit hesitant to start a 2-million word story. Apparently it is H/G which I don't particularly enjoy.


** I couldn't get far. I think I managed up through parts of book two.

Overall, low drama and (oddly enough) danger throughout the parts of the story I was able to get through. One character can see visions that literally remove all danger from the story. When there is danger, it disappears quickly and leaves everyone just a little scared, but not too scared. Because they're all one big happy, oddly well-adjusted family. It is a journaling style story, with almost every moment of everyone's not-so-dangerous lives mapped out and described in detail.

I'm making a lot of danger puns and references because that is what the author should have been doing. In my opinion, it would have worked better as a humorous and romantic one-shot, but I don't know the later plot so maybe something more interesting happened in the last one and three quarters million words. I may never know, as it couldn't keep my interest that long.

Do you remember that part in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy where Douglas Adams makes a joke right at the climax of an attack on a spaceship by spelling out explicitly that everyone gets out okay, with only a bruised arm and some broken stuff? Then the scene continues and you realize that though there is some tension, it isn't that strong because all the impact was removed ahead of time by a brilliant comedic writer and replaced by the setup for a joke?

That's the Dangerverse, just without the brilliant writer part and the punchline. It is competently written overall, but just so low impact that you are immediately reassured that all the fluffy bunnies will be okay before conflict even begins. Some people will like that. I couldn't be bothered after a while.

--------------

Original (AU) content-wise, there is some really weird stuff early on with some fanon werewolf attributes and attitudes and very little kids. It is a hair's breadth away from thematically just being open kink training of children, which is all kinds of wrong, but avoids that by being dutifully non-sexual at all points related directly to them -- while still having a sexual Remus pawing a consenting adult main character in the background. Mixed tones and contexts might be what are triggering those thoughts, at least for me.

The characters who (eventually, after I don't know how many tens of thousands of words) hit Hogwarts still have some really weird personality issues that are played very straight. Like grabbing each other by the throat to establish dominance relationships and the girls being especially submissive to the boys and the "alpha". Again, not outright sexual (as far as I read it) but that sort of alpha-beta, werewolf pack, dominance games stuff is usually in adult porn stories.

I should know. I read and write them.

That odd subject matter choice colored a lot of what I read, while being less interesting than* it sounds emphasized like I'm doing here. /It sounds more interesting than it is/ could be the tagline for this series (at least the first two books). Either that or, /waste the reader's time, the series/.

--------------

/tl;dr/: borderline kink alpha-beta kids early on, low dramatic threat via lots of visions to avoid "Danger", and a right out of the gate cure for everything bad about being a werewolf removing a huge chunk of drama. Otherwise, a happy school days fluffy series with some odd AU choices around a primary OC.

** I'd also like to hear from someone who's read the whole thing. I've seen it recommend a few times and never quite went for it. I'd love to hear opinions one way or the other.

*** I think that if you can get through the first story in the series, then it's definitely worth reading the entire series. The first book sets up the backbone. There's some great characters, some creative use of magic, interesting inventions... You won't really get to see that if you don't read the main series. Plus, I found the historic storylines (you'll know what I mean) to be really interesting.

** I started it a while ago but eventually dropped it.

By the 15th chapter so much prophecy\fate\coincidence and wistful thinking gets stacked on top of each other that when I combined all that with the story's genres (Drama/Humor), it started looking like one of those stories in which everything happens in the author's pretty little dollhouse as long as s\he doesn't think that things need some spicing up to keep readers aboard.

Maybe I was wrong, so yeah---getting some *detailed* reviews from people who've actually read it would be nice.

** I read the entire series, and I loved it.

Yes, it does drag on in some parts, but it felt like all the loose ends all got tied up as it went along. Given how the series givers so much time and so many people, and how many brand new elements she brought in, that length is absolutely necessary.

The entire series is its own AU for a reason.

If you like stories with an element of 'fates' or prophecy, try it. If you like new magics being explored, try it. If you like original characters who actually have personalities and aren't self-inserts, give it a chance. If you want character development, and conflict, and a bit of chaos thrown in, please try it. Go a chapter a day if you must (but that'll take forever so don't do that), but if you get through the first book, I highly highly recommend reading her whole series.

*** Great series! Read through chapter 41 in last story, and that was all that was available at that time. Thanks for alerting us to the complete status. I am now reading and enjoying the last story from the beginning.

** From what I have read so far (only finished the first book) it is pretty interesting and an enjoyable read if nothing else. I would say give it a shot, it might be for you or it might not be. I should also say that the first book is pre-hogwarts.

** It's so good. I started from the beginning in June and managed to catch up a month ago. I then finished it as the last few chapters came out for Surpassing Danger. I absolutely loved it, minus the last chapter, which in my opinion was mediocre compared to the rest of the series. Feel free to ask any more questions, it's so hard to sum up such a long and vivid fic. I can almost say I like it better than the original series.

Enjoy!

*** What makes it "so good?" Can you compare it to another well-known fanfic? Can you say, "if you liked X, Y, and Z you'll probably like Dangerverse"? What are the story's strengths and weaknesses? What is the overarching conflict of the series? Is the writing good, merely adequate, or bad?

**** To begin with, the writing is very good, I came across very few mistakes and it didn't feel like I was reading a piece of fanfiction. Also, I don't necessarily know what well-liked pieces of fanfiction would be, I actually came across the title of this series on this sub over the summer right after I found the sub and just got hooked.

The overarching conflict mostly follows those of the series, with a few liberties taken by the author. The major tweak that makes it so intriguing is that Harry and Hermione, along with a few others you'll meet, are raised as siblings and form a very strong core group that faces the main conflicts of the series together. While Harry's parents are still dead, he doesn't end up stuck with the Dursley's, instead being raised by Remus and Hermione's older sister. However, if you don't like a Good Draco, you'll definitely find it strange.

I'd say that a huge strength is that it does play on a lot of the familiar settings and conflicts of the original Harry Potter series and, to a certain degree with the exception of Draco, keeps the characters familiar to the series as well. They end up with somewhat different personalities but they're certainly still recognizable from the books. A weakness that you may find, depending on what fanfictions you do read, is that there is certainly a lot of story that goes on between major plot points. Not necessarily fluff, but that's a part of what makes it such a lengthy series.

I feel like this is becoming a bit much of an essay, essentially, if you have an inkling toward reading it after this, I'd at least try starting it, you can always stop if you don't like it. I put a solid 4 months into reading the series and I personally believe it was time well spent.

*** Also, if you're worried about the Harry/Ginny ship, it's not the main one and is only really touched on in the end of the series. Don't drop the series just for that!

** I read up until around the 50th chapter or whatever it was updated to at the time and I can honestly say it is in my top 10 favourite fic's that I have read.
