I want to see fics where Gilderoy Lockhart uses his charm to worm his way into politics. Furthermore, it will be fun watching Lockhart dealing with Voldemort's return in 1995.


** Lockhart would be the best minister ever. He wouldn't give a shit about politics. He would care about what the greatest amount of people care for.

​

He would be assassinated by the Dark Families in a month.

** Winner of 'Most Handsome Minister', Gilderoy Lockhart decides to meet with Dark Lord Voldemort for negotiations, confident that the dark lord won't hold up against his Charming Smile^{TM}.

Voldie: (/bored by Lockhart's prattle/) Avada Ke-

Lockhart: (/panics/) Obliviate!

Voldie: Wha- Who am I? Look here! I've got a nice and shiny throne! You look pretty shiny too... I'll steal you and make you into my new toy!

*** Whaaaat? No way! He'd definitely be more proactive with aurors and "the dark forces defense league" to make sure he never has to display his inadequacy.

**** He'd spend half the Auror budget on uniforms that look good in the black and white newspaper pictures.

“Don't worry about capes being impractical, they swish well in pictures and public perception is essential! Voldemort has still not attacked the ministry, and I don't like to speculate, but I think he realises that he wouldn't hold up against this dazzling smile!”

** Would probably accomplish more than Fudge. Not that this is much of an endorsement, but in the interest of looking good for his fans, he might actually do something, unlike Fudge, who... well, didn't.
