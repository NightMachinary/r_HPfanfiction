**** Nice. John Wick adopts a dog that turns out to be Sirius Black. When he finds out he's not a dog he doesn't mind and they team up.

[[https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/im-commander-shepard]["I'm Commander Shepard and this is my favorite X" is a meme]] about how you can get him to endorse ANYTHING. Turns out he's particularly protective of his endorsements.

*** Lord Voldemort realized too late that the killing curse isn't the only thing that's unblockable by protego shields. Also, a conjured slab of solid granite wall offers no obstacle to a Vanguard doing a biotic charge. Third, and most importantly, he REALLY should have stepped aside.

Because right now he was covering a larger surface area than the Hogwarts wards themselves.

** "Tom, you and your boys killed the mans pet warren and stole his Mako. What did you think would happen?"

...

"No, I know people generally don't see kinetic orbital bombardments coming. That's rather the point."

...

"Well, it's /Shepard/. Of course there'll be a hot insertion of incredibly well-armed space-magicians into the smoldering aftermath..."

...

"Okay, I'll admit the Blood Pack showing up was a bit of a surprise - I think they were just attracted by the commotion - but the Krogan Clans joining in was entirely predictable... The remains of your robe is still on fire by the way."
