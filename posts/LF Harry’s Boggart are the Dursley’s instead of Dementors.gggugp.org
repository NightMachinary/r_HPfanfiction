  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Well there is a story (trilogy) by nonjon called Where in the World is Harry Potter, that has the Dursleys be the origin of the dementors. The Three stories are Where in the World is Harry Potter, The Untitled Cheekquel Project, and finally You Did What. Regrettably the only links I have for them is hpfanficarchive and that site started having problems last night and is currently down. The last two stories has Harry being friendly with a dementor named Bob.

And sorry but I don't recall reading a story where the dursleys were Harry's boggart

  Life with the Dursleys was never easy, but when Harry was eight, it took a turn for the worse. By the time Hagrid shows up to deliver his letter and take him shopping, Harry has retreated into himself. A very reclusive Harry Potter arrives at Hogwarts and his need to protect himself may just thwart Dumbledore's every plan for the Boy-Who-Lived.WIP. This is not finished. It may never be finished. Read At Your Own Risk.
