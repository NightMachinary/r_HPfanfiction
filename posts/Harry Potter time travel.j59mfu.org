I've been looking but I just can't find any. I've found myself bored with constantly reading time travel fics where Harry starts over again from first year. It's all very repetitive. Get letter, go to diagon, train, Hogwarts, sorting.

What I'm looking for is a fic where Harry goes back in time but to second year+ preferably third or fourth year but I do not mind.

Thank you.


** Time travels that defy the usual tropes:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]]: Crazy Hermione goes back to her two years old self! Things work well, but there is a twist.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]: Harry is thrown back to 1975, without full knowledge about Voldemort's secrets. He has to team up Bellatrix, who is a very well written character in this fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8669569/1/Don-t-Waste-It][Don't Waste It]]: Wormtail gets a second chance. Very in character

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/Doubting-Thomas][Doubting Thomas]]: Luna raises Tom Riddle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13281665/1/Ginny-s-Plan][Ginny Returns]]: The only completed lone Ginny time travel. She accomplishes her primary objective efficiently, but...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]]: Adult Harry is thrown to his Year 1 and kills ALL of them without getting kids involved. Hermione finds out and is not pleased.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]]: Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan travel back 25 years and unleash hell on their enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4061219/1/The-Time-Meddlers][The Time Meddlers]]: Harry and Hermione travel back to their Year 1. They fix things nicely, but cause a new villain to emerge.

The breakoff point is the dementor attack the summer before 5th year and Harry is the same age when he ends up in the past. There is some slash way later

** linkao3(720072) has Harry return to 1991, but it /does not/ follow the pattern that has (understandably) bored you.

linkao3(Messing With Time by slythernim) has him return even earlier, and he quickly makes several large changes to the timeline. A story that's plenty of fun, and also rewards a careful reader for noticing the details.

linkffn(13185463) and linkffn(11922615) begin in October of Harry's fourth year.

Do you care that there's only the one time travel, at the beginning of the fanfic? Because if you don't, two more:

linkffn(12388283) is quite a ride.

linkffn(6517567) begins in the summer before fourth year. (Hermione is also time-travelling, not sure if that bothers you.) The repeated time-travel gives the author a lot of space to be very creative with the tasks, Hogwarts, and the Wizarding World in general.

  Harry Potter never actually beat Voldemort, but rather fought him to a standstill while Europe burned around them. Finding himself an unwilling part of a dark ritual to send him back in time twenty years, he is surprised to see how Dumbledore reacts to proof of obvious child abuse (Harry's), how eleven-year-old super genius and Witch Queen in training Hermione reacts to actually having a socially competent friend (Harry), and how much easier it is to shrug off the insults of munchkins when you're a grizzled war veteran.But there is one huge problem: being sent back blew out his magic entirely. Just waving his wand knocked him out the first time he tried it. Can Hermione help him though his classes even with his magic almost unusable? Will Harry be able to find the secrets to actually killing the Dark Lord and saving his friends from a horrible future without blowing his cover, or even getting mistaken for the Dark Lord himself? Will Neville Longbottom get better grades than him?

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** The best time travel fic I've ever read is Resurrect the Living by fascinationex. Harry (in his late 30s) can't stop seeing dead people, so Ron and Hermione send him back in time for a cure. I think he's eventually forced to team up with Voldemort. It's such an interesting take and Harry is much darker due to circumstances but not unbelievable
