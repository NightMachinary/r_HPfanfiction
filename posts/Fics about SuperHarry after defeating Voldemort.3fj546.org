I recently finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For]["I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" by kathryn518]] and found that premise enjoyable. What other fics like this are there? I'd prefer non-crossovers if possible. And I like very long fics (>100,000 words), although shorter recommendations are ok.

edit: Fixed link

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance trilogy]] (W: 1,713,423; Abandoned) by GreenGecko. But I'll warn that it's slow at plot development --- though it's one of the few stories that do this for the sake of realistic CharDev --- and that Harry's not that super-powerful at the starting chapters.

*** I second this recommendation. I spent a while reading it, the pacing seemed to fit well, but it was also the type of story where if I put it down for the day, I'm not going to have to reread a chunk to get back into it. I loved the expansion of magic in it, I loved some of the conflicts, and even when the last story leaves off, it was winding down instead of being at the height of a plotline.

****** /(poke me with a stick if I'm still missing the obvious)/

I think you'll often find yourself disappointed if you compare all fanfics to /Lightning's/ quality of writing. Lightning's almost as good as a professional writer, and what puts them below that level, in my opinion, is not the writing style but the plot development and the falling back to strawman characters' actions for driving that development.

Maybe /GreenGecko's/ Resonance isn't a masterpiece, reading which will increase your TOEFL score by some ~10 permanent points, but as I've said it doesn't have any major problems either. No major sputtering in the text flow, not that many mistakes and typos, etc. The author here needs a tool for describing the characters, their interactions and their story; and their (even if somewhat simplistic) writing style accomplishes just that.

p.s. If you /do/ know any stories that are written as well as the Sacrifices, can you recommend them to me?

edit: I think /Lightning/ has one more drawback too, actually: they often stretch their text for too damn long instead of trying to cut it a bit shorter.

**** I didn't think the writing was terrible at all, at least there was only one persistent horrible grammar error that bugged me (throughout the whole trilogy) and that was the author's use of "may" where "might" should have been. No spelling mistakes that weren't just typos.

I do remember the writing was really... spare... when it came to emotions. For Snape and Harry's relationship in particular, their feelings were only described through actions, not adjectives, at some points- but I almost felt that made it more powerful.

In some dialects you can always replace modal "might" with "may". Though now I'm imagining Star Ocean 3, with Cliff calling out attacks like "Hammer of May! Sphere of May!"

****** Huh, you learn something new every day, I guess, I've never run across a dialect like that before and it just seems really weird to see "may" used as past tense. If I ever read it again I'll try to not let it bother me. Thanks.
