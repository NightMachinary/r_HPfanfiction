** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]] is set in a muggle world - though with James Bond style science. "Harworts" is a school for spies in the vein of the Avengers and James Bond - which is real in this universe.

Complete story; spans the full seven years.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
