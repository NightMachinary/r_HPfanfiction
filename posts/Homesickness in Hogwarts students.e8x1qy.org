So of course Harry would never be homesick but you gotta figure Ron or Hermione and many others who had parents who weren't terrible had to get homesick at times. Were students allowed to go home during non holidays?

I used to do church camp when I was a kid and even just being away for a week kids would get extremely homesick and sad. Over 6 days. I cant imagine going to boarding school for 3 months straight as an 11 year old. Even in elementary school some kids would sometimes have their parents come eat lunch with them. Granted those were the weirder kids.


** You'll see this addressed in fics occasionally, but for the most part, I think authors tend to follow canon, which didn't really show this. I'm unsure if this is because JK didn't feel it was plot-relevant or if it's just something about British culture.

If you're looking for a good example, linkffn(Blackboards and Broomsticks) has a central storyline about a new Muggleborn student who gets homesick and feels out of place at Hogwarts.

*** I don't think it's a British culture thing - even among sections of society where going to boarding school is the 'done' thing, you still get instances of children feeling incredibly homesick and out of place (though not all children, obviously). I think this was explored in The Crown, when Prince Charles is sent to Gordonstoun?

I can only imagine the culture shock a muggleborn child would have attending Hogwarts. But it would be immense for many pureblood children too - especially those who hadn't attended a school before, and had only had supervised interactions with other pureblood children. It must be incredibly disorientating to suddenly find yourself in an enormous castle full of other children with (apparently) minimal adult supervision.

** Most fics I've seen that address it at all, make it another duty of prefects to spot kids having problems adjusting. Try and help them out or engage the Head of House if needed.

** Dumbledore probably expects kids to take this separation as as a lesson in independence or something. You seeming can't even meet your parents for a meal on the weekend till third year.

Why does Professor Dumbledore allow Professor Snape to be so nasty to the students (especially to Harry, Hermione, and Neville)? JKR: "Dumbledore believes there are all sorts of lessons in life ... horrible teachers like Snape are one of them!"

** To be fair, I don't really remember the books saying anything about parents not being allowed to visit their children or students not being allowed to leave on weekends. Hogsmeade is different because it's more of an unsupervised thing. I don't know, maybe it happened and JKR just didn't think it was important to the plot since Harry wouldn't feel that way.
