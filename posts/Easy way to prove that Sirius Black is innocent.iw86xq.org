J.K. Rowling writes this about the Fidelius charm:

"If the Secret Keeper dies, anyone to whom he or she has confided the information will become a Secret Keeper. This could involve many people, any of whom might be more willing to share the secret." - wizardingworld.com

If Sirius cannot give anyone the location of where James and Lily live, then he is not the Secret Keeper and therefore could not give said information to Voldemort. It also proves that Pettigrew is alive.

BOOM. Sirius is freed, and there is now a manhunt on Peter.


** Would be good, unfortunately it is said that with death of those are subject of the charm, it unravels itself. Therefore, both Hagrid, Snape, and Sirius have no problem to enter the Potters' house after their deaths.

*** Hagrid could have already known the secret, and Sirius definitely did. I can't remember if Snape ever knew where they lived.

Plus, I don't think the secret around Grimmauld place disappeared after Dumbledore died.

**** To be honest, Snape didn't have to know where the Potters lived, because he was never there. That's just one more scene they added to the movies to make movie!Snape somewhat likable because the book one was an irredeemable ass.

****** Let's reword it then. That's a scene they added to the movies to emphasize the point that Lily was the driving force behind Snape's change of heart about serving Lord V. We all know he spared no thought for her husband or child. Showing Snape grieving Lily, holding her dead body, looks like an attempt to make him look more... human, for the lack of a better word.

**** It did. Its said that McGonagall and moody put up the wards again after it unravelled when dumbledor died. IIRC Harry takes it as proof that albus died

***** i thought it said that when the people under the charm die(as in all who know the secret) it unravels, but if the secret keeper dies like dumbledore did then everyone who knows the secret becomes the secret keepers. and i think moody and mcgonagall put up wards to deter snape since they still thought he had betrayed them.

****** Minerva and moody set up another fidelius there. Remember when the trio can't go back there as they took the death eater there by mistake when escaping from the ministry?

******* they were able to go there, but they brought the deatheater with them, so they left him and abandoned it. since they would be secret keepers and just revealed it to a deatheater who could then reveal it

********** I feel that you are right. I remember a bit about the trio being a bit scared that it was snape when Remus comes to visit them. They would not have worried if there was a new fidelius.

Two different scenarios. With Grimmauld, Dumbledore was the Secret Keeper, and when he died everyone who knew the Secret became a Keeper. The Secret was still intact. When Voldemort attack the Potters, the Secret was broken. Whatever it was, whether that they lived there or were hiding there, they weren't anymore because they were killed. So it doesn't matter whether the Secret Keeper is still alive or not, because the Secret no longer exists to keep.

** The easiest way would be for Sirius to go to the ICW headquarters and request a trial for "breaking" the statute of secrecy by blowing up a street full of muggles.

The ICW upholds the statute, so I posit that the ICW can hold trials for someone who breaks the statute if a member nation does not do one themselves.
