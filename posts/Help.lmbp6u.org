:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So i read a really good fic awhile ago where tom riddle basically switches it up an does the whole political arena instead of murder. Theres also a marriage contract between him and a femharry and they agree but theres a bunch of like drama with femharrys friends and shes had a past of like rape from her uncle if i remember right. They eventually like take over Hogwarts as the heirs of all the founders i think and shes a teacher an pregnant?? Does anyone know it? It was in ffn.
