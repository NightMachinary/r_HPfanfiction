** It's good to let off some steam. Reviews on ff.net can be pretty vile, trollish and entitled.

Maybe to add something constructive:

To replace a long fic with a rewrite that starts from the beginning is just asking for trouble. It's totally your work and you can do with it what you want, but you are bound to piss people off and pissed off people are never good to interact with. There are people who favorited your story as it was and you have taken it away from them (for now).

The (IMHO) only correct way to do a re-write: Add a new chapter with an A/N "This will eventually be continued in the re-write"... and done. If your rewrite works out and you reach a point where it surpasses the original no-one will care if you delete it.

Good luck with your work though. Don't let a few entitled pricks get to your head.

** You're the author of Harry Potter and the Game? I've always heard good things about your fic! Glad to hear that you're taking the time to rewrite and continue the story. Ignore the troll. Remove their review and try to put them out of your mind, it's really the only thing you can do, I guess other than vent here.

** u/AutumnSouls:

  A stroke of late-night motivation made the author [think] "Hey, I can do this better this time!"

Fucking relatable though.

Funny that you updated like three days after his review. Kind of a nice "fuck you" to him. But yeah, fuck these people. You can care for your readers while not making them your absolute priority. I've been taking a while to write a chapter just because I'm too god damn happy with my girlfriend and I'd rather spend my free time with her for now.

I hate entitled readers. They act like they're paying for your story.

** That reviewer was certainly unpleasant, and the best thing to do is to ignore him/her/??. They slipped far too quickly into personal insult.

but I agree with the sentiment that it's just bad form to delete a story. Were I you I'd have kept it up with a note at the beginning saying it was an old version there for archival, and you would be posting a rewrite soon. I wouldn't say deleting was /selfish/, but it wasn't a good idea at all. Even if you feel the new version will be better, well, for instance, imagine someone who was halfway through binge-reading the old story and bam, one minute later, it's gone? Incredibly frustrating. To tell the truth, I'm generally of a mind (be it for fanfiction or not) that authors should have no right to withhold content they've already published once.
