Harry and Voldemort are basically looking for a way to end the war. Voldemort goes thru a mirror and Harry follows him. A ghost Draco follows too and I think they come out in fourth year. Also there is a girl who lived and she attacks moody during class and harry gives chase. I think he has two animagus forms, a Phoenix and I think a big cat.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.

**** Me 2. I was so upset when I read it a while ago to see it was abandoned. I always like fics where Harry interacts with a fem!Harry.
