** I know that they became more and more disconnected the more time Hermione spent in the magical world. Hermione's secrecy and all the lying she must have had to do to keep going to Hogwarts make the distance feel like it's inevitable.

Other than that though, we really don't know enough about them to conclude anything else for certain.

My go-to headcanon currently is that the Grangers are the emotionally neglectful types. Nothing like Harry's situation. More like they're the type to work long hours, so Hermione rarely sees them even when she's actually home. She was practically raised by babysitters or nannies until she became old enough to stay at home on her own. They have quiet dinners and most days, communication is just perfunctory hellos and good nights.

In canon, Hermione is an unusually independent child though, and like Harry, she gave me the impression if someone used to fending for herself. She is also someone very used to loneliness.

Now, I have absolutely no concrete evidence mind you. There are a whole bunch of other possible reasons for Hermione being terrible at socialization and emotions. That said, her parents' absence in the stories raised eyebrows for me, so this is the theory I'm currently sticking with.

** Good discussion of how much time Hermione spends with her parents in canon [[https://slashmarks.tumblr.com/post/626830726168444928/did-the-grangers-commit-child-abandonment-or][here]].

*** This theory seemed odd to me. I feel like it is overthinking. Perhaps in a fic there would be enough explanation for me to suspend disbelief, but it mostly I assume that Hermione as a secondary character has “normal” “boring” parents who are beneath the notice are of Harry an unreliable narrator. If he had stayed with them instead of the Weasleys during the summer I bet we would find out more about them.

***** But that has more backstory and has an AU element. I'm okay with it. I just don't think you can draw the conclusion that Hermione's parents didn't pay attention to her based on strict cannon. I think it's bad literary analysis.

*** I toyed with the idea of hermione catching onto how things were going in the wizarding world well before it all broke bad and modifying her parents' memories shortly after voldemort's return, simply based on how absurdly little time she spends with them in canon.

** Rowling gave absolutely no fucks about any characters that weren't really central to her plot and since the Grangers are muggles, we don't even get their first names. They were made so irrelevant that the Order didn't even bother to put them under the same protection as the Dursleys and it was left all to Hermione.

But we do have this horror...

#+begin_quote
  “I've also modified my parents' memories so that they're con­vinced they're really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life's ambition is to move to Australia, which they have now done. That's to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me --- or you, *because unfortu­nately, I've told them quite a bit about you.*

  “Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I'll find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I don't --- well, I think I've cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins don't know that they've got a daughter, you see.
#+end_quote

Well, at least, Hermione has been talking and writing to them enough that they know about her friends.

We get family and background information about side characters like Lupin and his parents on Pottermore, but nothing about the Grangers. They're /muggles/ after all.

** I have always thought it is [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/hermiona_nonsearch_parents.html][more complicated]] (very unfinished, just a sketch of what will be probably used elsewhere). Another version (also unfinished) is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23443483/chapters/59950417][this chapter]] of “Brother and Sister” linkao3(23443483).

** Arithmancer goes into this a fair amount (her parents freak out about her dangerous adventures at Hogwarts, and want her to transfer to Beauxbatons), as does the [[http://hpmor.com][fic that must not be named]]. In both cases they are a very normal Muggle couple who take good care of Hermione. I didn't realize JKR never gave their first names. In at least a couple of fics I've seen, they are both dentists, so that might be fanon.

**** Here's a paste from another thread ;-). Harry and his parents are having dinner at the Grangers' house.

#+begin_quote
  "Of course we know she's smart," said Leo Granger, starting to look offended at the child who'd had the temerity to raise his voice at their dinner table.

  "You don't have the tiniest idea," said Harry, the ice now leaking into his voice. "You think she reads a lot of books and it's cute, right? You see a perfect report card and you think it's good that she's doing well in class. Your daughter is the most talented witch of her generation and the brightest star of Hogwarts, and someday, Dr. and Dr. Granger, the fact that you were her parents will be the only reason that history remembers you!"

  Hermione, who had calmly got up from her seat and walked around the table, chose that moment to grab Harry's shirt by the shoulder and pull him out of his chair. Harry let himself be pulled, but as Hermione dragged him away, he said, raising his voice even louder, "It is entirely possible that in a thousand years, the fact that Hermione Granger's parents were dentists will be the only reason anyone remembers dentistry!"

  --------------

  Roberta stared at where her daughter had just dragged the Boy-Who-Lived out of the room with a patient look upon her young face.

  "I'm terribly sorry," said Professor Verres with an amused smile. "But please don't worry, Harry always talks like that. Aren't they just like a married couple already?"

  The frightening thing was that they were.

***** Is this a fanfiction? It's pretty cringe the part about "ah, the only reason why people will remember about dentistry", pretty racist too, he didn't count muggles as people or he is imagining a world where wizards will colonize muggles "for their own good" like Grindewald wanted?

****** He is imagining a future world advanced enough to have long since conquered diseases such as tooth decay. Therefore, doctors and dentists are a thing of the distant past. Like imagine there was some weird and obsolete 16th century profession that would be completely forgotten by now, except that it happens to have been what Galileo's parents did, so it is remembered for that.

******* Muggles don't know Hermione is "important", so in that future I don't see them remember dentists for that reason. And wizards don't care enough about muggles to check their profession, they just would remember her parents were muggles at best. I don't know what it was Galileo's parents' work, do you? (Don't look on Wiki).

Obsoleted works still were important works when they were all what people had, so it's pretty bad to shit on the job of one on those premises.

******** No idea what Galileo's parents did, but no reason to believe it was anything we'd consider surprising today. I do know of one surprising old profession, which was using platinum (then a waste metal found around gold mines) to counterfeit silver coins.

In Arithmancer iirc, Hermione already has to explain to other wizards what a dentist is ("like a healer, but they only fix teeth").

I think Harry in that passage expects both the muggle and wizarding worlds, if even still separate, to have changed a lot in 1000 years.
