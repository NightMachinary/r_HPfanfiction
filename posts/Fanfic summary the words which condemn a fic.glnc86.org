Some are good, some are bad. A summary is not necessarily representative of the story it precedes. It can however kill the interest in reading the work all by itself. What phrases make you discard a story as unworthy?\\
For me it's 'older twin' 'HGDM' and 'What if?'. I have remarkably little patience for 'Suck at summaries' and 'better than it sounds' as well. How about you?


** "Character bashing" (Weasley or Dumbledore most of the time) is usually enough to not make me click on a fic. Granted I prefer reading it in the summary rather than discover it chapter 3 when Ron first appearance show he has been replaced by an orange piece of shit.

"Manipulative Dumbledore" is also a nice representation of a fic quality.

Basically anything that hints toward "Lord" or "Nobility".

** /Mild bashing of xxx character./ Having someone describe their bashing as mild is a sure sign that the character is going to be ridiculously bashed almost every time.

** 'Character bashing' of any way, shape, or form. I love the characters. That's why I'm reading. Not to see them hated on.

'PWP' - just no thanks.

'Fem!Harry.' - sorry, but I just can't relax and enjoy these. I've tried a couple, but my mind just won't reconcile 'her' as being 'Harry.'

** 'Better than it sounds', 'Not your usual', or anything in a similarly self-aggrandizing tone. Just tell me what it's about, let me judge the quality.

If it has more than one or two characters listed for bashing, I'm likely to not click. Minor bashing I can put up with, but anything beyond that just bothers me. I far prefer complex characterizations, and bashing usually means simplified to an idiotic degree because the author doesn't like them and can't be bothered to even try.

** -If someone is spelling the names of the characters wrong even in the summary, it usually means they do it the entire fic. It's especially bad if it's someone they tagged and had the tagged name right there for reference.

-"I don't know what to put here, just read it."

-"I swear this is better than it seems just give it a chance!"

-Anything where Harry is leaving Magical Britain behind and they add "with a special someone" because it almost always means Draco Malfoy and people have realized that a lot of us don't like him and don't want to read about him as a main character, so they try to sneak him in by not tagging him as a character or mentioning him in the summary.

-"See inside for the full summary."

-"Things happen."

-"Will change the summary/title at some point, I promise."

-HG/DM

-If every sentence int he summary ends with an exclamation point, I lose my patience and won't bother.

** Bashing, any sort of phrase purporting a story to be the real story, betrayed (harry by his friends, a random death eater by voldemort could be good), Dramoine or Draco/Hermoine, Hadrian.

Anything describing the story as being slash or femslash as a main focus of the story (I'm a straight dude and prefer straight romances, but don't mind if other pairings are slash or femslash), or describing the story as taking part in a game or being a crossover.

I can only think of a few crossover that I might find interesting, like Sherlock Holmes investigating the death of someone who had been AK'ed and finding his way into the magical world somehow (please let me know if this exists) or if Harry (or Voldemort, especially him) was pulled into the world of Fate/Stay Night as Caster (honestly, if FSN was more popular with fanfic writers, it could be the king of crossovers). Too many crossovers just take characters from other stuff and throw them into Hogwarts, or take HP characters and throw them into other universes without an interesting justification. And while I know it is fun for some people to see their favorite characters interact, it's not my thing.

Funny you mention that, there's absolutely fics with this exact plot ! I read this one (abandonned) a long time ago so I don't remember if it's good, but there it is :

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9281423/1/Of-Wizards-and-Detectives]]

I'm sure I also read at least one other, so it's probably somewhere on ffnet :)

**** Honestly, the idea popped in my head and I knew it had to exist. Thanks for passing it on, too bad it's abandoned. Just found out there are over 400 crossover fics on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] between Harry Potter and Sherlock Holmes, most of them with the TV series Sherlock (modern setting helps), but a few with the books or the recent moves. Heck, there is one crossing over with the series Elementary but it's in Spanish. I'll check on the one you linked and look through other crossovers for what I'm looking for when I feel like reading it.

The version I'm imagining would involve Harry as an Auror and initially involve conflict between them before allowing Sherlock to investigate. Could be followed up with sequels where Sherlock is consulted on murders or other crimes that are difficult to solve. Heck, thinking about it I'd loved to read a fic where Gringotts brings in Sherlock after the Philosopher's Stone is stolen from their vaults.

***** Yeah Sherlock/HP crossover fics are one of the only crossover that I like, there's so much possibilities for detective work and great murder mysteries. I haven't checked the new ones in a while though, but I definitely will soon. Though a lot of the existing fics are a variation on « Sherlock rescues Harry from the Dursley and adopts him » (sometimes the Dursley die, sometimes they just abandon him, etc.), I haven't read any of these ones. I did read a few entertaining Hermione/Sherlock fics, can't remember any names but some were nice, if a bit short.

Another crossover that can be interesting is marvel cinematic universe/HP, I haven't read many but there's so much potential, Harry and co could be recruited by Shield, etc. I know there are a few Hermione/Loki stories where she's recruited to heal him, or to help keep him captive, because his magic makes it hard for muggles to do that.

****** I've never seen a Marvel/Harry Potter crossover that I found interesting, but I guess MCU could work if done right. Helps that the MCU is mostly set after Harry Potter, and that in that universe, most people become aware of superheroes when Harry would be in his late 20's/early 30's. That could lead to a world where people wouldn't be as freaked out by magical powers, especially after Scarlett witch became widely know, thought there would of course be the same problems of fear of those more powerful. It could lead to the loosening of the statute of secrecy as magic is interpreted as super powers.

Edit: Forgot to add that it being set when Harry is an adult means that the existence of superheroes doesn't fundamentally change how the Harry Potter series plays out, because it definitely would. The Wizarding World would have changed in response to any revelation of the existence of superheroes, and any fic set during Harry's time at Hogwarts would have to reflect that.

*** Voldemort as caster would have been terrific, though I might prefer his younger and less insane Tom Riddle self.

FSN is fairly popular. Unfortunately many of its most favorite xover are powerwank, like fate's gamble.

I'll admit that to write a good Holy Grail War is hard. So not many people can do it

** Snape/anyone. (Except for his canon unrequited fixation on Lily Evans). I don't mind stories about Snape at all, but any Snape pairings just cannot be parsed. I love a good Snape-mentors-Harry fic, but I loathe "Snape is secretly Harry's father" fics.

Fics with self-inserts or canon-modifying OCs. At all. Even if it's well-written and all, I just do not want to read them.

Fics where Hermione becomes an all-knowing powerful badass and Harry is marginalized for her greater glory. "Harry may be destined to defeat Voldemort - but it is Hermione who will lead the wizarding world afterwards!"

Anything with the next generation.

** Frankly if I see a pairing - any pairing - that the author has felt the need to highlight in the description, then I'm significantly more likely to avoid it. I'm willing to read most any pairing. If it happens in the story. If the story happens in the pairing I'm not interested. I'm not reading fanfiction for "the best pairing" or "what should have happened". I want to further explore and enjoy the world and alternatives to the story. Telling me the pairing in the summary means that I'm exploring a pairing.

And man, some people get /obsessive/ over pairings

*** In my personal experience, I got attacked A LOT by people for 'not warning them' about the pairing even when I tagged the eventual pairing from the beginning. Even if it looks like this, [X/X] to signify that it is a pairing in the fic, people don't pay attention for some reason? So I will usually add at the end of my summary a small A/N: [Ship name] to warn people. If someone attacks me over the ship despite it being tagged and coming RIGHT AFTER THE SUMMARY, then it is their fault for reading.

**** Honestly I'd just chalk it up to their fault from the start, if they have any problem with a pairing simply for not being their favourite. But I get that it's a different when you're the author getting bombarded with arseholes vitriol over something small you can avoid with a small note.

I get that avoiding stories like that will lose me some stories that don't fit the mould. Chances are I might end up reading the decent ones eventually - if I see something coming up frequently, like recommended here with a more detailed overview then I'm more inclined to ignore the pairing part. But for the most part it just makes it easier for me
