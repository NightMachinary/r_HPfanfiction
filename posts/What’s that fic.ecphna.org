Harry doesn't go to Hogwarts. He has to pay for all of his own food and works a a convenience store. He has a friend who I think might be female who has two dads one is a step dad and her homophobic relatives related or could be her mom that take her away and he is alone. He keeps seeing Dumbledore outside of the gas station and he hides behind the counter from him.

Sorry for the bad grammar I was typing what I remember the story to be stream of consciousness also English isn't my first language.

Thanks for the potential help, if you see this post I highly recommend it. The writing of the doc is way better then mine obviously, but that isn't hard.

(I could've sworn I bookmarked this fic, but evidently not.)
