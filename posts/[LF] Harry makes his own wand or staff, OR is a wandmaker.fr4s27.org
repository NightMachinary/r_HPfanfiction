So I'm looking for any good fics where Harry makes his own wand/staff thing or any good fics where he becomes a wandmaker

Also fics with cool wandlore explanations

Thank you!


** I wish this was a more common element.

I know it happens in this one Harry/Voldemort Ground hogs day fic where he decides to help Voldy instead of kill him after his first 50 lifes.

All the other ones I can think of he gets the parts to Olivander who makes it for him. Dissapointing.

** He crafts his own wand in "The Shadow of Angmar", a Lord of the Rings crossover.

Something to keep in mind though is that the author has done an amazing job at capturing that Tolkien feel, which of course means the pacing is slow and the magic is subtle. That combined with the fact that Harry has no idea how to actually go about crafting a wand means that it takes awhile for him to do so in the fic.

  The war was finally over and Harry had just started finding a life for himself away from the death and violence he'd experienced. He had a interested career, close friends and now family with Andromeda and his godson Teddy. Unfortunately his Potter luck struck and Harry finds himself in another universe, with new powers and a more established Voldemort wrecking the world. As much as Harry would love to just go home, it turns out he can't until he defeats Voldemort again...so much for retirement from war.

  “There is a pleasure in the pathless woods” Lord Byron. Harry finds himself unexpectedly reacquainted with Draco Malfoy when his work as an apprentice wandmaker takes him to Wiltshire. Amongst the trees Harry finds magic, growth, and a man who might finally be proving he's worthy of the wand that chose him. Hawthorn, Unicorn hair, 10 inches, reasonably pliant.A story of found family, trees with feelings, belief in the power of growth, wandlore, and gratuitous description of Handsome Estate Owner™ Draco Malfoy swanning around in white shirts and leather boots.

*** That being listed as complete feels incredibly disingenuous. There are also so many loose threads, and I suppose you can call that a "less definitive ending" like he did in those weird author's notes, but it's a lot more like ignoring deliberately placed plot points for..ambiguity's sake? I don't know. Tons of "Chekhov's gun" scenarios. What was the point of introducing the dementor knife and having them once be human, then never mentioning it again? What is the point of having Ron be kidnapped and resolving halfheartedly it in a post credit note (This was particularly irritating because for most of the story it seems like he's leading up to some kind of brainwashing scenario?)? Why did he keep making a point of adding bounty money to Harry's coffers then just never did anything about it? So much of this makes no sense.

** linkffn(The Wand Shop) sounds just what you're looking for!

Quite a few powerful Harry stories have him making his own wand, usually with some rubbish like basilisk fang, but it does work quite well in linkffn(11574569)

And the creation of his own wand is one of the crucial plots in linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar)

** It's been mentioned twice in the thread, but I'll say it again, linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) is really good, and Harry's lack of a wand (up until nearly the end of the completed part of the story) and his efforts to craft one make up a considerable part of the plot. The Shadow of Angmar is one of my favorite fics of all time even though it isn't yet finished; the way Harry is integrated into Tolkien's world is just superb.

I feel like Harry was maybe hiding away post war or maybe post Voldemort wins, and started crafting wands bc he couldn't have one anymore bc the ministry had said he was a villain or wanted or whatever. So he was making his own to avoid the trace. But, I may be mixing several story ideas.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!
