It was quite long, if I remember correctly, and featured her being good friends with Draco, Blaise, and Theodore. It was basically a harem-ish thing, with the boys being in love with her, and with a whole adventure/mystery plot.

Something I'm pretty sure happened was Theodore dying at the end. They called him Teddy in the fic, I think. I remember reading it a few years ago and I've been searching and unable to find it.
