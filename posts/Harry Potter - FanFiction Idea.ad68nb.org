** First of all, this is a setting, not a story.

For any good story plot and setting have to work hand-in-hand - even if that sometimes means that the plot has to move out of the way (1984, ...).

However, if you just build a world without any ideas for stories in it, it'll often fall rather flat.

Anyways, to the actual content: I'm not sure I really love it. It is super hard to write a young genius, and even harder to write one below the age of 10. Heck, I've been friends with a few "child geniuses" when I was younger, but none came close to what you want, and that makes it super hard to pull off.

It also takes away all the magic out of magic, but that is just a personal dislike of mine.

"Runic electricity" seems like something you should start with: Just make a wheel spin, and attach two magnets - profit!

In the end, if I can make a suggestion: It would make a lot of sense to write this as a self-insert instead. Having an adult in a child's body makes things more believable and gives you lot of material to work with.

And no matter if it's an SI or not, the typical audiences for this specific power-wank (which it is, and that is completely fine!) would probably be over at the Space Battles and Sufficient Velocity forums, so if you go there, you'll definitely find people that will like it. In those forums plot also usually comes kind of second, so that might fit with your vision.

** The Internet was not even a thing in the 70s/early 80s, at least not in the shape we know it.

And the ages seem off. It would be believable if Hermione came up with something like that after decades of research and trial&error, but not Harry at age 9.

  He becomes one of the major pillars in defeating Tom Riddle. He helps Harry with Dark Arts Weapons development,
#+end_quote

Also, why would you need "dark arts weapons" when a regular sniper does the trick just fine. You don't need to work around shields and such if the other side doesn't even know you are there.

#+begin_quote
  Also, his a metamorphmagus.
#+end_quote

A completely unnecessary gimmick for him to have, like Harry's magical animagus form in most stories. It adds nothing to the story but bragging rights.

#+begin_quote
  James Potter: Famous Quidditch player, Snape's arch enemy, prankster, pampered prince.
#+end_quote

So if you are going with book canon Snape and an exaggerated James, why doesn't Snape has his dark arts obsession and is perfectly fine with Death Eaters as friends? You seem very pro-Snape and anti-James for no apparent reason, as Snape's reasons to be on Harry's side are rather useless for the plot. And you are completely oblivious to the actual canon situation where both sides were little shits. But no, let's whitewash Snape instead.

#+begin_quote
  Like Dumbledore he is aware of the muggle technical advancement and will take full advantage of it.
#+end_quote

I think you seriously underestimate how long progress takes. If Harry invents the McGuffin, it would take years until others capitalise on that. Just look at the development of the steam engine or how long it took for things like LEDs to make it from the drawing board into mass production.

*** An alternative universe where Harry is born on the 31st of July 2008. (i think you missed that bit)

U seemed so pissed off for some reason, I dont know what the issue is. This is AU FF, and just an idea. If everything is like cannon then i might as well copy and paste JK's work. So just chill.

Rest is Just perspective really, no right or wrong. People can bend however they like. Like i said this is just and idea and i don't plan to write a FF. I am not anti James its just how the story flows. Hence its AU.

​

" I think you seriously underestimate how long progress takes. " LOL you take a FF book way too seriously. And I do know how long things take to invent / make and how much effort is required.

​

I believe metamorphmagus is an over powered ability to have, It was used brilliantly in prince of slytherin. In the wrong hands it can be very powerful tool.

#+end_quote

At some point, AUs stop feeling like Harry Potter anymore and the only shared part are the names (not even the personalities).

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

But why would you give that to Voldemort? He has the murder and fascist takeover parts down without it, so why give him another ability if canon is already enough.

#+begin_quote
  LOL you take a FF book way too seriously.
#+end_quote

Given the overall premise of "science", it is to be taken seriously. If you write a "Harry has a 10-foot cock" AU, that's obviously crack, but stories which feature science generally strife for accuracy and being believable.

#+begin_quote
  nd an exaggerated James
#+end_quote

in what way is that an exaggerated james? that's a charitable interpretation of him. canon!james was also a bully and shitty to at least one of his friends

and canon!snape doesn't have a dark arts obsession. he has an interest and talent for it. one of his many interests and talents
