As the title says, let's collectively come up with immortality methods besides horcruxes.

#+begin_quote
  You know my goal --- to conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked
#+end_quote

Now, it's likely that Voldemort is referring to his multiple horcruxes but it'd be interesting if Voldemort was referring to other immortality methods that he had experimented with. With the inspiration of the quote, what are some other immortality methods that Voldemort could have explored? This means that they should remain thematically consistent with the HP series and its magic system.

A few methods I've seen in fics (though I don't remember which ones):

1. Phylactery - This was an idea where one could place their whole soul into a container. It wouldn't involve splitting a soul and their body would be animated via the soul jar. It came with the caveat that if someone got their hands on the soul jar, one could be completely controlled by that person. Though this contradicts canon in part, I think it's definitely very thematically consistent. For a while, I thought that this was from /The Tales of Beedle the Bard/ and was actually from canon.
2. Philosopher's Stone Anchor - This was an idea where one could create and then embed a philosopher's stone within themselves. One would not age and be unable to die so long as the philosopher's stone remained within them. They would be able to die, however, if the stone was destroyed (say by a blasting curse to the body part with the embedded stone). My alteration to this is that it has to be in the heart, which I think goes nicely with the story about the hairy heart.
3. A spell to split body, spirit, and mind. This was an idea where one would cast a spell. Upon "dying", their spirit would go to an anchor, one's memories (mind) would go to a diary. If spirit was reunited with mind (I think the diary sort of possessed someone), the body would be reincarnated and the person would be reborn whole again.

My idea is drinking the blood of a unicorn and linking the ensuing curse to a time turner. The blood provides the magic to stop aging and repair wounds while the time turner allows one to manipulate the curse so that it doesn't effect them. It would help stave off death from the form of violence because of the curse which, although negated by the time turner which has to be constantly spun, would try and manipulate chance to keep one alive until the curse can take action. This method comes with the caveat that if the time turner is destroyed, the curse would act with a vengeance.


** when i read that quote i figured voldemort also did nofap.

and vegan keto diets

they kill all the horcruxes but then

#+begin_quote
  "Mwahahhaha Potter! You forget I'm on the vegan keto diet!"

  "Harry," Hermione said with worry. "We have to deprive Voldemort of his tofu, avocados, nuts and olives. We'll never be able to kill him otherwise."
#+end_quote

maybe also capri sun

#+begin_quote
  "Severus, bring me my capri sun, I need it to sustain my immortality," said Voldemort.

They could always just force-feed him a hotdog. That'd surely do him in.

** I mean, you could probably do it even easier than that. Just learn a healing spell that creates cells. Make it so that it affect the whole body and now, so long as you take care of your health you won't die of old age, everytime you are getting too old you just use the spell and become young again.

I am sure people with more than bio101 will tell me this doesn't make sense and explain a better way tho

** From more traditional methods I can recall rn:

- if you don't mind being a creature, vampirism is an option. In Italy, where there is plenty sun, garlic in a diet and crosses everywhere - don't recommend. In England you would hardly feel a difference.

Usually you want a bite from another vampire, unless you are ginger, then just take care to not get yr corpse stabbed in the heart or buried without head (happens in magical Greece all the time just in case).

- research some others local creatures that may grand you immortality for a price. Be careful about fae rings, the parties aren't as good as they say

- if you already died you may try to reanimated yrself - assuming you have failsaves, but which aspiring immortal don't have those - into a lich, wraith or a ghoul which in HP canon may or may not make u a dementor

- get your mind/soul a brand new body via some crazy transfer techniques (see: Orochimaru, Charles Xavier, Self/less) so pretty much what Voldemort used, but pls use it with style and don't forget about noses

- eat a mermaid or get her tears for a potion, depending on the severity of yr case, you may try blending both but be aware that smoothie will be salty and smelling like fish but surely /you can swallow your pride/ for the sake of eternity

- go on a quest to find peaches of immortality/apples of Idunn or some other suspicious magical fruit. What the hell, go wild, make immortal fruit salad. Tastes best with Ambrosia

- if u happen upon the fountain of youth during the quest, forget this salad idea, just jump in

- anger a god or some other entity by eg. killing yr brother or just plain swearing on them, they don't take to criticism well

- get into alchemy, sacrifice million of souls for philosopher stone, blame it on bubonic plague, live happily ever after with yr significant other

Or, y'know, eat cinnabar or gold to get their qualities (I don't take responsibility for following that advice btw)

- find and use Holy Grail (don't confuse with Holy Granade, but I suppose only truly worthy will obtain immortality, so yeah, pretend I said nothing)

I hope that our future aspiring immortals will find those ideas helpful xD

*** become capable enough in necromancy to truly ressurect people set up to your liveforce linked ritual wich aktivates itself upon your death to take your soul back and stuff it into beforehand created body

also use live prolonging methods like stealing live force for example or genetical engineering to have the time to master Soul Magic to a sufficient point to find the exact mechanism wich forces souls to leave the living world and disable it for yourself really why should you master soul magic if you do not want to modify your own soul to become greater?

**** Well the next step would be creating an ÅŒken, killing a Soul King, transcending into higher being and becoming god to destroy divide between what is dead and alive

Or if you are more lazy, reincarnation and becoming Shaman King would do too xD

** Hah! Number 3 was my fic "Return" (no longer on FF.Net). Blast from the past.

A couple of others:

1. Taking the idea of conceptual magic and running with it, Voldemort casts a spell on death itself to exclude himself from it. Like a "death fidelius". (This was where Lords of Magic would have gone).

2. Voldemort has cast a spell on the name "Lord Voldemort" with the effect that he will continue to survive so long as people fear the name. Dumbledore started the "He Who Must Not Be Named" thing in an effort to have the name "Lord Voldemort" pass out of use and be forgotten. Obviously requires an AU as Dumbledore's position in canon is the opposite.

** I have an outline for an after yr 3 fic where Harry and Hermione are invited to an interscholastic event by schools that wont get to be in the triwizard tournament.

The event takes place in Atlantis, which is only accessible by ship via Durmstrang-like water-teleportation.

Voldemort's shade comes with, and you learn that Atlantis holds knowledge of where to find.... the Fountain of Youth.
