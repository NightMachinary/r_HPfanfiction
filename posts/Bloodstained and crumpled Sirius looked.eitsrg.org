Bloodstained and crumpled Sirius looked at the letter in his hand. He had another chance. He could go to Hogwarts again, See James again, Stand Back to Back with Bella again.... But If today Was his 11th birthday, It was the day his mother.... his mother Tortured Bella for the first time.... And Bellatrix was bleeding ... He had get her to Aunt Cassie ...she had saved her last time. If he waited any longer.... shit! “Bella ! Bella stay with me!” , Sirius shouted as Bellatrix Lost Consciousness. ... Dammit he need a wand.... He needed... Floo powder... Grandfather kept it next to the fireplace.... He bolted out from under the table Towards The Smoldering hearth.... He screamed the Moment the flames turned green ,”Bellwood cottage Cassiopeia black!... Aunt Cassie! Bella won't wake up!”

An old woman's face appeared in the fire, “ It out-of-the-way boy I'm coming through, What's wrong with her?”

Cassiopeia black, The only member of his grandfathers generation besides uncle Alphard he trusted appeared in the room. Sirius seized her arm And dragged her across the room.

“ Walb-Mum! Tortured her! “ Sirius explained Catching himself midsentence.He was still an 11 year old to Aunt Cassie , Not the 30 plus year old battle hardened escaped prison he actually was .

He pulled Bella out from under the table, Battered, Bloody ,Brilliant Bellatrix... she was still breathing. “ Mum use the Crusiatis curse on her. “ His voice sounded hollow even too his own ears.

Aunt Cassie Got to work as quick as a flash, All while muttering to herself, “ I've told Arcturus that women is mad, but. He is just as bad. This can't continue.”

Sirius just stood by and stared , Bella would be alright , but he needed a plan they couldn't survive Living through their childhood again. Bellatrix the mad as she already was ... had gotten them a second chance... he had to make sure they didn't waste it ... it was only fair...

He was going to need a Solicitor and Aunt Dorea she was the only one that had grandfather out gunned. He had to protect Bella this time . She wasn't mad anymore he had to make sure she stayed that way... and he ... he needed to get the marauders back together....
