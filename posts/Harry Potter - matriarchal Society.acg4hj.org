I'm looking for a fanfic I read years ago and cannot seem to find it again.

It about a Matriarchal society where having boys is rare and men have to have multiple wives so that they can keep their population afloat. Every girl aims to be the first wife as it is the most prestigious title.

Harry, Luna, Trelawney and Lilly can see magic (which is an ability only girls should have) and Harry and Luna are kept away from each other as their abilities force them to become bonded


** You are looking for the Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs. I strongly dislike the stories, but here you go: linkffn(8629685), linkffn(9646669), linkffn(10373959). Enjoy.

*** Same here, The worst part is that the author had a very original idea, is very good at writing, but I simply could not get interested enough to keep reading it.

​

(I mean, Robst is a terrible writer and keeps recycling his ideas over and over, but I always get immersed in his stories...I wonder what this tells about myself....)

**** It actually speaks a lot about what I find is wrong in the Firebird Trilogy. It doesn't immerse the reader. Harry Potter is a great series because it is easy to find characters to emphasise with. Robst allows for you to find joy in the easy victories of the characters. His style is weak and would never work as actual novels but as fanfiction, they are well-written guilty pleasure fics.

Firebird offers---at least for me---no branch to hols onto. Characters are difficult to emphasise with, the world, while is immensely creative, lacks any connection to my world. I mean I started the story but by midpoint, I was extremely put off by the neutered Dumbledore and the extreme opposite of the world we live in with no fixes to the situation.

In HP, Voldemort is a foe that seems undefeatable but even then, J.K manages to leave a tiny possibility of victory that has you believing.

***** Exactly! I also think that, as fandom progresses, you have authors that are trully fanfiction authors- as in they simply wish to fullfill their own desires in relation to their favorite characters- and A.U writters, who basically just use an established book as a starting point. In this case, the end result has, more often than not, characters that share only a name with their originals and, or, even worse IMO, they are filled with a myriad of OC´s, which also does not help with being immersed in the story. ( my personal rule is that, before you add an OC, you should use an underdeveloped estalished supporting character; the audience already know that name in relation to the story, and creating a back story to someone who has just a couple of line in the original work is better than coming up with someone.)

​

I mean I LOVE a manipulative, evil Dumbledore and I think there is an open case of interpretation for his actions and innactions during the series; it is a twist in a character that was meant as a grandfather figure and it has some baring in canon, therefore I can accept such change in perspective easily, especially if well written and explained in the plot. Now, in Firebird , Dumbledore is just a cardboard supporting character that I was never able to identifiy as Dumbledore during his appearances- at least in book one- ; the rest of the characters inhabiting that world are simply- even Harry-...NOT appealing to me.

​

At the heart of the matter, Robst treats his characters with warmth and care; he REALLY wants Harry and Hermione to suceed and makes no bones about it. His writing might be not that great, but his fiction is filled with great moments and even Harry Crow, there is no filling chapter. Firebird? It is like the author does not see his characters as human beings- he just needs they to act in the way they do because we are supposed to believe that is what they would do in that society. and, what really annoyed me is that, in order to give us a plot twist, the author betrays his own idea a couple of times- come on, in a society where men are few, have multiple wives and get married off early on, especially in rich families, are we supposed to believe that Sirius Black went nuts because Lily Evans did not have sex with him?

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

  Hard times lead to hard choices. What's more important? Freedom, or fate? Love, or death? Harry Potter stands on the edge of a precipice, and he is not sure if the right move is to turn and fight, or fall.

  They had a plan, formulated from before they were even born. That plan died. From its ashes rises a Harry Potter no longer willing, or able, to let others fight his battles for him. Outgunned, outclassed, outmatched, nonetheless Harry will take up the sword to change not only Britain, but the world.

**** It's rather simple, really. It conjures up a world in which everything I believe is mutilated into almost non-existence. The characters are following rather stupid strings of thoughts in their reasonings, playing after the rules of their adversaries instead of using any means necessary to create a status quo they would want to live in. There is so much complaining in the story, how awful and unjust all this is, and yet, despite all the cries of despair, these protagonists accomplish nothing that would lessen the burden they supposedly have been given.

​

Then there is also the fact that I abhor soulbondery and underage sex and very generally speaking, the undermining of free will and its consequences. Firebird Trilogy offers a world of unfree will, but to explain that would take too much time just now and I am hungry. Toodles.

** I would read such a story - but only if Harry is fed up with this and not accepting that he's basically cattle (or a sex toy!)!

"So you want to be my wife/wives? Well, how about you prove yourself/yourselves worthy of the honor? Show me that you respect me, that you don't want to make me your toy!" (he should say something like this to candidates for marriage)
