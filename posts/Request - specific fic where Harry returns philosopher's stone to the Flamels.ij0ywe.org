** Kinda sounds familiar, is it the one where harry steals it at first but nick finds out? I cant remember the name but harry was pretty much a kleptomaniac.

** I believe it's either linkffn(Travel Secrets: First by E4mj) or linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5199602/1/The-Thief-of-Hogwarts]])

Both of these have interactions with the Flamels, and the first has Harry use a different aura (darker) to gat by in knockturn

(If I remember right)

** It happened in a Gamer fic - the only other thing I remember is that Harry has that training-Dungeon power, and the Zombie level's boss is a Dementor, and at some point he kills a werewolf in self-defence who turns out to be the father of one of his classmates
