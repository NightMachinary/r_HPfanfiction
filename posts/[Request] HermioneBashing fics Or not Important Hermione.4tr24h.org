Hey guys do you know any good Hermione!Bashing? Or fics where Hermione is not important to the story/ not a friend of Harry? Basically I don't ask much: Just a story where Hermione is not (anymore) a friend of Harry.

PS: Oh and not slash please.

** Linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) has Hermione siding with Ron when Harry's name is entered in the tournament. She later accidentally destroys his Holly wand and their friendship ends completely. 6/10 story though.

Good story and bashing. Pick one.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

**** I finished it maybe 3 months ago so I can't fully summarize the plot, but I can give you the gist of it.

Independent, powerful Harry, mentored by the portrait of Salazar Slytherin, Basilisk venom core wand(made out of fucking STEEL lmao), surprisingly well paced Harry/Fleur romance, Harry frequently uses cringy Anonymous catchphrase "I do not forgive, I do not forget", Order bashing, Ron/Hermione/Dumbledore bashing(moreover negative portrayal of characters rather than making shit up), GOF/OOTP timeframe, I think Harry gets a stupid Veela bird animagus? Either animagus or his Patronus changes to match Fleurs. Convoluted Horcrux gathering, Hermione is possessed by the Locket Horcrux while Voldemort sieges hogwarts, Hermione kills Sirius and is killed by Harry, Harry sort of kamikaze/martyrdom kills Voldemort. He is defeated by LV but mysteriously Voldemort dies anyway, Harry comes back to life at the end.

I can't portray the story in a positive light unless I leave significant details out. It's a shit story with decent writing and a decent romance. Everything else is cliche.

***** No, not steel: Ebony! (just re-read the scene and the one previous where Hermione destroys his holly wand...the catchphrase is cringe worthy, but I don't know if I'd say something better if someone destroys an item I consider irreplacable!)

Still, I've got to finish this one (didn't realize it had been finished)...Well done Harry/Fleur sadly is rare (just like generally Harry/Older-Female-Student fictions are rare!), so you got to take it when you can get!

It doesn't.

Everyone but Harry-Sue gets bashed in this story. In order to make the protagonist more sympathetic, Seel'vor casts Hermione as a woman who gives up on her dream of being Harry-Sues girlfriend because of practical reasons. Harry eventually forgives her when she starts acting like a sexual prop in the story.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

** In linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) there's no bashing, but Hermione and Ron aren't very important characters and don't get much screentime, as it were. The Weasley twins also (unlike most fics) don't get their dicks sucked by the author non-stop, although they aren't bashed either.

Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.
