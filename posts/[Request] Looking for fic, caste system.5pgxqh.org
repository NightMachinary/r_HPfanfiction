Not sure how to bump posts, so just reposting.

Hello,

I'm hoping that someone here will be able to help me.

I started reading a fanfic a long time ago and then lost the link.

It started off in I believe ancientish Egypt (though that could be wrong) and the ruler had a prophet that told him about either a way he could be immortal, or something else.

Anyway, fast forward he's still alive and there's now a caste system in the wizarding world. Muggleborns are taken from their parents as small children and put into homes, and when at Hogwarts the students are paired with another student that's their study partner etc throughout their time there. Harry is paired with Draco, and Hermione is a sort of wildchild that was taken into the muggleborn home later on.

Thank you. I'll try to remember some more details about it.

Edit: There was also some sort of camp made up of people that were against the school and the way everything works, and I believe Tom Riddle was the head master of the school.


** Sounds similar to linkffn(Reign of the serpent)

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
