*** I love it, too bad it updates so slowly (once every many months).

It's very well written, the drama is believable and not forced and the pace is slow but not frozen (things change, albeit slowly).

This is one of the very few exception to "Female OC" being a terrible choice.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

While I am somewhat a fan of HP/OC, there aren't many that are readable or they're daughter of Sirius or incest which isn't my cup of tea to be honest.

** linkao3(Living Stone Architecture) has Harry with a female OC. The relationship isn't the central focus of the story though, so if you're looking for something more dedicated to the relationship, I'd take a look at the other recommendations in this thread.

  Harry Potter is 18 years old and he doesn't know who he is. It may be a bit dramatic to say something like that, because he realises he is Harry Potter. But he's just a random guy who doesn't even know what he likes to do for fun, now that Lord Voldemort has been defeated. Or, the one where Harry Potter doesn't know what to do with himself after the war, so he becomes an architect, makes new friends, falls in love, and accidentally changes the world.
