I can't remember the name of it, but there was a scene where Draco challenges Harry to a duel in front of everybody, they duel and Harry kept slapping Malfoy's wand out of his hand, causing everyone to start laughing and Malfoy is just too shocked to do anything about it.


** The only story I remember reading where Harry keeps slapping Malfoy (face not wand) during a duel is called Harem of Honeys by RotaryFile (aka Selector).

Here's a link to the author's page (as I don't remember what age the sex starts at).
