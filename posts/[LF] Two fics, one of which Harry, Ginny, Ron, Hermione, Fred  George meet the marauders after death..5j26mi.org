The fic starts with Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione and George meeting up with Fred/waiting for eachother to die at the King's Cross-esque halfwaypoint. The fic includes a scene where Harry and James pranks Sirius by having Harry pretend to be James.

I'm also looking for another fic which includes a scene between Harry and Snape as well as a quidditch match between Harry, James, and others on one side vs Dumbledore, Regulus black + others on the other side.

It was a while since I read either of these fics and I may have gotten the details of what happens in which fic mixed up. I think they were over on AO3, SIYE or HPFF but they may have been on FFN. Not really sure where I read them.
