I was trying to find a fanfic I recall reading once. It was set after the books, at a sort of pagan-style party with all the weasleys and associated friends/family. I think it centered on either Rose Weasley or Victoire Weasley, and it ended up with her giving her virginity to a man taking on the role of the forest lord or something similarly fae, who we find out is Harry Potter and this is a sort of tradition for basically all the women of the cast once their husbands are drunk. Wasn't having much luck searching for it, so I thought I'd try here.
