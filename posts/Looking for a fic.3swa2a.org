I remember reading it some time ago, but I've forgotten its name. Basically Harry dies in the forest and is transported to a different dimension everytime he dies but remembers his original life. All of the alterante dimensions have no magic. IN one dimension he becomes a football player


** That sounds like this one, I think. linkffn(6563043)

  Voldemort strikes and Harry falls. When he comes back to himself he isn't at Kings Cross with Dumbledore. Instead he's at the Dursleys, going to Stonewall High instead of Hogwarts. Why?

*** Yep, that's the one. And I was also stupid and didn't call it football at all. Because I didn't even think about that, since I'd never encountered anyone that called it football, not soccer. Now I'm married to someone that calls it football and I realize just how annoying it was.
