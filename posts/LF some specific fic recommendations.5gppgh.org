Hi everyone, I'm looking for fanfic recommendations that fall specifically into the following categories:

- Marauder Era (Although I may have entirely exhausted these fics)

- Hermione Granger time travel to Marauder Era (Not sure what this is actually called, but I am hoping that any fics are up to the standard of 'The Debt of Time')

- Dramione (Post-Hogwarts)

If you could please recommend fics that are at least 100k words, that would be excellent.

Thank you and Merry Christmas!


** Have you read linkffn(roundabout destiny by maryroyale)? I highly recommend it if you haven't!

  Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.

***** It's a good story. The only thing that I really dislike - though it's just a pet peeve - is the way female virginity is hyped in the story.

** Haha yeah no kidding.

For Marauder era stuff I read mostly wolfstar. Two of my favorites are [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/][The Shoebox Project]] and Casting Moonshadows. The shoebox project is one of the original and most famous marauder fics in the fandom. It's a series of pictures, letters, stories etc. from their 6th and 7th years at Hogwarts before the war started. It's really heartwarming and the characters just jump off the page. There are some weird parts that make no sense, but overall this is one of my favorite fics ever. I just love their friendship and reading this makes me really nostalgic for college (as I never went to boarding school hs). Even though I have read other "wolfstar," most of the vignettes from this have become head-canon for me.

[[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/3378356/1/Casting-Moonshadows][Casting Moonshadows]] is one of my favorite marauder fics. This spans from first year until the end of 6th year (although it is still being updated occasionally) and is one of the most detailed and beautifully written MWPP fics in fandom.

The downsides are that it is really dark (especially Remus' and Sirius' back stories) and assuming it sticks with canon going forward, knowing what happens to the Marauders (especially Remus and Sirius), makes parts especially heartbreaking.

The pranks in this fic are amazing. The friendships are heartwarming. It will make you laugh and cry. There's a reason why this fic has 7k comments and is such a favorite almost 10 years after it was started. The author is also a published author in her own right, so you know the writing is great. Linkffn(3378356)

For Hermione going back to Marauder era IMO there is no better fic than [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1124404][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]]. It's seriously the best and one of my all time favorites. Linkao3(1124404)

I've read some Dramione but none that I really liked enough to personally rec. I would check out Hawthore and Vine though for a lot of good suggestions. The Fallout is on there and it wasn't to my taste but I've seen people say it's their favorite fic in all of fandom. It's a war AU where Draco fights with the Order and it's really dark but it's well done if you like war fics.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

  Lonely and outcast by his classmates, Remus wishes on a moonshadow for a friend who understands him. To his amazement his wish is answered not once, but three times, by his former enemies, the Marauders. SBRL and some JPLE as well, of course.

**** Thank so much! I've read Casting Moonshadows and will be sure to check out the other two. Do you know of anyway to get The Shoebox Project onto a kindle? With ffn and ao3 stories, you can download them as a Mobi file or use ficsave.xyz to download them, but is The Shoebox Project only on that one website?
