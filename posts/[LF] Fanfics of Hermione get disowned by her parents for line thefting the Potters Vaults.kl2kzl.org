*** u/Bleepbloopbotz2:
#+begin_quote
  Packed with cliches and has the writing style of a midwesteren 15 year old.

  Over 2k+ favs.
#+end_quote

Never change FFN

Edit : Pretty sure this fic also break's rule 8 as reviews seem to suggest Hermione and Ginny are forced to become goblin sex slaves or something to that effect

**** I read the chapter in question.

The author of this fic probably shouldn't be allowed near schools.

**** I can think of 4 reasons:

- Rabid Hermione fans taking insult from his comment.
- People hate them for being born in 1997.
- The tone of their comment irks people.
- They were the newest comment on here that didn't answer the question.

****** Can't remember the exact wording, but it was something like:

'A fic where Hermione isn't good and does [something reprehensible]? Lol good luck' - brackets are the parts I can't remember the exact wording.
