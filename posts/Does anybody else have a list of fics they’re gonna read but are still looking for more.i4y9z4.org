I mean, I have an A4 list of fanfics I wanna read (only like 4 aren't Harry Potter) but there's like a couple of them which are 100+ chapters and I read those ones first, but I keep looking for more fics to read after the one I'm reading now. So I just keep getting more and more fics to read, when 1. I already have so many to read and 2. I gotta start writing my ones soon otherwise I'll end up with so many fics to read and so many fic Ideas to write and just never ever finish either

Does that make sense? (I don't plan stuff before writing, be it a text comment or story -so all of my stories are being made up as I write them a)


** Obvs. Don't we all? :D

I've only been here 8 months and I've already got a thousand fics in my list to-read (and I'm not kidding. Not including the fics I'm actively reading, I have 979 fics on my 'to-read' list.)

**** Yep. I'm a story hoarder. Books, games, ebooks, tv series, movies, etc. I'm definitely like those tumblr posts "Oh, I have a hundred of *insert media thing here* at home... Maybe just a dozen more new *insert media thing here*'s on this shopping trip." :D

** I love ao3 for the bookmark feature because I simply tag it 'To Read' and go back over them regularly. Many are also wip where I wanted to wait until they're finished before reading them. Other work I put on my to-read-list in my fanfic Word where I document the ones I've read already, the ones I havent finished yet (boring, too long etc) those I still have to check out. It's horribly long by now.

**** Yes, but the bookmarks also show the tags and summary, clompletion status etc and not just the name. I also tag other things so when the mood hits for a specific pairing/genre I can reliaby find a fic in my bookmarks instead of going hunting in the wild.

** I take screenshots of books to read next and sometimes when I'm on a pairing and get off of it I end up with leftover screenshots that I'm like ‚Äúuh I should read sometime‚Äù. But besides that nope. I don't like bookmarking books I haven't read. I save bookmarking for important books, haha.

** I've got a database of stories I've read over a number of years (mostly HP, but nowhere near all) that I started once I started reading too many stories only to recognize that I'd read them before. I started it with the idea of keeping track of stories I had no desire to either finish or re-read. I don't have a lot of problems with re-reading stories I like.

It currently has about 4000 entries, about 1/4 of which I haven't read yet, but put in because they looked intriguing.

** no. I feel like I've read everything there is that I would like to read. unless I get a new obsession with lots of new fics to read, I only read fics that are being updated, completely new, or sometime decide to reread something. occasionally I find a new fic, by requests or accident, and I read it right away. whole if it's completed.

this was much easier when I was satisfied with a simple Drarry. :)
