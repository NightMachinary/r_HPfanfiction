Everyone here has read at least one slightly overly romantic smut fic where classic cliches like "my heart skipped a beat" are used all too often. How about a fic that starts like that, but just as the main character (Harry or someone else?) meets their love interest, the horcrux suppressed magic breaks free and stops his heart? Woudnt that be interesting... Just an idea. Btw, I am currently listening to Snarky Puppy's Lingus. What a great piece!


** Oh,you are evil. But a good idea for a prompt if a bit dark
