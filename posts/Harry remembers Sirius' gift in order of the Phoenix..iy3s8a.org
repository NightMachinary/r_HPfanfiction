I always wondered how the story would go if Harry remembered the package Sirius gave him.

I feel like it could start something like this--

“Sirius is being tortured NOW!” shouted Harry. “We haven't got time to waste ---”

“But if this is a trick of V-Voldemort's --- Harry, we've got to check, we've got to ---”

“How?” Harry demanded, but then suddenly, “Sirius' package! The one he gave me before we left after Christmas break. He said I should use it to reach him if Snape was giving me a hard time.” He said the words tumbling out of his mouth as he started off towards Gryffindor tower...


** One of many nice things about “A Dramatic Reading by White_Squirrel” linkao3(14041326) is the scene in the end of the chapter 5.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

*** What's even better is that Sirius got Molly to make the call because she can yell the loudest.

** Well, it could have also gone the same exact way as the book. As in, maybe poor Sirius gave up on the idea of Harry calling, so he set it on his bedside table and couldn't hear it when he was tending to Buckbeak. The only difference with the book is that Harry has all this extra guilt now.

It would have been nice to have them speak to each other, though. That would have changed the entire last half of the book if Harry had someone to vent to about Snape and Umbridge. I'd like to see that story.

** Sirius lives.

Voldemort continues to operate in the shadows longer, but the war probably follows much the same time table, as he'll be able to topple the Ministry as soon as Dumbledore's gone. Unless he hesitates because he still doesn't know the prophecy.

Lucius isn't disgraced. Malfoy redemption might be less likely.

Sirius will feel very vindicated by the revelation that Snape is a traitor. Then shocked when he turns out not to be (if Sirius lives that long).

I can see Sirius not living through the war- he probably joins the Horcrux hunt, and dies at the Battle of Hogwarts, maybe fighting alongside Remus. In fact if I was writing it I'd maybe have him die taking a curse for Remus, which means Tonks doesn't die searching for him during the battle, so Teddy gets to have his parents.
