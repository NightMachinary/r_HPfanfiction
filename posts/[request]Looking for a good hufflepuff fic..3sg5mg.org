I really want a better characterization of Hufflepuff, because they are basically the house of everyone with a chip on their shoulder. They strike me as the house of getting shit done and protecting their own, but I have never seen someone write that very well.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.

** Sort of meets your request in that its a fresh take on Hufflepuffs - and one of my favorite things posted on our blog - is [[http://hpedit.tumblr.com/post/107542892621/in-the-opinion-of-most-a-slytherin-hufflepuff][this ficlet]] about Lucy Weasley being a Slytherin-Hufflepuff hatstall.

** Linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided). Linkffn(Finding Himself) - I really thought this did the best sense of explaining what "She took all the rest" would most likely translate into.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** linkffn(A badgers champion by spitkill) Harry is a slightly OP Hufflepuff who makes friends with Susan, Hannah, Cedric, and Hannah's OC brother. Features dueling and quidditch teams, Hufflepuff loyalty, and nice family!potters. It's not a bad read ~30 chapters and updated every couple weeks or so. Currently in third year I think, but I'm not sure I'm a couple chapters behind.

  The Potters had a plan for when the Dark Lord struck on Halloween. It was risky, but it worked. Lily and James Potter both survived the encounter, and their son was now the marked boy who lived. Eleven years later he sets off to Hogwarts with training to change the world. Little does he realize the Dark Lord he thought was gone, would return sooner rather than later. HannahXHarry

Outside of that, I second Co-miNb's recommendation of BajaB's “Harry the Hufflepuff” series.
