I felt that both these figures deserved prison time, especially Umbridge. In Canon they avoid their fate after OOTP. Are there any good fanfictions which have them arrested?


** I actually never understood why they didn't arrest Umbridge considering that she confessed that she basically tried to /murder/ Harry with dementors.

*** I know! Harry was very justified in book 6 being angry at the ministry.

** It's astonishing that both Fudge and Umbridge are allowed to get away with their crimes so easily in Book 6. At the very least, Fudge should be tried for treason - he had recieved prior information about a seditious rebel returning to try and conquer the country, and does nothing for nearly an entire year, allowing Voldemort to build up strenght virtually unopposed.

And Umbridge casts the damn Cruciatus curse with multiple witnesses and is still working for the Ministry even after that. It's ridiculous.

*** Attempted to cast, but yes. The Malfoys are also a sore point.

*** Well it's overall in all the books. Abuse of power, unfair punishment and bullying, lack of protection against it are rampant in all of the novels. It's to wonder how such a society could have survived like this.

That no professors said anything during 2nd or 4th year is an example and apparently students weren't used to obtain help from professor nor encouraged or else someone would have said something about the blood quill.

Adding to that the corruption, bribing (I don't remember if it was officially written but I think we could infer this was common by what was actually written) lack of resistance from the people against injustice or terrorism (Ministry and Death Eaters), miscarriage of justice; Sirius is an example but I wouldn't be surprised if he wasn't the only one. Be it accused for something he didn't do or free despite obvious evidences (Malfoy). Again I don't remember if it was actually stated but I wouldn't be surprised either if muggleborn were having difficulties finding good jobs.

The world JKR wrote is plenty magical for some things but for others it's appalling how it seemed to work. But again most were (hopefully) plot devices.

** I understand arresting Umbridge but why Fudge? He was incompetent and stupid but that's not a reason to send him to Azkaban.

*** Bribery of course. It was heavily implied in Order of the Phoenix.

*** You mean other than abusing his power to run a smear campaign against a teenager (who is a war hero and the child of two more war heroes)? There is the bribery OP mentioned, his course of action left the country entirely unprepared and can easily be considered treasonous. And the whole "let's throw Hagrid into Azkaban as a PR stunt" thing. And his actions regarding Sirius Black also come to mind, although Dumbledore shares much blame there.

Not a crime.

I have to agree here (even though it never was proven in the series).

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Not a crime just stupidity. You don't go to jail for being stupid, unfortunately. And far from being treasonous, I don't understand how you took this leap.

#+begin_quote
  And the whole "let's throw Hagrid into Azkaban as a PR stunt" thing.
#+end_quote

That's sad but it's something that often happens in the real world too, without repercussion. When you don't find a culprit, just threw suspect #1 in jail. It's not the minister that's going to jail then.

#+end_quote

Again, at this point he is a known criminal.

But on the other side you could blame him for killing (soul sucking) Crouch Jr. without even a trial or at least sending him to jail.
