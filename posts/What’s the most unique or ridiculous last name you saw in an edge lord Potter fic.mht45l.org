**** Well...it's an acquired taste. I've gotten sick of robst's stories at this point with how little tension, and character development there is. In some of his stories he does downright impossible things according to Magicals, but it lacks any oomph to it.

I remember reading Birth Of Forest(Hashirama reincarnates into Naruto, highly recommend it), and there's this scene at the end of the Chunin exams where Naruto senses Hiruzen's passing, someone he cared greatly about in both lives. The amount of awe, and wonder that comes about from those witnessing why he deserved his title as God Of Shinobi is still one of the greatest things i've read that fall under that category.

While Harry doesn't do anything quite as impressive compared to the above mentioned story, when he does do very impressive things, it lacks any real weight. It makes the stories far less enjoyable for me.

*** I actually really like how the author did names in that one. It explains where albus percival wulfric 🅱️rian dumbledore came from and has a real "old name" vibe.

Granted, I kinda wish the author hadn't gone with a name that starts with a Salva* prefix, when that's christian and latin rooted, something that clashed with the culture merlin was from, but w/e.

** Not a last name, but "Hadrian" will always be the most cringeworthy "real" name for Harry. Any time I see that name in a fic, it's an automatic pass.

*** I always like it if it's meant as a poncy alias, or something Harry would be embarrassed by. It's seriously what he prefers, then well... we all know what kind of Lord-something-something fic it's going to be.

*** Really? I don't mind that. When he has like 20 different names with a bajillion Galleons, and the keys to Avalon, that's when I drop it. A simple name change like that though is fine for me. Some people just don't like such ordinary names, and Hadrian is a good enough replacement without just straight up changing his name. It's like Voldemort, Tom ain't scary, but Voldemort /shivers/.

**** I mean, I personally disagree wrt simple names, but that's a different issue. No the issue is "Hadrian," which is honestly just the cringiest attempt at a dramatic sounding name I've ever heard of. I could take "Ebony" seriously before I read a story about "Hadrian." It's something I'd expect from a 13 year old.

** Off hand I honestly can't recall anything unique but the ones where he basically renames himself by slightly changing his first name and taking one of his parents names always struck me as ridiculous and usually make me automatically hit the x button. Harry James Potter becomes Harold Jameson Evans, woooooow it's a trick that would make Loki himself weep with envy. Only an unparalleled genius could ever hope to fit that jigsaw puzzle together.
