Any good fanfics where Sirius wasn't framed for the murders and Harry gets to be raised by him?


** I'm reading The name is Potter Black! By PadyandMoony Harry is raised by Remus and Sirius in Hogwarts where Sirius is the history teacher. I'm very much enjoying it. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3673549/1/The-name-is-Potter-Black][the name is Potter Black!]]

** I remember really enjoying the linkao3(Stealing Harryverse) Harry starts out with the Dursleys but meets up with Sirius (and Remus) when he is 8. Continues through 3rd year although that story isn't complete there is a wrap up and notes discussing what the author had planned for the ‚Äúrest‚Äù of the series.

  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.

  James raised his wand, and Sirius had one shocked moment to register the stark black ink on the inside of his best friend's forearm before the world went sickly green and then faded away. Oneshot - Complete.

** Living with Danger - Sirius is in Azkaban, but Remus finds out he is innocent at the time that Harry is ~2. He then frees Sirius and they raise Harry together. Eventually they manage to redeem Sirius aswell. This is a really great story, it actually might be my favorite HP fanfic. Sorry tho, idk how to link stuffüòÖ

** In linkffn(Sirius' Savior by Silverfawkes), Sirius runs off with Harry instead of going after Peter, but he's still blamed for the Potters' deaths. Very good story, and has a sequel (unfinished).
