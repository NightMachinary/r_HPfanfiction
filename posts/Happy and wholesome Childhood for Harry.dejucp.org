Like the title says I'm looking for a fanfiction where Harry has a good childhood. Like being raised by Sirius, Remus, Snape or even someone else.

I don't mind whether it has any real plot advancements, just want to read a cute little Harry growing up and being loved.

Thank you in advance

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  Harry had lived in a lot of different places when he was growing up, but the home he shared with his guardian, Albus Dumbledore, was by far the strangest and most wonderful. He spent most of his time playing in the woods, making friends with snakes that slithered between the trees. They seemed to understand him, which was good, because no people ever visited the house.

  Canon Divergence AU Dumbledore raises Harry from the age of four after the Dursleys are found to be unfit guardians. They live in relative isolation, away from the pressures and dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together in the role of headmaster and student.Nothing has changed except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they mean to each other. And that changes everything.

  Whoever thought that he, Severus Snape would be the perfect man to raise a child, was sick in the head and needed to be locked up and his brain removed and used for potions as punishment for even thinking of such a stupid thing...Lily thinks otherwise.

linkffn(11797196) if you are think Harry getting adopted by Severus Snape sounds interesting.

** Unless you mind LESS or Albus+Tom moral reversion (not Slytherin apologism, but rather a "mirror" AU), the lighthearted kid!Harry raised by alive parents I liked the most was linkffn(The Apothecary Knows Best). Harry is roughly 6 years old thorough the entire fic, so if you want his entire upbringing, this is not for you.

There's also linkffn(Fixing Past Mistakes), a gen fic where SS acts as adoptive father to a kid Harry, following his upbringing from (IIRC) 2 years of age to roughly 13.
