As the title says, I recently remembered a scene from a fic I read maybe about a year ago, but for the life of me I can't place. In the scene Dobby walks around Grimmauld place while wearing cheeky t-shirts with writing on'em like :" Master Harry Potter kicks ass" and others similar, that's it. Sooo... Can anybody help me? I remember quite liking the fic in question and would love to get the chance to read it again, thanks in advance.


** Is a long time defined as months or years in this instance?

** If anyone was curios about the aforementioned fic, I recently found it. It's a Keira Marcos' fic titled :"That old black magic". Ho can find it on her website.
