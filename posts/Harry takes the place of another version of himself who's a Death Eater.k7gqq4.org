:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I really don't remember much, but it was a fic with Dimension Travel where AU Harry was practically Voldemort's right hand and Harry has to pretend that he's that person to survive. He contacted the Order at some point and I think there was an attack on the Hogwarts Express where he took part but actually helped to protect the kids. Yep, my memory is useless, but maybe there is someone who remembers this?


** It's linkffn(A Stranger in an Unholy Land).

I really love that story! :)

(There is a sequel too, though it's abandoned and the final few finished chapters haven't been uploaded to FanFiction.net but they are available from here: [[https://strangerinland.weebly.com/index.html]] But be prepared for the pain of a great story left unfinished... :( This unfinished stranger trilogy is kinda like I'm Still Here, similar settings and characterizations, both sadly left half-baked.)
