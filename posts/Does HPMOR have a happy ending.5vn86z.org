title. Does Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality have a happy/uplifting ending? Just yes or no, please.


** Yes. If you like HPMOR and can read through it, the story delivers a fairly satisfying ending.

** Yes. For what it's worth, there is an ending without epilogue but with fairly clear implications that what will happen therein will be happy for those involved.

** No. It has an ending that suggests an uplifting epilogue, but at the end of the story, it hasn't reached that point. The emotion conveyed is relief, not joy.

** Most people I've heard say the ending is unfulfilling.

*** I guess I can understand it. I don't know if you've read it or not so I'll try to keep it spoiler-free, but on some level there is the implication that most of the stuff that will happen past the story that makes the ending happy isn't because of Harry but because of others, which can make one feel that the protagonist was nothing more than a puppet for others from the beginning to the end. Considering how Harry behaves over the course of the story I can see how people can see it as a let-down.

***** Many people quit at various points. I can see why that would happen, as the story is ... specific, and the author's style can be grating to some.
