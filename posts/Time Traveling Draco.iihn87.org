Could somebody recommend some draco-centric, time traveling fix it fanfics? I've read History Repeats itself, so I'm looking for something similar to that.

  Twenty-one years after the fall of Voldemort, he returns again and this time, he wins. With no hope and a dying world, they made a ritual that would either send the performer into the past or cause the earth to tear itself apart. Draco figured that either way, they could count it as a win.

  All it takes is one look in a mirror and an ill-advised attempt to shatter it, before an embittered Draco Malfoy fresh out of Azkaban is sent back into his body on the day he gets his Hogwarts letter. Suddenly, Draco has an unwanted second chance, with a Sorting Hat that doesn't know what to do with him, a certain Muggleborn who won't leave his study table alone, and green eyes he just can't get out of his head. And then there's his new wand, whose choice of him could just mark him as every bit as dark a wizard as his name means he should be.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

** The 'Draco does it all again' series is my favourite for time travelling Draco fic. It's a series, with years 1-3 of Hogwarts complete and now into year 4.

  Draco gets sent back in time by the centaurs to before he started at Hogwarts to "fix everything". How he's going to achieve that, he's not sure. First step: befriend Potter.
