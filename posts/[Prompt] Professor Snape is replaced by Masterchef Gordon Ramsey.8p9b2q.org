Requirements:

- As is my custom, I am not picky about length

- Ramsey being nice to smaller students

- Assorted older Muggleborns are visibly terrified of Ramsey

Bonus:

- Ramsey criticizing every single method of Snape's as ineffective

- Ramsey exploding at Malfoy for trying to sabotage another student's potion

- Ramsey confronting Snape over his methods


** Pretty sure that already exists can't remember the name though.

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

**** Jesus Christ. I read the first chapter and it was pretty good. I clicked on the Chapter List to see how much more there'd be (on mobile, so I don't read the bot message much): 65 chapters!!

I like the idea, and the writing is good, but 65 chapters and nearly 200k words is a bit too much for me to read when the premise entirely seems to just be “Harry Potter + Gordon Ramsay.”

***** I just finished reading it. It's a bit of a slog to get through all the character introductions, but I thought the character development was great. There's a better balance of the competition plotline vs the regular HP war plotline later in the story. Also, Gordon Ramsay doesn't play nearly as much of a role in the story as you might expect for a story based on this premise.

  Snape's away on a 'special mission' from the headmaster. When the seventh year Gryffindors take their first potions lesson with his substitute, word of a Potions Master with a pedigree for insults far worse than Snape's passes through the school. Who is this Master of the Cauldron? Gordon Ramsay, Devil of Hell's Cauldron.
