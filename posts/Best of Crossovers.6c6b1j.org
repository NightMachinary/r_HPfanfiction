** linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger): When Harry is King's Cross Station after being hit with the Killing Curse by Voldemort, he is called to Middle Earth by the Witch-King of Angmar a thousand years before the events seen in The Lord of the Rings. At the time of this comment, has the most favorites and follows of *any* LotR crossover. WiP.

linkffn(Cursebreaking Hamunaptra by Zenzao): A fusion of Harry Potter with The Mummy (1999 remake). Features Bill Weasley as the main character. Beautifully written with great worldbuilding hidden throughout, and outstanding magic. WiP with very infrequent updates.

  She walked into his office with a map and a plea for help, out of options to turn to and desperately short on knowledge. How could he say no? A Bill Weasley versus the Mummy challenge fic in progress. AU - canon divergence and fusion, some humor. Rating may change with future updates.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon) is an excellent Firefly crossover. Harry Potter wakes up after sleeping for hundreds of years to find that humans have left Earth and magic has apparently disappeared. He eventually joins up with the crew of Serenity to figure out what happened.

I really enjoyed this fic, and it has plenty of nonjon's trademark humor that fits right in with the characters from Firefly. Harry and River especially have some great interactions. It's not a perfect fic and has some pacing issues, but still definitely worth the read.

Some of the Firefly character voices are really spot-on in that fic. Like, you can actually hear them speak the lines in your head, "Yup, that's something that Jayne could've said"

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

Can you sell me on The Stars Alone without spoiling it? I've read Broken Chains and liked it well enough, but the new story just sounds way too over the top and leaving pretty much the Harry Potter universe behind. Is it basically just a SG1 fic (I liked SG1... not sure about reading a whole fanfic about it though)?

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

Also has the best outlandishly evil Snape I've ever seen as well as senile as fuck Dumbledore. Voldemort's fate is also A+.

Child Of The Storm is my favorite crossover, personally.

It's an HP/Avengers crossover, and X-Men stuff makes an appearance later, not sure if they're actually part of the Avengers and I'm not aware or if it's a triple cross. It's finished, but the sequel is still going. The sequel, linkffn(Ghosts Of The Past, by Nimbus Llewelyn) is also good. As fair warning, it's /monstrously/ long.

I will admit that I rarely see it mentioned in these crossover posts, though I'm not honestly sure why. Nobody ever says that it's bad, but I've also not gotten good comments either? 0 idea.

** One of the best Harry Potter crossovers is linkffn(3473224), The Denarian Renegade. Shezza did a great job with this; Dresden Files/Harry Potter crossover.

Another good one, though more of a comedy, is linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5030443/chapters/11562568]]). It's the only good Harry Potter crossover with a manga I've come across.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night. [Harry Potter characters in an AU with magic replaced by the elemental powers of Avatar: The Last Airbender / Legend of Korra. Full summary inside.]

**** Well, I'm not sure about that one since I've not read it as of yet, but “Harry Potter: Geth”, which is one of the author's other stories, has Harry being fairly powerful and game-changing to the point where it would by itself become boring, but also has him be the butt of many a situation and he occasionally grumbles that they can take the power he has because he doesn't want it and it is kind of hilarious.

That said, I have no idea how well that translates into enjoyability of other works of theirs, as “Harry Potter: Geth” is tagged as “humor” and this one isn't.

**** It is powerwanky (even moreso in the sequels, which crossover with Marvel, Smallville, Supernatural, Sekerei), and moderately bashy to Dumbledore.

YMMV. Harry Potter: Geth is better.

***** Yeah, I read that summary of the first few chapters a few comments down and it sounded horrifyingly bad. Gonna have to stick with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10681251/1/Lightning-Dragon-s-Roar][Lightning Dragon's Roar]] for my stupidly powerful Harry needs.

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.

*** Buffy crossover with... Xander? Why?! I like the dude as much as the next guy, but he's probably the most vanilla of all the characters from Buffy. Is it interesting?

Edit: Whoa, I just noticed how Xander is basically the same archetype character (kinda average, funny, ...) as Ron, except better in every regard.

***** I actually tried to read this fic because I really like Buffy... It's so terrible! Just a few chaptes in Xander becomes an expert in wandless magic, is the king of the goblins because he defeated their leader or something and teaches everyone how to fly without a broom.

What even is the point of any of this? I have read crack!fics that were less of a joke. Dumbledore researching the perfect lemon drop as a secret weapon against a diabetic Voldemort ist more reasonable than anything that happens in the first few chapters of this story.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
