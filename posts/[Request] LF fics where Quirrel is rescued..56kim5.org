I'm re-reading The Sorcerer's Stone, and my sympathy for Professor Quirrell was renewed when it was heavily implied that he was a very unwilling puppet to Voldemort.

During the Trio's misguided belief that Snape was pressuring Quirrell into giving up the keys to the protections, they gave him encouraging smiles, stopped others from bullying/mocking him over his stutter, etc. and I wondered if, had anyone simply reached out to him, would he have still gone through with everything or would he have been brave enough to ask for help?

Can you imagine being possessed/manipulated by a feared wizard nobody believed was still alive? People would think you're crazy - or worse - and that's assuming Voldemort wouldn't stop or kill Quirrell before he could ask for help or expose him.

Just wanted to ask if anyone knows of a story where he either redeems himself, or is rescued from Head!Voldemort.


** I think Dumbledore said that Quirrell was seduced into welcoming Voldemort into him, not that he was unwilling.

** The Innocent series - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064][Innocent]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10093402][Initiate]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10858061][Identity]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11732213][Impose]].

Sadly after the interesting, but deeply flawed first part we got second and third part which rehashed canon plot to the point of pure idiocy considering how many things change (Quirrel's survival being a good example).

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
