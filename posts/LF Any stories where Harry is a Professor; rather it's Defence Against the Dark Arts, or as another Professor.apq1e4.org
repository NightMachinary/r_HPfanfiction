Any stories where Harry is a Professor? The most common one is him being the Defence Against the Dark Arts, and i wouldn't mind those; but if there are any other stories where he teaches another class, let me know!

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione.

No Weasley Bashing.

Would rather it be completed; if it could.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash.

Other than that go nuts.


** linkffn(11160991) 0800-rent-a-hero has Harry as divination professor

linkffn(12184104) Lone Traveler: Professor of Defense has a dimensional traveling Harry teaching D.A.D.A in Marauders time (is part of a series but can be read by itself)

linkffn(11913447) Amalgum: Lockharts Folley has Harry time traveling into Lockhart and then teaching D.A.D.A (is Harry/hermione and has Ron bashing though)

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** I've been really enjoying this one - Harry is an Auror at first, then becomes the DADA professor. But I'll be totally upfront, it's not completed and hasn't been updated in a little while - but what's available is good, and I'm quite sure it's not abandoned, so I am patiently hanging on!

It's got entirely almost no views and followers, and I think it deserves many more!

All was well, was being the keyword. After dropping off his two sons at Kings Cross to go to Hogwarts, Harry thought the most stressful part of his year was coming to a close, but an unexpected meeting reveals a new darkness. Can Harry keep the darkness at bay? Or will it consume everyone he loves?
