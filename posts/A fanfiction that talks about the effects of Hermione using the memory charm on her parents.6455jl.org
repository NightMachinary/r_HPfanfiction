I always thought it was sort of horrifying that she did that. I'd like to read something that focuses on its repercussions, where maybe she's unable to restore their memories, or something goes wrong while she restores them and their minds get torn apart, or they do get them back and are scared shitless that their daughter would do such a thing and estrange themselves from her, or the ministry finds out and crack down on her using it etc. Thanks! :)


** I'm pretty sure the main plot point of Broken sort of involved Hermione's parents and the memory charm, but it's been a while since I've read it.

  He felt something close to pity for the woman in front of him. And while that disturbed Draco to no end, what really disgusted him most of all was the harrowing fact that someone or something had broken Hermione Granger's spirit beyond recognition.

**** This looks intriguing! I have seen this motif as a plot point in a lot of newer fics focusing on Hermione. In some, her parents never get their memories back and remain in Australia. Naturally, I cannot remember specific fics at the moment.
