** Groingotts (Women's), The Golden Snitch (Men's), Engorgio (Either, but I feel like it would make a really good gay club name along the line of Bulge), Salazar's (High class gentleman's club, mainly targeted towards Purebloods)

** I don't think Azkabuns works...dementors are kind of boner-killers and wouldn't work in their advertising.

How about, the Dark Arse (you aren't going to be studying Defense against this), Unic-horn...the Copper Veela (cop-a-feel-a) or Veela Up?
