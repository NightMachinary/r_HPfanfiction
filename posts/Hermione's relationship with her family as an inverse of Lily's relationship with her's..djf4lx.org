It's an oft-worn trope to compare Hermione Granger with Lily Evans (not without merit I acknowledge: both Muggleborn, both highly intelligent and able to pick up using magic with ease, both with a tendancy to be stubborn when they believe they're right), but what if Hermione had shared a key similarity with Lily's sister, Petunia? Specifically, an irrational jealousy of a sister. For the sake of argument, let us suppose that this hypothetical sister is 100% Muggle, with just as much intellectual potential as Hermione, but much prettier, and has a much easier time of making friends. Maybe this sister is their parent's favourite (though they'd never admit it openly), as the metaphorical cherry on top. Maybe Hermione has lived her life in said sister's shadow, constantly being out-shone in everything she does (which could be a way to explain her seemingly distancing herself from her family as the years went on).

Alternatively, maybe her parents aren't quite as accepting of magic as fanon tends to imply (nowhere near the level as the Dursleys, but perhaps they feel an instinctual level of unease when exposed to something that fundamentally contradicts with their worldview). I feel like it wouldn't be too much of a stretch of imagination to suppose that the parents Granger are scientifically-minded people (good grades in the hard sciences look to be a requirement to even begin to learn dentistry in the UK), and it probably wouldn't be too hard to imagine that they would've initially tried to find a rational explanation for any and all accidental magic that Hermione did while growing up. Perhaps one such incident of accidental magic had some kind of unintended consequence that left Hermione's parents wary of magic, and a general lack of communication between Hermione and her parents after she began at Hogwarts only intensified that wariness.


** From what little is shown of the Granger parents in canon, their unease with the magical world isn't due to the magic, but the people who live there, and how they treat muggles. I think they would be accepting of Hermione as a witch, but wary of other witches and wizards, since their first exposure to them didn't leave good impressions, and no one tried to correct or explain anything. Including Hermione, once she learned about the two sides of the last war, and the prejudice against anyone who didn't qualify as being a "proper wizard".

At Gringott's. Assaulted by an overly pushy Arthur Weasley who treats them like zoo animals. And Hermione never does introduce anyone.

#+begin_quote
  "So you don't think I'm a match for Lucius Malfoy?" said Mr Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione's parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, *waiting for Hermione to introduce them.*

  "But you're Muggles!" said Mr Weasley delightedly. "We must have a drink! What's that you've got there? Oh, you're changing Muggle money. Molly, look!" He pointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in Mr Granger's hand.
#+end_quote

At Flourish and Blott's. Watching Arthur and Lucius (two grown men) get into a fistfight and almost stampede the store.

#+begin_quote
  Mrs Weasley was shrieking, "No, Arthur, no!"; the crowd stampeded backwards, knocking more shelves over; "Gentlemen, please---please!' cried the assistant and then, louder than all, ‚ÄòBreak it up, there, gents, break it up---"

  The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid's waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up the street, *the Grangers shaking with fright* and Mrs Weasley beside herself with fury. "A fine example to set to your children... brawling in public... what Gilderoy Lockhart must've thought..."
#+end_quote

Then Mr. Weasley is pushy again, and no one explains to them what the fight was about.

#+begin_quote
  They said goodbye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side. Mr Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs Weasley's face.
#+end_quote

It'd say that the rocky relationship between Hermione and her family is not the Grangers' fault. They're parents, they made an attempt for Hermione, but it's hard to involve themselves in Hermione's life when Hermione is the one who goes to boarding school and skips out on them on the holidays post GoF.

*** Hermione was obviously covering up the shit that went on in her school, and when she finally had to come clean at the end of HBP, she mostly likely took the easy way out and magically manipulated them.

There should be huge repercussions once she lifted her memory charms.

**** Hermione chose a cat over an owl, so if she did use the school owls to deliver letters to her parents, the Grangers would only be able to write a reply if the owl stayed in their house, instead of flying off straight away as messenger owls do.

So it was on Hermione to keep up communications with her parents. It's not like they could call her on the phone to ask how she was doing at school.

***** Oh I know it was on her that she didn't have communication. Even if she used Hedwig or a school owl, I'm guessing she wouldn't write much, as most of her attention would be taken up by the crazy events that were happening. I'd think it would be hard to write about mundane things after being cornered by a troll and petrified by a basilisk. Also, a lack of communication for a months without explanation would have damaged their relationship even more. I really doubt she told them about the insanity of Hogwarts.

**** You've got a point. I also wonder like....idk, I don't remember if the books say anything but did they know what Hermione was up to? I mean if I were a parent, and my child was nearly getting killed every school year, I'd probably try my best to keep her home. But you know they're Muggles so....it'd probably be easy to hide things. If Hermione felt like she was always lying to her parents about her safety, maybe that's why she would always be at the Weasleys, a family who understood everything that was going on.

I'm sure she still cared though bc she wiped their memories before leaving then came back. Just a weird relationship. And if my child cut our ski trip short, I'd be sad because I don't see that child often.
