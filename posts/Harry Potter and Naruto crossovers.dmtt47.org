Preferably set in the Naruto universe with Harry somehow making his way into it, if there's any gender bending I'm all for it as well. I'm not into Harry being shipped with any of the students from any of the teams, mostly because I like having an adult Harry, so an adult Harry is a bonus for me. Also, I'm all for non-hetero ships, I'm also really cool with hetero ships. With short fics I don't care how long the fic is so long as it isn't abandoned and complete, (I prefer complete fics) but I can deal with incomplete ones if they're long.
