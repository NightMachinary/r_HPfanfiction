Mostly asking authors that have stories that have been running a long time, or are high in word count.

Do you ever feel bad or guilty that your style or content quality improves later on in the story? I get reviews from earlier on that address problems I'm aware of and tried to fix later on, but I always feel terrible that the content at the start isn't as well written as later on in the story. The start should be the foundations of whatever you're creating- not something flawed and wobbly.

I don't have time to redo all of the content (word count is far too high and the time commitment to do so is insane). How do you all cope with knowing something you've made is flawed at the start?


** I know what you mean, and there's a lot of things I'd like to go back and rewrite. I have to tell myself that my readers would rather I finish the story than spend my time messing around with the start. I can always go back and do edits later.

** You know whats great about publishing a fanfiction on a platform on the internet?

You can edit content at any given time. - Find a spelling error? Fix it. - Dislike the phrasing? Fix it!

I do not feel bad about the fact that the early chapters of my fanfiction(s) cannot compare to later chapters.\\
Why? Because I do not release the fanfiction until I am satisfied with the quality.

*** I agree with you. I am mainly shitty at time management, so I wouldn't start publishing until I'm done to a satisfying conclusion (if not the end). I don't have time to write every day, so doing quality work takes months even. And as I don't like to read "in progress" stories that update every 2 years, I try to not do the same.

Does it take absolutely forever to finish a story this way? Yes.

But is it also consistent? Yes.

Also, if I discover a plothole later on, I can correct the story without confusing the reader.

** I do think my first few chapters of /Parselmouth/ could use a retooling. That said, I'm not /ashamed/ of them.

*** It feels very forced how Harry and Hermione drag Ron along. It felt like you wanted to include him at all costs, even if that meant a few odd scenes.

And I get it, the first year is boring and 11-year-old children are no joy to write, but that aspect was not very well done.

** This is the two sock problem, but with fanfiction!

When Knitters finish their first sock, the bottom half is much better than the first half, so they're conflicted; should I start a new sock (and have one nice sock and one ugly sock), or tear apart the old one and start over?

I'll tell ya, there's a reason that most socks are made by machines now!

** Yes. I'm frankly astonished anyone made it through my first fanfic at all, the first half was quite terrible.

But I hardly have time to write onward, much less go back and edit. I would love to have a stronger beginning, but at the moment I'm more concerned with finishing. I tried pausing to edit, and it basically resulted in a six-month nothing happening wherein all I managed to rewrite was the prologue. Not worth it. Better to just keep moving forward.

Fanfic is nice because people are much more forgiving of less than incredible writing, willing to give stories more of a chance than regular books.

** Abso-fucking-lutely.

I'm happy with the direction my story has taken, but looking back at those first ten chapters? God, it's the absolute worst.

But, at the same time, if I could go back in time and tell myself that "powerwank fics aren't as popular as you think they are," I wouldn't take the opportunity. Looking back at my story and noting the difference in quality between the beginning and now is a fantastic way for me to measure how much I've improved since then.

I think it's best to remind yourself that it's /fanfiction./ Yeah, some people can get really, /really/ serious about it, but they're far and few between. Have fun with your writing! There's no shame in keeping up something old and silly, and there's also no shame in changing it. It's all up to you.

Without exception. I have gotten much better at writing and therefore my early works are/were substandard, even if not a lot of time (6 months) had passed. About half a year ago, I reread my first story "Drool" and the writing sucked. I had no issues with the plot itself, but there were way too many dialouge tags and spelling errors. Fixed that before publishing the sequel/chapter 2.

#+end_quote

After that, I took a look at my longer stories. Again the issues were not with the plot. I am satisfied with it and there were no obvious holes, at least none that I or any reviewer could find (a few of the "plot holes" reviewers mentioned came from their fanon/headcanon assumptions and I dismissed them as irrelevant).

But the first few chapters had issues with too much exposition and quite a lot of that was unnecessary to boot. Consequently, I have rewritten chapters 1 and 2 of /No Longer Alone/ and am in the process of reworking the first chapter of /Dawn of Darkness/. There are no big changes to what happens since I don't see the need for retconning anything (so far). Most of it is just a presentation, something which is important in the first few chapters since they are often used by people to gauge the story as a whole. Especially /Dawn of Darkness/ has issues there since the first two chapters were taken from a one-shot and then turned into a bigger story. Consequently, the first chapter which truly reflects the whole thing is Chapter 3, a disparity I am trying to take care of.

** I think the first couple of chapters of my most followed story are trash, so yeah. I just accept that I wasn't as good as I am now and move on. In a way, I kind of separate past me and present me. So whenever someone criticizes those older parts, I kind of mentally tell past me what a fuck up she is.

Except not so harshly.

** Not really. Stories usually get better with age, trust me, you couldn't compare my old stories with the ones I write now. They always get better. If I finish the story, I will go back and fix what needs to be done.

** Dear lord, yes. So much so. My co-written series is at 439k without the side stories and if I go back and read the first few chapters, they feel very surface level in comparison to everything else. It only hits stride around Chapter 8 (though is comparatively better around 4) out of a total of 47 and I do cringe a lot if I read before those eight. Some stuff I'm really pleased with, but in terms of my own writing in that period, it was obvious I hadn't written fic in several years at that point. I just hope people like it enough to push through.
