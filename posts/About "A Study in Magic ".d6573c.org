When I first read the sinopsis I was very excited to start reading it because I believed that it would be Harry being like a mini Sherlock, to my great disappointment it was not, I just read to halfway year one but as far as I could see Harry was pretty much average so I really want to know what is it about

is just like Harry and Sherlock's stories running parallel but not really influencing each other too much?

does Harry change and becomes more like Sherlock?

how do the 2 universes interact with each other?


** If you're talking about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic by Books of Change]], Harry would eventually become a mini-Sherlock somewhere during the 4th year, or maybe third? I don't really remember. To be honest, I prefer this than mini-Sherlock from the start, it shows the growth of Harry's deduction skill from his canon self rather than making him a completely new person.

The universes does interact with each other, but not much. Lestrade was a squib from the Lestrange family and his children will go to Hogwarts, an assassin that Moriarty hires is actually a wizard that eventually tried to kill Sherlock and Dumbledore.This is the weak point of the story, even with Sherlock's superhuman deduction skill the story still follows almost all of canon stations. It does show why it happened like that, for exampleLucius Malfoy obliviated Sherlock after giving the diary to Ginny, so they have no idea who is the Heir of Slytherin.

It become more interesting from the 4th year with some kind of Magical TV invention, and Sherlock's plot to overthrow the Ministry during 5th year is brilliant. Personally, I love the interaction between the character from Sherlock and Harry Potter. Sherlock-Snape banter is incredible, and the fact that even Dumbledore fears Sherlock's ability is always interesting.

It also have an abundance of OCs. They're a little Mary Sue-ish, but I don't feel them as an Author-insert, so it doesn't bother me that much.

** Can you specify, please? I can think of at least two HP/Sherlock (Holmes) crossovers of that name, with one being BBC's Sherlock (with a female John) and the other a rather nice pastiche of the original Doyle stories set in the modern day.

** I made it partway into Year 2, and I dropped it because it felt like they were running the stations of canon with all these extra bits with Sherlock and (fem)John that didn't change the story. 40k thousand words in (at a guess) and nothing significantly changed.
