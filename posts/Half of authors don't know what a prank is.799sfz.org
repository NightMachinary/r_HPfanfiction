Whenever Harry does literally anything slightly ironic or negative to the Ministry, Dumbledore, whoever, Sirius and the twins go apoplectic about what a brilliant prank it was. Harry reading Harry Potter books? Prank. Harry writing to the Daily Prophet to tell his story? Prank.

These aren't pranks, like at all. Theres no reason for Sirius to laugh for 3 literal entire minutes because Harry got better grades than Malfloy or something. It's like a shoehorned in way to show "Hey, Sirius likes pranks right? He's funny?" and it's just, argh. You can have them laugh or whatever, but don't call it a prank.


** Good prank - use a potion to cause people to have a lot of gas.

Bad prank - write a sequel called HP and the Cursed Child.

I remember one story I read ages ago where the author actually addressed this. Harry was quite the Garry Sue, but a plot point was that students came together and protested the pranks and other hostile aspects of Hogwarts (like Snape). The twins ended up getting expelled I think.

** Considering one of my stories is built on humor and Weasleys, I have tried very hard to ensure that all pranks are actually pranks. That is, mildly amusing antics like seeding the Dursley's garden with gnomes or turning Dumbledore's hair pink instead of trying to kill someone or just get better grades than them.

That said, I'm pretty sure even my characters realized that busting people out of Azkaban went beyond just a prank.

Let them flit around while people are eating, swimming through the air and being pretty and beautiful and getting in people's faces. If creating air-breathing levitating fish is too much work, fill the hall with colourful parrots instead.

...Or! Enchant a bunch of musical instruments to follow people around and provide backing music! One instrument per target, but if they meet another target, the two instruments play the same melody! Full on orchestra if you get a couple of dozen people in the same room!

** Pranks:

- sticking charm on everyone's socks and shoes. delayed transfiguration to shorten robes and turn everyone's socks and shoes into hosiery and high heels.

- spike drinks with potion that gives a nice singing voice. also makes them have to sing whatever they want to say.

- knickerknacker - enchanted box. touching it teleports your underwear inside. can also be applied to a pair of gloves that steals underwear by touching someone. happosai would be proud.

- swap professor trelawny's magic ball for one that only shows porn

- carmen sandiago hat and wig combo. enchanted with Gemino Curse and switching spell. taking it off spawns a copy back on your head and switches the original with the copy so you're wearing it again.

- billowbust - charm that causes someones robes to inflate at the front so it looks like they have a comically large chest.

- pillows that self-transfigure into a [[https://i.imgur.com/EMF6NkZ.jpg][puffskein]] at midnight.

- lewdglass - shows the last person someone got off too. stash mirrors around the halls. someone will figure it out eventually. alternatively whomever is standing in front of the mirror their reflection starts putting on a strip show.

- enchant the great hall so that farts are opaque. serve gassy foods.

- gigantic expansion charm on the entrance to a common room so the doorway is now a quarter mile long tunnel.

- transfigure every seat in history of magic into exceedingly comfortable reclining chairs. too easy to fall asleep and not wake up, lots of delays to the next class.

- double the number of butterflies in a room once a day as long as nobody is in the room. cast a charm to lure butterflies into the room. it's going to get ridiculous eventually.

- transfigure a gallon of water into a spider. have it sneak into someones room and end the spell once it's in position.

- serve everyone caffeinated drinks for dinner

- enchanted plates that occasionally make food twitch like its alive

- self-serve food. i.e. donut holes, creme puffs, or jelly beans enchanted to serve themselves to people by flying into their mouths.

- spell that conjures a cat between your feet every 5 minutes. cat will then proceed to exit the room (or best effort) as fast as possible and run through any open doorways it sees.

- tea that makes you find both sexes attractive for 24 hours. call it earl-gay.

*** Some more 'Totally Harmless' pranks

Extreme confidence: Give a friend in need a sip and see their confidence skyrocket. They of course don't become idiots because they are confident. They just don't see how it possibly can't go their way.

Outstanding recollection: For those people that just can't seem to remember anything they are supposed to. Hit them with this and they won't forget anything happening in the next hour for a total of 13 days. After that, it is a very foggy memory, but still there.

Philosopher: Have a need to say interesting information, that isn't really important. Like how it is strange how wizards haven't been to the moon, when there are dozens of stories about how wizards has been to the moon.

Lucky plague: Make the house elves mix a little Felix Felicis into the food. See the chaos spread around the hall with everyone going about fulfilling their dreams. Like asking out your crush, only for your crush to have left to win a contest, so you have to follow.

***** Yeah, I don't think you know enough about how girls/young women interact in school to generalize about it.

For that matter, men - or more often, boys - get harassed and bullied by other boys all the time. My brother was bullied and ambushed throughout all four years of high school. Years later, he encountered one of his former bullies (who was working as a butcher in a grocery store, which is nicely symbolic), and the guy didn't remember his own behavior being cruel at all. To him, it was no big deal, just what boys do. Bullies don't usually think of themselves as such. Even bullies who run in packs.
