In the books and and in a lot of fics you get the feeling that even "muggle loving" wizards don't view muggles as anything more than particularly clever animals or children. They act like muggles need protecting, but aren't humans. Wiping memories isn't seen as inhumane. The Weasleys acted like their [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Molly_Weasley%27s_second_cousin][squib cousin]] becoming an accountant was something taboo. Even muggleborns will often completely cut themselves off from the muggle world and try to fully integrate into wizarding culture.

I really enjoyed linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12901407/chapters/29473305][Ottery St Catchpole]] by Erisah_Mae) which gave a really good muggle outsider's pov of the wizarding world.

Essentially, I'm just looking for anything with humanized muggles or magical characters that maintain at least part of their life in the muggle world. Bonus points for characters pointing out "pro muggle" people who are still very obviously prejudiced against the nonmagical. Or pointing out how the word muggle itself sounds like and is often treated as a slur.


** 1. Cutting muggleborns from the Muggle world intentionally is a pure fanon. Yes, it is difficult to keep up with the muggle world, when you are seven years mostly isolated from it, but there is nothing in the canon suggesting it is routinely done. My headcanon was always that Hermione subscribed not only to The Daily Prophet, but also to The Guardian (because it must be The Guardian).
2. linkffn(Ten More Minutes by Litfreak89) and its prequel linkffn(What We Had by Litfreak89) are obviously very pro-Muggle (it ships Harry × the Muggle waitress from the start of HBP).
3. linkao3(17777138) ships Hermione × Dean Thomas, and it is very much balancing in between the Muggle and wizarding world.
4. All those “Harry gives up on magic” stories are per definition very pro-Muggle (e.g., linkffn(5866364) ... WARNING! There is Ginny-a-gobblin-warrior inside!).
5. There is plenty of “Muggle wanders into magical world” (e.g., linkffn(2053712) or linkffn(3743602)), which are obviously pro-Muggle.
6. All those “The Queen steps in and saves the situation” (e.g., linkffn(11500936) or a crackfic linkffn(11961978)).
7. I forgot another category. “Harry grew up in a muggle institution” (the best one is linkffn(The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader), which despite the title sounding like a one of Marquis de Sade novels is a very sweet and lovely thing, unfortunately unfinished).

*** I can sort of see muggleborns cutting off from the muggle world simply because they have to keep a MAJOR part of their life secret no matter how much they trust people. Or go to Azkaban for breaking the statute of secrecy. Can you imagine not being able to tell your friends where you go to school, what you do mine months out of the year, why there are no phones/computers, why you have quills/pet owl if they see your stuff and have to lie about it?

***** I mean part of why I mentioned muggleborns was more of the tone of how muggles are talked about in the books. It's not so much them cutting themselves off from their families, it's just that with how isolationist the magical world is, even just getting a job in the wizarding world or marrying into a wizarding family essentially cuts them off from knowing anyone in the muggle world outside of relatives. And there's also a level of callousness towards muggles that's just...uncomfortable. For example, we never see a muggleborn getting upset over memory wipes. I mean maybe there are a lot complaining but we don't get to see it in the books. Hermione essentially changes who her parents are by altering the last 17 years of their lives when she could have talked to them as adults and gotten their permission to hide them somewhere. The lack of magic is treated as a disability and the magical attitude is sort of the ablest equivalent. Muggles don't need to give consent or understand what's happening them, the magicals know best, and when someone with magic cares about a muggle it's their responsibility to protect them regardless of what the muggle wants. The way squibs get treated alone is enough to show the magical world's view on the non-magical.

****** I think you are still mixing what's really canon and what are you deductions.

1. Concerning work in the magical world, I think there some compromises could be made. Northumbrian worked on that extensively, so for example linkao3(1623053;3068372) and MIT stories show that with some cover story (work for the Home Office covered under the Official Secrets Act) should make normal live among Muggles believable. Of course, when ones get closer (see Strangers at Drakeshaugh again), troubles happen.

2. Memory wipes are problematic, true. I don't think anybody would make much noise about one-time random event short memory wipes (like all those sunbathers in Wales who saw The Common Welsh Green Dragon in [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ilfracombe_Incident]]). It becomes awfully problematic when wipes are repeated and/or longer memory ones (e.g., what happens in Strangers at Drakeshaugh again). I don't think the canon directly addresses the latter, but yes it is very problematic (there is nothing written how well the Roberts family survived their repeated and frequent memory charms).

3. The case of memory charm on Hermione's parents is rather complicated. First of all, it seems to me that she used actually some non-standard (reversible?) memory charm, because she was carefully preparing for something, which was later mentioned (in the Luchino Caffe) that she “best in casting” of spell all of them (somehow) knew how to cast. Second the relationship between Hermione and her parents is shockingly little researched while in my opinion quite problematic in all relationships in books. I am writing about it a bit in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/hermiona_nonsearch_parents.html]] (very very unfinished, WIP). I think strangeness of that relationship is a way more interesting and important than just memory charming them. Third, I think it is truly one of the cases where JKR dropped her ball on justice, because Fate (or somebody) should punish Hermione for doing something wrong (a way worse, than stupid but understandable conjuring of birds on Ron), what was basically equivalent of Imperius Curse.

******* You're right that there's not much in canon. It's more than anything the offhand comments you see every once and a while and the general tone those comments set. Like the Ron "I think Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him." or the Mr. Finnigan being in for a "nasty shock."

And ohhhhh yeah I wish we knew more about Hermione's relationship with her parents. She loves them enough to be protective of them and not want to worry them but that's not much. What bothers me more is Harry and Ron's reaction to Hermione essentially rewriting her parents. Or the lack. These three are supposed to be our heroes, but living in the wizarding world seems to have desensitized them to socially acceptable things in the magical world like mind wipes. Or love potions. Fanon often has characters like Hermione or Harry calling it out as rape but in canon it's just a potion. Molly's tale of using it in Hogwarts is treated as sweet instead of horrifying. Romilda Vane's potion is annoying but not expulsion worthy or reputation ending.

It's just interesting to consider how being emerged at such a young age and isolated into the wizarding world might influence the morals of the characters. Because it's worrying when a character constantly concerned with the rights of house elves and other magical creatures doesn't bat an eye at the societal norms such as memory alterations.

***** I'm not completely sure about that because it's canon that you have to keep magic a secret from any non direct family members or members of your household. The isolationism would be a direct result of the statute of secrecy surely which is canon.

  Lists had never failed Hermione before. So when her feelings for Ron get out of hand, it's only natural for her to write a list to clear her mind. She would come up with a list of boys most objectively compatible with her, detail the reasons why, and choose someone from the list to serve as a distraction. Of course, she never dreamed that her notes would all magically get sent out. (Inspired by To All The Boys I've Loved Before)

** If the muggle part is more important to you than the sympathetic part, here's my story about a muggle who's a vainglorious prat. My readers assure me that he's oddly endearing, though.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
