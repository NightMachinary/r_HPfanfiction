Looking for almost-any kind of fic that deals with Slytherin house and/or students in a post-Voldemort world.

The books made it clear that no student participated in the defense of the castle, and that next to Pansy's little (and very public) outburst probably did nothing to win them any simpathy.

"Anything but Slytherin" linkffn(4269983) is a good reference.

I'd prefer it not be next gen though. Can't relate to a whole new cast.

And as usual, if not completed, at least updated with some regularity, pretty please?

Thanks!

** Rebuilding by colubrina is a nice immediately post-war fic. It's not solely Slytherin centric, but it's Dramione and the usual cast there (Pansy, Theo, Blaise, etc) get a lot of attention.

**** Would Draco/Hermione be better, or is it the pairing itself provoking this lovely response? If you are put off by something to the point that you 'throw up in your mouth a little' then you should probably have mentioned it initially.

** I don't know how to do the fancy linking but “Harry Potter and the Marauders of the Mind” deals partially with Slytherins post war.

It's not finished and only gets updated every couple of years.

** I think the Anguis Series might interest you. It deals a lot with the distrust and dislike of Slytherins, though it focuses on an original group of characters and is mostly set pre-Deathly Hallows-they also do fight in the war in this one, but they aren't involved in the Battle of Hogwarts largely.

The first one is Latet Anguis in Herba, which is a series of oneshots introducing the characters and then Shade to Shade, Falls to Shadow and Beyond this Place (all of which are in novel format).

Beyond this Place is the one post-war and does deal with the distrust towards them.

There is also Stygian Trilogy, but again it's mostly next-gen/original characters with Draco and the original cast appearing often. It does deal with the distrust and dislike, but it's not as mentioned as Anguis I would say.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

** linkffn(Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake) is a solid post-war Slytherin fic. Unfortunately, it has an entirely OC cast - not even next-gen, just made up characters a little older than next-gen

  Slytherin House isn't what it used to be. There are barely enough children to fill a classroom, let alone a House Table, and the Quidditch captain is a muggle-born fourth year. For a new generation starting at Hogwarts as the war drifts into memory, there's far more to learn about the four Houses than they could ever have imagined (prequel to Snake Bites).

Cursed Child itself shows how Rose Weasley considers Scorpious Malfoy as a liability.\\
