With The Last Jedi's impending release, I haven't been able to get the thought of a starship crewed (or partly crewed) by some number of Harry Potter characters out of my head. I know there are several okay crossovers out there, but I'd like something that takes itself at least a little seriously. I don't mind fan service in small amounts and humor is part of almost all good fanfiction (I mean really, how serious can an HP/SW crossover be?), but I do like cohesive stories that at least attempt to close the plot holes.

Some thoughts for discussion:

- Plot requiring protagonist(s) to save the galaxy? Or something more episodic that's more about the lives of the character(s) than it is about imminent destruction?
- Most interesting era? Using the Fidelius Charm to hide Force-sensitive individuals after the Jedi Purge springs to mind.
- Iconic characters from both universes required? Or can original characters carry at least part of the story?

Anyone have any thoughts on what they'd like to read? I'm pondering writing something myself since there's not a whole lot of people writing HP/SW crossovers, but I'm not sure if I know enough Star Wars lore to do it well. +I got mad and stopped reading EU stuff when they murdered [[/s][LotF spoiler]].+

** The hardest part is keeping balance (pun intended). Like, if you just add Harry to the story and have his abilities be super OP and everything rolls over to his jaw-dropping magical prowess, it's hard to keep the story interesting. Sadly, that seems like where a lot of SW crossovers end up, and while some of them manage to keep it entertaining for a few chapters, eventually it just turns into the same old shit we've all read a million times.

I'm currently working on an HP/SW crossover myself, so I feel like I have some insight, and let me tell you, it's a ton of work to balance everything. I did it for the nanowrimo challenge, so I'm sitting on slightly over 50,000 words in the story (a bit over 8 chapters), but I've come across the opposite problem. I've normalized things slightly too much, using simplistic reasoning as to why Harry can't just save the entire universe with a few OP spells, and coupled with my own mediocre to average writing style where everything comes off as slightly too boring, it's a real struggle.

As for your specific points- 1) Harry doesn't need to be the one to save the galaxy personally. Worldbuilding and character examination is more interesting imo, but there always has to be an ultimate goal. I don't like the idea of Harry just being the unknown guy lurking out there who sighs and goes "fine, I'll save you, just give me a minute" and then does everything with minimal difficulty.

2) Clone Wars is my favorite era. It seems to be the most popular one as well. I think a lot of that is to do with just how good the Clone Wars tv show turned out to be, and also because that's the era we probably just have the most information on. There was also a lot of good video games during this era. I don't really find late Galactic Empire that interesting, and going earlier into Old Republic results in not very original stories I've found (though I've only seen a few).

3) Honestly, I find HP being in the SW galaxy waaaaaaaay more interesting than the reverse. Adding in more HP characters other than HP tends to be an unneeded distraction. Like, you don't need portraits of his past wives to lord after him, or Luna as some army general. It's just baggage. Give Harry a clean slate.

Lastly, I know there's plenty of people that just want good SW crossovers to read. There's too few of them. I can count them on one hand with fingers still left over. So pretty much any story at this point is worthy of consideration. You just have to be very careful about how you portray Harry, and be careful of falling into the same traps that have ruined other SW crossovers. Maybe think twice if you decide to make him a bounty hunter/jedi/sith, and be careful about how you want to portray magic in a universe that has the Force.

*** I agree on putting Potter characters in the Star Wars universe being way more interesting than the reverse, but I don't necessarily think multiple transfers is a bad thing. The problem isn't having too many Potter characters, it's having too many characters in general. If you have the entire Potter cast plus every Jedi Master ever, how are all of them going to get screen time to make each interesting and something readers look forward to?

The aspect I would want to see/write that I don't feel like has been done properly before is synergy. I feel like wizards and Jedi/Sith should be complementary, each side bringing something that the other either can't do at all, or at least can't do effectively.

For example, Force users aren't bothered by just about any number of blasters, so I would have a Shield Charm not protect against energy weapons. On the flip side, nothing the Jedi can do can match apparition or transfiguration. The universe I imagine has both light and dark wizards as much as light and dark Force users and characters with similar goals would gravitate together. Palpatine has Voldemort while Yoda has Dumbledore sort of thing.

The reason I bring it up in response to your post is that balance is a lot easier to achieve (or pretend) if your characters have different strengths. Then their strength becomes situational rather than just a flat hierarchy of Yoda = Palpatine > Obi-Wan = Harry > Ron = Jar Jar or something.

Of course, in my potential universe a wizard can't be Force sensitive and vice versa. Technically. Like anything else, rules are made to be bent (but not broken). >:)

** A "X is reborn into a new universe" trope could do a lot to circumvent the worst excesses of crossover fics. It both allows the character to acclimate to the new world and gives a good excuse for Harry (or whoever) not to have access to his usual powers.

/The Black Prince/ linkffn(11098283) is a good example of that, but with /HP/Game of Thrones/.

This almost makes me want to start a story where Harry is the younger brother of Kylo Ren or maybe Rey's twin or something, but my schedule is horribly crammed and even if it wasn't, I have other fics on the backburner that I really, really need to get to ...

*** I like this approach, though they don't necessarily have to be reborn into the universe. I could see a timeline something like:

- Harry defeats Voldemort canon style
- Some stuff happens
- Harry and whoever else gets flung into the SW universe
- Some years later, after HP characters get used to the universe, the story starts.

Doing it like that retains a lot more of the Harry Potter character and the feeling of being a stranger, but also doesn't bog the story down explaining all the details to Harry and others.

My plot bunny with the Fidelius protecting Jedi from the purge actually starts with Harry and friends being couriers/smugglers. They started legit shipping, but realized magic's ability to hide things could make them a lot more credits for little more risk. The Harry and friends that finally meet the Jedi not only have a bit of universe knowledge, but also are a bit scruffier from their adventures.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.

No it wasn't, that's what I'm saying. The author brought in a bunch of bullshit about "sorcery" which was basically magic used like the Force, and it was automatically evil and created a ton of manufactured drama that ruined the story.

Unless I'm mixing it up with a completely different story, but the fourth chapter of The Lightsaber is called Sorcery so i think it's the same fic. I can't really read the whole thing right now.

Secondly, but this is one of the most important aspects to me when it comes to crossovers - the power balance. I don't like reading about Harry (or anyone, really) curbstomping his problems through the story (unless it's a crackfic, or comedy). But I will hate it even more, if a character, who was described as powerful and smart and experienced, suddenly got nerfed and acted like a fool for the sake of drama.

Make Harry immortal (or at least ageless and very hard to kill!) and make him show up at all the key moments (maybe even without influencing much, hell let him only give the main characters important nudges...with exceptions, seeing someone apparate with a lightsaber or turn invisible etc.? Yeah, tactical advantage baby!) but also give him something to do (I've read one where he's looking for Sirius and had jumped into the veil after liquidating all his assets and preparing for all eventualities)...nothing is worse than a powerful character with nothing to do

** I agree with that others have stated - the best fics tend to be where Harry is inserted into the SW universe.

Now that isn't to say you ~couldn't~ do it the other way around, but you would have to do it without the tech. In every x-over with SW chars/powers into the HP universe, you inevitably have the massive difference in tech levels arise, where the protagonist has to whip up some tie fighters or some such.

Because, really, you need the tech to make the lightsaber. And who doesn't love lightsabers?

As an idea, consider a bungle in the jungle style adventure, Harry going curse breaking with Bill, somewhere in Africa (because hey, that place is huge and grossly underused in fanfics), where they/he discovers an ancient sith/jedi temple. All ruins, no tech to speak of. Maybe a damaged holocron stuck on repeat, beyond repair (first repair spell on it shorts it out and it disentergrates or some such). Harry is incredibly engrossed/attracted to the idea of a monastic / mystic order.

Go from there. No light sabers (unless you sneak them with magic instead of tech), no insane tech. I'd read it.

** There are a couple ways how a good crossover could work. There's "I still haven't found what I am looking for" in which MoD Harry takes care of Ashoka after she leaves the Order. IMO it would work better as a Harry/Ashoka instead of the muti pairing but that is just me. linkffn(11157943)

Harry saving Naboo would be an interesting premise, especially if he decides to train Anakin in magic instead of leaving him at the temple. Anakin grows up with his mother (I doubt it would be that difficult to liberate her, especially with magic) and close to Padme. Stuff is going well until the Clone Wars start and Harry, Anakin and Padme get sucked into the mess.

Harry reincarnated as Vader would make a good crackfic with him helping the Rebels or outright defecting.

There was a story in which Ashoka was thrown across dimensions and ended up raising Harry but I disliked that one because it was a Weasley and Lupin wankfest. But the premise of Ashoka being thrown into the HP universe has a lot of potential. Imagine Harry introducing his girlfriend Ashoka and everyone is freaking out because they think she is some sort of Demon.

** How it would look? linkffn(The Stag and the Dragon) like this. Fun, not taking itself too seriously, ideally not burrowing too deep into EU lore on the /Star Wars/ side (original trilogy is best).

** Personal I would love to see more of a Side Story, that either doesn't often or doesn't at all intersect with the main story line. Like Harry ends up in the SW Universe with a Friend or two builds a small crew of like a Battle Droid and some cool aliens and then become Smugglers/Bounty hunters. Do we see Light sabers and Jedi? Fuck yeah! Is that the main plot? No, it's more about grabbing that next paycheck and carving a bigger piece of the world for themselves.

Use of different Droids, OC Droids. No reason for The MC to always have 3PO, R2 and or BB-8 or even worse HK47. Their are trillions of Droids, it doesn't have to be the 4 of them. Same goes for Jedi. Use the EU it's not Canon but it still exist

** I just started reading a new fic that is an HP/SW crossover and it seems to have potential. The author has been updating weekly so it's worth a try.

** I'll dump some I enjoyed:

linkffn(6353083);\\
plums's version of the above, linkffn(9068231), and his co-writer's story, linkffn(11157943);\\
most of Darth Marrs's stuff, including linkffn(11576387) and linkffn(10912355).

Preferred era would probably be the Clone Wars. A lot a variation in characters, plot lines to get involved in, and a generally less-totalitarian government, among other reasons.
