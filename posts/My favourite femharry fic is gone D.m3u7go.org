I loved the anima series, starting with invisus by Kdblaylock93 is completely gone! Does anyone know one that is similar? It was fem harry, soul Mark's, mentor snape, and went in a different direction than the original books


** Hell yes, I've got a whole google doc on this. Here we go:

linkao3(The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles) - fem!Harry, not soulmates but there's courting, top quality writing and goes in a different direction to the books. Feminist themes. Starts 4th year summer and diverges from canon. 9/10 bc it's unfinished

linkao3(ink and parchment rose_by_another_name) fem!Harry and mentor Snape, writing improves as it goes on. 7/10 because although the author updates regularly it's kind of tropey.

linkao3(appearance by slytherin_drops) fem!Harry, soulbond but not soul mark, Voldemort wins AU so canon divergence, nice Snape.

linkao3(the ouroboros mark by wolf_of_lilacs), fem!Harry and fem!Voldemort, soulmarks

linkao3(byzantium) this one is a complete AU (fairytale elements) but it's fem!Harry and they're basically soulmates (the Fae have fated them to be together) so I thought I'd throw it in.

It's suddenly hit me that the Anima series might not be Tomarry like I'm assuming, so these might not be what you're looking for. Anima was Tomarry, wasn't it? I can't remember now.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.[ON TEMPORARY HIATUS FOR PERSONAL REASONS, NOT ABANDONED â™¡]

  Eliza Potter was abandoned in an orphanage by the Dursely's and so 11 years later she refuses to be the Light Golden girl everyone wants. Eliza Potter is more a force of nature than a girl and she refuses to let anything stand in her way to greatness, and that includes meddling old headmasters[starts in first year]

  Knocking at his boyfriend's underwater window isn't the only time Harry has quoted Shakespeare back and forth with his boyfriend. It was just the first.In which Tom likes to show off his eidetic memory by quoting literature, and Harry is forced to be his (completely unwilling!) verbal dance partner. That they're in a library, of all places...? Well, he'll just hope Tom remembered to put up silencing charms.

  And beside her, tenderly holding her hand, both their wrists bare...Her soulmate, taller, older, many things more than she, black hair falling past her shoulders, face impossible to see.Harriet reaches out to touch, but it is only a mirror.-In a world where soulmates are unlikely to meet yet soulmarks are kept hidden, Harriet Potter and Lord Voldemort must clumsily wend their way.

  Rey, the chieftain of a desert tribe, has her life turned upside-down when Emperor Hux conquers her people and demands that she marry him. But as she finds herself pulled deeper into palace intrigues, she begins to realize that the real threat may not be her husband and his First Knight, Kylo Ren, at all - but something entirely more sinister.

  Appetence--- defined as an attraction, a natural affinity, or an instinctive desire. A cosmic sort of bond that clouds the mind until all thought is consumed by that singular point of infatuation. When Voldemort divines what Harri Potter truly means to him all those years ago in the graveyard, a festering sort of obsession begins. His horcrux. A part of his split soul, crafted from his marrow, magic, and might--- his very own damning appetence. He knows what has been kept from him, what rightfully belongs at his side, and he wants her back.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.
