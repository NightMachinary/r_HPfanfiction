I have a long lonely winter ahead and delving in Snape centric fanfic (preferably with Hermione romance)+Hot coco helps cure my seasonal depression. I've just finished with pet project and i absolutely loved it.


** linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles) is the definitive Snape fic imo.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

******* Skip the last chapter and it's brilliant. It's a redo of canon, sort of. An alternate point of view. Canon-compliant, exactly canon-compliant, but such a different perspective on, well, everything Snape was doing.

Even the last chapter isn't the worst, but maybe wait until the spring. I mean, we know he died in canon, so knowing that will happen does colour the fic. I'll admit I loved it anyway. I also didn't try to read it during the worst part of SAD, so I feel you're right to be cautious.

If anyone ever does a good fanfic of this fanfic where the last chapter gets made into an AU where he lives and picks up from there, I will be all over that.

** Not super similar to Pet Project, but a really unique AU that you might enjoy linkffn(Forbidden by Savageland).

A little more Hermione-centric in terms of POV, but it's SS/HG so there's a lot of Snape as well linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258).

This fic can only be described as different from anything else I've read, but it's nonetheless good linkffn(The Young Adventurer's Club by artemisgirl)

linkao3(Of Myth and Magic by Wonkington) has some great psychological thriller elements to it.

Loten has written a lot of great SS/HG stories -- try linkffn(Chasing the Sun by Loten) or linkffn(Post Tenebras, Lux by Loten).

Hope you like some of these!

#+begin_quote
  This is the first chapter of my huge sprawling SS/LE fanfic, Sympathetic Magic, which I wrote between 2008 and 2013 (when you see it, you'll understand why it took so long!) and posted on DeviantArt. I've been meaning to post it on AO3 for ages, but I can only work in like half-hour intervals when my baby is asleep, and I'm also trying to write original fiction in those precious half-hours, so this could take a while...\\
  The story follows Severus and Lily through their last two years at Hogwarts, but it's also focused on the Marauders, Narcissa and Lucius, Regulus Black, Poppy Pomfrey, and lots of OCs. No characters are really hated, except, I guess, for Bellatrix. It's AU, but I think quite respectful towards J.K Rowling's plots and characters. It gets extremely caught up in the emotional world of the characters, and can spend whole chapters in symbolic landscapes representing their souls (I'm not sure if that's really selling it, but it's the truth!) Anyway, I can't really describe it. It was my soul for almost five years, and I haven't re-read it in way too long, but I still hear from people asking me to make the story more wiely-accessible, so I'm going to post it here. Hope you enjoy it!
