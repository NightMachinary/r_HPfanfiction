After that recent boggart thread, I'm curious - who's got a fic where the form a boggart takes for Mad-Eye is revealed?


** I can vaguely recall one where his Boggart is him becoming what Dawlish and Runcorn are; a mindless goon helping an evil regime .

** CONSTANT VIGILANCE!

Sorry felt like saying it. I think it would be a boggart!Moody who had forgotten that his wand was in his back pocket and it blasted its ass off.

*** Ah, the humiliation-fear boggart. Like Hermione's McGonagall telling her that she failed every class.

** Moody's boggart might be Voldemort. Not the person exactly - I don't think he fears Voldemort. It's what he represents - the victory of the dark.

Or maybe it's snails. He could have a big irrational fear we don't know his life
