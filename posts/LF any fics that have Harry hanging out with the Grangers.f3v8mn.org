I've always loved it when Harry gets to see a "normal" muggle family through the Grangers like the Weaslets were his view into a wizarding family. I'd prefer if he was older and the war was over and they're hanging out learning about each other, like the first chapter of picnic panic, but I'll take what I can get


** Robst has a lot of Harry hanging out with the Grangers moments, usually at some private island or whatever.

But then again, it's Robst.
