** I can't see the murder of an ant being sufficient to split one's soul, unless the murderer is a fellow ant. So now we're writing about Tom Riddle the ant, which is a potentially interesting AU.

*** He was good at mind magic and not that reasonable, right? I can totally see him using occlumens/Potions/Whatever to convince himself that he is an ant until the Horcrux is made and then revert it. No chance of him regretting the death of an ant, so no way of undoing it. Though to be fair it would really depend heavily on the magical system/interpretation about how Horcruxes work.

*** He wasn't often surprised. Tom thought himself a strong user of magic, sometime even daring to think he was better than Dumbledore. The ritual was laid out perfectly, not a single rune out of place and everything was ready.

In the centre of the ritual circle laid an ant, a random ant from outside the orphanage that Tom trapped within a vial.

As he started to unleash his magic, Tom thought himself a god as the green light hurried to the ant and struck it dead.

He of course expected to black out after using powerful magic. After all, creating a horcrux was no easy feat. Splitting a soul to store a part of it was magic beyond anyone's dream.

So when Lord Voldemort changed the main component from a human soul to an ant's, of course there would be some unknown effects.

He didn't realise that the ant he chosen happened to be the Queen of the nearby colony. So when he woke up surrounded by ants giving him food, he only had himself to blame.
