Selene Malfoy is Draco's older (I think) sister who went to the french magic school then transfers to Hogwarts. I think she ends up paired with Fred but I might be wrong. I don't remember much else unfortunately, read it years ago

EDIT: Found the story, its called Unconditionally by volliglosgelost
