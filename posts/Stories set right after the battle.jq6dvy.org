Focusing on healing, the funerals, being together, etc. Maybe even showing that Hermione went to return her parents memory or whatever.

Maybe we follow them slowly for a year or something. Would like more of a slice of life type of stuff, but action/hype or whatever is perfectly fine as well.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length. Can be old or new.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

No Weasley Bashing please.

Can be Canon or AU.

  The Battle of Hogwarts is over. On the third of May, 1998, Harry wakes to a changed world, to a future he did not think he would have. This is a story about those first days after the battle. Days of mourning and funerals, love and loss. Grave Days.

  Whilst Voldemort's prisoner, Draco is made a vampire and forced to take Harry as his first meal. With Draco managing to resist the temptation to drain him, just barely, in a moment of blind rage at what he has been forced to become, he aids Harry in the destruction of Voldemort. But even with that threat vanquished, once back at Hogwarts, Draco finds himself disturbingly addicted to Harry's blood. And amongst all this, a dark shadow looms ominously on the outline of the forest, watching them closely. A vampire!Draco story and also an ‘Eighth year' story.

** linkffn(An Inch To The Left by GinaMcKnight)

It's a Hermione/Percy fic that focuses on the aftermath of the war which includes things like rebuilding and reforming Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic, rounding up the last of the Death Eaters and Dark Lord sympathizers, Fred (he lives) recovering from his injuries, funerals, and Hermione getting her parents back.

It's has a generous amount of Muggle wanking (I'm not sure if it's the correct term) and features a redeemed!Draco. It's also LGBT friendly and has Harry dealing with survivor's guilt, depression, and alcoholism. The story is structured by having scenes be from the end of the war, so it starts out like: 1 day after the war, two days after the war, one week after the war, 4 weeks after the war, etc. It's not complete and updates have been sporadic lately.

It's a sequel to the author's other fanfic, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7670511/1/The-Unlikely-Pair][The Unlikely Pair]]. This one starts out in Hermione's Second Year where she befriends Percy because they're so similar and come to understand one another. It does have some mild Weasley bashing, having all the younger Weasleys mocking and bullying Percy ruthlessly on occasion, while Hermione gets treated badly by Harry and Ron and under appreciate her. It follows canon events but focuses on Percy and Hermione's relationship until it deviates during the events that happened in OOTP.

  Percy Weasley survived the war mostly unscathed. Now, he's repairing his relationship with his family while also trying to repair the whole of Magical Britain. Plus, he's got a girlfriend now, right? Everything is changing, and even the familiar is a little bit unknown. Sequel to The Unlikely Pair. Percy/Hermione. AU from Chamber of Secrets.
