Looking for basing on Dumbledore, Molly, and or Ron. Wouldn't mind Hermione having either.

I don't want any Harry/Hermione pairings.

Thanks

Update: title meant to be fics not fits.

** /My Slytherin Harry/ and /Hail Odysseus/, linkffn(10645463;6160345)

/Aspirations/, linkffn(4545504), has extreme Hermione bashing on top of severe Dumbledore/Molly/Ron bashing. But the writing is awful, and I shudder to think I once liked this fic.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

**** I tried to read Aspirations a while ago and couldn't get past the first chapter. They say each other name is almost every sentence.

Hail Odysseus was a good one.

I'll take a look into Slytherin Harry.
