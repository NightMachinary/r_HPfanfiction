#+TITLE: Trying to remember the name of this one fic where the Dursleys move to Australia in fourth year, letting Harry come home to an empty house. In a bit of a panic, Harry goes to the Leaky Cauldron and starts working there in exchange for room and board. Notably did NOT bash Dumbledore or the Weasleys.

:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Featured Diagon Alley worldbuilding, situational irony, and Harry covering his scar with an ordinary headband. The story was abandoned after the sixth or seventh book came out, because the author got fed up with some of the canon characters. Anyone remember this fic?

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.

**** Oh man, I love this one! I downloaded it in EPUB format. :D Nice slice of life, fluffy Harry-ing that's not edgy independence. Just him living. Independent harry done right.

** Why didn't Harry just pay for room and board? He's rich. Also, he never once mentions this to Ron, who would immediately offer to let Harry come live with him for the summer?

*** Multiple varied reasons that are mentioned in the fic itself, but can be partially summarized as "Harry is a traumatized, self-sacrificing 14 year old boy, and is not thinking clearly."

I like the fic for its worldbuilding and lack of character bashing, but it's not a pinnacle of literature. It's mainly just a fun read for me.
