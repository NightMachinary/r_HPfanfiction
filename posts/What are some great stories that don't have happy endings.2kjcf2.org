I fancy a story that doesn't have the hero triumphant. The ending could be sad or ambiguous. Any length is fine, and I would like completed stories. I tend to avoid slash, though you can certainly post recs for the entire sub. I like H/Hr but any quality story is appreciated.


** Well, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero][Unsung Hero]] is a giant kick in the balls. H/Hr

*** No matter how you feel about the ending of that story, you'll never feel the same scale of feels as those who were there while it was being written. It was nuts.

*** I thought Elizium ended in a pretty positive note especially since [[/spoiler][Harry was alive and well and about to mind-control Umbridge into bringing down the Ministry]].

**** [[/spoiler][The dystopian future revealed in the 7th chapter is what makes this story fitting for recommendation. No matter what he manages to accomplish after breaking free, he will already be late because the time gap is too big to be able to mitigate anything. And to be fair, I don't think he'll succeed in toppling the Ministry either.]]

*** /The Substitute/ is brutal, gets hella existentialist (I think...) - though the ending seemed terribly anti-climatic compared to what I thought might happen.

**** Yeah, the ending seemed a bit forced. But still, the story fits here nicely.

** "Eden" is LMHG, but extremely well done and bittersweet. I love it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6336173/1/][Pain]] The ending is kind of sad, but mostly just not a triumph. Its a very sad fic, just fair warning. I ended up crying reading it.
