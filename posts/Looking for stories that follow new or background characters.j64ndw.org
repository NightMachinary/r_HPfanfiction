Not typically a fan of FF but I just read Reborn in a Magical World and I liked how it was told from the perspective of someone outside the story with knowledge of the story. Does anyone have recommendations like this? I'd like something that more or less follows the same plot of the original story aside from the meddling of this new person.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  In 1990, prominent Muggleborn research wizard Cromwell Albertson embarked on an ambitious project to interview six Muggle-born students -- before and after their life-changing discovery of their wizarding talent. He continued these interviews over the next nine years, a period of time which spanned both the Chamber of Secrets attacks in 1992 and Voldemort's second rise and subsequent persecution of Muggleborns in 1997. The Pensieve Projection that resulted won a Superbius award for artistic excellence in 2002 and has been required viewing in the Hogwarts Muggle Studies course since 2008.

**** Sorry. Second time I've done this, which is I've linked two fics and then reread the OP and realised they don't quite suit. So I delete the comment but not quickly enough not to trigger the bot.

These are two really good fics if you want to try them anyhow.
