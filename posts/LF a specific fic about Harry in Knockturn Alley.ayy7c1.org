I was just reading and earlier post, and I thought of this fic but I can't at all recall which one it is

I remember bits of this fic including: Harry rebuilding an orphanage in Knockturn Alley, working for a candy shop, suing/being sued by the Dursleys, and learning business skills at Flourish and Blotts

Does this sound familiar to anyone?
