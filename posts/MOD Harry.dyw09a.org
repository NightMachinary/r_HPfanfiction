Looking for fics which explore the MOD aspect. But not the ones which use it as a tool for time travel/dimension travel. Also not the ones in which Harry is OP or something like that.

PS: Stick to canon pairings if possible (not necessary but preferred)


** Linkffn(Beyond the curtain) includes a very fresh take on it and it's pretty essential to the plot but I won't spoil what it is. It's also a good ass story on its own.

**** It appears not just look up beyond the curtain Harry Potter and google should do the rest. There's also the shadow of angmar but neither of these are god!harry stories if that's what you're looking for.

** Just so you know, recommendation as a flair should be used if you are the one recommending a fic. Request is for if you want people to recommend fics to you.
