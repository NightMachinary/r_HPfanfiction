Hey guys, just had a thought today and wanted to see if anyone knows any fics that would suit.. Has anyone read anything where the Dursleys have to go to Hogwarts / Grimmauld Place / The Burrow / somewhere in the magical world for whatever reason? Maybe Voldemort's targeting them and Harry convinces them to go into hiding in the Wizarding World? Basically I want Dursleys interacting with magic and varying responses - they hate it, they're amazed, they're scared, whatever.

Dunno why, but this thought just won't leave my head!

Thanks in advance..!


** It's a bit of an old story (and some of the themes go way over the top--Harry's riding a dragon into space, e.g.), but this happens in Jeconais's [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War]]. 225k words, complete.

** There's a fic, which I believe is called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3446796/1/Magical-Relations][Magical Relations]], in which Dudley is also a wizard. It does rehash canon quite a bit, but I think it's worth the read, or at least a look to see the Dursleys reactions. I won't spoil it for you. It hasn't updated since October 2014, but take a look.
