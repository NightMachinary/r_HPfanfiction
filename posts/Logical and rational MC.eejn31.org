A main character that, when things go pear-shaped keeps calm and makes logical decisions on how to fix the situation. MC doesn't have to be a leader or be charismatic, but bonus points for that. The MC also knows how to control his/her emotions, so to an outsider, they would seem borderline sociopath. If they are an sociopath, fine, but i would prefer that they still have empathy.

- No lordship powerwank.

- Preferably not a big focus on romance, but romance is fine too.

- No MC slash/fem-slash. If its just in the background, it's fine.

** This is certainly how I've always viewed myself but I do believe it can very easily have the effect of making a story seem dead and unemotional to the core which really puts me off. Interested to see what gets recommended

** OKay okay okay so, bear with me on this, but linkffn(Son of the Firebird) lives up to your expectations if you can get over the whole sexual dynamic aspect of it, which is not in any way romantic...like...at all.

** Harry in the Art of Self-Fashioning is generally dispassionate and asexual as well. It's an excellent story despite that (or perhaps because of that).

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

** The Harry in [[http://www.hpmor.com][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] certainly thinks of himself as logical and rational. It's questionable whether applying logic to the magical world is the rational thing to do, of course.

** Well harry potter and the methods of rationality has some of that.

[[http://www.hpmor.com/]]

It is the second most reviewed followed and favourited on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]

And it has its own very good audiobook, found at [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=56]]

To make it not a powerwank some of the other charachters have also become more rational so some of them might seem extra sociopathic (draco).
