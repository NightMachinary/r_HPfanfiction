:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's a fic out there that takes place (mostly, I think) during sixth year, and Harry holds a candlelight vigil with the whole school for katie after she gets petrified, and I remember Lilu it, but now I can't find it. Figured I might as well ask the hive mind of reddit to see if that rings any bells (hehe, get it) for anyone

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.
