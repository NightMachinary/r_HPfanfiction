I feel like that's more realistic for what we've seen of Harry. Even with the Imperius, it starts to affect him, but he refuses it and throws it off. Of course, I imagine he'd get immune to Veela allure via repeated exposure(that seems canon too, according to... book 6, I think?), but not at first.

Any stories that show that?


** I wish more people would just adopt the tactic of not even using the word "allure" at all in their Harry/Fleur fic.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

*** Allure is better than paraphrasing the alluring effect Veelas have all the time. It isn't quite as strong as fanon makes it out to be (even though it's fun to write), but if not for his father, Ron would have jumped to death during the World Cup because he was entranced by the Veela dance.

I think you may be misremembering the scene a bit:

#+begin_quote
  The veela had started to dance, and Harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen.

  And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through Harry's dazed mind. He wanted to do something very impressive, right now. Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea... but would it be good enough?

  “Harry, what are you doing?” said Hermione's voice from a long way off.

  The music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing up, and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box. Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard.

  Angry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn't want the veela to go. Harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest. Ron, meanwhile, was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr. Weasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his hands.

  “You'll be wanting that,” he said, “once Ireland have had their say.”

  “Huh?” said Ron, staring open-mouthed at the veela, who had now lined up along one side of the field.

  Hermione made a loud tutting noise. She reached up and pulled Harry back into his seat. “Honestly!” she said.

**** So I have had this prompt dancing around in my head.

What if instead of being entranced by the Veela, Ron was thought they were hot and was an awkward barely teen dealing with Puberty. Thus is somehow becomes plot relavent that he is actually immune to it, just an awkward teen.

** In my own "Drool" Harry is being affected by the Allure, though nowhere near Roger Davis levels. And he embraces the feeling because it is a very pleasant experience. He is also a little starstuck by Fleur, as any 14-year-old boy would be when around an attractive, slightly older women.

** There's really no veela allure that Fleur can turn on and off whenever she likes.

The only thing that's described is that her beauty turns heads wherever she goes, be it at the Great Hall the first time she's introduced, during the Yule Ball (somewhat), during book 6 when Ron just stares without tact (Ron will be Ron), and during her wedding where her beauty and radiance makes it seem like the heavily scarred Bill has an unblemished, handsome face.

That's it. There's no exotic allure or veela force-field that compels boys and men to ogle her and lose all higher brain function.

*** Objection, the world cup. Ron almost jumps to his death and the referee loses track of the game due to the mascots.

While not entirely overlapping with the fanon concept, Veelas having an alluring effect is canon. And since alluring effect is a mouth-full and thrall is a little too harsh, Allure is a perfectly viable term to describe their effect.

**** The veela's enchantment is a magic which is cast by singing and dancing, it's not a kind of magical field that veela have around them either permanently or under their mental control. Mr Weasley is able to protect himself from the effect by plugging his ears, and while Harry notices that the Veela are supernaturally beautiful from the moment they appear, he is not magically entranced until they begin singing and dancing. Similarly, the moment they stop singing and dancing, the enchantment ends.

Separate from the power to enchant men into stupidity, veela are also supernaturally beautiful, which also causes men to say stupid things in their presence, but which is on a completely different scale to the complete loss of willpower when under their singing/dancing enchantment.

Fleur has the supernatural beauty. Whether she also has the ability to enchant men through singing and dancing is unknown.

****** I've witnessed men make ridiculous boasts to beautiful women on more than one occasion. No magic required. Add in the fact that Fleur is /supernaturally/ beautiful and I think that her good looks are entirely sufficient to explain certain men saying stupid things around her.

The enchantment effect and the "she's so beautiful I must impress her" effect are described in completely different ways in the books. The enchantment is like a switch, turned on and off by the music and the dancing. While it is ongoing, every man who can hear the music is enchanted; Harry is affected equally to Ron.

The "she's so beautiful I must impress her" effect is not described as robbing a person of their willpower or sense. Harry feels none of this effect even though he is just as susceptible as everyone else to the musical enchantment. It's not that he is able to resist the "beauty" effect, he just doesn't feel it at all. Meanwhile, Ron demonstrates both behaviours.

**** My comment was about Fleur herself, not full-blooded veela. Fleur turns heads because she's incredibly beautiful, not because of anything else.

[[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] has replied to the assumption of full-blooded veela having an allure - there isn't one. When a multitude of full-blooded veela sing and dance, they cast an area-wide influence spell. When those veela stop dancing, there is no longer a spell in place, and the effect of the spell stops, giving the impression of an "allure".
