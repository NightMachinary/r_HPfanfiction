In every fix where Blaise is present she is characterized the same way is that Canon? Also where does the Astoria's sickness come from?


** HBP, chapter 7

#+begin_quote
  Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold).
#+end_quote

Astoria's sickness comes from Cursed Child.

*** OK but how did that make so well know it is really weird how the Fandom has made the fanon as strong as the Canon in some areas

**** I'm not really sure what you're trying to ask. Those ideas became common in the fandom because they're canon. (Or at least as canon as you're willing to let Cursed Child be.) In fact, those are almost the only canon details we know about Blaise and the Greengrass family, and Blaise and Daphne are very popular characters to use when you need a Slytherin who is not definitely evil, so those details get included a lot.

If you want to talk about fanon ideas becoming too strong, you should be looking at Daphne and Tracey instead.

***** I agree with Daphne specially because at first I though it was an OC but I haven't felt that Tracey has a strong fanon identity

****** Tracey's fanon identity definitely isn't as strong as Daphne's, but that's probably only because she doesn't get used as much. But she's almost always Daphne's only friend (or possibly one of her only two friends, along with Blaise), a halfblood, and an excitable extrovert.

**** Since some character have only a few lines as characterization in canon, writers tend to stick to that and then add more from their imagination from that base. And in the case of Mrs Zabini, it's a fun backstory and pretty easy to build up on :)

** A Black Widow is a female killer who kills for a number of reasons. One of which is financial gains. With her seven husbands dying and leaving her their gold, it's easy to infer that she must've had a hand in their deaths

*** Imagine if she's just incredibly unlucky instead and actually would rather have the husband(s) alive. That'd be such a fun prompt.

**** I remember reading at least one fic where she genuinely loved her first husband, Blaise's father, and after he was murdered she successively seduced, married, and murdered the men responsible for his death.

I also recall reading (but not the name of) a fic where Blaise's mother was just genuinely unlucky with her husbands.
