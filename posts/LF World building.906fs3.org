Most of the fanfics I can find are rehashing of canon but with Super!Harry or Bashing!

I'm looking for something where the main character spends time developing skills and not everyone magically agrees with them. In AU where the magic doesn't solve every issue and the characters aren't Mary Sue or Gary Stu.

Please no Dumbledore, James, Draco, Weasley, Snape bashing. I prefer complex characters.


** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]

There is lots of worldbuilding, although the fic does start a little slow. There are some amazing characterizations with no bashing, and lots of very complex characters that are neither good or bad. Harry's growth in skills is slow and realistic. He never becomes OP Harry who is way better at magic than everyone else.

** What's your opinion on crossovers, since they should include a lot of world building?

*** I enjoy a good crossover. I think they are hard to do properly. Most people favor one set of skills over another and tend to skew one sides power to a ridiculous degree.

I went through a Star Wars/Harry Potter stage for awhile, and about 95% make Harry able to rip information from Jedi and Sith minds alike, while making him faster than speeding bullet and able to block the Deathstar with a wandless protego. Completely ignoring any and all skills that have been learned over decades of training/conditioning and experience.

***** I enjoyed it a lot. I was impressed at the rivalry for Harry's affection between Tony and Sirius.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

It's still in progress, but the basic idea is trope subversion on a huge level. The beginning has a lot of tropes because of this, but then it starts to shine.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
