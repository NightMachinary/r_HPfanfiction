** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/2/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] has both a Harry and a Voldemort that are drastically powered-up compared to canon.

*** You recommended wastelands but did not include the hero trilogy by the same author?

**** It's sad that that trilogy never got finished, just like it's sad there's no sequel to The Matrix.

**** I loved wastelands, but the hero trilogy just wasn't that good. Even the beginnings of wastelands was a little rough, like it was trying too hard to be epic. That was one of the cool things about reading wastelands, you could actually see the author getting better as the story went on. It started off trying too hard and then turned into something that really was amazing.

***** It has been a while since I read either of the two. Maybe it is time for a reread.

** Perhaps the classic story like this is Bobmin's million-plus-word [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunrise/Sunset Over Britain]], a story I could never force myself to finish. It is very angsty and hasn't aged well yet fits the OP's description to a tee. In this story, Harry and Voldemort are so far above normal wizards in the power stakes as to be laughable.

Kwan Li's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]] is another that comes to mind. Though Harry's plussed-up to the gills, Voldemort is, if anything, far more so. The level of desperation among the protagonists is so high that by the end it's hard to find hope of a favorable ending.

Darth Marrs's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][Firebird]] trilogy is another with an amped-up Harry and very buff Voldemort.
