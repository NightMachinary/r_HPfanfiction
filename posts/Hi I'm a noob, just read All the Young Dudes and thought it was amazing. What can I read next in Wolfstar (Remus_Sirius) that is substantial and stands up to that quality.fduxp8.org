I also read and loved Stealing Harry, though I thought the last Year went a bit skewiff.

Those are really the two I have read. I wouldn't mind one from Sirius' perspective, though I fell in love with the Remus characterisation in ATYD. Wow, for a first fic, that is so amazing.

Longer the better, falling for one another during school, raising Harry, any of that sort of jazz.

Thanks :)

*** Thanks, these sound great! Shoebox is on my radar but I can't load LJ sites atm on my computer (lol) so it's waiting for me.

Thanks again :)
