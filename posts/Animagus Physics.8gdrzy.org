So, when Peter Pettigrew cut off his finger, his animagus form missed a toe.

When Voldemort gave him a silver hand, do you think it: 1) Turns into a silver paw 2) Remains a giant silver hand 3) Prevents the transformation

I'm not convinced it's sufficiently part of him to be included in the Animagus Transformation, but it looks like clothes and wands do.


** I haven't ever thought about it before, but since you bring it up, I think it would be a silver paw. It's connected to him so well that he can use it, so I'd assume that magic would allow him to continue to use the hand as a paw in his rat form.

** Probably a silver-colored paw, as opposed to a silver paw. Maybe this would be a special case since Voldemort is super wizard, but other Animagus transformations will have certain telling features appear as part of the animal, rather than actually persisting into the transformation unchanged (e.g. McGonagall's glasses appear as an odd pattern in her cat form).

** Could you imagine it remaining a giant silver hand? He's running around just like, /pat-pat-pat-THUMP pat-pat-pat-THUMP/
