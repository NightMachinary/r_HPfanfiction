Hi. Looking for fics where harry learns to make wands and or other magical foci. I prefer long complete fics. No pairing is OK. No slash. No Ginny unless it's a part of hp/multiple.


** There's Firebird's Son, but the wandmaking part isn't the central plot at all. It's long, complete and hp/multiple though. And controversial.

** linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) - not complete but very much worth reading

linkffn(Griffon Reborn by Yrtria) - also not complete but wand-making is a significant plotline. Also, I think the author could use a few more fans to promote returning to the fic.

linkffn(Ectomancer by RustyRed) - not complete and the way Harry kit-bashes wands is kinda goofy to me, but the story itself is quite immersive and good with imagery.

... y'know, I'm sensing a trend here. Wand-making = incomplete story. What's up with that?

*** I just checked Yrtria's ffn profile, and apparently s/he is still working on Chapter 23, and is probably going to change how s/he is writing it to see if that helps speeds things up.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.

Speaking of abandoned wandmaking fics that are rather good: linkffn(The Wizard From Earth by Mortaspriest)

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.
