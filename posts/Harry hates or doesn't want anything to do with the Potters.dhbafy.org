As the title says fanfics where Harry doesn't want anything to do with the Light and/or the Potter family and rejects them at every turn.

Cliche I know but I like it when they all beg for forgiveness and harry is just very apathetic to it and refuses to accept their forgiveness or submit to their whims.

Can be\\
- Harry was given up by James and Lily - Neglected, wrong bwl - Dark Smart Harry - Fem Harry

Obviously don't have to stick with these tropes but these are the most common ones

The more genuine and regretful they are the better

The fact those are what comes to mind is kinda sad, as most of those are pretty shitty, extremely OOC setups.

An in-character setup would be for Harry to be adopted after abuse by his aunt, and want nothing to do with his former life.

linkffn(12212363) has some elements of this. He has a curiosity about his biological family, but as soon as it threatens his connection with his adopted family he shuts it down quick. So he does want to know about the potters, just not enough to allow it to threaten his priorities.

Although it does have the stupid, troperific, "Harry conscripted as a mini soldier as a kid and starts an army unit on campus". Story would have been much better without that shit.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete! Sequel: Nymphadora Tonks: The Last Auror.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** The Black Queen series by Silently Watches ticks all, if not most of the boxes here, it can be pretty dark though and definitely not suitable for kids; but a great read nonetheless
