*** JK has been really clear on that in the past...I know MoR got a legal warning for selling shirts with their quotes on it and another fic I can't remember the name of with Quidditch shirts for sale that were entirely based on an original team in their story. This seems more severe.

**** JK Rowling is being far too punitive. She created something, and prospered from it more than she could imagine. Why not just be cool about it? Before George Lucas sold Star Wars he was cool with his fans. He never took any fans to court, nor did he go around trying to get fan art obliterated. He just let it be.

JK is actually one of the more lenient authors out there, so long as you're not making money it's fine. she also actively endorses several HP themed charities. When has JK ever tried to get fan art obliterated? Also I don't think she ever took anyone to court, just asked them to stop making money off her work.

***** It's important to remember that this is about legal precedent. If one person starts selling t-shirts, another sells an encyclopedia, a third sells tickets to a stage show, somebody else starts selling their own fan-fiction on amazon, if she doesn't act against them legally it's considered tacit approval, and a judiciary /can/ (doesn't mean they will) interpret it as her waiving her copyright. Then we start having movies about harry potter in vegas.

******* I think you might be right there. I was thinking of trademarks rather than copyright. I'm not sure what Harry Potter falls under in this sense. Is the character name copyrighted? trademarked? What about Hogwarts, quidditch or expelliarmus? She can definitely waive her right to something, whether it's terms or characters I'm not sure, if she doesn't act to protect them.

**** It is an interesting idea from the standpoint of exploring the constitutions of reappropriation and collaborative pieces. In fact, it's been a subject confronted for quite some time. Happenings, pop art, fluxus, exquisite corpse... its a serious question that artists address constantly across every discipline.

But do these secondary creations contribute their own form of legitimacy if they're distributed in the same way as the original? I personally wouldn't agree with that. If the argument is to create a more collaborative manifestation of a novel then repurposing the same format that requires direct reference for fundamental understanding deflates any sort of progression into that realm of controversy. Actually, if a secondary creation or fanfic that is so much so assisted from it's predecessor at such a degree and earns profit for the assisted author then it has already terribly stagnated under the restriction of copy right laws instead of validating itself as it's own entity while simultaneously drawing from existing materials and lending itself to future recreation.

Quite honestly, I really haven't come across fanfics that generate sincere reflection in order to defend their validity. It's fun yeah and a quarter of them really do a god damned good job for what they are. But when it comes down to it, they exist to speculate nuanced preferences. And that can't compete with revolutionary action towards communal ownership while requesting the same treatment as the original within our current model of capitalism.

*** For books its absolutely makes sense to not do copyright on the contents. Unless fanfic authors all turn into psychics overnight, the original author gets the first shot at using the characters and location in a published work and therefore the majority of the profit if its quality work. From there, the fanfic keeps people interested potentially increasing sales of the original works.
