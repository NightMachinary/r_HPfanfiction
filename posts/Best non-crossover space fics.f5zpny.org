I've read Voyage of the Starship Hedwig and DSS Requirement and it's sequel which seem to be the two most often recced here. Are there actually any other half decent ones?


** There is one where Harry and co. Plus voldemort and co. Colonizes the moon. I do believe its slash though, and i can't remember the name of it. But it's worth reading even if you're not a slash reader.

*** Harry/Voldemort is a firm no for me. Just find it ridiculously creepy. Thanks though.

**** Same here, got lured in with a "no smut, no lemons, very minor slash" recomendation, and its a space fic. Gave it a shot. Not the best by a long shot though. Much prefer hp/stargate for space fics :)

***** Those are pretty good, yeah. Sadly, many of them refuse to shift the timelines a little and so little harry, as a kid, is out in the galaxy somewhere. It's weird. I much prefer adult protagonists, children have no business flying dingy spaceships around the galaxy, alone.

** OP asked for non-crossover, but all of the chatter (except the rejected rec for Xerosis) have been crossovers. Here's a non-crossover, although the space bit only comes in at the end.

  COMPLETE. One-Shot. Hermione Granger has to locate Harry Potter or she'll lose her job. She's more than a little curious what he's been up to the last few years. Perhaps, she'd be better off figuring out where he's going rather than where he's been.

** Hmmm, isn't there an HP/Firefly fic that is decent? I recall Harry living long past the days of the magical world being separate. He is on another planet when he runs across the crew of Serenity.
