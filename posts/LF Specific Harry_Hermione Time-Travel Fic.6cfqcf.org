I'm looking for a fic where Harry and Hermione travel back in time and start systematically killing Death Eaters. The first ones they kill are Narcissa and Lucius by sneaking into their mansion. The fic explores the consequences of murder on the soul, and Harry's battle with remorse.

It was sadly abandoned, but a very well-written fic so I'd like to read it again.


** Harry acts like a time traveller killing Hitler and his top Nazis to prevent WW2 and the Holocaust, and then suddenly feeling bad because now Eva Braun is sad.

*** The author got so much hate for that manufactured angst that he/she gave up this story.

**** Which kind of confirmed that this was not some temporary lapse of Harry which would be solved in future chapters.

*** What? The story was brilliant because the narration doesn't imply they're doing anything wrong. Only later, when Harry feels remorse for his actions, we start to understand that yes, using Legilimency on people left and right is not ethical, and calculated murder leaves consequences on someone, regardless of how justified it was. I find it a refreshing fic because it explores concepts which are canon, but mostly ignored - how many fics actually deal with corrupted souls? If you disliked this story because Harry wasn't a ruthless killing machine, you have bad taste, it was well executed.

**** Feeling remorse over Draco "I wish all mudbloods would die" Malfoy missing his mass-murdering father is shit. There was nothing deep or complex to it. Harry simply decided that killing Death Eaters was wrong - despite the fact that he knew how many lives their deaths would save.

I don't dislike the fic because Harry is not ruthless, I dislike it because he fucking cries over a mass-murdering scumbag, and forgets all about the innocent victims he should save.

Harry in this story started trying to prevent the holocaust, and suddenly felt remorse over Hitler's sad lover. And that's simply sick.

  An older and more experienced Harry and Hermione return to their first year at Hogwarts. Their goals? Assassinate Death Eaters, destroy Horcruxes, and deal with Voldemort's hidden contingency plan... by any means necessary. And maybe they'll fix a few other things along the way.

** I think you have to take into account the universe this story is set in. The utilitarian approach is all well and good, but HP canon is basically pseudo-Christian, and violent acts definitely do impact someone's soul. I like that this is taken seriously in some ff, not everything has to be AU. Also, your comparisons to Hitler don't change the fact that killing someone is not easy. I sure can't imagine calmly pulling the trigger on, say, even a high-ranking nazi without being fucked up later.
