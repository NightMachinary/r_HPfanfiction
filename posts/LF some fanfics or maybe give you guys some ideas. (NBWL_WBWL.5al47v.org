** This is not WBWL but it is one of the best crime lord!Harry fanfictions there are. The sequel is currently being written and is updated roughly once a month. Features a Genius!Harry Killer!Harry some child abuse in the earlier chapters. And is for VERY mature audiences. linkffn(10808106) linkffn(11869527)

*** Its ok, I didn't really like the whole "harry is 8 and is a perfect crime lord that never has anything go wrong" thing. But it was ok other than that.

**** Yeah, I think that too. But luckily all Harry Potter fanfictions have an excuse. "IT'S MAGIC BRUH!"

***** The problem I have with it is that no one from canon gets notably strong before Hogwarts. If this was a different fandom where there are ridiculously strong children, say Naruto for instance where both [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Itachi_Uchiha][Itachi]] and [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kakashi_Hatake][Kakashi]] are shown to be ridiculously strong, joining ANBU (Black Ops ninjas essentially), so children being ridiculously strong is actually supported by canon.

**** As a note, they don't go perfectly, just way better than is reasonable for canon.

  Dumbledore thinks he will rescue Harry from his terrible family, setting himself up as Harry's mentor. Unfortunately for him, somebody else got there first. BAMF!Harry, M for violence, language, child abuse/prostitution, drug use, and all around criminal goings on.
