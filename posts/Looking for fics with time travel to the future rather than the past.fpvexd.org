Time travel fics are in abundance, but almost invariably they're from future to past. I'm wondering if there are any fics where the reverse happens. It could be from the Marauders era to the present, present to next-gen, or indeed from the present to the far distant future.


** There's one where Sirius accidentally makes a pseudo-horcrux out of the Marauders Map and Harry accidentally brings him into post-OotP Hogwarts.

I cannot for the life of me remember anything else about the story but I either remember it being slash or wishing it had been.

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

** Linkao3(6765496)

Muggles learn about magic. In one side plot someone realizes that there's a business opportunity in making real flying, time traveling DeLoreans. And of course someone steals one to get the lottery results of next week.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
