I've always enjoyed hogwarts centric fics most of all, but the past two months or so ive been reading more and more post-DH stories. I just finished linkffn(What We Lost by JacobApples) and im reading along with his new continuation linkffn(Found in the Ashes by JacobApples). The harry/andromeda pairing might be odd, but the chemistry is there. Anyone else have any good fics for post-DH? Time travel is cool too, just anything where the character(s) have gone through the events of the war.

â€‹

Oh, I also read linkffn(Vitam Paramus by TheEndless7) which features Harry/Gabrielle with a lot of focus on Harry having a quidditch career. Very entertaining read, which makes it deserve more praise considering it has no action to carry the story.

** Since I've been on the same kick, I'll drop a few recommendations for stuff I think is well-written:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8125531][Hogwarts, to welcome you home]] - A fluffy feels trip about Defense professor Harry.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11968875][To Welcome You Home]] - Similar title, completely different premise. Just a short nostalgia trip.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/245007][Lost among Our Winnings]] - A series of postwar vignettes with feels and some plot surrounding the remaining Death Eaters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] - Just read it. I'll let its 1648 words speak for themselves.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7583506/1/Letters][Letters]] - Teddy finds some long-forgotten letters Harry wrote during DH in case of his death.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11317075/1/These-Cuts-I-Have][These Cuts I Have]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12787674/1/Some-Cuts-Leave-Scars][Some Cuts Leave Scars]] - Everyone picking up the pieces after the war. Lots of soul-searching in the first one.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/252249/chapters/391280][War is Over]] - Lots of postwar tension and Ministry bungling. Has a next-gen James Sirius sequel, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/369727/chapters/602150][Inter Arma...]]

And if you want some next-gen stuff to go along with it, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] is always worth a read, and I rather liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417562/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Global-Revelation][Noahphantom's Albus Potter series]] (though its worldbuilding/magic system diverges from Rowling's style quite a bit in the later books).

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

** Since this is tagged as a discussion:

#+begin_quote
  Is it just me, or is everyone else getting on a huge post-DH fic kick too?
#+end_quote

I can't really get into those since I am not a fan of DH or the results of it. To name just a few:

Ron/Hermione, the Lupin/Tonks marriage, the canon jobs in the Ministry, the big Weasley family, the anticlimactic Molly/Bellatrix fight, the way Harry won, the way the final battle played out, the fact that Hermione got the idiot ball during the last two books and forgot about Tesco.

#+begin_quote
  The harry/andromeda pairing might be odd
#+end_quote

While rather uncommon, it is tame compared to a lot of fanon favourites (eg anything with Malfoy or Snape). It was believable and well done until kids were involved. There was simply a huge change in the tone, which was rather off-putting.

.

I think linkffn(10871795; 8175132) count as post-war-time-travel, even though not in the way you imagined.

There are also a couple of one-shots which are set after the war, but out of my ~170 favourites in this fandom, maybe ten are postwar due to the reasons mentioned above.

*** Pretty solid points, honestly. Thanks for the recs. I think i might be getting burned out on 'lets redo the series except change this' stories and since i never really touched any p-DH before it seems really appealing rn.

I agree with you on how crazy some pairings can get (i get the heebie-jeebies when it comes to hermione/snape). And yeah, the tone change was kind of abrupt. I think it would have been a more solid story with just Teddy and no other kids. I hope the sequel is good, but the new villian is already kind of off putting.

I feel like jowling kowling rowling really wanted to tie loose plot threads when she was writing DH. In my opinion, it created a weaker and dissapointing climax to the series.

I dont wanna even think about cursed child and the can of worms that comes with that.

What do you think of complete divergences? I'm writing a story which, after one station of canon (Slughorn's Christmas party) completely ditches the canon plot in favour of an original one. As in, Harry has to flee Britain because the Ministry excels at incompetence and then has to travel all across Europe to figure out what is actually going on and why.

********** Thanks.

Dawn of Darkness started out as a oneshot called "Stop worrying for one evening" (shitty name, I know). I was already writing another story at that point (4th year with Tonks as big sister) but quite a few of my plot ideas were not feasible because Harry was simply too young to do stuff like travel across the continent or hold his own in a fight. So I started thinking what to do with these ideas until I remembered that I had a sixth year oneshot sitting there, which would be a good base (Tonks quit her job because she was fed up with the Ministry, Harry is no longer a child and knows significantly more combat magic).

I rewrote the oneshot a little to be a better match for the main plot and called it chapters 1 and 2. The remaining story is darker, so I didn't just continue the happy oneshot. I'm not entirely happy with the state of things there, but I also have no real concept on how to improve it.

If you are looking for something more similar to Drool, there's another short story I've written called "Under Guard". Basically, the Order persuades Hermione's parents that she would be safer at Grimmauld, but she is not amused. Enter Tonks, who is bored after her first Order meeting.

************* Ive read through chapter 8, and i think youve brought the relationship to a stable, yet uniquely odd point. There is trust and mutual attraction even if they dont know what they want to be. With the changes youve made it makes sense for them to be so close.

I really love the idea of the HRE style german government, i havent seen anything like it. A lot of the politics seems a little abstract at this point, but politics are kind of abstract by nature. Considering a majority of the politics so far have been portrayed through articles and speculation it makes sense why we dont see the whole picture.

Overall im enjoying it and will probably catch up by tomorrow night. Also i like your portrayal of andromeda and ted. The one thing thats bugged me is that Harry dissapears the night of the party and none of his friends or the order attempt to contact (or influence) him? I understand that theyve either seen him with dora or read the articles, but it seems kinda iffy for them to just leave him be.

************** Well, for starters, thanks a lot for the detailed feedback, it is much appreciated.

Harry and Tonks are hidden behind a Fidelius, Andromeda is the secret keeper. That alone makes contact a little tricky. Dumbledore trusts Tonks since she is in the Order, so it's not like he ran away with a stranger. And it's Christmas as well, which means Harry is not required to be at Hogwarts until January. Hermione is in Switzerland with her parents. And Ron recently discovered the wonders of a girlfriend, so the only danger Harry has to expect from him is getting high-fived too hard. And Molly, well good luck trying to get around a Fidelius with Andromeda Tonks as secret keeper.

As for the magical HRE, I'm using that as headcanon for all my fics, even if it only makes an appearance in No Longer Alone, where several principalities field their own teams. Harry watches the Group Stage between Lithuania, Holstein, Venice and Japan as well as a knockout game against Flanders. Bohemia, Strya and Saxony are mentioned as participants as well.

When you get to the last two chapters, could you give me some feedback on whether the descriptions of the places is detailed enough or not?

I recently read some non fictional books about WW2 again and since then I am somewhat uncomfortable, when people talk about "war" in Harry Potter. It sounds cruel, but no, nothing described in canon even comes close to an actual war and I think that some words should not be used too easily.

What I do like are "new generation" fics, especially if they focus completely on the young characters and do not feel the need to make anything more intense or horrible by adding another super villain or horrible childhood or orphanhood.
