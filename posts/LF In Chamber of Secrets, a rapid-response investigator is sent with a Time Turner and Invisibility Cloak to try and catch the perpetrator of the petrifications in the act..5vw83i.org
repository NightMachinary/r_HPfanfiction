To quote TvTropes - What An Idiot - Harry Potter...

#+begin_quote
  From the second book onwards the same situation repeats itself: some crucial events take place with either no witnesses or kids (usually Harry) as witnesses, and afterwards nobody believes them.

  *You'd Expect:* They would use the Time Turners to send back an invisible observer and oversee the events in question.

  *Instead:* They never do, and it constantly gets worse.

What if someone DID grab a Time Turner to try and investigate the cause of a petrification, after the second one or so happens?

Does anyone have any fics where this happens?

Although, now you mention this one, I wonder; are there any fics where the Diary possesses Lucius Malfoy? If it can possess Ginny and drain away her life force in the span of half a year or so, what could it do to Lucius over the course of 12 years? Rewrite his memory and personality entirely?

I shall have to post another request for that, I think.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** Its very close to what I did in HPG, where Dumbledore goes back in time to try to catch whoever is petrifying the students.

There's also 'Petrifaction Proliferation' by WhiteSquirrel which follows a similar theme. He was the one who gave me some very helpful advice on how to handle the 2nd year story, and is a really good writer, so you might want to give his story a shot even if it doesn't match your criteria exactly.

As far as my story goes, the chapter that focuses on the Time Travel is called '/The Three Dumbledores/'. You should look at that chapter first to see if that is what you are looking for before you read the entire thing.
