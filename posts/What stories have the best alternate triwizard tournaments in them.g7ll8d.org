I dunno I read one a while ago were Harry slayed the dragon with the sword of griffindor and I'm always curious to know what other alternate tournament ideas people have came up with?


** I mean, linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is in the middle of 4th year with an amazing alternate tournament. The whole story is great, but it is a complete AU, the tournament is almost completely different, among other things.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

***** I don't know how far you read into the story, but it differs from "Lord Harry" in quite a few central themes.

First, the caste system is as much an enemy for the protagonists as is Voldemort. Hermione never accepts being a third-class citizen, even though she can act the part in public. (And she and Harry overdo that since they learned from outdated books. As the story progresses, that is relaxed quite a bit.)

Second, there's no "Lord Hadrian". Harry isn't a teenage politician. He isn't rich, he has no collection of seats. Nor does he or any other teenager control the Wizengamot or the Ministry. Politics are done by Dumbledore and Sirius.

Third, there's no "Indipendent Harry". Dumbledore is the leader of the Order of the Phoenix. Harry's not working against Dumbledore - nor does he actually want to. It might appear so at the start, when Dumbledore doesn't like Harry becoming a patron, but contrary to the kids' opinion at the time, giving a preteen such authority over another isn't exactly a good idea.

Fourth, there are no helpful goblins. Nor ancient laws that make people listen to Harry.

It's a story where the adults generally handle things. Enough things go wrong due to enemy action that the teenagers do have to fight and struggle, but the war is usually handled by the Order and the Aurors, not the DA. Harry plays a crucial role, but Dumbledore calls the shots, so to speak.
