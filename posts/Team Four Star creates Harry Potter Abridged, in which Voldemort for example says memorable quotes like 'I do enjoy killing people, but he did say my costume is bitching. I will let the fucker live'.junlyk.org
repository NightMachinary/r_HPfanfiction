*** Quirrelmort, sounding like Zorg from The Fifth Element: Give me the shtooooone!

Hermione: Uh, with your weakened state right now, you're about as powerful as 3 Rons.

** Please for the love of everything, do not allow such a masterpiece to become an Indy! Harry fic! Please! I'm begging you.

I also have a few suggestions such as making Hermione a drug addict who's hallucinating half of hogwarts so the troll is just her snorting even more fairy dust and crying in the bathroom. Harry could be like Kirito from SAO abridged with the love of the game replaced by a love of magic, Ron could be like Klein or be a secret chess master plotting to overthrow the world but is really insecure about his magical abilities. Flitwick could be a brutal axe murder in his free time and threaten people with an axeing when they annoy him, Minerva is a walking Scottish stereotype, snape is a Squibb who snuck into hogwarts and has since lost total control of the situation, Hagrid is still Hagrid just more Hagrid-y, a dragon on your head no issue just scratch it under the chin, Dumbledore could be the only sane one but is really weak so he gets by on common sense and doing simple stuff to win fights and uses a lot of dirty tricks.

The moon is cream cheese, Voldemort is a fraud who when he was drunk made the death eaters and did the ugly snake-noiseless thing, Lucius is called Lucy at all times and regularly switches bodies with his wife, Bella is constantly horny and does a lot of weird crap, Sirius is perfect gentleman and invites everyone in for tea and is generally very British but he freaks people out and he has no clue why everyone is terrified of him (maybe he has a few pet dementors) I might write this at some point.

**** That's could be an interesting dynamic with Hermione and he'd probably make a good drug mentor, a “drumentor” if you will.

** Voldemort looked at the now slowly cooling corpse of the Basilisk that was supposed to kill the Boy Who Lived. At the time, said boy proceeded to retrieve the Sword of Gryffindor from the mouth of the beast and turn towards his next foe, Fawkes already healing the wound in Harry's arm.

'You done goofed' the boy said, stabbing Riddle's diary with a fang of the basilisk.

Riddle began to scream and evaporate"

I''ve only watched Hellsing Abriged and am a bit drunk, so it's the best i can do.

** I do miss parodies like these. Back in the day there were '[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEEBC55D98CBC6AFF][Potter Puppet Pals]]' and '[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC76BE906C9D83A3A][A Very Potter Musical]].' It would be good to have new content.
