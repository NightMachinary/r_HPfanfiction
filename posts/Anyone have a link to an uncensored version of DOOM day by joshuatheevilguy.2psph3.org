** From his fanfiction.net profile:

I have found another site for [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=364&warning=3][Department of Mysteries Day]] and am (SLOWLY) updating it with old and new chapters. For those of you familiar with the Tenhawk Presents website... you have to be a Member in order to read 'Rated M' stories. /EVIL GRIN/

***** Just made an account to see if I could read it, nope. Same message. IDK if I need to wait for a validation email before? I'll report back in 15 minutes.

Edit: No further emails, so I'll guess there's no way for me to read it atm :(
