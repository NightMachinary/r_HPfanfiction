*** an excerpt from an original parody series I'm working on then(it's in the middle of a serious rewrite since the romcomness of it really annoyed the shit out of me, deciding if they're together or just friends or frienemies is killing me):

Lit.High.1

Harmony Silo put the paper down, looking over at James Evans as he walked into the school. She watched him stop to breathe on his student council president photo and wipe it clean of kiss prints from various girls---and a surprising number of boys, throwing high-fives and disarming grins all around as the sheeple bowed down before him.

She sighed, unwillingly admitting to herself he somewhat deserved it. Over Spring Break he had traveled to Lord Darken's Forbidding Forbidden Fortress---that all were forbade to travel to---and with a dozen news crews filming, had magically dueled him to a stand still with no help while battling his Necromuncher minions, summoned an ancient artifact from beyond the mists of time---an obscenely blinged out sword covered with fat rubies and amber gems, then cut Lord Darken in half from the top of his snakey head to his groin. Lord Darken had exploded into a mass of snakes that then exploded into gibs.

It had stopped a hidden war of bigots out to kill off people like her, magicals born to mundanes. The rumors in the Daily Soothsayer had James only a few votes away from Emperor of a United Magical nation.

When he looked her way, he gave her the same grin and she felt her wand slide from her wrist holster. Only a quick move stopped it from flying towards him. She scowled. His power---as defined by a prophecy spoken a year before he was born---was to be Metaphorically Literal. It had been a living hell as he grew up she always assumed.

James sat down in front of her and his eyes twinkled merrily as he smiled at her. She sighed. “What do you want?”

“Can I borrow your Alchemy notes? Mine were lost over spring break.”

She nodded. “But they're at home.”

“So I'll stop by.”

“You know where I live?”

“No, I just figured you would either let me drop you off after class or tell me where,” he said, raising an eyebrow.

“I'll meet you here after class,” she said, looking like it hurt.

~•~

As Harmony followed James out to the student parking lot, she came to a dead stop. “What. Is. That?”

He smiled as he turned back to her then looked back at the glistening white Koenigsegg One:1. “Uncle Sothis got it for me for, well, surviving. Cool, isn't it?”

Harmony held back the snarky comment she wanted to say, that it was a very expensive looking penis compensation, and instead nodded. In the back of her mind she did have to admit it was cool looking.

He opened the door for her and she carefully slid in, clutching her backpack so it wouldn't scratch the car. She knew it was a hypercar because of her father watching the braying moron Jeremy Clarkson and she knew it was expensive but beyond those, she didn't really care.

“So fly or road?” he asked.

“It flies?!”

He grinned and flipped up the carbon fibre oval on her side of the dash and she saw it magically expand and show it was covered with dozens of runic formulas, various knobs, and a block of a thousand octarescent pearls were powering the spells on the vehicle.

“How can you break all the laws?” Against magical enchanting mundane items magically.

“When we were eleven, you remember how you suggested I should donate to charity?”

Her eyes widened. “You remembered that?”

He nodded as the car rose into the air and he flipped a toggle that said Invisibility Booster. “Anyway, that led me to another idea because you were complaining about the lack of indexes in the books at our old school.” Before the magical world had been revealed to the mundanes when they were fourteen, they had gone to boarding school in a castle in Eureka, Oregon that had been transplanted from Atlantis before it had fallen into the ocean centuries before the ‘discovery' of the New World by mundanes.

“So, Uncle Sothis and Uncle Remo took my original idea---to create indexes for all books---and turned it into a new series of books, Encyclopedia Arcana. The first edition will be released in about six years they think. They distill every book on magic down to its base. There're over two hundred magicals working on it.”

She stared at him, her jaw dropping down, revealing the hint of elongated canines from an accident in their second year. “How come you never mentioned it before?”

“Because you stopped talking to me about the time the idea got finalized.

“Where's your place at from here?”

She looked out the window and realized their were only a few hundred feet in the air. It took her a few moments to figured out she was looking at Oak St and 14th Way. “Two blocks south and one east.”

He checked for traffic on a magical equivalent of a RADAR then settled down to the ground and her eyes widened at the sound of the engine whining loudly.

“It was silent before.”

“Because flying is for stealthiness, loud cars are a safety mechanism.”

She looked at the RPM counter and saw it went up to 8000 and it passed a red arrow as James hit the paddle to upshift.

He parked the car in front of her house just as her dad opened the door to get the mail. Harmony resisted the urge to giggle at her father's flabbergasted expression and the mail dropping to the ground as the passenger door scissored open, revealing her.

“Hello, Mr Silo,” James said as the man walked to the car while Harmony walked up the stone path and into the house.

“This car is amazing. I never thought I'd see one this close.”

James got out. “Take her for a test drive, Mr Silo.”

“Really?”

“Yeah. She's set to manumatic mode so just shift with the paddles---Right up, left down---when she hits about forty nine hundred.”

Mr Silo slid into the seat and James helped him adjust the seat then got the passenger door down.

A moment later he was halfway down the street.

James chuckled.

Harmony walked out and asked, “Where's your car?”

“Your dad's taking it for a test drive. Thanks,” he said as he took the notes she held out. He read a few pages. “It's so much easier now that we don't have to use quills, eh?”

She nodded. “I miss the castle, though.”

“They're going to turn it into a higher education. For those of us who want to get Masteries and they'll have it affiliated with Willamette University so we can get minors in mundane stuff.”

“I know. But they said it could be years.”

“Sothis threw money at them. He was the angel investor for a few tech companies that blew up recently.”

She wanted to ask which ones but didn't because her father reappeared with the cops hot on his tail.

A few words from James and some autographs and a smile that---literally---charmed the two cops, her dad was let off with a mild warning and James was on his way.

“He is so cool!” her father gushed.

Harmony scowled and went to her room.

([{<>}])

Harmony walked downstairs, a book floating in front of her as she read and checked the weather on an app in her phone, glad that being away from the castle it wasn't an explosion waiting to happen like her CD player had been. The magic of the castle had sped the CD up so fast it had exploded like shrapnel and the batteries had been fratricided by the shards, exploding even larger.

When she got to their sitting room, she froze. The latest model her father built and kept in the small alcove---a three foot long USS Pennsylvania he had made from balsa wood and working aluminum guns---was no longer there. Now there was a framed picture of the paper with James's interview from the day after the fight, a 1/16 scale Koenigsegg One:1, a copy of his wand---she had seen those go up for sale on her trip to Abnorm Alley in Anaheim, and a stuffed figurine of him her parents had gotten her as a gag gift her first year before going to Eureka.

“Mom!”

Her mother came into the room, wiping her hands and sighed. “I know, I know. But he let your dad drive a multi-million dollar car, sweetie.”

“But he's being a fanboi! Of an eighteen year old boy!”

“Better than if he was being a fanboi of him as an eleven year old, yes? And I saw him fight. he's definitely a man, girlie.”

Harmony huffed and went to get a cup of coffee. Only to find there was a coffee mug with James's face on it where her dad sat at the table. “Aggggh!”

~•~

James dropped down between Chuck Treble---who was drawing Willy Wonwon's younger sister Rummy, a copper haired cheerleader sitting across from them next to Pike Bay, the other boy who could have been the subject of the prophecy---and Willy Wonwon who was manning a fondue pot with candy coating in it. Pike was carefully slicing a mandrake root then dredging the slices in cacao powder before passing them across the table to Willy.

Willy stirred the mandrake root in the candy until there was a flash of gold light from it and he pulled it out, revealing a candy coated slice of mandrake root and passed it to James.

He popped it in his mouth and chewed carefully. “Nice. White gold plated blade?”

“Pure white gold with stabilizing runes,” Pike said.

“Why?” Willy asked.

“White gold causes Mandrake to gain an anise flavor,” James said.

Pike nodded. “But the use of pure white gold instead of plate makes the anise flavor stronger. But gold is too soft so you gotta use stabilizing runes so it stays sharp.”

“Rummy, I'm done,” Chuck said and passed the pad of paper over. It showed Rummy, in her cheer uniform, looking over her shoulder, smiling mischievously.

“That's so great! It's gonna look so good on my MageSpace page!”

“I'll scan it later.”

INSERT CHARACTER SCENE FROM OTHER STORY (because all eight books happen concurrently, various events happening throughout the books occur in other books.)

James rolled his eyes as OTHERCHARACTER pulled ***self off the floor and was escorted out by the security guard.
