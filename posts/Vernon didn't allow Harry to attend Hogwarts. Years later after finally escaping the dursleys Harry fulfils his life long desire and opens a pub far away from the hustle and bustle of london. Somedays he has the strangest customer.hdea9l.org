**** Its so unrelated and distant, it's hardly fanfiction. It's just using the name of the characters at that point.

This could be much better written without piggybacking off of the Harry Potter fan base.

It's like "Harry Potter: the Muggle" a book about what if Harry Potter wasn't magical at all, and parents never died. It's just writing a completely unrelated story for the purpose of what? I've read some "out there" fics but suggestions like this? It's so, so far from the regular thing that the only thing still keeping it in the genre of fanfiction are the names of the characters.

You want a story about a Muggle kid raised as a Muggle who opened a bar, basically.

Why not just write or read about that outside of the Harry Potter world at that point?

****** They are the same thing mostly, with a few distinctions.

Bars serve more hard alcohol and ruity drinks for the ladies than pubs, while still offering regular beer. Pubs have a much larger selection of beers, and a smaller selection of harder alcohol.

Pubs also tend to serve meals/food, where bars have just bar food. Bars are usually louder, from music playing to general atmosphere. Pubs tend to be quieter and more of a relaxing dining experience.

Any follow up questions about them in America?

***** I once asked the same question and figured that there are at least 3 good reasons for these "Harry in name only" fics.

1. You get the world building for free
2. You get the characterisation (and readers emotional connection to charachters) for free
3. You get a bigger audience likely to see your story

What this means is that author's can write better, more interesting stories with less effort, or with less understanding of the more technical side of writing.
