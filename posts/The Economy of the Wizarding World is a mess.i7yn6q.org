  *The Monetary and Financial system*
#+end_quote

The Monetary and financial systems are stuck somewhere around the late Renaissance. The only bank in the magical world, Gringotts, doesn't act like a modern bank. It's not a financial intermediary: it doesn't make loans or offer interest bearing accounts. Instead it's primarily a safe deposit firm, with famously high security vaults. This complete lack of a modern financial system where savings are lent out to finance investments, means that wizarding entrepreneurs and businesses have to rely on self-financing or the munificence of rich individuals. This is why Fred and George were only able to start up their joke shop after Harry gave them his 1000 Galleon winnings from the tri-wizard tournament. A world as hierarchical and prejudiced as the one Harry inhabits --- where most rich wizards such as the Malfoys look down on those less fortunate than themselves --- clearly does not encourage innovation, growth and social mobility.

​

there is no government run central bank, Gringotts also performs this role. It is in charge of maintaining the monetary system, which despite consisting of commodity money --- Golden Galleon, Silver Sickle, and Bronze Knut --- operates more like our own fiduciary system with trust in the currency being key to its value.

  *Businesses and Regulations*
#+end_quote

Every industry in the wizarding economy is highly concentrated. One reason for that may be excessive regulation and bureaucracy. We witness an example of this in The Goblet of Fire, when rather than allowing consumers to decide for themselves, government bureaucrat Percy Weasley tries to establish a standardized thickness for cauldron bottoms. Such regulations drive up the costs of production and increase the barriers to entry for challenger firms.

​

And Ministry of Magic appears to employ almost all wizards and witches. It also appears to be the monopoly provider of a vast array of goods and services, such as education, health, and even the maintenance of Ministry buildings (sadly the magical world seems to have missed out on the privatization wave which swept the Muggle world during the 80s and 90s). Having such a large government, with a high regulatory burden is likely to have a crowding out effect on the private sector.

  *Trade*
#+end_quote

Foreign producers and international trade could provide competition, but heavy government regulation also appears to stop this: In The Goblet of Fire we learn that ministry regulations prevent the importing of flying carpets, which could compete with broomsticks as a mode of personal transportation. The reason for the ban is that flying carpets are classified as a Muggle object, yet the fact they can fly clearly makes this ban absurd and is obviously an example of the government trying to protect domestic producers at the expense of consumers.

​

#+begin_quote
  *Education*
#+end_quote

A good education system is crucial for enabling this. Unfortunately, in the magical world schooling is generally very poor. A severe lack of competition, with only one school, Hogwarts, covering the UK and Ireland, and only 11 magical schools in the whole world, means there is little incentive to provide good quality education. Throughout his education we see how Harry Potter is taught by a series of unqualified and terrible teachers. From Hagrid, with his penchant for large and deadly beasts, to Professor Snape, a former member of the terrorist organization known as the Death Eaters, to Professor Trelawney, who is only competent at divination when in a trance.

​

#+begin_quote
  *The Government*
#+end_quote

The biggest issue in the world that Harry Potter inhabits is the role and influence of the Ministry of Magic. This has immense and arbitrary powers, which it uses to control and regulate most activities in the magical world. Worryingly the concepts of checks and balances or separation of powers doesn't seem to exist: the Ministry functions as executive, legislator, and judiciary.

​

The importance of having an independent judiciary is underlined several times throughout the series: Hagrid and Stan Shunpike are both imprisoned in Azkaban without trial, and when Harry stands trial in Order of the Phoenix the Ministry acts as prosecutor, judge, and jury. Finally, when Sirius Black escaped Azkaban, the Ministry altered his sentence arbitrarily from life imprisonment to death by Dementor's kiss. In all these cases there appears to be no appeal or review process.

​

Worse still, most of the powers of the ministry are centralized in the hands of one person, the Minister for Magic. How a wizard or witch is appointed to this position is unclear, but it doesn't appear to be by democratic election. Rather the system seems to operate more like the late Venetian empire, whereby the elites decided among themselves who the next Doge would be.


** Privatization was a catastrophe. There's no need for it, it's extremely wasteful. In particular, private Healthcare is a nightmare and the NHS is far superior.

*** also considering how companies cut corners

I would not be surprized if the ministry only got involved in couldron making due to the fact several dozen people died due to couldrons of insufficent thickness that leaked out the potion.

some standardization is needed. hell does anyone remember how annoying phone chargers where a decade or so ago with every phone having its own charger and port and then goverments got involved and now we have fair less

another note about privatization australian telephone and internet used to be goverment owned it was then privatized and the quaility went down and the goverment still had to spend billions to upgrade the network

  Gringotts, doesn't act like a modern bank. It's not a financial intermediary: it doesn't make loans or offer interest bearing accounts.
#+end_quote

We don't actually know that. We only see Gringotts from the perspective of Harry, who is a child. Banks do not lend to children. When Harry gave the Twins the money, they were going into their final year of school. They may have been seventeen, but they were schoolchildren. In the real world, to get a bank loan to start up a business - so a business mortgage for the premises and a start up loan to kit it out and buy in the products to sell - you need at the minimum a credit score, and potentially even some collateral. The Twins will not have had that. For all we know, Gringotts could give loans, mortgages and business start up money to adults who apply.

As for your other points, you do realise JKR is a socialist don't you?!

**** No, it doesn't. But it does explain her love of centralisation and state involvement in the economy and why she built her world around this. We don't actually know that the wizarding economy is stagnating, I mean, Harry doesn't read the business and finance sections of the Prophet so the reader wouldn't know either way! Regulations don't automatically mean stagnation. Your comments about the Ministry running education, health, maintenance of government buildings and so on - that's how it works even today in the UK. The majority of our schools and hospitals are state run, and stuff like safety regulations (so your cauldron bottom example would fall here) are a normal part of life.

There's probably, according to estimates based on how many people go to Hogwarts compared to the overall population of the UK, only about 10,000 magical people in Britain. So a hugely diversified economy probably isn't necessary and wouldn't have the customer base for a massive range of businesses - the town I grew up in has about twice that population and has like two supermarkets, a couple of restaurants, five pubs and one high street of clothes shops, and this tiny weird bit with three fancy shops and a market. I honestly find it bizarre that they need two joke shops for a population of ten thousand!!

I think your most valid point was the one about separation of powers - I've often said this but wtf is Umbridge? Is she an elected politician? Because she seems to have the powers of one. Is she a lawyer or judge? Because she sits on the massive jury that they seem to use. But wait, she can't be voted out so she must be a civil servant - who in the UK are apolitical. Was she a school inspector, like those who work for Ofsted? Or was she a teacher? The wizarding world doesn't need economic liberalisation, it needs democracy!

** You realize there are probably less than 30,000 wizards in magical Britain? And that extremely codified and formalized governments as well as modern financial systems only work with a large enough population to support them? And that if your government was devoted to hiding a massive secret from a population much larger in addition to the usual stuff a government does, it'd probably hire a bunch of people too?

That doesn't even touch on the subjective stuff like the regulation laws which are debatable in the actual world.
