What are some unusual bits of fanon you've seen or come up with?

Don't post common or well-known ideas, we've had endless threads talking about those already.

To be clear, fanon = original ideas that aren't supported by canon, but are still canon-compatible.


** The Ministry is forced to send a certain amount of prisoners to Azkaban, as an offering to the Dementors, who would otherwise leave the island and feast upon the innocent.

The reason why so many wizards seem insane is that they suffered long term exposure to the Imperius Curse during Voldemort's rise, and the curse seems to induce madness if used for a long period.

** There are some pureblood kids who never knew Voldemort's name until they reached Hogwarts because their parents were so terrified of saying it that they literally refused to mention it even once to their children.

The Marauder era was the last generation of children allowed to do magic at home before turning seventeen. This is in very large part due to Voldemort recruiting underage wizards (Regulus was taken when he was only 16) so the Ministry banned underage magic to make youngsters less desirable. (As for canon-compatibility: Petunia mentions Lily coming home and turning tea cups into rats, and Sirius used Permanent Sticking Charms in his bedroom at Grimmauld Place, which he left at the age of sixteen.)

At least once a Muggleborn student has told a pureblood about the Bloody Mary legend and speaking her name three times in a mirror, to which the pureblood has scoffed ("that's NOT how you summon a ghost!") but agreed to try it just to prove the Muggleborn wrong, and one of the Hogwarts ghosts (or Peeves) has popped up behind them right after the third "Bloody Mary" just to scare the shit out of them.

The Chamber of Secrets, which doesn't actually have any secrets, wasn't originally called that and was never originally a secret. It was just Salazar's hideaway where he kept his pet basilisk and he gave it a Parseltongue name, but no one else could pronounce it properly and so the original name got mangled until everyone thought it was "secrets". (Which, as I understand, is the history for a lot of English words.)

It's canon that Dumbledore has a habit of earning loyalty from people through large favours--letting Remus attend Hogwarts then giving him a job, giving Snape a second chance, helping Mundungus "out of a tight spot once". Related fanon: He earnt Mrs Figg's loyalty by giving her brother, also a squib, a job when he started acting out because he resented being a squib a lot more than his sister. Her brother? Argus Filch.

A bit like wanting to avoid someone who smells bad, wizards/witches subconsciously have a feel for others magic and can find a compatible magical signature attractive and incompatible signatures unattractive.

** - Bellatrix was tortured with the cruciatus for so long, that her body (in an attempt to save itself) switched the reactions of arousal and pain. She doesn't feel bad about using the curse, because to her mind it no longer has a negative but a positive connotation. From the outside she is the crazy one, but from her perspective those refusing all the suffering at the hands of Voldemort are the mad ones.

- Magicals are unaware of the advancements of muggles like you and me are unaware of the details of technology available to help people without sight. Technology is like prosthetics to magicals, only there to assist with things that an abled person can do anyway - only those disabled (squibs, muggles) need technology. Of course, there is technology that in some fields is already better than magic, but there are also prosthetics that allow you to run faster than with real legs - you still wouldn't use those, as you prefer your natural legs.

- Voldemort didn't die because of Lily's sacrifice (many mothers would do that), but because he promised severus to spare her, and unknowingly entered a magically binding contract. He initially offered her to step aside, but she refused, and so instead of fulfilling the contract, he killed her and broke the clause, resulting in some form of punishment (e.g. him not being able to fulfill what he wanted to get from this contract, in this case being able to kill the boy from the prophecy.)

- Petunia is a squib and feels the horcrux in harry's head - since she was always told she was only a muggle, she doesn't even consider the possibility, and therefore has no idea where this feeling of uneasiness comes from. In the end she concludes that she simply dislikes the boy, reinforcing her (and by extension her family's) bad treatment of him.

** Originally the character we know as Daphne Greengrass was going to be called Queenie.

I like to imagine that her whole name is Queenie Daphne Greengrass, and that she goes by her middle name because she's embarrassed. Following from that I like to imagine that every story that uses the IceQueen!Daphne trope is actually her friends coming up with the teasing nickname. This makes a stupid trope much more bearable.

This could, if used in a story, be a good way to introduce a more carefree Harry who teases/flirts with her after finding out her name via the marauder's map.

** I came up with a reason why Peter Pettigrew did what he did. He was tired of the war, he was tired of his friends going away and starting families and doing things without him. He resented this. All he wanted to do was go back in time and go through his time at Hogwarts again, this time being the guy that the other Marauders looked up to.

Voldemort promised him a Time Turner so that he could accomplish this feat- that and a permanent de-aging potion to return him to his 11 year old self. His plan? To Obliviate himself/transfigure himself into something else permanently, and to take his place on the train.

That's why he's so uncaring about all the people he kills/leads to their deaths. He doesn't care because he is going to go back and change everything anyway.

His plan was to go through school and change everything, then use the Time Turner to go back again so he could literally go to school forever, because he's twisted as fuck.

** This thread is kinda old, but I figure I might as well throw my two cents in.

We never hear about people falling off the stairs. We never hear about those dementors accidentally kissing someone despite their obsession with wandering onto the grounds, and most of all /somehow/ the only people affected by a /basilisk/ were those looking at it indirectly.

With all the danger in Hogwarts, you'd expect that there'd be at least a couple of deaths, that you'd see some kind of effect on the student body from the sheer quantity of danger that they get put in, but we don't. The only death we hear about is one that left a witness who was impossible to remove, Moaning Myrtle.

You remember those kids that just up and vanish after their sorting? People like Sally-Ann, Mandy Brocklehurst, Euan Abercrombie, Owen Cauldwell, Graham Pritchard, and Kevin Whitby? No?

/Neither do the students./

I'm not doing the best job at setting it up, but the theory is that the students mentioned above are dead. Their families and friends? Obliviated. Anyone who'd heard about them? Obliviated. Hogwarts is the safest place in Britain after all and we certainly can't have any muggles mucking that up with silly things like a wrongful death suit.

I've always kinda had this idea in the back of my mind since I read that part of the Seventh Horcrux where Harry kept talking about Sally-Anne, but the fic that convinced me of it was Chapter 9 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/9/The-Snow-Queen][The Snow Queen.]] (background of the story is fem!Harry disappearing at a young age) I'd suggest you read the rest of it first as it's /very/ AU, but the first quarter or so of Chapter 9 is all you really need to get the theory.

So, what do you think? Crackpot or not?

**** To be honest, I'm not quite sure myself because I don't have any problems with them either; heck, considering how much hair gel people like Malfoys use it's actually pretty amusing that the Potter fortune had been made on hair gel; and it explains why Snape doesn't use hair care products when he so clearly needs them (which is also an amusing thought). Though I do have to say that “Fleamont” is a bit weird as a name.

Nonetheless, if I had to guess, I'd have to say it's probably because they are characters who never actually existed (writing-wise) before Madam Rowling's decision to reveal them as James' parents, when Dorea Black had already been an established character linked to both the Blacks and the Potters. With that, it simply feels as if she was aware of the fans' speculations and wrote that bit specifically to throw them out of the loop.

Also, “Euphemia” is a nice name, so no protests from me on that front.

Charlus and Dorea were very much not disowned from the Black Tree (an action that would have been taken had they been the ones to do it, especially considering Alphard was disowned for giving him money)

Why were people so insistent that James's parents were Charlus and Dorea despite the evidence? (there's more than what I listed, but I don't feel like hunting right now.)

Personally, I quite like the new Potters. They are a blank slate, it will be interesting to see what people come up with for them. (Like James and Harry's hair being a side-effect of Monty's Sleakeazy testing)

****** I think it was mostly because of lack of alternative, in this case. Sort of like some people resort to calling Hermione's parents “Dan” and “Emma”, only quite a bit less cringe-worthy than that one. Because really, with how small the wizarding world had been presented as, lack of actual names was very likely treated by many as lack of actual people; and I guess I can understand the sentiment even if I do not share the feelings behind the choice of theirs.

Also, I like your idea about their hair being a result of that. It would make sense, I guess, and is fairly amusing. Heck, let's go further with that one: considering the warning about the redheads on the Sleakeasy, what if all the Potters before that had red hair too and it turning black /and/ messy was a result of the testing?

And that would also make dealing with Voldemort a family problem: the man has no hair to sell him hair care products, after all. And yes, I am jesting.

**** Well, first of all, men could still be carriers. But even if they couldn't, Fleur could still be part-veela.

A full veela marries a human husband, then they have a 1/2 veela daughter (Apolline) who marries a human husband. Apolline and her human husband have two daughters, both of whom are 1/4 veela.

******** The entire series is an example of it. He's unreliable because he doesn't have all the information, and doesn't always understand what he sees.

For example, pick one of the times they were doing a "The whole school hates Harry" plot (er, 2,3,4,5...) That description is magnified by the fact that he's perceiving it.

If someone told one of those scenes from the perspective of, say Lupin, Lupin would be focusing on other things, and maybe only notice Harry glaring at Malfoy once or whatever.

Harry is an unreliable narrator. We are going by what Harry /thinks/ he knows. He is making an assumption, as I very much doubt he put any effort into researching Veela after seeing them, and thus knows nothing.

**** Not necessarily.

Veela take their roots in the slavic Vila (or Samodiva, or however else you'd want to call it), which are basically fairy-like (in appearance) spirits of deceased maidens that were too frivolous to depart in peace and thus remained after death. They do have an affinity for fire, can blind men by cursing them to be attracted to the Vila doing the curse so much that they ignore everything else, and are capricious so they might do that or might instead warn people about bad things coming as they see those. So they might have drowned at sea, but they also might have not.

Oh, and that also explains where Vila (or Veela) come from, if not from children borne to other Vila or Veela. They just do happen.

** I don't remember what story it was in, but when Harry got to Hogwarts he was getting freaked out by all the nice people. When he got to Snape he relaxed and thought "Oh good, somebody hates me. That's much more familiar."

Following that line, though it would be completely contrary to cannon, I like to think that Harry barely bats an eye at the shit spewing out of Snape and Malfoy's collective mouth, but can't handle compliments to save his life.
