** I'm going to be completely honest with my criticism.

#+begin_quote
  A Family in the Making.
#+end_quote

Capitalize the title that way. Also, work on your grammar in the summary. If your grammar isn't correct in the summary, I'm going to assume your story is worse off.

#+begin_quote
  Two Potters roam the halls of Hogwarts. One is the family heir, preparing to battle Voldemort, and the other doesn't know she is one, but when old secrets come out, they must deal with the consequences. The fate of the wizarding world rests on it.
#+end_quote

FTFY

#+begin_quote
  They, however, held on to all the little nuggets of wisdom until it could be adequately .
#+end_quote

Adequately what?

#+begin_quote
  Ullaog, The Goblin in charge
#+end_quote

'The Goblin' doesn't need to be capitalized. Neither of the words do.

#+begin_quote
  Astoria
#+end_quote

If you want to mark the changes of perspective, at least bold it or something. Add a horizontal line. Something. The normal formatted names are a bit jarring.

#+begin_quote
  The Dinner was a tense affair,
#+end_quote

Dinner isn't capitalized. Also, end that with a period, not a comma. Start the part after the comma as a new sentence. It reads better.

#+begin_quote
  "Yes, father?"Astoria
#+end_quote

Needs to be a space between her name and the part before.

#+begin_quote
  She felt a bit excited, father had been training her sister to take over the family businesses and he was always working, she rarely got to spend time with him.
#+end_quote

Rewrite this. An example: "She felt a bit excited. On top of always working, father had been taking time to train her sister to take over the family business; she rarely got to spend time with him."

#+begin_quote
  "Your mother was a fine woman. Beautiful, Intelligent and Kind but
#+end_quote

Unnecessary capitalization.

#+begin_quote
  she did make mistakes and o e of them
#+end_quote

one.

#+begin_quote
  They impassive mask that Orion wore broke as his most closely held slipped away to the person that it would hurt the most and he could not do to stop it.
#+end_quote

What? I've no idea what you're trying to say here after '/that Orion wore broke/.' Rewrite the entire sentence.

#+begin_quote
  She made a mistake. I big one but that mistake led to your birth, But that doesn't change anything Astoria.
#+end_quote

Replace that /I/ with an /A/. A big one, not I big one. The '/But/' isnt meant to be capitalized.

#+begin_quote
  Astoria nodded numbly; she could feel the effect a calming potion wash over her.
#+end_quote

Rewrite. She could feel the effect /of/ a calming potion wash over her.

#+begin_quote
  The next ten minutes was like a dream, she was numb to all words of assurance and sadness, her parents spoke. She barely heard them, she felt betrayed,
#+end_quote

Rewrite. Example: "The next ten minutes were like a dream. She was numb. She barely heard father's words of assurance. She felt betrayed. She had been brought up as if she was a Greengrass, and now she wasn't one. She had been lied to for her whole life.

#+begin_quote
  She didn't remember when her father had ended the meeting but she had found herself walking to her room, she heard her sister trailing behind her.
#+end_quote

Rewrite. Example: "She couldn't remember when her father had ended the meeting, but she found herself walking to her room, her sister trailing behind her.

She barely heard Daphne's soft voice. "I always wondered..." Daphne began, glancing at Astoria with a soft smile on her face, "why you had less magical talent than a normal Greengrass. I had feared that my bloodline was weakening but clearly that is not the case."

#+begin_quote
  Astoria ignored barb, Compared to Daphne's usual taunts it was almost tame but the smile had surprised her, the last time she had seen her smile was when Daphne had returned from her first year in Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

Astoria ignored /the/ barb. You missed a word again. Proofreading man. Do it. The next sentence also needs to be rewritten. Example: "Astoria ignored the barb. Compared to Daphne's usual taunts, it was almost tame. The smile had surprised her however. The last time she had seen her smile was when Daphne had returned from her first year in Hogwarts."

I didn't feel like reading the rest.

*** Whoa, this hurts but I truly deserve it. A lot of mistakes slipped through and I just didn't notice them in my rush to get the fic out, I messed up. Thank you for your advise, the line by line breakdown showed me some of the numerous flaws in my writing. Appreciate it.

**** No problem.

I didn't intend for it to hurt, but sometimes us writers need that kinda thing. If it makes you feel better, it was really just the grammar and sentence structure stuff that bugged me. That stuff is the easiest to fix.

Your story is still too short for me to say if it's interesting or anything, but feel better in the fact that I don't think your story/premise is trash or anything. Being told your creativity/idea/story telling skills suck hurts a lot more than simply your grammar, haha.

And your writing will only get better from now on. Your reviews are still positive (well, I only read 2 of them) and any story with a Harry/Daphne pairing will usually get plenty of attention, plenty of good things said, and likely plenty of constructive criticism to help you improve. As much as it sucks, writers do need the criticism.

** I only gave it a brief skim since I'm really not a fan of the premise. You're also having to deal with some strange maths. I'd had to explain this before but fanfiction is weird, in a normal story we only know what you tell us. In fanfiction we know everything unless you tell us otherwise or your fic is really original. What you're having to deal with here is not only a premise that I'm not a fan of an I suspect it won't be a lot of people's cup of tea but the events that led to your story happened when the Potters were in hiding or dealing with their own son. Not really seeing when this could have happened. This is unless you tell us otherwise anyway and you haven't. That can be recovered from but it takes good writing or else your readership is already sceptical.

*** Bad maths on my part, I think I have to postpone the hiding to Dec 1980 and fix the birth date of Astoria somewhere in June 1981. That should work. I don't mind people not liking my premise; people have different tastes.\\
My main focus is own improving my writing style. Thank you for your advise. Hopefully I will some day write something you like. ☺️
