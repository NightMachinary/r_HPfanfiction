Like lots of unique and interesting teaching methods, field trips, or extremely powerful magic/inventions

Edit: if you choose to take this as a prompt, let us know :)


** "Welcome to Year 5 of Defence Against the Dark Arts! This year, I will not be teaching you directly. Instead, you will need to meet in secret to teach yourselves---and I'll be trying to uncover your meetings. If I catch you, you will fail my class and won't get to take the OWL. If you don't practice, you won't fail my class, but you won't pass the OWL.

"However, I may issue pardons to some of those I catch---typically to the first ones to turn in the rest of their group---letting them take the OWL anyway. But those taking that approach should keep in mind that just because I pardoned you doesn't mean that your groupmates are going to forgive you: not getting yourself incapacitated before the exams is on you.

"Now, some of you have called this approach 'cruel', 'abusive', and 'harmful', but this is how we learned it, back in the day, and we turned out just fine!"
