I'm not wanting something so much about a middle aged Harry with grown kids, but more of a teen/young adult Harry raising Teddy or some other child while struggling to balance parenthood with the other plot excitement.

NO HET.

To possibly make this more difficult, I really don't want any het stories unless it's the greatest love story you've ever read. (A completely in the past het relationship that got Harry the kid is fine, just no current het.) Gen or slash would be best.

Any suggestions?

Abandoned, but still good, imo.

*** Ha thanks! That's actually one of my faves. I've unfortunately exhausted the trope where Harry goes back in time and raises Tom because I love the idea so much, yet there are so few well-written stories in that niche.

**** I think theres a dirth of fics where Harry goes back and actually kills Riddle. Something like linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7774132/1/Oops]]).

  Go back to the beginning, that was the plan. Stop Voldemort on the cusp of becoming a dark lord, stop him before he created his first horcrux and change history before it could be written. That was the plan, only Harry made a mistake.

** There's linkffn(rewriting history by tiro) where a young Harry raises Severus. Not het. Someone else recommended it in another thread a bit ago and I think I finished it a few days ago. I really liked the character development, just not the very very end of it.

  Whenever Harry does something drastic, he always ends up in a strange situation. Time-travel-fic.

**** No problem! The pacing seemed a little weird, it felt like a longer story than it was, but certainly not in a bad way. I was just really surprised at the word count when I looked at it.
