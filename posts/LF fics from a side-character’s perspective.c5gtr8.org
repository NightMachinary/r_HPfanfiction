I just finished reading Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent, and I really enjoyed reading a fic from a (female) side-character's perspective. I also really enjoyed The Changeling last time I read through that.

For one, it's just good to have something a bit different, considering how often I end up reading fics from Harry's perspective. Seeing Harry as a character rather than the narrator is really compelling to me, for some reason.

I also just enjoy getting to know new characters, within a setting that I already know and enjoy.

So, what fics might deliver that kind of thing?


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/136245][we must unite inside her walls or we'll crumble from within]] is a series of oneshot character studies from the POVs of various female side and background characters. The events are mostly canon, other than some post-DH "what happens after" stuff.

** You can straight continue on another Daphne Greengrass' story (and don't worry, she is as far as possible from the Lady Greengrass as possible, if you dislike this type of the Haphne trope as much as I do), linkffn(Daphne Greengrass and the 6th Year From Hell by WhiskeyTangoFoxtrot;Daphne Greengrass and the 7th Year From Hell by WhiskeyTangoFoxtrot). And don't worry, it is *VERY* different from The Importance of Intent, but it still provides that third person outside experience.

** Consider Wind Shear linkffn(12511998). POV bounces around a lot with Bellatrix, Cygnus Black, Charlus Potter, Voldemort, Moody, Dumbledore and Harry. Even scenes with Harry aren't necessarily from from his POV. The first scene is Harry vs proto-Death Eaters from Bellatrix's POV.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  What's a nice Jewish boy like Anthony doing at Hogwarts? Well, for starters, his name isn't really Anthony. Winner of the Fanfiction Booker's Prize 2014. Year One complete.
