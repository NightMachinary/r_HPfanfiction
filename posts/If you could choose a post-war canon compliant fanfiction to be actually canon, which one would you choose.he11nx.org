#+begin_quote
  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

** If you don't count Cursed Child (which you shouldn't) I would say linkao3(turn by saras_girl) because I love it and it does happen after 19 years later.

  One good turn always deserves another. Apparently.

** If you forget the epilogue and the cursed child, as in, Harry and Ginny don't happen, then...

At your service by Faith Wood

such a great mystery, it felt like I was still reading HP. it's eight year, so they are also at school still, just after Voldy is dead. not sure if she disregarded Hinny or if she just made them break up though, so not very sure how canon compliant that is. (the fic is Drarry).

I just. really. hate. the. epilogue.

** None of them, because there's no good way to do post-war canon compliant fic that doesn't run into JKR's own bad fanfic.
