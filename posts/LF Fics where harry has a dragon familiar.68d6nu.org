Any other fics in that vain would be good to


** That one you vaguely remember is Bobmin's first HP/Pern crossover (that I can never remember the name of), though it is less of a familiar-wizard thing and more of a partnership.

  Harry befriends the dragon in the first task, and this makes all the difference. Watch as Harry rebels against the ministry, forms a bond with a dragon the likes of which hasn't been seen in centuries, and goes up against Voldemort! And he might just fall in love along the way... some Dumbles bashing, temporarily bad Ron, and Harry/Hermione/Luna for the pairing!
