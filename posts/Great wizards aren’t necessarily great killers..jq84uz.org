I have been thinking about the down sides of spells. I was thinking that maybe wizards rely on them two much, and a fic that includes this premise would be pretty cool.

1. Many spells can be countered. Which means they are, relatively slow, almost certainly slow enough to be dodged. Bullets would be better.
2. Many spells are accompanied by a bright light and noise. Arrows, throwing knives, etc might be more effective.

Now don't get me wrong. I love Harry Potter and I think the magic is awesome. However I also think it is fallible and that in some scenarios other methods might be more effective. For example in close quarters Voldemort wouldn't be able to beat someone like Bruce Lee. (Assuming Bruce Lee could see the spell.) And extremely long ranges wizards could loose to muggle snipers. Now I believe magic has its place, but ,when it comes to fighting, supplementing it with other methods of killing would make it immeasurably more effective.

If anyone knows about any fics that do this I would like to hear about them. If anyone starts writing a fic that does this please let me know.
