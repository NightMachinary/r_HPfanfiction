Idea for an Auror procedural story.

Just to preface, I'm heavily into writing all different kinds of things. It's a passion of mine.

I recently had the idea to write a bunch of short stories about an Auror who is employed to hunt down criminals or dark wizards. However, I'm struggling with a few aspects and wanted to have community collaborative talks to see if any of you lovely people had some better ideas.

~ I wasn't sure how to structure it. I was thinking either having stories that are separate with separate cases, while having an underlying plot that interlinks them, or having each story be completely separate but add character development and bring recurring characters.

~ I figured I would set it in America to start out, as he/she is working for MACUSA. Maybe have them take up cases other places later on?

~ as this is a fan work, I don't want to include any characters previously set in the universe. I actually wanted to make this completely new and fresh, while also making it darker and grittier, similar to normal police work or procedurals.

If you guys have any ideas or want to help in any way let me know! Like I said, this is just a fun project that I wanted to take on to express my love for the Wizarding World using the talents that I have. Thank you for any input!


** Personally, I'd prefer completely separate and character-focused (we don't have enough character-focused works in the fandom, IMO), unless you have a particular underlying plot you're passionate about - though I'd say a plot-focused story would probably make the transition to global scale easier later on ("You found the MacGuffin and uncovered the evil plot, come join the ICW auror branch and help us hunt down the perpetrators!").

I like the idea of an auror's caseload for a frame story - do you have an idea of how you're going to portray that 'case by case' nature? eg. Is it a series of verbal case debriefs to a superior officer, are we reading the auror's after-action reports, is the audience the standard omnipresent witness, etc?

I have no particular opinion on having only OCs in the series - I've seen good OCs and bad OCs alike - though I would say that the occasional cameo by a character we know might be a fun treat to draw new interest (eg. if they need to solve a case in England, the auror department there might throw up a few familiar faces; or maybe they meet Hermione at an ICW conference and have a brief chat exchanging ideas, etc).

About the only thing I'd actively request to be in your work would be at least one CSI-style pun, complete with sunglasses. Because how can it be a Law Enforcement story without one? :)
