Also were Everyone permanently Magical enhances themselves and uses magic to change there appearance like changing there Hair,Eye and Skin to colours that would make Tonks proud Like Purple, pink,blue Orange, ect or there House colours during Quidditch matches(or like Narcissa Malfoy who Obviously changes her Hair Colour to the Malfoy Hair colour.) and student are encouraged to use magic to do things like make there rooms bigger and magical enhance there beds to make them better and stuff like that.( I have always been of the opinion that Dumbledore transfigurs or conjures his own Robes in books considering some of the things he was said to have on them).

Like I am Sure They would not be able to use magic to temporarily enhance themselves during Tests but permanent Enhancements would be fine and that shouldn't stop them from Using magic To enhance themselves while studying to do things like memorise things faster.

and were Classes are a bit more interconnected were in Herbology (and Care of magical creatures) student use the plants(and animal parts) they grow/collect as ingredients in potions class and Student don't just pour potions they make down the sink but actually bottle up the Potions they make in class and actually use them, like say they learn to make a Wideye Potion that they then use to stay away in Astronomy were they learn about how the movement of Celestial body's can effect other magic like potions. were in later years they use what they learn in there Defence against the Dark arts Class to go into the forbidden Forest to collect Ingredient for Potions that they then use to Enhance themselves so they can do better in other classes which in turn helps them do better at potions as a feedback loop. were it is Encouraged for Students to use Divination to to try and Predict the Questions that will be on there End of year test,O.W.L and N.E.W.T tests. or To use magic to Scry into the Past to watch Stuff that they learn about in History of Magic.(were Divination is almost used as a magical search engine were student student can use in to predict what mark they will get on essay so they can decide if they want to rewrite it or like spell check)

It would also be interesting To See some Conflict between Muggle raised and Magical raised student with the Muggle raised thinking that it is Cheating.

*** Thanks.

And yeah I just want more daily life magic because I feel like in canon the students were being actively discouraged from useing magic even before umbridge came along in fifth year and did it more blatantly.

And in a lot of fanfiction the only magic that people seem to remember exists is combat magic. Which is quite boring
