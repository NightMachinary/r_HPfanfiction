You reccomend an unloved and underrated unique fic to me, I do the same to you~! Start!

I'll reccomend it by replying in the comments.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17437508/chapters/41055629][Between Ruin and Salvation]] by commas_and_ampersands isn't the right fic for anyone looking for a happy ending, but it's still wonderful in its own bleak way.

*** I'm perfectly fine with no happy ending. As long as the story is good.

â€‹

If you're looking for a long fic with a good plot, the here it is! It's not one of those long fics that could be improved by shortenting it, and it's got the most interesting plot ever!

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate]])

It would be far more popular, perhaps the kind that is often reccomended like The many deaths of Harry Potter, but it's ron centric and that puts people off meaning it doesn't have many people reading it.

Even if you hate ron, you can't hate him here because his character development went entirely differently. This story has elements of horror and thriller, but it focuses more on people. Ron is not a seer, something far more sinister and beyond them all is going on.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Faith and Understanding]] by Lethe Laguz

This is the chronicle of Ginny's friendship with Luna, with Ginny's musings therein.

It's funny, it's heartfelt, it's goofy, it's sweet. Ginny and Luna argue and tease and confide in one another.

And it has my favorite passage from any Harry Potter fanfic ever. The closings lines are absolutely beautiful:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

*** Oh I love Luna and Ginny! They are my 2 favourite characters (especially Luna!). I'm having lockdown blues and I miss my freinds so this fic is really going to cheer me up. I really want the lockdown to end, it's terrible.

I'll reccomend this fic : Fate - linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate]])

Not many people read it because the fact that it is ron-centric puts them off. But, it's the best story I've had the pleasure to read! It's got an interesting plot with a Ron that has completely different character development.

It is not a seer ron. It's far more sinister than that. But although it's plot is the most interesting I've ever seen, it's focus is on people. On people and humans and their goodness and their selfishness and all other traits that cause both good and bad.

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

A good, non peggy sue time travelling one shot that shows Harry attempting to fix things with a time turner and ending up with the worst possible ending. That ending hurt, it's not usually how people end up ruining the timeline.
