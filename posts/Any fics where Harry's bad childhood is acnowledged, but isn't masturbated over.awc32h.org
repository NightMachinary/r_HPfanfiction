Just curious. It feels a bit overdone and frankly, while I'm all for stories dealing with a damaged character, I'm not too keen on wallowing in that ocean of angst and misery.


** linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon; Across the Universe by mira mirth)

The second is fairly angsty, but the childhood thing is on the side and it's never discussed in any detail.

I know there are a good number more out there, I just can't think of them at the moment. I might update later.

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.
