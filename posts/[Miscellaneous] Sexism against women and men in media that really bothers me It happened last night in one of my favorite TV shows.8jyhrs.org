** What does this have to do with Harry Potter, Harry Potter characters, or Harry Potter fan fiction?? Not a fucking thing, so why is it here??

*** I marked it as miscellaneous. I'm sorry, I just wanted the opinions of fellow writers on narrative sexism. It was apparently a mistake to do.

*** Okay. I'm sorry. I thought that was exactly what miscellaneous meant: that you could post things not really about the harry potter universe. Because it's miscellaneous.

*** Because I marked it as miscellaneous, because I wanted to get the opinions of fellow writers - people who are knowledgeable and talented in the art of constructing a story, tropes, characters, and issues of representation and sexism and other relevant things - and because you're mostly all my friends so I needed to vent it to my friends.

Do you have anything constructive or relevant to say about the issue?

*** I wouldn't call it misogynistic. I'd call it progress. Better. Treat women like men, including when it comes to violent fight scenes and dangerous situations. Don't just let men die in a fire rescue scene and get the woman and the kid out. Maybe let the woman and kid die and the man lives. It's equal treatment, and I do it in my stories because that's how it should be.

***** Well, in any case, I'm going to keep trying to overcome it with sheer force of will. :) Because sexism in media should always be overcome, or at least consciously minimized if people can't really manage it.
