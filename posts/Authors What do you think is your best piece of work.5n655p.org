*** Interesting I would have said : Pureblood Princess > Letters > Vitam Paramus > Quidditch World Cup

Based off of the catchyness of the plot points and the writing mechanics always seemed pretty good right across the board. Why did you rate your fics in that particular order?

**** I almost flipped Princess and Vitam Paramus. But in the end I felt like Vitam Paramus deals with a more difficult concept and subject matter and I liked the execution of it.

While Princess probably appeals to a much wider audience than VP, I felt that VP is just better written technically than Princess. And at the end of the day, I like it more.

I detest Letters for a wide variety of reasons that to go in to would end up being longer than most chapters I write. Without being too 'woe is me' or anything, Letters was written at a very low point for me and a lot of what I did during it reflects and reminds me of that.

So mostly I hate Letters because it represents an abject failure on my own writing style and ability and a part of me that I'd rather put behind me. I also think that it is my worst written story, technically speaking.

**** As much as I love Pureblood Princess (especially the epilogue, which I've reread multiple times), I personally like how simple the story is with Vitam Paramus. It's written, technically, amazingly and the fact that it's a slower story, that focuses on the characters more than anything, is what makes me love it so much.

Plus, the Quidditch is the best written on the entirety of fanfiction.net, haha.

** I both love and hate my own stories for so many different reasons. On one hand, I hate them because they are a reminder of how bad I was a mere few months ago when I started writing. On the other hand I love them because they remind me of how much I've improved and how much dedicated effort I've put into them. I doubt I could ever rate them on any scale objectively, but I'll give it a go for my completed one-shots.

** I don't think I can muster a concise answer for this.

For starters, I immensely enjoyed writing everything that I've posted on FFN to date. Some stories/chapters/passages were as frustrating and challenging as they were fun, but the point stands. So I can't say that I'm more proud of one over the other.

I guess if I was to rate by overall reception, then it would be:

Untitled Tome/Squared Circle AU > Fruits of Ennui > Compendium of Hogwash

That some readers actually find Fruits of Ennui funny will always tickle me in a special +place+ way, however :)

** See, I can't generalize quite so much. Everything I've posted and left up has a certain charm for me, even 'We Lost', if for only having a really concise summary of Les Mis to compare against Hermione's situation.

So, I have favorite passages, favorite chapters where things came together in a way I feel proud about:

- Holly Evans Chapters 42: Rumble Rumble and 43: Fresh Snow.\\
- The opening five chapters of Holly Polter.
- Of course, the Dementor chapters of Mad Ideas (1,3, & 6).

These all have a combination of good imagery, comedy and sentiment that achieve the style I would like to convey. I'd like to get better at action, but these aren't horrid examples of that, either.

** I'm still deeply in love with linkao3(starving by hexmionegranger) because it quite honestly just took off and basically wrote itself in less than a week and it's kind of ridiculous (modern au ft. surprise mafia involvement? what on earth?) but yeah, I have a big old soft spot for it.

I think my favourite is still linkao3(off course by hexmionegranger) - it was what pulled me back into fanfiction writing this past summer and even rereading it I'm proud of myself. Every email that I get that's like "wow! you did a really good job portraying what it feels like to be questioning your sexuality" makes my heart grow because I wrote it all from my own place of knowledge and I love that it resonates with people.

My older one shots are very cringe worthy. This Christmas a whole bunch of people found & commented on an old one shot I'd written years ago and like....... I just wanted to shake all of them and be like MY DUDES PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS TO YOURSELVES I LEFT IT UP FOR POSTERITY PLEASE I HAVE WRITTEN MORE AND BETTER THINGS STOP NOW. So those would be lowest on my rating list.

I'm in a weird place with my current wip linkao3(don't take this sinner by hexmionegranger) just because I am still constantly nervous every time I post a chapter that people are going to be like "??? you wrote 80k+ of this? what the fuck were you thinking? this plot is so dumb I can't believe it?" and Dramione shippers can be /rabid/ and I've already had someone be like "this isn't good because there's no rape" which like? What? So I like it, but I'm just really hesitant about the whole thing, but I'm getting good feedback and it's 98% written so I'm still posting. I think I'll feel better once it's all out, because I'm so worried about disappointing people with my plot, but once it's all posted at least there's nothing that can be done.

** Editing and rewriting A Friend to Government Pigs during my last year of college got me back into writing fanfiction. There was a lot in there that I was proud to have written at the time as a high school senior, but there were things I wanted to fix and make the story stronger. Granted my lead is an unknown canon character and her primary supporting cast is quirky OCs, but still at it's core it's a bit of a dark fic that touches a lot on wartime PTSD and depression. I wanted to explore part of the postwar world through someone who was not tied into the series events, but had done heroic actions of her own and how her life was changed and altered through those choices.

In order of top three favorites : "A Friend to Government Pigs"> "Lucy Weasley and the Mask of Gold"> "Terminology"
