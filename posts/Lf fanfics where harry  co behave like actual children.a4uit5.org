most fanfics have Harry & co behaving like kid politicians or something, acting like their 20 something when they're only 11. The only one i can think of that does it well is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12703694][Harry Potter: Geek of Magic]] , where it's quite obvious these are children. I suppose by “behaving like children” I mean they rush to conclusions, they say stupid things that only a kid would say, they don't censor their thoughts, ect. i know not all children are like this, but im just tired of fanfics where they all regularly have political talks.


** The most impressive recent example I can think of is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487/chapters/31624473][the dogfather by hollimichele]]. The children are believably childish, even if a bit wiser than their canon selves. It all seems to reflect what a bit of determined good parenting can achieve.

** I think linkffn(the best revenge by arsinoe de blassenville) does the best job I've seen characterizing Harry and co as innocent, curious kids.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

*** That was pretty toxic. Please see Rule 8:

#+begin_quote
  Request threads are for recommendations. Fic Searches are for finding a specific fic. Make a discussion thread if you want to express your opinions about the thing being requested. Flair accordingly.

In other words, don't criticize or questions people's requests in a thread solely for requests.

**** I'm not sure I understand that rule. I don't especially want to clutter the subreddit with a post dedicated solely to expressing my opinion that it's better for children in fanfics to be unrealistically mature than realistically immature. If it's all the same to you, I'll just apologize for the infraction and get on with my day. I do take issue with being accused of being toxic though. That was not my intent, and I don't think my opinion is harmful.
