** I'd love it if it were Neville or Hermione. Neville selling them out would be a nice parallel to Peter (you know, with less on the line). He's afraid and he was pressured by Umbridge. Harry and the others are furious with him, though Harry is conflicted in seeing how ostracized Neville becomes and wondering if it's right to hold onto his anger over it. Talking to Sirius doesn't help because Sirius equates him to Wormtail and thinks Harry should have nothing to do with him.

Despite everything, Neville is quick to come with them to the Ministry and help Harry. He keeps the SNEAK on his face until after the Department of Mysteries battle, where he does what Peter didn't and redeemed himself.

And Hermione because I like the idea of her own secret jinx backfiring on her. Though I don't really know how it would work in context.

*** Hermione tells her parents and the jinx activates?

I would be curious what would happen if Luna told her daddy and the jinx activated.

**** I never thought about this before but it brings up an interesting question.

How did that charm work exactly? Cause obviously someone told Seamus after the Quibbler story broke in order to bring him in. So clearly talking to someone about the DA who wasn't in the list isn't enough to activate the jinx. Is it only for authority figures? Does it go off of intent?

***** It could be intent, or at least to Umbridge.

As for Seamus, I reckon it was more Dean took him to the meeting directly so it didn't count. Or maybe he added his name to the list off-page, so to speak.
