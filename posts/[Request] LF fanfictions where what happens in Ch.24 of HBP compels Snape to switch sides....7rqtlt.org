Canon defines the "Unforgiveables" as unforgivable, but Harry gets away with using them (and I don't want to see him in Azkaban, don't get me wrong), while everyone condemns the Death Eaters/Draco for using them. I simply... well, I want to hold Harry to a higher standard, I guess. And if Draco deserves punishment, then so does Harry, in my mind - and it's not as if there aren't extenuating circumstances on Draco's side either. He steps one toe out of line, Voldemort will take it out on his parents. Besides, Dumbledore too wanted to save Draco.

I don't know. I guess I feel that Draco is the underdog in this situation. Sorry, I can't put it any better into words.

Draco was angry and desperate, but his situation was not Harry's fault. They duelled with spells like the LegLocker Jinx before Draco escalated the situation trying to use an Unforgivable. I guess what I mean is that Draco is the instigator of this escalation, whereas Harry reacts to other people's action in kind. Which doesn't make Harry's actions right, but makes them more understandable to me.

All good points, and I can see where you're coming from! - After thinking a bit more about it, I think for me, two more points come into play:

1. Harry being foolish enough to use a spell marked as 'for enemies' without ever having tried it out first in a safe environment to see what it does. At one point, he contemplated using it on... that Quidditch player guy he can't stand, who became a rival to Ron, just for the guy basically irritating the hell out of him. - Now I'm curious to see how readers would have reacted to /that/ if it had happened (but this is only as a sidenote).

2. Harry confronting Draco, while the latter is confiding in Myrtle, of all people, and while he was /crying/ wasn't smart either. In a way, Harry instigated the whole thing by doing something so foolish. How did he think Draco would react he's caught in such a vulnerable moment?

Does that make sense? :)

2. Harry didn't confront Draco while he was confiding in Myrtle on purpose.

   #+begin_quote
     „And Harry realised, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot, that Malfoy was crying -- actually crying -- tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into the cracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his shoulder. Malfoy wheeled round, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulled out his own.“
   #+end_quote

He was keeping an eye on Malfoy because he thought Malfoy as up to something nefarious - which he was. He didn't know beforehand that Malfoy was crying, didn't know he was confiding in Myrtle, and Malfoy saw him before Harry could decide what to do.

I mean it makes sense, in a way, that you argue Harry instigated that duel by spying on Malfoy, but then... didn't Malfoy again instigate Harry spying on him by becoming a Death Eater and everything that followed that? Harry didn't spy on Malfoy the years before, he had a very good reason for acting as he did.

Well, in any case. You're right. He couldn't have helped being seen by Draco while spying on him (in the book). I guess what it comes down to is that I'm irritated by people applying double standards, because Harry is Harry, and Draco is.. that little Death Eater slimeball.

Urgh, sorry. I guess at this point, if I tried to keep on discussing this, it would only end up with us going in circles. But thank you, you've given me a lot to ponder on :)

******************** Oh yeah, that happens to me a lot too. I confuse the books with the movies or fanfic scenes... one last note: I think people are in general more forgiving when it comes to Harry because he has many redeeming qualities and is overall a guy who sacrifices his own wellbeing to help others. Then you look at Draco: he was delighted in CoS when slytherin's monster went after muggleborn students, he tries to get Buckbeak killed in PoA even though his injury wasn't as bad as he pretended and he was only injured only because he disregarded his teacher's orders, in Book 6 he almost kills Katie and Slughorn, he continually shows to be an unkind and racist person. Yes, he was raised in an environment that fostered such behavior, but so were Sirius and Harry and other characters. The books are very much about how choices matter more than circumstances outside our control, and Draco continually shows to make the wrong ones. I don't think that he can't be redeemed or that he isn't to some extent a victim, but I think when trying to understand why people are more forgiving when it comes to Harry, you have to take into account how much Draco revels in his believed superiority and cruelty for almost six years.

I do. It's not that I'm ignoring it or want to give him a free pass. But I can't help but feel that the deck isn't exactly stacked in his favor. His family and friends are Death Eaters (or aspiring ones), even Slytherins who have nothing to do with Voldemort are lumped together with those that are, at Hogwarts, and considered bogeymen by their fellow students, and the one person who is looking out for Draco's best interests can't really do anything, because Snape needs to stay in Voldemort's good graces.

But I guess having all these complicated feelings in regard to the HP series speaks for its quality - nothing worse than a book that doesn't make you ponder things, imho.

********************** I see your point, but two things:

1. At what point is Draco accountable for his actions, instead of a victim? (I don't mean the Unforgivable necessarily, which troubled me the least because it was a knee-jerk reaction in a desperate situation, but the rest of his behaviour.)

2. Yes, there is a certain bias at Hogwarts, though I do think that fanon often exaggerates just how negative Slytherins are viewed in society. I mean... Slughorn was the Head of Slytherin, and it didn't hurt his reputation any. Influential people like the Minister for Magic don't exhibit any negative bias towards members of Slytherin and work with them happily. I hope this conversation isn't getting tiresome for you... Sometimes I enjoy talking about all things Harry Potter a little too much, I guess.

*********************** 1. He is always accountable for his own actions and choices, from a moral POV. As far as the law is concerned, I do hope that wizards too have something like a Protection of Young Persons Act, though. I don't think he should be punished for his involvement with Voldemort to the same degree as adult Death Eaters. - What I said in my last post was more of a case of 'my heart goes out to him' than logic speaking, I guess.

2. ...I really don't think Fudge being wrapped around Lucius' little finger is a good example XD - There is actually a lot of bias. The first thing Harry hears about Slytherins is Hagrid saying something along the lines of that everyone from that house turned out to be evil... Plus, since the books are written from Harry's POV, everyone besides Draco who belongs to that particular house is described as ugly/brutal looking... And stuff. I can't think of the whole list right now, but the bias in the books really raised my hackles.

Not at all! I wasn't online much, back when the books were new/still released. I totally missed the hype, so I'm happy to have found someone willing to talk about HP topics at length :)

************************ 1. Yeah... I don't think he should be punished to the same extent either. I mean, in the beginning, he merrily participated in the whole thing - he was proud to be a Death Eater, proud to be given a task, and eager to help achieve Voldemort's goals. And I don't think he had any illusions about what that meant for muggleborns, he just didn't anticipate that things could turn out bad for him, a pureblooded Malfoy, too. Only when things turned bad for him and his immediate family did he regret his choices. Which doesn't make him the most sympathetic character, in my opinion. His heart didn't go out for anybody else.

2. Hm... Yes, Hagrid. I would argue that he is not the most reliable judge of well... anything. Dragons, Acromantulas... He doesn't seem to perceive the world in the same way other wizards do, and the books make that obvious. About the society as a whole, I don't think it was just Fudge. When Harry and Dumbledore were discredited in OotP it didn't help them that they were Gryffindors, and the general population did not believe them more or Malfoy and other Slytherins less because of their house affiliation.

There certainly is a bias, as is evident in Hagrid and Ron's behaviour, I just think the later books show that after Hogwarts, it doesn't play such an important role anymore. There is no "he's a Slytherin, he must be bad" stigma in the world outside the school, as far as I remember at least...?

I'm glad :) I read the books when they were first released, but I missed the discussion happening around them online.

I think the hilarious thing is that his parents actually sheltered him from the grisly reality of it - not out of shame for their own deeds, but so that he wouldn't endanger them, I think. For a Slytherin, Draco brags a little too openly about disliking muggleborns.

He sees what Slytherins monster does to muggleborn students, and wishes to help it.

There is the scene at the World Cup:

#+begin_quote
  Harry, Ron and Hermione turned sharply. Draco Malfoy was standing alone nearby them, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed. His arms folded, he seemed to have been watching the scene on the campsite through a gap in the trees.

  Ron told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he would never have dared say in front of Mrs Weasley. ‘Language, Weasley,' said Malfoy, his pale eyes glittering. ‘Hadn't you better be hurrying along, now? You wouldn't like her spotted, would you?'

  He nodded at Hermione, and at the same moment, a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite, and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them.

  ‘What's that supposed to mean?' said Hermione defiantly.

  ‘Granger, they're after Muggles,' said Malfoy. ‘D'you want to be showing off your knickers in mid-air? Because if you do, hang around ... they're moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.'

  ‘Hermione's a witch,' Harry snarled.

  ‘Have it your own way, Potter,' said Malfoy, grinning maliciously. ‘If you think they can't spot a Mudblood, stay where you are.'

  ‘You watch your mouth!' shouted Ron. Everybody present knew that ‘Mudblood' was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of Muggle parentage.

  ‘Never mind, Ron,' said Hermione quickly, seizing Ron's arm to restrain him as he took a step towards Malfoy. There came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard. Several people nearby screamed.

  Malfoy chuckled softly. ‘Scare easily, don't they?' he said lazily. ‘I suppose your daddy told you all to hide? What's he up to -- trying to rescue the Muggles?“
#+end_quote

So while he didn't know what it would mean for him to truly be a Death Eater - e.g. the constant threat of death hanging over him and his family, I don't see how he couldn't have known what Voldemort was all about and what he would mean for other people, muggles and muggleborns.

2) Not a fan of the epilogue either... The names of Harry's children... But yeah, what I meant was that there is no example, as far as I can remember, where Slytherins are at a disadvantage because of their sorting after they leave the school. There is a bias, but it seems to play a far bigger role at Hogwarts than outside of it.

*************************** 1) Alright, please don't take this the wrong way, I /do think/ that it's horrible, what was done to that family. I do. But I think that, from Draco's point of view, it was just... well, a 'bad prank.' He watched Muggles being humiliated and injured (though we are never really told if they were, but it can be assumed, and the psychological damage... well, except their memories would get deleted - which is another can of worms to me) and though of it as 'sport'. Not too bad in the greater scheme of things. (Again, I don't agree with this). I don't think he really got what murder/using the Cruciatus on others, oppressing them etc. truly meant, at that point. I think HBP and DH show him slowly realizing what the ideology he was raised with means when put into practice.

At least, that's my reading of the character.

2) I think such a bias existing, and being around it as a person (as a student at Hogwarts) for seven years is bad enough. But no, we do not have canon evidence that Slytherin's are at a disadvantage after leaving the school. - But then again, how could we have, since Harry is telling the story? How would he know/care?

**************************** 1) Hm... Yeah... but I think it tells us a lot about him, that he isn't bothered by what is going on at the Cup, that it is not a wake-up call for him, but that he is able to view it as some kind of "bad prank", nothing too bad.

There is also a scene in HBP where Harry, Ron and Hermione run into Draco at Madam Malkin's, and Malfoy basically demands that Hermione be treated as a second-class citizen (that she, as a muggle-born, shouldn't be able to shop there.)

So while he might not have understood what murder really means (he is appropriately horrified when the muggle studies teacher is murdered in his presence in DH), he enjoys living the "less serious" parts of this ideology.

I don't disagree with the notion that he only realises in HBP and DH what the ideology /really/ means, and I don't think it is too late for him to change, I just disagree that he is some kind of misunderstood victim of circumstance. He goes to Hogwarts, he interacts with muggleborns and half-bloods and other students, he has time to form his own opinions, to start seeing them as people... but he doesn't. So even if he draws a line at torture and murder, I don't think that makes him a good person.

2) That's what I meant earlier, we have canon evidence that tells us they are not perceived negatively: Malfoy, other Slytherins in high positions at the Ministry, OotP where people believe a Slytherin already once accused of Death Eater activity over Dumbledore and Harry, and in a way HBP (Edit): even though Voldemort is back, it's not as if the other three houses suddenly shun the Slytherins as a whole. They are still treated normally.

Read this yesterday, maybe you'll find it interesting too: [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/draco-malfoy]]

It offers a balanced view of Draco, taking into account the impact his parents had on him, and I think JKR also puts into words what I meant:

#+begin_quote
  For all this, Draco remains a person of dubious morality

  Draco was not concealing a heart of gold under all that sneering and prejudice and that no, he and Harry were not destined to end up best friends

That's what I mean. He isn't evil, but he isn't a good person either just because he is not willing to murder and torture. On the other hand, Harry is a good person who sacrifices everything, his life for other people. Which is why people are more willing to forgive him when he makes a wrong decision.

2) Yes, they weren't flaunting it. But the point was how Slytherins are perceived, not how Slytherins-that-are-Voldemort-supporters are viewed. Or maybe I'm not getting your point ;)
