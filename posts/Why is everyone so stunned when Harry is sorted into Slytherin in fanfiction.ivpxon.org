Every fic I read everyone is so shocked about it, why?


** According to Snape, there was a rumour that Voldemort died while trying to kill Harry because Harry was (or, rather, had the potential to become) an even greater Dark wizard.

Him being sorted into Slytherin might have confirmed that rumour to many, what with the House's dark reputation and wizards' general tendency to jump to conclusions.

(Now that I think about it, it could be an interesting idea for a fic: a Slytherin!Harry who /doesn't/ actually want to be a Dark wizard, but everyone assumes otherwise, and his good and even heroic acts are misinterpreted as "hiding his true intentions" and "defeating competition" (we can't have two Dark Lords at the same time, can we?) Harry doesn't like it, of course, but he /does/ privately enjoy the fact that people tend to treat him with respect - no one wants to be on the future Dark Lord's shit list, after all.)

I would read something like that but in most dark Harry fics he sides with Voldemort.

*** I would like to remind you of both Andromeda Tonks and Horace Slughorn. Both were sorted into Slytherin, and while Slughorn was a dick to anyone who wasn't famous or highly skilled, he wasn't a bad person, let alone evil. Andromeda was obviously not an evil person, marrying muggleborn Ted Tonks and got disowned because of it.

**** To be fair, we don't meet those characters until books 6/7 aside from a throwaway line from Sirius. And even then you have to read between the lines for Andromeda as it's not really stated directly. So having 5 books of "Slytherin are all evil racists", then having 2 side characters (I don't think Slughorn counts as a major character) wasn't really enough to stem the sentiment.

**** Andromeda, the one truly good Slytherin, was being booted out of her family and, presumably, polite society, for being who she was and loving whom she loved.

And Slughorn significantly helped Voldemort by keeping shut about the Horcruxes for two or three decades (after it became obvious that he was a monster, definitely after his downfall).

***** Slughorn felt incredibly guilty, and the only reason he never told anyone was so that no one else would try to make a horcrux themselves. He didn't do it with the intention of hurting anyone, just keeping himself alive. I didn't know that having preservation instincts was evil.

****** Slughorn felt guilty, but let's not ignore the fact that if it was known he'd helped Voldemort (and especially how he helped Voldemort), he would lose a lot of reputation and influence. Clearly reputation and influence matter to him almost as much as his personal safety, so letting anyone know about the horcrux(es) would be unthinkable. When a person puts not only their safety but also their personal ambition above the good of the community, they're probably not a particularly good or nice person.

***** “I don't want to read sexual abuse or Harry with evil characters“

is different from

“I don't want to read Harry with a same sex partner”

Is different from “I don't want to read stories where gay people exist.”

I know there's a lot of fucked up shit in fan fiction, but if you mean anything other than the last one I don't think it's fair to lump fucked up pairings with gay relationships. And if you do mean the last one, I think that's even more fucked up.

** The stories have given the impression that house assignment has some correlation with your family. All the characters we (I) know their parent's hogwarts house of, they were sorted in the same house. Draco, for example. The Weasleys. Sirius became the Black sheep for not being in slytherin.

Harry's parents were Gryffindors, so there was a certain expectation that he would join there. Couple that with the stories most children grew up, it only made that expectation more certain.

** I figure it was because of those fantasy novels about Harry that have been in print since he became the boy-who-lived. Even those people who realize it was fiction would have their expectations set for how Harry Potter would really be. And part of that is being some kind of paragon against the Dark Lord. So when he get's put into Slytherin, everyone is shocked that the Boy-Who-Lived isn't what they expected.

On a side note, I thought it would be funny if Harry had an overriding ambition grow in him from the day he was introduced to the magical world. He wants, desires, and has the overriding ambition to make the world's most magically delicious jaffa cake! So the hat put him in Slytherin for his ambition.

** Crack idea:

Harry gets sorted into Slytherin. However, his first interaction with his new housemates unintentionally terrifies them, in a massive misunderstanding (Caphius Caine/Mr Black levels of misunderstanding).

The more he tries to reach out to make friends, the more the misunderstandings grow.

Canon Harry was almost slytherin, the only reason he wasn't because of Hagrid and Draco.

**** No, he really wasn't. Some cunning is expected of a 11 year old child. Him breaking the rules and not being fought is not cunning either, it's called "invisibility cloak". Him going straight to an adventure is also not cunning, thats bravery. Bravery is all and good, but its not a Slytherins trait. Do note that I'm talking what conically happened in his first year. The year authors make most of the changes in Harry's character.
