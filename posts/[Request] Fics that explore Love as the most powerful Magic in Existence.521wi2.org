** Alright, so there is what I'm going to call the 60s Trilogy (because it's all about the power of love [I'm not feeling very witty today])

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Veil of Mystery; Harry Potter and the Ring of Reduction; Phoenix Intuition by semprini). Full disclosure: every time I tried to read Phoenix Intuition I said "fuck that" about 5 sentences in.

** Power the Dark Lord knows not by bennybear linkffn(4196577)

It's not exactly what you are looking for as it does not make 'love magic' a thing however, it shows what love meant in canon and how it could have helped.

  One shot. AU by both means and intentions. Featuring Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco. Special appearance by Severus Snape. It's too serious to be a parody.
