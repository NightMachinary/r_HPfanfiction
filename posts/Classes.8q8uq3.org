I was wondering, what classes would beauxbatons and the others schools would have in comparison to Hogwarts?


** I don't see no reason why they wouldn't have basically the same core classes (beyond the fact that Durmstrang has Dark Arts in place of Defence Against the Dark Arts); it's not like foreign schools don't have the same old History, Maths, P.E., etc.. You could play around with the electives, I suppose; for instance, it wouldn't surprise me if BeauxbÃ¢tons had a Magical Literature class, and the suggestion that it would offer Alchemy more prominently because the Flamels are BeauxbÃ¢tons alumni is a clever one.

** Given Flamel attended it, Beauxbatons ought to have an Alchemy course that is popular enough to remain on offer for the higher years, unlike Hogwarts.

Durmstrang should have a mandatory education in martial magic, as opposed to a dueling club.

Uagadou would have something taught about the differences between casting with and without a wand, with an emphasis on the latter given their traditions.

Mahoutokoro (this is a terrible name, its just means "magic place" in Japanese), well, you'd learn to conjure an entire anime series out of nothing. It's the real secret to how Japan releases so much anime every season. ðŸ˜®

** I figured out a schedule for my Durmstrang!Harry story. I decided to have it a bit more orderly with a set schedule, and with extra teachers so there isn't 100 students in each class. I figure most of the classes would be more or less the same, with some cultural/regional changes.

There were 4 "core" classes in Potions, Charms, Defense, and Transfiguration, as those would be the chosen main magical disciplines. And then each of the core classes would have subclasses/electives, and electives would start from second year and be in 2 year blocks, so you'd have a 2-3 elective block, 4-5 elective block, and 5-6 elective block. That meant you could take a 2-3 elective at sixth year if you wanted, and some electives only had a single block you could take.

For example, Enchanting and Spellcrafting would be two charms electives, with enchanting being available starting from year 2, while spellcrafting being just year 6-7.

Potions would have things like Herbology, Alchemy and Monster Biology as electives. Transfiguration would have Conjuration and Human Transfiguration as electives. Defense would have cursebreaking, monster hunting and duelling as electives.

In addition, there were non-core classes which were stand alone classes, like astronomy and history, as well as standalone electives like divination. And, since I wanted to make the school feel more real, I added in courses like Math and Literature. Those course are all similar to muggle courses, except they would have a magical slant to them. Some of them can have their own electives as well, such as international politics as a history class.

** OWLs and NEWTs appear to be the international norm.

Given this I would expect most of the core courses are similar or nearly identical.

There may be some variations (ex. Beauxbatons may have a specialization on enchantment, Uagadou may teach an advanced form of transfiguration called transmogrification, etc.), but the main fields are probably similar.

Actually, they aren't. Fleur makes a deal about how Beauxbatons has a single exam in their sixth year rather than two exams in 5th and 7th.

**** I stand corrected. Although it is plausible they only take one of the exams (or that's all that is necessary in France).

** Durmstrang seems like the kind of school to teach Warding to me. My reasoning is that the school is obviously in a cold climate (possibly northern Finland, considering the boat in GoF) and seems like a tough place to live. To me, Warding feels like a discipline of magic that requires some power.

I'm not sure where I ever got this from - it may have been the books - but I thought I read somewhere that Fleur was one of the best at Enchanting. This seems like it could fall in line with the more 'delicate' feel of Beauxbatons.

*** Some historical reason, lets not go to the school that produced Voldemort for example. Loyalty to a school, one of the child's parents might have been to a school other than Hogwarts. A personal dislike of the staff at Hogwarts. A chance at international connections. Feeling Dumbledore can't prioritise education with all of the other titles he holds. Disliking the house system, maybe the parent was a Hufflepuff and wouldn't wish being a duffer on his worst enemy. Job taking the parents abroad mean they're relocating away from the UK.
