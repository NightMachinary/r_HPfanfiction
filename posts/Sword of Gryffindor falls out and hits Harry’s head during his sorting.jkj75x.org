***** -Years later in a room with old artifacts in display-

The guide: "And this is the sword of Godric Griffindor. Years ago it fell out of the sorting hat while it was sorting Harry The-Boy-who-Lived and Sword-Charmer Potter. There's great speculation about what happened that day, and we can't be sure what sort of properties the sword had before that moment, though the few Gobblins who deigned talk to us guarantee that no such enchantments where present at the moment of it's manufacture. As it is now, it's been told that whoever wields it is able to understand parseltongue so long as they are holding it, as well as create boils in the skinn of your enemies should they touch you while you're wielding it. There's also speculation that it can shatter the souls of whomever it slashes, but it has never been proved."

(the boils part is because of Harry's Mother's protection)

******* That's actually one of the major plot points in John Brunner's 'Traveler in Black' stories, which were crossed with Harry Potter in linkffn(The Traveler in Black Meets Harry Potter by meteoricshipyards).

The Traveler was tasked with bringing order out of primordial chaos, and every spell/ritual/etc. imposes a little bit of order. This causes magic to become more constrained as time goes by, so wizards of the past were much more capable than currently, and magic will eventually disappear.

******* Pretty sure half of the problem is that Rowling isn't very logical. Like this isn't me being all like ‚ÄòI'm smart and superior' like I'm literally disabled, so I'm intimately familiar with the fact that it can be hard to make a world that makes practical sense when you're not the sharpest tool in the shed.

It's why I enjoy when people who are experts in their given field (eg logistics or civil engineering or something) and write out what would actually happen in fictional circumstances, because, you know, having owls delivering hundreds of letters in a world where the statute of secrecy exists is a funny picture, but logistically it's not going to be very pretty.

But one thing I think she did get right is neuroses you and how silly it tends to be on a regular basis.

I can't see anything wrong with the way you summoned the bot. It's possible that it's acting up. However, it doesn't work if you edit the comment to include the summon unless you use another command, so if you made a mistake and tried to fix it that might have caused the issue.

****** Hmm assuming that Gryffindors did not have one-heir tradition like Malfoys seem to go for...

I couldn't guess at math considering inconsistent travel opportunities and child mortality rate throughout ages but assuming he did not get kicked in family jewels by an Ox as a child this may well turn out to be true

*** Don't be. I've always thought (and several fanfics take this route) that because of the way he was raised and what he learned to survive... he has more Slytherin habits. Cunning, manipulative, willing to survive at any cost, able to hide the abuse and their own suffering from the world. Tell me that Harry isn't more Slytherin - after all, he's not in there because he didn't want to be around Draco (who was also mis-sorted, as with his idiocy, need for attention and 'Leeroy Jenkins' persona, is straight-up Gryffindor).

**** Isn't that great though? A descendant of Gryffindor who acts like a Slytherin. I understand the whole "heritage" thing takes a lot of Harry's individuality from him and makes his power and skill less a product of his hard work and more a prerequisite of his bloodlime, but that idea (on paper) is cruelly, deliciously ironic.

*** Wait, why would the Peverells be descended from Slytherin? It's entirely possible the Gaunts can be descended from both of them through two different sides of the family.

**** Think a little, the Gaunts are descendant of Cadmus Peverell, The Potters are descended from Ignotus Peverell. Both Cadmus and Ignotus and also Antioch were brothers by the legend, so the three were of the same father and mother (a common ancestor).\\
It is logical that Salazar Slytherin was even more in the past after this common ancestor because there is no connection of descent between Slytherin and Peverell know.\\
So yes even if Slytherin were a descendant of Cadmus Peverell (not logical), Harry and Tom Ridlle does have a common ancestor in the Peverell's Father. And if my theory is right, both of them are Slytherin descendant by this common ancestor.

It is just that Parseltongue is a blood ability it should not be possible to transmit it by Horcrux (Soul shard).

***** That's not what I was trying to say. I meant that it is entirely possible for Tom and Harry to share the same common ancestor but that doesn't mean that that ancestor is a Slytherin descendant. It's possible that one of Cadmus's descendants married a Slytherin descendant and that's why Tom would know Parseltongue while the Potter line doesn't. Plus, if the Potters had that ability, why does no one bring that up at all?

****** Ah, so the only link between Cadmus descent and Slytherin would have been marriage somewhere probably the Gaunts as their are the more outspoken of Slytherin. Possible but yet again it would stand to reason that another Slytherin descendant married into Ignotus line as the Purebloods are all interrelated. Why the Potters doesn't show the ability ? Simple why does the Potter aren't know as Peverell descendant ? Because both Parseltongue and the Peverells are considered Dark and the Potters wanted to appear Light. See Harry, despite being a Parselmouth, he doesn't use the ability because it is Dark. Everything is pointing that despite not being interested by purity the Potters remained pure before James marriage to a muggleborn. The Blacks married into the Potter and they have their motto Toujours Pur.
