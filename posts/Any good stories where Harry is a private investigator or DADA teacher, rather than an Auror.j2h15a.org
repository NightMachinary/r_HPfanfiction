Crossovers welcome, but not necessary. Character bashing is heavily frowned on, however. House elf slavery apologism or "marriage contract" fics are of the Devil.

*** By definition, a government officer, even one who does detective work, is not a "private" investigator.

In function, the Aurors seem to be like a combination of Secret Service, counter-terrorism, intelligence agents, and SWAT. The ordinary magical law enforcement patrol and beuarocrats like Arthur Weasley would seem to be closer to normal police.

  At twenty-five, Harry Potter is at a crossroads in his life. He's achieved his dream of being an Auror, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, and with one child and another on the way, he's missing out on precious time with his family. But being an Auror is all he knows how to do - right? So he's in for a surprise when Professor McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, offers him a job as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ...

  Daphne Greengrass wouldn't realise that a chance encounter at the age of eleven could have led her to have a life of adventure. Fourteen years later she meets Harry Potter again, this time over a dead body, but will she walk away or stay? He's a consulting detective and she's a healer, worlds apart from some, but for others, it could be just the beginning. AU.
