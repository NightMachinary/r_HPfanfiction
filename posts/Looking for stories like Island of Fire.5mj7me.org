I am looking for stories like Island of Fire or Voyage or the Starship Hedwig. Basically magicals building a new society.


** I love Harry and Co building up a new civilization from ground up, and I like these two a lot:

"The Stars Alone", linkffn(12040341): SG-1 crossover. Harry, Hermione, and Luna are liberating enslaved humans across the galaxy, while fighting a total war against Goa'ulds.

"The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig", linkffn(7135971): it would have been a great story if the author had used a beta.

There are many overlaps in the above threads, one fic stood out particularly: "Brown Coat, Green Eyes", linkffn(2857962). Unfortunately, I still have to read it and could not provide any more details about it.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

This story is more about shenanigans in space than actually building a civilisation, to be honest. It does fulfil the requirements of those other threads, but this one, barely if at that.

Still a good story, though.

** The Salem Settlement got me all excited, but it's not been updated since November....so that's three chapters a year updating schedule. It was really only just starting to world build, too.

** Is that the Temeraire crossover? Man, that was good stuff! For some reason I always find myself slightly unsettled by that kind of conceit, given how steeped in tradition both wizarding culture and the story itself tends to be, but that's a flaw with me and not the stories.
