*** That's a very nice series, thank you. I wish it were a bit longer, but it's good as is.

** If you mean “and help win the first war” then I suggest Wind Shear. Otherwise it ticks your boxes.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
