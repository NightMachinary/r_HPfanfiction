JK only had 7 books to describe an amazing world of magic so surely she doesn't mind writers adding to it. I love finding new and creative magical items or spells invented by a transformative works author. I remember one fic I read years ago (and I wish I remembered the name so I could credit it) who thought up a spell that worked like Google in the library. Harry was looking for books with a specific phrase, uttered the incantation, and out jumped a pile of books opened to the phrase's location. For a fic I'm working on, I've created dual bracelets for a parent and child that are magicked to let the parent know when the child is in danger or pain when they're both worn.

From the super complicated to a simple spell, what are your favorite fan creations?


** For me, it is the simple one I like the best, even though it is completely world-breaking: the "Notice-me-not charm" which is so ubiquitous that half of fanfic writers forget it isn't canon.

Alternatively, wards. They don't exist in canon, but are rather useful things, even if not always well thought out.

Of course, I would love to see a bit of an Adams influence in more fanfics and see them use a "Someone Else's Problem" field.

*** Wards aren't canon? They're not called Wards as such, but protective spells. Like what they did around camp every time they apparated to a new location or around Hogwarts before the battle. Also there as the warning ward placed on Hogsmeade to warn the Deatheaters of any apparation.

- Wardstones
- Runes that are somehwhat tied to them
- 'Powering' them

The concept of wards is a bit different in fanon than canon.

***** Interesting. I've never read a fic that had wardstones or anything like that, but I could see how that can be a bit overused. Although the idea of using runes and ancient protective magic is fascinating. I've been thinking a lot about nature magic and how it differs from what they use in canon. Specifically in this one fic I'm writing where the grandmother of the child weave a wreath together to protect the child and keep it healthy, using runes and chanting as they do it like the pagans did. It's interesting to mix real historical rituals into the HP lore.

Wow. I find them pretty common in "Lord Harry" stories where he finds the long, lost Potter manse.

Also mind-bogglingly common: if non-family touches the ward stone, it will suck all of their magic out and kill them! Because rocks know who's family and who's not.

****** Think of divinations as English literature, vague imagery and all that open to interpretation where as arithmancy is maths.

It's not true that no one creates new spells, Snape did and the twins might have done. If Snape was doing it then the marauders might have done in an attempt to one up him. It could easily be a hobby that goes in and out of fashion.

If you put maths towards spell creation your heading towards quantifying magic which I think people have shown in arguments about magical cores is a bad idea. As an engineer I can understand wanting it to make sense but magic isn't logical and maths is the ultimate logic in a lot of ways. Why can't magic be magical?

Edit: better example of the same thing being taught differently art/sketching vs technical drawings. They show the same thing but I've never seen it taught as art.

*** I hate it when authors treat arithmancy as essentially Muggle mathematics that is simply being applied to magic. It's not mathematics, it's arithmancy i.e. it follows entirely different rules though it shares some notation.

From what we know of arithmancy in canon, I'm not even convinced that "3 + 3 = 6" would hold. In numerology traditionally 3 has been an important number while 6 is considered a evil number. It would therefore be odd for a combination of two good numbers to yield an evil number. Given that 7 is a magically powerful number, it seems more likely that 3 + 3 = 7 in arithmancy.

**** Whenever I imagine an Arithmancy class, I imagine Hermione having a massive eye twitch at the realization that its basically formalised Divination. That mathematical logic and a knowledge of physics does nothing for you in there, but rather an understanding of abstract cultural concepts.

This is a very good example you brought up:

#+begin_quote
  3 + 3 = 7 --- good + good = good
#+end_quote

However, I still like the idea that Arithmancy is used as a tool for spell creation. But more in a sense of "If I wave my wand like this, and say these words, will I make effect X or will I spontaneously spawn a bull over my head that crushes me, or something? ". Then you "calculate" it and magic will give you a hint. I once wrote that into a scene:

#+begin_quote
  With the routine of the gifted arithmancer she was, Hermione isolated the speed related parts of the broom calculation and combined them with the direction based numbers of the paperplane charm. She all put it into a bracket and moved Poppy's calculations around it, deleting some of it in the process. In the end, she got rid of the brackets and arranged the numbers in a logical sequence from lowest to highest number. Then Hermione shook her head, deep in thought and erased the circled ten-thousand from the blackboard. Instead she wrote 9999 in a rectangle.

  “Almost divine?”

  “The highest anyone could possibly reach in terms of perfect spellcasting.” Hermione mumbled. Then she calculated the formula in her head, a feat Poppy always admired, and reached exactly 299,792,459. She stepped back with her eyes wide as saucers and gaped at Poppy who merely shrugged.

  “Does that number ring any bells?” Hermione asked, obviously expecting a positive answer.

  “Not really, should it?” Poppy asked.

  “That is one meter per second over the speed of light.”

  “Damn...” Poppy looked gobsmacked at the calculation. Arithmancy had always been the ‘better Divination', as her Mama Min called it. Having the result being just above the speed of light was like some entity giving them a big hint that, yes, this would work. “Now to bring that into a spell. Any ideas?”

  “Absolutely none. I can't even begin to think of language patterns fitting this, let alone any sounds Latin could offer.”

**** I agree with your example. In general though, as long as something has rules and patterns, it can be described using Muggle mathematics. As long as we are able to define the new rules logically. If it has arbitrary or no logic, then Muggle mathematics won't help. I like the idea that arithmancy has less rigorous definitions, as in we can predict the outcome of some operations ( adding three and three), but we can't really definitively explain some things: what makes three a "good number", don't know, it just is.

******* Okay, but you can also apply different rules for the = operator or anything you want. The point is that he was talking on a very fundamental level, without making changes to the underlying structure or assumptions, magic COULD make basic arithmetic in base 10 work so that if you have 3 apples, and you set them next to another 3 apples, you somehow now have 7 apples. In fact, that happens on occasion with duplicating and enlarging food!

Math need not apply to magic.

********* You are very much missing the point. What Taure wrote about was the possibility of equations in arithmancy being different on a fundamental level due to the fact that magic factors into it a lot and that carries its own connotations and rules both. What you instead started going on about was how stuff in maths doesn't have to mean what you mean and you only have to make a symbol with established meaning mean something else just like that.

The symbols are intended to mean what they mean. The possible fundamental difference that is being discussed comes from the fact that with magic there is more and likely different intent in it and as such the symbols might mean different things because they are /intended/ to mean different things. Trying to pretend that the symbols with established meaning can be made to mean different things without a change in intent /is/ disingenuous and a fairly bad thing to do in this case as it pretty much goes against the spirit of what is being discussed, fanon or canon or whatever else.

************** 1. I was the one who started the entire discussion about a spell-crafting interpretation of Arithmancy in the context of The Arithmancer which utilizes some rather high level mathematics and mathematical concepts. The discussion was never about "simplistic mathematics".

2. Just because you don't know about such structures in mathematics, does not mean they do not exist. The theoretical mathematicians, the people far smarter than either of us, deal with such abstract structures every day. The basic mathematics you encounter is just one application of the humongous theory behind it. In terms you'd understand, it is still muggle mathematics because it would be a structure completely defined and covered by existing theorems and axioms just with the concrete meanings of some symbols tweaked to suit such an idea as 3+3=7 if necessary. It is no different to how mathematics most people encounter in high school is simply one concrete example of the huge and abstract theory behind it.

Insulting you? Oh, internet, never stop surprising me.

And I hold a bachelor degree in mathematics and am working on a masters in the field. Complex mathematics was two semesters for me and that is hardly the thing I am talking about as it is a completely different field. It is also, in some segments, just an application of an even broader theory which can stand on its own. This stuff is from algebraic structures and number theory for the most part.

And why should relaying on something which exists be intellectually lazy? For one, going by that, you can scrap half the literature and art then. (/Not to mention the entire fanfiction!/) For two, there is the entire question of designing the concrete system which would be challenging enough on its own.

*** I love a few different interpretations of arithmancy. I love it as a statistics/probability form of divination, where you have to have a finite starting point and it gets screwed up if you have a result in mind (like confounding results on an experiment because you're seeing what you want to see). I think this is what I see most often.

I see that connecting *really* well with the spell crafting interpretation. You have to be able to figure out how things might/should interact, what the results might be, and potentially how to optimize it. That's a lot of math, and a lot of "might". It could be why spell crafting is considered difficult or dangerous (is it considered so in canon? can't recall). You narrowed down your craft into two potential outcomes, but the only way to know for sure is to test it.

** u/UndeadBBQ:
#+begin_quote
  I remember one fic I read years ago (and I wish I remembered the name so I could credit it) who thought up a spell that worked like Google in the library.
#+end_quote

I simply called that one "/Index/". I also once wrote about an earring that opens a ghostly list of books when touched in a library. I always thought it odd that a wizarding library would not be equipped with something like that and I'd guess that many had the same idea.

My favorite spell by another author... hmmm

I really enjoyed how Steelbadger worked Potion theory into his "Shadow of Angmar" fic. That is the first one I remember. It had a beautiful effect and was a great way of giving Harry a tool while not making him overpowered.

One I read about and just shamelessly stole for my own fics is "Falx". Its really nomen est omen, hence why I like it so much. The spell functions like a [[http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/deadliestwarriorthegame/images/f/f6/Falx.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120509152851][falx]] in that when it hit, it sliced through a person or, when it collides with a Protego, pulls the opponent by his wand towards the caster, unbalancing him.

Another really awesome idea was found in a story in which Harry inherited the Potter vaults and found out about his families history as artificers, especially mirror makers. He also finds out that the Potters use these mirrors to spy on people and get dirt on them. Harry gets a bunch of houseelves who then proceed to channel their inner NSA agents and spy on pretty much the entire british community.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

So, like a trunk that transfigures into a bracelet, but you can take things out and put them away while it's in bracelet form. She also had a locket one once, that was Hermione's.

Then there was the Dueling Field Generator (I think) from That Old Black Magic. Which Harry referred to as a magical holodeck, leading to Draco's intro to television.

And myredturtle had James Potter develop a spell (Redeo) that would bring his wand to his hand - no matter where it started. Meaning, miles, even counties away. That was in Black Moon Ascendant, which was a challenge fic and hasn't been reposted yet. Sorry.
