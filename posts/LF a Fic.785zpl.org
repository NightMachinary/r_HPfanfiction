Harry falls asleep in a graveyard(?) wakes up to find himself younger and that his family is alive TY in advance :D


** The only one I can think of is linkffn(A MODern Man by dogbertcarroll), Harry crosses into a universe where his young counterpart has crashed into a tombstone and died of exposure. Really weird fic, though a lot of the authors stories are. Might not be the story you are thinking of, because I have an odd recollection of another story that started similarly.

  Harry takes advice he shouldn't, to do something he really should have known better than to try. Still, all's well that ends well, right?
