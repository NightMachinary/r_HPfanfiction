I read a one shot in someone's collection where Harry was doing his normal day and got caught up in events surrounding him and then declared the bad guy because of it. I was wondering if anyone had any stories that followed the same idea, where the main character is swept up in the events around them and then associated with the wrong crowd.\\
No real restrictions, cannon or crossover, and the main character could side with the bad guys or fight against the case of mistaken identity.

Thanks in advance.


** Oh yeah, there was this one crossover where Harry infiltrated a SHIELD base completely by accident that was pretty good. I didn't bookmark it though, so give me a bit of time to find it.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

**** No, not this one. I've read Wand and Shield and it's pretty good, though.

The one I'm thinking of had Harry trying to open a bank account in what was actually a SHIELD command center or something. It was a one shot and pretty funny.
