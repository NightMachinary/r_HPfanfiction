Whether it's Harry going to be alternate reflection of his own world (alive parents, different war, etc), or simply a crossover-like-story where Harry goes to a new world and makes a home for himself. I just want to see Harry have a happy ending in a different setting.

Thanks in advance!

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** Linkffn(3959072)

It's the third part of a trilogy, no dimension traveling in the first two parts. In the story 2 Harrys swap places in their universes; one universe has more or less everyone surviving. They swap back eventually and the ending for the canonical universe is in one of the one-shot compilations of the author since the trilogy is the story of the AU. Both Harrys get more or less the same amount of "screen time". More information would be a spoiler for the first two parts in case you want to read them. (First part: Linkffn(2913149))

*** OH NO! Now I cannot write this idea! :( I had this exact idea today but someone else got to write it first! :( I really wanted to try to write it!!!

**** If you want to write it, go ahead. The OC Harry has already won his war, so the canon Harry just spends most of his time with his family, but tries to hide that he is not the OC one. And the OC Harry doesn't do that much for the war, he mostly focuses on getting back.

There's nothing wrong with similar stories, just write it if you want to. (And send me a link if you do :D)

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? This is a very dark fic. Warnings within. A/N: Currently editing fic.
