in this story harry becomes independent and uses a a shotgun and his wand, he eventually designs powdered potions that work like spells that he puts in shotgun shells, he gives these shotgun shells to a muggle family that helps him fight voldemort.


** I remember that in Three to Backstep Harry asked the twins to make him potionballs (that were filled with poison) that could be fired from paintball guns.

That's all I can come up with.
