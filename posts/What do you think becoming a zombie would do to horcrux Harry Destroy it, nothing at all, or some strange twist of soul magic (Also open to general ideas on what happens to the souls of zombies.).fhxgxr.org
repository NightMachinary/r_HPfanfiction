Also, I am thinking more traditional eat-your-brain zombies, rather than inferi, which I see as just dead bodies that have been reanimated and obey the whim of whoever raised them.


** Zombies are tradionally dead bodies animated by virus/fungii/etc - not dissimilar from inferni. You would want a zombie type that is transformational in nature: decaying body but not mind, changed diet, perhaps affinity to dark spaces/creatures/magic.

I think such a zombie would still have its soul so the horcrux would not be destroyed or removed. Your zombie would be a dark creature, so perhaps the horcrux could start to empower or influence Harry physically and mentally. Harry could shift into a unique kind of zombie; one that could control other zombies for example.
