Maybe it could once upon a time, but after a millenia, even Godric Gryffindor's enchantments mostly wore off. The Hat call still come up with songs and talk to students, but it cannot reach into their minds and evaluate their personalities anymore.

Of course, the Hat knows that if it ever admits the truth, it will be swiftly replaced. So nowadays it mostly flies by the seat of its (non-existent) pants, Sorting students randomly with a few legacy admissions thrown in for good measure. It then tells confused 11-year-olds how brave/smart/loyal/ambitious they are, and peer pressure takes care of the rest.

This explains how Pettigrew ended up in Gryffindor, Lockhart in Ravenclaw, and Crabbe and Goyle in Slytherin.

** And to answer my own prompt, because why the hell not.

***

The Great Hall was almost totally silent as Hermione Granger's Sorting went on and on, the girl sitting nervously under the Hat. Some students whispered quietly to their House mates sitting next to them, urging them to pay attention to this year's first “Hatstall”.

It was a popular legend at Hogwarts that having your Sorting go on for a while was supposedly a mark of a future great witch or wizard -- the kind that could succeed at anything they would set their mind to. And apparently, the bushy-haired first year had that kind of potential.

In reality, the Sorting Hat was pondering whether it could get away with sending “Granger, Hermione” to Slytherin.

For the umpteenth time, the Hat silently cursed old Salazar and his obsession with blood purity. How did he think a /hat/ was supposed to determine some eleven-year-old's blood status anyway? Was it supposed to take a blood sample or something?

In any case, before Slytherin left Hogwarts (after one too many arguments with Godric, who had apparently had it with all the snakes in his castle), he went to see the newly-enchanted Hat and promised that if it would “fill his noble House with filth” (end quote), he would come back and set it on fire.

It has been a thousand years or so since then, but having once known the Serpent Sage, the Hat was not inclined to disobey his instructions even now. So, it resorted to trying to remember the names of the students it has Sorted, and if some other eleven-year-old with the same last name put it on a couple of decades later, the Hat assumed that he or she was at least a half-blood, and thus a viable candidate.

Well... back to the problem at hand.

“Granger sounds like a pureblood name... or was it Dagworth-Granger? Damn it, my memory isn't what it used to be... anyway, it's not like two Muggles would name their daughter something like Hermione, right? At least I hope they wouldn't.”

In the end, the Hat decided to play it safe and Sort her into Gryffindor, giving the standard spiel about bravery and friendship and all that. The girl, at least, seemed happy as she took the Hat off and went to the Lions' table, so it probably didn't screw up too badly.

After that, it got easier. “Greengrass, Daphne” and “Malfoy, Draco” went to Slytherin, “Longbottom, Neville” went to Gryffindor (weren't his parents Aurors or something? They've got to be brave if they picked a job like that, right?), and the Patil sisters went to two different Houses -- McGonagall /still/ complained regularly about the last pair of twins the Hat Sorted into her House, so it decided to have some pity on her this time. The ancient artifact was looking forward to Sorting yet another Weasley into Gryffindor and calling it a day, when...

“Potter, Harry!”

Hm... wasn't this boy famous or something? Didn't he kill off that one guy whom everyone was afraid of ten years ago?

Well... this sort of potential, combined with precocious disposition towards violence, was exactly the sort of thing Salazar would want in a student. So, the Hat gave the standard sales pitch for House Slytherin and was ready to send Potter to the snakes, when it felt /very/ strong discomfort from the kid. Apparently, for whatever reason he wasn't that keen on spending the next seven years in a dungeon with a bunch of purebloods (or so the Hat hoped). No Slytherin for him, then.

But then what? The Hat remembered the last Potter it Sorted -- John? Jamie? Giorno? Never mind that -- he was a Gryffindor, and that was the important part. Hooray for legacy admissions.

*“Better be GRYFFINDOR!”*

“There you go. Have a good run, kid,” the Hat thought as Harry Potter stood up from the stool and went to join his new House mates.

“I just hope he isn't going to become the brightest student of Hogwarts or something. That would be just plain /embarrassing/.”

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Hoyle may not have had proper ambition and craftiness, but if there was some indication that they could be physically abused by their families, maybe the Hat places them in the house least likely to get them hurt.

It breaks down a little when you consider Sirius, but it seems that his family never beat him for being Gryffindor, just ostracized him.

He wanted to proof himself very much when he came to Hogwarts. He didn't want to be driving by his name but make a name of himself. I would count that as ambitious - especially when you think about how great of a name he already had.

He also was sneaky and resourceful - he got into the restricted section in the library and got away with smuggling a dragon at age eleven.

Later year Harry was less a fit for Slytherin but there you can argue about nuture VS nature. By sorting the kids into houses they nuture some kind of personalities. A Harry in Slytherin would been very different from one in Gryffindor because he would have a very different environment.

Did something happen mid sorting that made it mishear Sirius' name? Did someone lend Sirius a Gryffindor themed cloak (and lead the hat to assume he's not actually related to the other blacks)? Did someone offer to have him dry cleaned if he stuck a few students in the wrong house?

********* My thought is that it probably balances out by OWLs, or at least could if the Hogwarts staff employed modern teaching techniques.

Although, muggleborns are under represented in top ministry positions which shows something, I think. A combination of who you know and background knowledge unrelated to the curriculum. Doing well on exams simply isn't enough.

Overall, I believe there are advantages to each side and pupils are likely affectes by the same privileges as in the muggle world.

Draco and Hermione both come from comfortably wealthy families who take interest in their educational success and provide varied experiences for them (e.g., trips abroad/around the UK.) Hermione is known to own a large number of books, which Ron's family couldn't afford.

An advantage specific to muggleborns is that most will have attended standardised schooling since age 4-5. So, they already have literacy, mathematics, how to use a library, and thinking skills which are being developed.

By contrast, when wizarding families can't afford good tutors, the families must homeschool. Lockdown is a fine example of parents struggling to balance childcare and work. Not all parents are suited to teaching and some struggled at school. (Imagine Goyle tutoring his kids.) However, the children most likely know what terms to search for, in the same way that Ron knows the colours of ministry worker's robes.

Children who are disengaged from learning and have socio economic disadvantages most likely have the most difficult time at Hogwarts.There's no real sign that the staff at Hogwarts work to close the gap.

Seriously, a lot of Draco hype comes from his talk with his father before the Second Year, when Lucius scolded him for not scoring as well on his tests as Hermione did - which a lot of people apparently interpreted as him being second-best to Hermione. Personally, I don't think that's the case, given that Lucius said that if Draco's grades don't pick up, he'll only be able to become a thief when he grows up.

That said, Draco was pretty good at Potions (good enough to make it to Snape's NEWT class, at least), Occlumency, and was a rather strong wizard for a 16-year-old, being able to cast Unforgivables. Oh, and he had to have some talent for flying to stay on the Quidditch team.

He's also clearly powerful because of the unforgivables and definitely has the vanishing cabinet wizard repairman skills on lock. I don't really agree that Lucius was saying he was that bad in school, I thought that scene was pretty clearly ‘I expect the best and nothing else' with a lot of prejudice thrown in.

The other examples you used might be less likely to be true - we know he bought favour in Potions (granted, we also know he got an O in an official exam but he wasn't the single class prodigy in OotP and before) and we also know he bought favour on the Quidditch team. He never actually beat Harry in a match without injury, although he probably beat the other seekers. That doesn't mean he wasn't the best person for the job but it also doesn't mean he's great.

Of course, Lucius didn't mean what he said literally. After all, whatever his grades were, Draco never had to work a single day in his life.

I was a little surprised that Lucius chose to scold Draco in public (one would think he would say such things only behind closed doors), but maybe Borgin was something of a friend of his, or someone he trusted to some extent.

As for Potions - I think that he probably got some extra tutoring, perhaps from Snape himself. I don't believe that Snape, for all his prejudices, would praise Draco if he didn't deserve it.

And yes, he did buy his Seeker spot, but I still think he's at least good enough to keep it, even after all the misfortunes that befell his father. Definitely not Harry's level, but not the worst player either.

******* Hermione beat him in every single exam in their first year - Lucius makes this comment in /Chamber of Secrets/ when Malfoy starts complaining about Granger and complaining about teachers showing favoritism(which I find ironic given Snape).

So while he's clearly not /on par/, he's at least possibly close behind. How close, we don't know. We know she beat him across the board, but we don't know by how much.

Potions is the one that cracks me up to think about, because Malfoy clearly benefits from Snape's favoritism and overt bias against Gryffindor, yet she still outscored him anyway.

However, he was the only student in Hermione's class in their sixth year who is confirmed to be able to use a Protean Charm, which she could already do a year earlier. We know the Protean Charm /is/ NEWT standard, but the fact that no student other than these two is singled out as using this particular spell might indicate that they're pretty close in ability.

The crucial difference is Lockhart wasn't really /evil/ like a Slytherin.

On top of that if Pettigrew can be treacherous like a Slytherin while in Gryffindor then there's no reason Lockhart couldn't be cunning in Slytherin. Furthermore, we've seen the brilliance of Slytherin planning in things like "Propose a duel and tell filch." or "Hear that Potter is the owner of my wand and send another killing curse (that has never worked) at him." You've got to see that Lockhart's plan was much, much *cleverer* than anything a Slytherin could manage.

***** Slughorn's plan was also ingenious. He ended up very influential but it didn't come with any of the downsides fame does. Everyone who was worth something knew him and liked him, but he would never be the victim of a scandal or the press.

Remember that just cleverness isn't actually the trait of Ravenclaw - loving learning is the trait. They value knowledge and wit and wisdom, that doesn't mean they're the only people to possess those qualities.

Lockhart valued the power and the fame. Yeah, he definitely had to use his brain to get there, but that doesn't automatically make him a Ravenclaw.

Slytherin falls victim to everyone thinking you have to be evil to be there. You don't, but when all your parents are Death Eaters then the propaganda mill will obviously have an effect. Lockhart would be the perfect Slytherin in the same way Slughorn is - both of them very ambitious and getting exactly where they want to be in legitimate ways (well, until Lockhart got caught and exposed, but you get the idea - it looked legitimate for a long time).

****** Remember he was actually good at obliviating people, so they would have led perfectly normal lives just not remembered the really cool/important stuff they did. The reason why Lockheart ended up like he did is because the spell was cast by a 12 year old with a broken wand. Not to say stealing people's accomplishments isn't evil because it is, just that he didn't make anyone a vegetable.

******* Do we actually know tho if any of his victims lived normal lives? Also Lockhart cast the spell himself, with enough power that the backlash from the spell misfiring caved in the tunnel.

******** True! I completely forgot it was he who casted. I mean we don't really know that his victims were normal but I felt like it was implied.

*** Lockhart sounds smart there, but you're forgetting the bit where he repeatedly makes a fool of himself in public, revealing his incompetence. If he was smart he wouldn't have duelled Snape for the duelling club, he wouldn't have unleashed a bunch of pixies he couldn't even protect himself from, he wouldn't have vanished Harry's bones. He could easily have gone the whole year without casting a spell in front of students, or even just only casting spells he knew would work.
