So after reading the other thread, I'd like to give some mpreg a try. What would you lot recommend?


** A word of caution. If you don't like Harry/Draco or Harry/Snape then the odds of you finding an mpreg story you might like is /very/ low, as 99% of mpreg stories feature those pairings.

But if you love those pairings you're in luck!

**** Then I wish you good luck!

I was never much into mpreg, but even the little I did read I learned pretty much immediately that there seems to be a higher percentage of bad mpreg stories compared to good ones than any other sub genre of HP FanFiction.

A large percentage of them basically just make Harry a girl in all but name which I never enjoyed, or are just cheap smut fics. It's most likely because of the popularity of Harry/Draco and Harry/Snape pairings, which ends up attracting everyone and their mother to write sub par stories for it.

But I suppose that's FanFiction for ya!

** Ok, this one /has/ mpreg, which makes me reluctant to rec it in other threads, but the mpreg isn't really the point and it's not typical mpreg. It's actually a great post-Hogwarts cursebreaker story: linkffn(harry potter and the soul gems). But in this thread, at least someone might give it a try without noping out when they see the mpreg warning. There's a sequel, too.

** Using the "mpreg" tag in AO3 brings up a lot of stories, and some of them are even great, but it really depends on what kind of relationship/pairing you want to look for. For example, most Tom/Harry mpregs also have quiet a bit of angst /or/ a lot of light side bashing. On the other hand, Draco/Harry mpregs tend to be more about "true love". The type of story is also influenced by at what point mpreg occurs. Mpreg can be the end result of a relationship, just like pregnancy often happens at the end of male/female romance stories. Or it can happen at the start, and be the point of the story, which will be more angst and less romance. Some mpreg fics are really more kid fics then about the mpreg itself.

I like Tom/Harry myself (I like dark Harry). The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10221383/1/Kitty-Love][Kitty Love]] series is very popular linkffn(10221383), but I've never liked it that much (I find it a bit too cliche and childish). The same for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10264186/1/Surge-de-Hydra][Surge de Hydra]] linkffn(10264186), and really anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3996465/Watermelonsmellinfellon][Watermelonsmellinfellon]], but if you are willing to read anything, give them a try. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9591343/1/Some-Other-Beginning-s-End][Some other Beginings End]] linkffn(9591343) is good, but its a one shot. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/526351][Je Souhaite]] linkao3(526351) is pretty good too. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/604625][Meant To Be]] linkao3(604625) is unfinished and more kidfic then mpreg.
