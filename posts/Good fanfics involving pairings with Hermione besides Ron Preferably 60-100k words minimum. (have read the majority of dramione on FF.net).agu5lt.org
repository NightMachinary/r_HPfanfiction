Hello, just looking for some good fics to read while I wait for my fave to update. I've read a few theomione and nevmione fics before and they were good, but also too short. Mostly just looking for pairings or Hermione with someone other than Ron. I mainly read Dramione, and I'm very into Manacled right now. Have also read some fics by bex-chan


** Have you checked out shayalonnie, maryroyale, or resa aureus? They're all on FFN, I know the first author is also on ao3.

** Hermione/Cedric

He survives GOF, but was injured.

Finding Himself. Sequel was started, but abandoned. First story is worth it tho.

** If you read a lot of Draco/Hermione, have you checked out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11894165/1/The-Eagle-s-Nest][The Eagle's Nest]] by HeartOfAspen? It's 306K words long, and complete (the author having just finished January 2). Obviously, Draco and Hermione have the two lead roles locked down but Theodore Nott also has a pretty big part too.
