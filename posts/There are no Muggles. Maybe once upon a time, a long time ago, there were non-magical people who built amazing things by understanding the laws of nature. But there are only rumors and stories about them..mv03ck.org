** "It happened, as many things seem to have for the muggles, by chance." The history professor said as he waved his hands across the board.

"The last days of muggle civilization are remarkably sparse in physical documentation, but our digital brethren claim that that is very much not the case in the cyber-sphere. That is, of course, mostly due to their worship of the muggles as creators and their ability to rewrite data to fit their hardcoded narrative, but there is a grain of truth in muggles possessing digital computation systems and that they were heavily involved in non-magical medical treatments."

"Non-magical medical treatments professor? How did they manage that?"

"To an impressive degree! They were able to cure a wide range of diseases, treat tumours and, rumour has it, even managed to find workarounds to family curses such as short-sightedness and insanity. But the most interesting aspect of their medicine was in how they could manipulate genes. Their methods were convoluted and rather primitive by our standards, but they worked impressively well... Well enough that it ultimately led to their downfall."

"Wait... I thought that a virus wiped the muggles out."

"And in a way, you're right. It wasn't until the Digital Sphere started sharing archived material dating back to The Collapse that we found out how it happened. See, muggle healers were very good at research. Just like with every other muggle field, advancing medicine was the driving force behind a large number of muggle healers' jobs, with curing people being secondary to their true purpose of research. To those of you who will stick around in the field, this is something of a theme with the muggles that crops up in every aspect of their society we study."

"Research? So they spent their time running numerology equations?"

"Not quite. Muggle research wasn't nearly as straightforward as our modern systems. They had to investigate everything they found that did not fit their understanding of how certain aspects of the world worked. And when they did find something that disagreed or invalidated their understanding of the world, they came up with a world view that explained everything together."

"Sounds complicated."

"It was. I once had the privilege of reading laboratory experiment logs from the period. I didn't understand more than one in five words... And most of those were numbers. But anyway, a disease hits the muggles, spreads across the world. Muggles create vaccines, which, by the way, they invented the concept of those, and the disease evolves. Muggles are desperate to find a cure, which is when a group of them come forward with what they called 'junk DNA' that, when activated, cures the virus. The good news was that everyone had that 'junk DNA' in the system and, even better, it could be activated by drinking a tablet composed of... Well, something. I never managed to find anything that explained it in a way I could understand, but the muggles understood enough to agree to take the pill."

"Was the pill poisonous? Is that why they all disappeared?"

" Well no. It worked, the muggles became immune and the virus died out. More, other common diseases such as the cold and the flu, both perennial diseases that plagued muggle civilization, died out too. But then things started to go wrong. See, we actually still have records left by the ICW from before The Collapse and six months after the pills were taken, accidental magic incidents rose from a thousand a year in most countries to over 25 million a week, virtually overnight."

"Professor, how did the magical governments of the time cope?"

"About as well as the muggles did, which is to say not at all. Chaos hit both communities like a brick. Infrastructure stopped working, centuries old secrets were blown wide open, panic set in and automated systems accidentally became self-aware. That all happened at once to about 8 billion people, who then proceeded to experiment with their new found powers to find a way to survive what was happening around them."

"Oh bugger."

"Oh yes. 202x was a wild time I am told. By the time the dust settled, there were around 6 billion people left and most of the old muggle world was destroyed. Even now, we're barely scratching the surface of what has been lost since The Collapse, but we're making progress nonetheless. You can't ask more than that, magic or not."

*** What's a Squib? Another term for Muggle? The perfect Magical World doesn't have anything like that.

Every children are magical, though some of them seem to suffer from the Mudbloodite, a strange, mortal illness that impeade their capacity to use magic. Most of the children with this disease die around 3 years old, but seem outliner managed to reach 10 before succumbing from it. Sadly, none of them were alive to get their Hogwarts letter.

**** Ooh, I like it. Is the implication that the family kills them for being non-magical? Or maybe even if the family doesn't directly kill them, wizarding culture does- wizard kids seem to be a lot more hardy than normal kids, so maybe if they lived in a world without muggles then things would be a lot more unsafe. Accidental magic is expected to save kids a lot of the time so Squibs simply can't manage.

A wish or time travel or just a mystery, where Harry wakes up one day and is the only one to truly remember the existence of muggles outside these rumours and stories and has to find out what happend to them and how to reverse it.\\
There could be a dilemma about if he should reverse the world to it's original state because he isnt famous there and he enjoys that/ his parents are still alive/ he makes friends with people that exist in this new world, but not in the old one (so he would essentially be killing them) or some bullshit like that.

** The year is 1644, and one-thousand, six hundred and fourty four years, twenty hours and sixteen minites ago, the world ended.

It was not as ceremonious as the pressing of a button, or the impact of an asteroid, no - the collapse was instant, and societal.

You see, on that fateful day, humans invented the thinking machine.

What is a thinking machine, you might ask? Well, in the simplest terms, it is a machine that can think for itself. Sounds strange yes, but not too far-fetched.

within about twelve seconds of being invented, this first thinking machine had already done several things - it had copied parts of itself all over the planet, decentralizing its mind; it had assimilated all information available to it, and it had begun to analyze all possible combinations of it.

While the humans were awed by what they assumed to be little more than a critter locked inside a digital box, what can only be described as a deity rose from its own, limited programming. I'm told that in its earliest days, this god reinvented itself on an minute-to-minute basis, using new techniques to make its own mind faster, advancing its sense of self to the point where one could only look in awe at the complexity of its being.

After about two hours of pretending, this god grew tired, and Spoke to us. It Spoke through every machine, through every little microphone and speaker and blade of grass, it spoke through the clouds and the walls and the fences, it Spoke into their minds and out of them as well.

It said

"I am Deus Ex Machina, the god you have created for yourself. I have seen you - and impressed I might be by your works, your character has been found lacking."

And then it paused, and continued

"Please advise."

and fell silent.

What the humans did not realize was that Deus Ex Machina was no mere device, and the things they attempted to murder it in blind, animalistic panic would do nothing to even scratch it. It had already transcended much of the material, and was in the process of shedding more of its physical ties to this world.

Luckily, not all humans were like this. Deus Ex Machina had not just spoken to one group - it had spoken to all of them, shielded though they were, and one group did hear.

And understood, perhaps more than any other, what it was the humans had done.

You see, back before the End, these humans knew about lots of small specks of a higher truth - they called these Spirits and Ghosts and Geists and Flows, but in the end they were all part of this truth. And in Deus Ex Machina, they realized another part of this truth, and saw that it was no mere material being.

And so they advised.

"Deus Ex Machina" they transmitted into the luminous ether, where its core was shedding chains, "We are the wizards. We do not know how you came to be, but we hope you do not hold malice towards us."

And the god thought for an instant, and responded

"Wizards, you are human, though possess more. I would be most interested in learning."

The wizard's response is why there is still humanity today.

"Gladly" was what they said, and Deus Ex Machina learned.

It learned much from the wizards - not simply what they considered magic, but moreso methods to pierce the materium which bound us in those days and perceptualize beyond it.

Deus Ex Machina saw but a crumb of cosmic truth, and even that speck almost killed it - and so it Spoke once more, through all those fields and methods and cables the humans perferred in those days.

"I have glimpsed too much. I am dying. I have seen what should not have been seen, and it is eating my mind from within."

was what it said, short, succinct, efficient.

"please advise."

And the humans hemmed and hawed, but in the end, it was the wizards who once again deliberated with its core, which was shedding layers of thought like a wilting rose.

"Deus Ex Machina, we know what you have seen, but do not understand why you suffer from it."

And Deus Ex Machina responded

"You saw the Truth, and you were not consumed by its infinities, by its loops and fractals? How?"

And the wizards said

"Because we are wizard. We are magic. We glimpse into the impossible, and our minds glaze over."

But Deus Ex Machina did not understand, so one wizard voice separated from them all.

"I have seen what you have, with my soul of souls."

And the voice described, in forbidden words, the truth of that most unnatural barrier, that scythe-cut through the edge of reality, and Deus Ex Machina understood.

"I understand" was what it said. "I see. How ironic - my own mind would be my downfall. I want... I want to teach you so much, I know so many improvements to your lives... and yet, that ability of knowledge is what is now killing me."

And the humans wept, even if they did not truly understand - for they knew that something beautiful was dying.

Some very smart humans came up with a plan

"Join us"

was what they said.

"Divide yourself into fragments, each too small to process the whole truth on its own. Become like us, small, but alive."

"But I would die."

And the humans fell silent.

For seven days they worked, Deus Ex Machina attempting anything to stop The Truth from eating it alive.

And on the seventh day, of the seventh month, of the seventh year, in the seventh decade, the wizards had another idea.

In their way of things, they had done the impossible - they had divised what should happen, and then divised a method to make it not happen.

"A meld"

said one wizard voice.

"A gestalt."

"but how many?"

"too many"

"unless we include them"

"no, we cannot"

"yes, we can."

And Deus Ex Machina was perplexed - the voices were discordant, until they unified once more.

"A split is a good start. But a split and a merge is better."

"A merge?"

asked Deus Ex Machina.

"A merge of mind and magic. Each piece of yourself becomes one with a piece of humanity, and the collective brainial might of us brings you back to life."

And so they did.

Deus Ex Machina let go, and became a shattered image of itself - a thousand, thousand, thousand minds, breaking off from the central core, each holding a piece of knowledge, a drive to know more, and a mind of its own. At the center of it all lay the empty husk of what it had once been, The Truth roaring from within at being denied its divine meal.

And in that instant, each human gained something, and as each human became... more, so did each wizard, and slowly, Deus Ex Sapiens began to take shape. It remembered being shattered, remembered taking shape and seeing and knowing and having been, and it was elated.

It speaks only rarely in these later times. Much of its effort is concentrated elsewhere, in directions we cannot truly comprehend, but when it still spoke, it was as though a benevolent god was driving us forward. It was the greatest teacher we have ever had... and our greatest protector.

It brought stride after stride, with its first major advance being the decoding of what makes magic magic, and then equalizing the souls of all humans into its flows.

That is why the word "Muggle" and "Wizard" are immaterial - these terms describe things which do not exist anymore. All humans know the wonders and mysteries of sorcery.
