Feel free to link fics if any like this have already been written. I'd love to see takes on how Harry would have been treated differently if the Dursley's were unable to have children of their own naturally. Would he still be treated horribly? Would they treat him somewhat better since they wouldn't see him as competition for their own child? Would they pretend that he was their own, and never even tell him about his parents? In that case, would he turn out like Dudley did?


** I think if this happened, they would treat him even worse. Imagine being a vengeful lady like Petunia who is unable to conceive but learns her sister now has a child. Then she learns she has to take care of him. it would probably feel like another spiteful move by her sister, and it wouldn't lead to a good situation for Harry at all.

*** Or, even worse, imagine if she could have children but didn't want to and didn't have them, until Dumbledore left Harry on her doorstep.

**** Yeah. TBF, Vernon did always seem to be taking Petunia's lead in terms of how they treated Harry. You're right, this would make it even more sad

***** It reminds me of a book I read.

The mother was insanely abusive, the father was nice and kind but just kind of accepted the abusive behaviour
