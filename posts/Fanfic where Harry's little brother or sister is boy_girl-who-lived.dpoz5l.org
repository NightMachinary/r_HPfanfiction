I'm not looking for a wrong-bwl fic, or a fic where Lily and James are still alive and forget Harry exists. I'm just wondering if there are any (good) fics where Harry is just a supportive big brother helping his little sibling throughout his/her adventures at hogwarts.


** I am going through linkao3(A Different Perspective by ynmidk) and it doesn't seem to be completely horrible. Harry-gets-thrown-back-in-time-to-his-former-self time travel fic, except here Harry becomes a twin-sister Rose to the BWL Harry. A bit of gender-bender (not too much), and it seems to be developing into some kind of story. Still a bit early for much more assessment.

  When Harry saw his godfather get stunned by Bellatrix and about to fall through the Veil, he tries to save him- only to fall through the Veil himself. Death has to send him back, however, as it is not his time to die yet. If reality has to be rewritten a bit in the process, it's no big deal to Death.

** linkffn(The Double Agent) is a bit like this. Spoiling a bit just by posting here, but it's predictable.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) has a few bits like this.

  A Harry Potter Oneshot. Follow Harry's journey through the shadows of the war with Lord Voldemort, and watch as he does everything necessary to ensure the survival of his family. Non-BWL Harry! BigBrotherHarry! Rated M to be safe.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
