To clarify, I am an adult and I'm looking for well-written adult characters. Too many teenaged fanfic authors write as if their adult males are teenage boys. I get it, they don't understand adult males, but I'm not looking for gratuitous sex scenes that serve only to titillate teen readers. I want fully mature, adult relationships. This isn't to say I'm against Porn Without Plot (I'm not!), I just want the adults to talk/act as real adults do and I don't want an overly-romanticized version of some teenager's ideal dream-guy.

That said, I read a lot of Remus fics but have two that I find myself going back to re-read over and over again. [[http://pandoras-fic.livejournal.com/2985.html][Consequences]]* and [[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/viewstory.php?sid=2626&textsize=0&chapter=1][Things I Have But Could Have Done Without]]* (both Remus/Tonks) are well-written stories that feature the sexiest characterization of Remus that I've found. It's not just the intimate scenes; it's also his personality, wit and dialogue. But I'm interested in seeing which fics out there depict any other characters in a similar way.

I'm also quite fond of [[http://sshg-exchange.livejournal.com/258940.html][Father Figure]]* (Hermione/Snape with BDSM tones) as the sexiest Snape I've found, and I'd love to read more, but I'd also love to find a good Sirius depiction that does him justice. I'm also interested in any other male or female characters, including the Trio, as long as they are no longer school-aged. I'm up for any pairing, any scenario, and have no aversion to AU.

So, fellow adult readers of [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]], help me expand my horizons!

*--NOTE: all these fics I've linked are rated NC-17, R, Mature, whatever the proper term is because they contain sex scenes and adult themes.


** I've read this question several times, and frankly can't remember which fic ever really did that for me. My favourite characters are Hermione, Snape, OC Draco... but of them only Hermione ever reads as sexy, and she was established as that from the canon for me. Fan fic just explored that untapped potential.

So I've decided to focus on the "well-written adult characters", and upon only coming up with 3 candidates found that 2 of them are quite heavy on sex.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation]] - Hermione/Neville not quite sexiest anyone, but to me the fic came off as one that portrays the mental states of young adults that just came out of a mini-war and have to deal with the aftermath. There is quite a bit of sex there, but a lot of those scenes read more like a too-intimate look at the character's personal issues rather than 'porn'.

[[http://mirrordance.net/aashby/bnw/ChaosIndex.htm][Chaos is Come Again]] - Severus/Hermione. This is a marriage law challenge fic, but it is also the very best of them that I have read. Adults are adults - Snape might seem as a bit too bitter, and Hermione may be too naive, but they definitely do not read like teens. Again I wouldn't say that this fic is "sexiest of" for either of them - there is sex. It's not central to the story; it's been a while but "erotic" is not an impression I was left with.

[[http://dhr.accio.nu/rec/id:484][Parade of the Sun]] - Hermione, Draco. This is tough to judge in terms of adult characterization due to the circumstances they are placed in being rather extreme, and it is hard to see whether adults would behave/think any different than non-idiotic teenagers in same situation. I think they at least both qualify for young adults with issues at the start of the story. But by the end of the story I was left with this as most mature representation of the pairing. Very light on sex... though again, it's not like circumstances really allow for much of that.

*** Awesome, thanks! That gives me something to work with!

What I meant by "sexiest character" is that fic that portrays a character so well that you can't help but see them in a better light. Not an idealized version of them, but an actual human with flaws that also highlights the best parts of their character. I've read so many Remus-centric fics, that my perspective is slightly skewed now. I'm hoping to get a chance to discover a better appreciation for some other characters, so thanks for your recommendations!
