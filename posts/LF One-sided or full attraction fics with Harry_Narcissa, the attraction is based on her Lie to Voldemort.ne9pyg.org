I had the idea that Narcissas Lie about Harrys death caused a Bond between them. Similar to Harry and Wormtail, when he protected him against Sirius and Lupin.

THis bond might cause one-sided attraction, so either one of them is attracted to the other (i pictured Harry to Narcissa) of both getting attracted to the other.

There might be near kiss situations or even One-night-stands, to try to get it out of their System. Or something full is about to happen, althought i think i prefer the temporary stuff.

Maybe because of this bond, Narcissa grows more friendly to Harry....and that may be the cause that she wouldnt be disgusted by him, when he tries to kiss her, but she appreciates this attention, but wont go further (for now atleast).

Well, maybe it just stays a one-sided with Harry developing a growing feeling inside (sexual attraction), but she just see him as a Friend. Such a progress might lead to some sort of Harry/Narcissa fic based on Friendship or even Teamwork (with work or political stuff). However, i will leave the option that she "helps" him with his Problems.
