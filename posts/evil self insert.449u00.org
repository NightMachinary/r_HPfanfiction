** Depending on what brand of evil you want the protagonist to be... I'm possibly writing two, but the one that's further along is not HP.

My Buffyverse SI gets turned into a vampire and is more comedic sociopath or [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil][affably evil]] than he is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz][Evil.]] Jack is less 'conquer the world' and more 'gather all the things of power' but he's slowly starting to butt heads with the other powers of the Buffyverse. He also considers Drusilla to be his mother, Faith his sister, and thinks that trolling Buffy is an excellent way to spend an afternoon.

My HP SI reaches a similar state by suffering a merger with the 16 year old Tom Riddle in the diary horcrux, but it's just starting out and gets written when I have writers block on Blood and Chaos.

*** I absolutely love blood and chaos! that moment when Jack realizes he doesn't like to kill the homeless because they don't have any stuff to loot afterwards and he likens it to a happy meal without a toy had me in stiches. And that scene in mirror/wish verse where he just casually [[/spoiler][mentions he killed notFaith mid sex and kept going]] was so awesome.

  People always rant about how awesome it would be to be a Potter. Well, not me. For me, being a Potter meant constant fear and pain, having the whole world placed on your shoulders, being hated and feared because some asshole couldn't kill you as a baby, and it meant being a sacrificial lamb for a hateful world. But with what I know, can I change the rules? Dark self insert.
