** I will assume we're talking about a hypothetical JKR who is willing to engage on the level of detail that I'm interested in, rather than the real JKR (who I would be afraid of asking these questions to due to the risk of an off-the-cuff response that wasn't fully thought out).

Population

- Number of wizards in the world.

- Number of wizards in Britain.

- Number of wizarding children born a year in Britain.

- Percentage of those children who attend Hogwarts.

- Size of the goblin, vampire etc. populations.

International wizarding politics

- What happens to the wizarding governments when a Muggle nation conquers another one?

- What is the level of acceptance of Muggleborns globally?

- Are "great powers" in the magical world, and if so, which countries constitute that club?

- If there are great powers, what is it that gives those countries an advantage?

- What formal legal powers does the ICW have over national magical governments? Is the ICW more like the UN (diplomatic only) or the EU (has genuine authority over its members)?

- The identities of the remaining unknown magical schools.

- What happened during the colonial era in the magical world? Did European magicals rule the Americas/Africa/India/South-East Asia? Did Native American wizards die in similar proportions to their Muggle counterparts?

Magic

- Confirmation that wizards cannot run out of magic.

- The identities of the other principal exceptions to Gamp's law.

- Further clarification on the nature of the food exemption. Does it prevent the creation of anything edible, or merely the creation of "food" in the normal sense used in everyday conversation (i.e. ready-to-eat food).

- Clarification on what is meant by "principal" in "principal exceptions". Does it mean there are other, non-principal exceptions? If so, what is the difference between them and the principal exceptions?

- Other than the creation of the philosopher's stone, what is it that alchemy can do that transfiguration cannot (if anything)?

- Clarification on the range of magic as well as its maximum scale (e.g. the largest object that can be transfigured).

- Clarification on the ways magical authorities track magic and individuals, other than the Trace.

- The properties of dark magic, other than resistance to healing.

*** I mostly agree, but I think we know a little bit more about dark magic than its resistance to healing.

This is how Snape describes the Dark Arts.

#+begin_quote
  “The Dark Arts,” said Snape, “are many, varied, ever-changing,

  and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster,

  which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and

  cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.”
#+end_quote

So in addition to their resistance to healing, we know that dark magic has a tendency to change and adapt, I think we something like this happening when happening when George and Harry both hit Crabbe with two different curses and he ends up growing tentacles on his face.

#+begin_quote
  "Interesting effect," said George, looking down at Crabbe. "Who used the Furnunculus Curse?" 471 "Me," said Harry. "Odd," said George lightly. "I used Jelly-Legs. Looks as though those two shouldn't be mixed. He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face. Well, let's not leave them here, they don't add much to the decor."
#+end_quote

I think other cases would be situations with the indirect gaze of the basilisk, where even if you dont look it directly into its eyes the dark magic will still take you out, the bite of the werewolf where the magic not only doesn't wear out over time like magic normally would, it also spread itself to others even if they themselves are not magical, and of course curses like fiendfyre of protego diabolica fit the Snapes description of dark magic extremely well.

***** I suppose it could be read that way, but I think it doesn't really fit in with the way the the dark arts were portrayed in the books. The only example I can think of is Voldemort using Harry's blood to bypass the sacrificial protection. But this could also just be Snapes own views biased by his love for dark magic.

I also dont think spells acting this way would be fully limited to dark magic, but it seems to be more common to it.

#+end_quote

I think it fits perfectly well. We know from Lupin in HBP that spells go in and out of fashion. We see how potentially very harmful dark spells like the /Petrificus Totalus/ become mostly harmless if you know how to counter them easily. We see how Sectumsempra is a very dangerous curse mostly by virtue of the fact that no one other than Snape yet knows the counter to it (George's lost ear is permanent, but Snape was able to reverse the spell's effects on Malfoy in a moment).

And we see the arms race most fully in relation to the Killing curse.

Round One: Dark Arts has the unblockable killing curse.

Round Two: Lily Potter counters it with sacrificial protection.

Round Three: Voldemort counters sacrificial protection with blood magic of his own.

Round Four: Harry uses Voldemort's blood magic to tether himself to life.

It's a constant back and forth. Contrary to common fanon, magic is not in some fixed, stagnant state. Wizards are constantly developing new methods to get around each other's spells, and /we see this being taught at Hogwarts/:

#+begin_quote
  “Less than zero,” said Harry glumly, tipping lamb chops on to his plate and starting to eat. “Better try, though, hadn't I? I'll offer to do two more detentions or something, I dunno...” He swallowed a mouthful of potato and added, “I hope she doesn't keep me too long this evening. You realize we've got to write three essays, practice Vanishing Spells for McGonagall, *work out a counter-charm for Flitwick*, finish the Bowtruckle drawing and start that stupid dream diary for Trelawney?”

I already acknowledged that as possible interpretation in the comment you just replied to, so I dont get what you are trying to say.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The example I gave in the comment you replied to wasnt about unpredictable effects but dark wizards adapting their methods. Voldemort created a dark potion out of Unicorn blood and Naginis venom and added Harrys blood to bypass the enchantment that defeated him twice.

If you mean the ones in my other comments, all of them are definetly dark. The first examples are about two curses(and like all curses they are dark magic), the gaze of the basilisk and the bite of a werewolf are both from dark creatures, and protego diabolica and fiendfyre are both clearly dark magic.

As a result, Australia has a basically nonexistent magical population of European ancestry but a very isolated community of aboriginal wizards. Since the Australian wizards are isolated aboriginals they don't particularly care about what's going on in Britain, making Australia a good place to hide some vulnerable muggle parents from the Death Eaters.

Edit: And Australia is probably a good place to hide anything or anyone. Including parents. Can't see a death eater coming all the way down here. They likey wouldn't want to go anywhere they can't apparate to. And travelling from Europe to Australia seems a little inconvenient by flying carriage.

The fact that she actually specifies physical traits of the black characters in her books.

So yeah I don't care about the casting and I think a lot of people are the same (unfortunately we hear of the loud minority, as always) but her tweets and inconsistent information makes her unreliable. What bothers people the most are those inconsistencies between what she says/write and what she already wrote.

Other example which has nothing to do with sexuality or ethnicity. JKR is said to have written Fantastic Beasts 2 but we can see a Minerva McGonagall (as credited in the cast) already a teacher in 1927. Previous information given with much details on Pottermore (before being removed) said McGo was born in 1935. In HP5 which happens in 1995-96 McGo answered to Umbridge that she'd been teaching at Hogwarts for 39 years.

JKR can't own her mistakes apparently and tries to sweep it under the carpet which in the age of information is quite pointless.

Finally let's not talk about the inconsistencies in the Cursed Child that, while not written by her, was approved by her.

I know no one is perfect and she can't remember every little details but at this point it's more than just not remembering some details. More so as she wrote it.

That they cast one isn't a problem because it's not what's in the book as long as portrayal and acting is good (well portrayal is wrong anyway but that's the Cursed Child problem, not the actress).

(I know the Doylist answer to the first one, it's because Harry Potter is supposed to be set in 'our world' and it wouldn't fit to have muggles know about various magical creatures.

The statute of secrecy wasn't about muggles being a threat, it was about muggles being annoying. We are explicitly told in the books that magical were only rarely caught and if they were they would usually escape unharmed because of magic. The reason the books give us about the statute of secrecy is because muggles wanting magical solution to all their problems. And if your goal is to hide the existence of magic, then hiding magical creatures and plants is also required.

  "If Beings are defined as those creatures that are sufficiently intelligent to understand the laws of the magical community, and have a part in shaping those laws, why doesn't there seem to be any non-humans represented in the Wizengamot? And why are non-humans legally prohibited from using wands?"
#+end_quote

The Wizengamot is a successor of the Wizards' Council a organisation for wizardkind, non humans have their own political system and representation in the ministry through their liaison offices. Even Centaur have a liaison office even though they are classified as beasts(on their own decision) they just choose not to use it and have in general prefer not to have contact with wizards at all. The reason for the wand ban is obvious, wands are the biggest advantage Wizards have over other beings and through them they enjoy being the ones in a higher position, sharing the wands would just put them at a disadvantage, especially considering how other beings like Goblins or Centaurs refuse to share their own magic.

** If Dumbledore is Gay why haven't you written anything in Pottermore about it? or you know ANY canonical work.

(also why did you go out of your way to straightwash their relationship by writing in the blood pact in the Crimes of Grindelwald so that dumbledore's reasons for not attacking Grindelwald is not because of love, but because of the bloodpact. Also, this allows you to write lines like "we were closer than brothers", and people now have an excuse to say, that's not referring to them being gay, that's referring to them being blood brothers.)

I'm pretty sure that Jo has very little to do with Pottermore. If she did, the articles wouldn't use words like “may have,” “could have”, “possibly”, you know, uncertin speculative words. There was a piece on James Potter written on his birthday in defence of grey characters that wrote him in terrible light and focused on Snape's Worst Memory. The author wondered what happened to James that made him change from a grade A prat to some one who fought for the Order. It was pretty awful. Imagine if some one took the one day you crossed a line and did something idiotic in your teenage years and based your character about it.

Not to mention that wizards know for a fact that there is an afterlife, but dont actually know the details. So they would still crave answers and religon would be able to give it to them.

****** My question sort of was referring to the idea of what the insular magical community would come up with for their religious perspective. What does God look like to a wizard? Do they reject Christianity because of such things like the Salem trials? Do they see religion as a muggle thing or is it a common factor in their society as well, like meals and banking? We don't see many pureblood children who practise anything comparable to a religion, but the phrase "Merlin's beard" is common enough that it's the magical equivalent of "Oh my God." Did they worship Merlin? Is that why purebloods are so ingrained to keep the bloodlines pure, they believe it makes them holier?

They only fully diverged from muggles a couple hundred yours ago, while changes on the outlook on Religon would happen, it wouldn't be by a strong degree.

Probably the same like muggles would see God, they still have our religions after all.

#+begin_quote
  Do they reject Christianity because of such things like the Salem trials?
#+end_quote

Definitely not, their culture is undeniably Christian and wizards make enough references to god that we can easily assume that they are Christians. Also the books explicitly mention that witch hunts were no threat to wizardkind. They only caught real ones very rarely and even those would usually escape.

That is not true. Wizards mention phrases like thank God, my God, for Gods sake or good lord much more often than they mention Merlins beard, or even Merlin at all. Even pure-bloods, Draco for example never mentions Merlin, but he mentions god multiple times. Even Ron mentions God more often than Merlin. And Sirius at one point even sings "God Rest Ye, Merry Hippogriffs" .

​

Its only in fanon where characters have replace the usage of God in the language with Merlin

You should reread the books, the society we see is clearly Christian, but they are also British so they dont talk about religion.

******* Religion is a reflection upon faith and upon the nature of the world itself. Any religious preacher worth their title will tell you to question your faith continuously, to come up with your own conclusions on matters. A lot of religious scripture is comparable to philosophy, it's merely framed around the presupposed existence of a deity or deities.

** Ok, I know this is a bit ridiculous, but I always DIED to know whether that "don't get too friendly with him, though Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pure-blood" line was a real hint from her about a future romantic relationship between Scorpius Malfoy and Rose Weasley. I dunno, I've always thought those two have a great potential to become a "Romeo and Juliet" and kind of epic couple.

​

So, now letting aside the corny stuff, I would also ask her about her views on Latin American wizardry. There's something about Benedita Dourado (see Pottermore's entry about Castelobruxo in case you don't know who she is) that always caught my attention and I've actually been wanting to write a whole story about her in her youth, as if she was like a "Brazilian Dumbledore". But adult life kinda sucks and doesn't let you so much free time, so... maybe in a few years?

​

I'd also love to know more about Herpo the Foul. I dunno, he just seems quite an interesting figure for me. I bet the guy has a great background, and who knows? Maybe there's an epic story just as Harry's and Voldemort's behind him. In fact, I would ask her about other powerful dark wizards and their counterparts.

​

I would also like to know what the hell is that horrible thing you gotta do to create an horrocrux (besides the killing stuff, of course).

​

And well, those are the first questions that came to my mind, but actually I feel like the Potterverse has a great historic potential. Like wizards in Africa, during the French Revolution, during WWI and WWII, the Rennaissance. I would seriously love to know about History of Magic. Which doesn't mean I wouldn't get bored with Binns lol. Think I'd prefer to go on my own and read books about it in the library.
