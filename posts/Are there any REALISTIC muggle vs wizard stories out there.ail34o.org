I seriously doubt the rest of the wizarding world would just stand by while an entire country of theirs gets wiped out. And it's still crazy to me to suggest they could wipe out all wizards even in Britain, especially in one strike/day/whatever.

First you need to somehow find all the wizards and where they live, then bypass any magical protections, then you have to launch a coordinated strike that wipes them all off the map, somehow managing to make sure none see it coming or Apparate away, and all assuming that magical protections wouldn't stop the attacks.

It's an unrealistic premise anyway. There has to be a reason muggles would decide to kill thousands/tens of thousands of people, including children. The only way they would be willing to do this would be if the wizards struck first, delivering an incredibly cruel and significant blow. And in that case, wizards are already on the attack and it's game over for the muggles anyway.

#+end_quote

Except, you know, the French didn't have magic on their side.

This is all assuming wizards can't protect themselves against muggle weaponry, which I don't buy. We know the Shield Charm can protect against physical objects, so why not bullets? HP magic isn't Skyrim or DnD magic, where there's mana to deplete and it only takes a certain amount of mundane force to break through.

Bullets? Shield Charm. Gas shells? Well, ignoring the fact that we don't use chemical warfare (this is where war conventions would be relevant), there's still things like the Bubble-Head Charm, or something similar, or Apparition (why/how would anti-Apparition jinxes be used against the wizards?), or again the Shield Charm. Or so many other kinds of magic.

And that's ignoring the fact that wizards have anti-muggle magic that would stop an assault in the first place. So not only would muggles have to first find these magical bases protected by enchantments, but then they'd have to get past them. And suggesting they would be able to do it with ease is 100% speculation and not supported by anything in canon.

Shield charms are directional. Which means that you can, maybe, shield from direct fire. But that shield will do you no good when a few dozen six-inch shells rain down all around you. And overpressure would be another lethal issue against which shield charms are ineffective.

Also, the point of suppressive fire is not to kill the other side but to keep them where they are and prevent advances. Keep them pinned and blast them with explosives.

Even tear gas would do the trick. Something regularly used for crowd control despite its useage during the first world war. Force them to cast bubblehead charms, which ought to come with some kind of side effect (blurry vision, divided attention). If the charm fails, they are exposed and almost guaranteed to be neutralised.

An all-out war yes. But Muggles vs Voldemort could work reasonably well. Ask the Muggleborns where the magical manors are and just shell/bomb those "holes" on the map into oblivion. You are firing on coordinates, not on sight, so the "anti-muggle" measures are useless. And given that shells are inanimate objects, wards should not be triggered by them (unless you have some against meteoroid strikes).

It would not be impossible to coordinate a syncronised attack at a given time if you can prepare it.

A "curbstomping" doesn't have to be a perfect genocide. Just an overwhelming victory. Like, say, what the Japanese did to Singapore.

Or if you want to write a really nasty story do it like the second Iraq war, in which the "curbstomping" was done with insufficient planning and knowledge, the puppet government installed was inept, there was a massive and effective insurgency, and it didn't end well for anyone except for a few contractors who made vast amounts of money from corrupt contracts.

No, some wizards are. And some wizards aren't. Kingsley Shacklebolt is good enough that not even the Prime Minister suspects anything, and is utterly shocked when he finds out he's a wizard. You're generalizing all wizards because of a few stupid ones we see.

The majority of wizards are half-bloods (Ch 7, Chamber of Secrets), meaning they have some connection to muggles. There's also muggle-borns, of course. To suggest wizards in general are confused about muggles and "completely inept" is stupid and unreasonable.

****** Given that wizards would be absolutely wiped out on the battlefield but are able to neutralise the Muggle militaries within an hour, it is difficult to imagine a setting where you would have a proper war which would last for decades or centuries unless some Vietnam like Gurellia scenario where most wizards die and the remainder takes up arm against the Muggle world, who developed countermeasures to mind control and apparation.

It is not rare to see such a scenario, but it is usually chapter 1 of a time travel story where Harry goes back to the past to fix things because usually, it is somehow Voldemort's fault. The conflict is never really central and used for more to set the "everything is shit in the future" mood.

******* They wouldn't nearly be able to neutralize muggle militaries within an hour. Or ever really. There's plenty of built in resistance to coercion and rogue agents that it would be nearly impossible to directly infiltrate. Unless of course you think that wizards have somehow infiltrated everything including the trident subs. That would take enough people (that a small population simply couldn't afford) that they might as well try and make their own army.

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!

** Marquis Black comes to mind. Emperor is his best and most well known story, although I'll point out that he changes the HP magic system into a mix of anime tropes. Magic in his stories is nerfed to basically being "any sufficiently advanced technology" and reduced to a numbers game: if the tank has more dps than the wizard's shield regen speed, the tank wins.

The West does. China has nowhere near as much terrorism as we do because they are an oppressive regime which ignores human rights. A Muslim blew himself up? Better deport a few million of them to "reeducation" camps. Is it humane? No. Should we do it? No. Does it work? Well, better than our blunders. Although I maintain the position that Syria would have been resolved 5 years ago if NATO had not supplied terrorists with weapons and money to fight an ally of Russia.

**** That is exactly what that would be. The idea that wizards win, because magic is automatically better than superior numbers, tactics, and technology is wizard wank. If you could just apparate in and imperius the government heads, Grindelwald would have won WWII for Hitler, before wizards got involved to stop him. Apperating into buildings is difficult. Casting the imperius is difficult. Heads of state do not congregate in a single area, and often require permission from a separate governing body to do anything useful.

** The only thing I have even vaguely close is the first half of chapter 3 of Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447/3/Amalgum-Lockhart-s-Folly]]). It is a Time travel fic and chapter 3 describes the future that harry comes back from, a world where voldemort's muggle hunts enrage the muggle world to strike back at the wizarding world. Is kinda a curbstomp though. How realistic it is, is up for debate.
