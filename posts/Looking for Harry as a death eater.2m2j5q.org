I don't care if he changes sides because he learns he has family on the dark side, falls in love with someone on the dark side (don't care if it's slash, anything goes), because Dumbledore is a manipulative bastard and the Voldemort is the lesser of two evils or because Voldemort isn't as evil as they make him out to be (like: He doesn't like muggles, but he doesn't ignore the fact that he himself is a halfblood and therefore wants to give the muggleborns that TRY to fit into the magical world a chance -> he really wants to protect the magical world or some stuff).

Bonus points if Harry is friends with Slytherins and if some of his cannon friends are also on Voldemorts side/switch sides after Harry explains it (like the twins, somehow I can't imagine it with Ron).

Oh yeah and please only completed stories or ones that have been updated regulary and recently. Happened too often when I didn't watch out for status that I got confused between several stories with a similar base story that only got updated every three months or something.

*** How heavy/serious is the "angst" part? That story appeared in a few of my searches but that always put me off. And who gets anxiety, Harry, the reader, the wizarding world?

** I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2538955/1/Time-to-Spare][Time To Spare]], Harry gets sent back in time, in one of the stupidest ways I've heard of, Voldy tries to send him 200 years in the past and /somehow/ messes it up. (He doesn't even seem to think about the possible impact of the butterfly effect on his very existence, and 200 years into the past isn't a good time anyway, 200 years in the future would be better, his power base would be solid as hell after all).

Anyway, he eventually does join the death eaters otherwise I wouldn't be posting on this, but remains against them, but whatever. Oh and he does become friends with a slithern, at least one. Though his friends don't switch sides as far as I know.

Despite plotholes a milewide, I enjoyed it.

Edit:

Not quite what you're looking for, but I also recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6206646/1/Be-Careful-What-You-Wish-For][Be Careful what you Wish For]] and it's much longer second book, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] Harry doesn't become a death eater, but after he offs voldy, he launches a crusade against muggles, along with Draco, Daphine, Neville etc. Almost everyone is with him against the muggles, with the exception of dun..dun..dun.. Hermine and Ron.

*** Thanks for the recommendation, I also like time travel fics so I'm definitly going to look at Time to Spare.

Also, while the other one/two depending on how you look at it might not be exactly what I'm looking for now, they do sound intresting, so I'm putting them on my list for later, so thanks for those too :)

*** I'm able to click the links and read the summary, so no problem with that ;)

A Father Devided sounds especially interesting, but I never stumbled over any of those, so many thanks for the recommendations.

** Just found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8704528/1/Enveloped-in-the-Darkness][Enveloped in the Darkness]] seems it was received pretty well and has a WIP sequel. I'll update, if you wish, as I am just starting and don't know much myself (like friends, House etc.)

**** I've read up to chapter 15. I've quite liked it so far. As stated in the summary Harry's upbringing is much more like that of Tom Riddles. Furthermore his magical control, and his conduct to school mates and general world view are all quite similar to TMRiddle. It didn't stick out as completely OOC to me but Harry isn't the same for all that (though my judgement may be clouded due to my thinking about/reading Tom Riddle Jr/Lord Voldemort stories recently). His interactions and friends and pals have fit his new personality and outlook. There is a bit of super power stuff like wandless that still seems a bit lame, despite it being explained in upbringing, but equally there is some powerful stuff that works and is intriguing IMO. On the whole not perfect, little roughness in the first few chapters, but I certainly think it is good enough to try. (Reading a little of some of the other suggestions here I would say this was better written than most of them and for my tastes more interesting and enjoyable so far.)

This is good to hear. I have no problem accepting AU backgrounds and the changes in persons that exist for that reason, but it has to be done in a way that makes sense somehow.

And I'm not too much of a quality snob. If there are no glaring mistakes (spelling, grammar or other), I'm fine if everything else is.. well, hobby author quality. We can't be all great authors who write fanfiction next to real projects :D

Put it in my list, thanks :)
