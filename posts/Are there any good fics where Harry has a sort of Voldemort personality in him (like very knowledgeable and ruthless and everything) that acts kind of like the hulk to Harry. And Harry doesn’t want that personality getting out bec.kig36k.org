#+TITLE: Are there any good fics where Harry has a sort of Voldemort personality in him (like very knowledgeable and ruthless and everything) that acts kind of like the hulk to Harry. And Harry doesn’t want that personality getting out because it is ruthless and remorseless.

I read a fic called linkffn(it's all relative on the hellmouth) that I enjoyed. Basically Harry is quite capable in his own right and has a monster in him that gets out when he gets to angry/loses control of himself.


** This is not a particularly strong recommendation, but /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ (HPMOR) does something like that.
