The British Ministry of Magic is a corrupt, ineffective sham under Fudge in canon (from memory at least).

What if that was kind wasn't really a secret to the rest of the world? Everyone hates working with the British, because it means working with /Fudge/, and no one wants to work with Fudge.

I can generally see the way they handle meetings with Fudge and his lot generally being something like "Just nod, smile, and get rid of them so we can get back to the /real/ work".

Basically: Magical Britain, under Fudge at least, is considered the laughing stock of pretty much everyone else. They keep a polite facade up, because it's honestly easier than dealing with the fallout of actually telling Fudge he's an incompetent fool, but few countries can honestly say that they /enjoy/ having official dealings with Magical Britain.


** The Bulgarian Minister of Magic openly fucks with Fudge during the World Cup Final. I think this pretty much /is/ canon.

"Certainly, minister. You ought to start preparing now, you'll be having a meeting with the British in 20 minutes?"

"Ah, yes, how could i forget? I've been looking forward to it, always a treat to meet with old friends, reminisce the past. Did i tell you that one about when me and Albus were chasing Grindelwarld all around Warsaw in 44'?"

"A few times, sir. However..."

"What?"

"It's not him, sir. They've sent their minister this time. Fudge, i believe?"

*** That was the moment a cloaked, masked wizard burst into the room and found himself held at wandpoint by the Minister and his guest. Not that he cared.

"Minister, we did it!"

"What did you do, Sebreyakov?" asked the Minister, stowing away his wand.

"We made the golem!" exclaimed the interloper "We didn't think we could get it done in time, it just could not remember not to sign anything, but we finally managed!"

"Really? That's excellent news! It can nod along with useless prattle?"

"Yes!"

"And say meaningless platitudes?"

"Yes!"

"And you've tested it?"

"Of course. Remember Umbridge, Minister?"

"I've been trying to forget, Sebreyakov, I've been trying to forget. What disaster happened now?" asked the Minister feeling the full weight of his office settle on his shoulders.

"No disaster sir! She just called ahead to confirm the appointment. We had W.I.Z.A.R.D talk to her! She didn't notice the difference!"

"Well, that is an excllent news! In fact... I thought I'd need something strong to last through the meeting, but this is news worth celebrating! Come, sit, Sebreyakov, Ivan. I've suddenly found my schedule clear for this afternoon!"

"How did the meeting go, Cornelius?"

"Excellent Dolores! I must say, even, better than ever! I've always thought he didn't like me very much, but he's been nothing but nice this time. Didn't even mention that drivel about You-Know-Who, or ask about Dumbledore once!"

"How about that dreadful thing with the Tournament? Did the agree to not push for their own investigation of Karkaroff's disappearance?"

"Ah, sadly we didn't agree to anything. But, but, he didn't push too much either. I've got to say, he's been a great fellow to talk with. A meeting or two more, and i'll surely get them to drop it"

/\/**back on the continent, R&D department****

"Srebryakov! How did our W.I.Z.A.R.D perform?"

"Without issue, chief enchantress. Brits didn't suspect a thing!"

"Good. Call the department for a meeting, we'll start the work on combat modules. We've got to earn our salaries!"

"Yes, chief Tanya, ma'am!"

**** Maybe the Unspeakables are the civil service? Nobody questions them and they just make things work in the background when they have leaders that were voted in in a popularity contest?

It would also explain how fast Hermione rose to power as she's actually competent and has actually read all of the law books to prepare for the job, so it reduces the amount of cleanup the Unspeakables have to do in the background, causing them to subtly push her to the top so they can get back to their hobby of mutant brain fighting or whatever else they mess around with in the DoM.

***** I don't think it quite fits, they seem far more like a research division than the civil service. I mean, Umbridge is "senior under-secretary to the Minister of Magic", that is the title of a civil servant.

This would actually be the worst nightmare of the Civil Service, they want someone who is a bit buffoonish and easily led. Hermione has a history of campaigning for reforms (house elves etc.), and would violently clash with the service on it's main objective: preserving the status quo.

** As an aside:

I know the first instinct is to equate Fudge to Trump, but Fudge was definitively ineffectual and resisted rocking the status quo. The lack of malicious intent means he's more in line with pre-Civil War presidents like James Buchanan or Millard Fillmore.

**** I've always thought of Fudge as a middle manager type person who's been promoted well beyond his ability and now he's making all the decisions he's rushing them in order to be 'seen to do something', without actually thinking through any of the decisions beforehand and refusing to change his mind once he's made a decision.

Due to this, if you get him at the right time of day you can subtly suggest solutions for his problems that profit you (Malfoy probably did this) and he'll latch onto them as a drowning man latches onto a raft. The more you suggest solutions the more trusted you become until he's contacting you to make suggestions for him. And before he knows it he's unconsciously placed himself back in that middle manager position where he was most comfortable.
