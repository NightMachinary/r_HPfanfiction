Though not making someone as attuned to the waves of destiny as a Seer, being a child beholden to a prophecy has the rarely discussed benefit of increasing an individuals aptitude for Divination.

By having a life, at least in part, dictated by Fate, an individual is made subconsciously familiar with how it moves and operates. Something Neville and Harry discover quite quickly in their third year.

And Voldemort too upon his return...


** As Hermione stepped into the boys' dorm room, she was met with a cloud of sickly sweet smoke and and a low, thumping beat coming from the Wizarding Wireless.

"What in Merlin's name is going on here?" She asked between coughs.

Harry barely glanced up from the multiple crystal balls he was arranging on the bedspread as he replied. "Divination. We're trying to figure out what Voldemort is up to. Neville, anything in the smoke yet? And where the hell is Ron?"

"Loo again and nothing yet, just a lot of half-formed animals" Neville replied.

"Argh, same for me! I keep seeing peacocks and nothing else! Ron needs to get back here and pick up the slack."

"In his defense, you have had him drinking a lot of tea."

Hermione decided enough was enough. "Don't you think this is a waste of time? We know how imprecise Divination is! And what on earth are /those two/ doing?"

Neville spared a look at Dean and Seamus, quietly giggling in the corner. "Oh, they're just along for the ride. The smoke can be...potent."

Hermione's expression became even more unimpressed. "Uh huh. And you're /sure/ this is a good use of our time?"

"Trust me Hermione," Harry said with a pleading glance. "We just need to figure out what the signs are telling us. We need to go through the books again and try and figure out the significance of peacocks. And get me more tea!"

"*Lucius!*"

Lucius Malfoy reluctantly approached the great hall of Malfoy Manor in response to the half-yell, half-hiss of his master. Things had been...tense since Lord Voldemort had decided to use divination to determine his enemies' plans.

The sight that greeted him upon entrance almost broke his composure - a riot of colors and smells that would turn the stomach of the most hardened butcher.

"Yes, my Lord?"

Lord Voldemort stood amongst the remains of his latest attempt, clearly unbothered by the blood and guts staining his clothing and hands. "Get me another peacock, I need fresh entrails to read. Potter is *up to something!*

*** Thank you, this is beautiful! I love reading when Harry and Voldemort are obliviously stupid and violently stupid respectively in near identical ways, haha

**** Yeah, I was really tickled by the idea of Divination actually working, but it being so specific that it's practically useless without other context

** I have always wondered why there don't seem to be any redo/timetravel fics where the characters have the usual "can't tell anybody otherwise will be studied by the ministry/executed/whatever" and pretend to be a seer instead. "I had a vision of Scabbers turning into a man."

On another note, I always preferred the idea that being the subject of a prophecy would make you worse at divination. If you see the future, then that fixes what you see as inevitable, so the more you use seer powers, the less able you are to actually affect the future. The flip side of this would be those who do change the future, e.g. those involved in prophecies, cannot look forward as that would fix the result, if that makes any sense.

*** I did read one (‘The many deaths of Harry Potter', every time he dies he resets to a past point) where he tried pretending he was a Seer for a while but can't pull it off lol. The actions he takes due to the foreknowledge he has changes the future so what he ‘foresees' doesn't actually happen and no-one believes him.

I think I've seen it done in one other fic too, a Tom/Harry time travel one.

*** In linkffn(11160991), Harry gets pulled into an alternate universe and the past. He uses his future knowledge to somewhat good effect, while disguising it with actual divination knowledge.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
