Title


** MoR is all I can think of off the top of my head.

I think you might like linkffn(Trial by Troll). And linkffn(Culture Shock) had a super-cool troll scene, but that might just be because I'll love anything with sci-fi.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** Could people stop downvoting stories just because they dislike them personally? The original post is asking for stories where Hermione dies in the troll attack. Right now, this is the only story in the comments that fulfils the criteria. If you don't like it, that's fine, but it's stupid to just downvote it.

  Yudkowzky is a funny and relatively talented writer, regardless if you support his offshoot-rationality mindset or his preaching. The fic stands on it's own as a entertaining read, and with writing better than the vast majority of other fanfiction. Give it a read, if you haven't.
#+end_quote

This entire statement is true. Frankly, the only issues with Yudkowzky's writing (from a technical point, not a plot/holy-shit-this-shit-he's-preaching-is-insane point) is the fact that he doesn't understand pacing and that long, didactic internal monologues happen way, way, way too often.

Sure, the wizarding society he has set up is ridiculous, because he

1. didn't actually read the Harry Potter books

2. assumed that what we saw of wizarding society in the books was the totality of it (when it came to things like logic, etc.)

3. set up the wizarding world as a strawman

And sure, the philosophy he is espousing is cult-like, and of the irritating 'I am so very super special smart' unique snowflakeism variety that just seems to piss people off.

But it is highly entertaining, and better than the vast majority of other fanfiction. Honestly, if you read it as crack (because of the ridiculous wizarding society, dementors as death representations, the humanism super Patronus and the utterly immature plans-within-plans-within-plans^{plans} variety of he-knows-that-I-know-that-he-knows-that-you-get-the-idea spy v spy stuff) it becomes a hell of a lot better.

***** The real issue with 2 is that it is a quite honestly infantile reading of canon, ignoring the reality of the not-fully reliable narrator.

And that is true with Indy!Harry, but I was only really discussing it in the context of MoR. Though yes, the strawman wizarding society is my least favorite part of Indy!Harry stories.

And honestly? When I started viewing it as a less serious work, I came to really enjoy MoR, because then it fulfilled my one guiding rule of reading HPFF: Does it entertain me enough to keep reading?

EDIT: Changed fanon to canon. Stupid typos.

Hmm, not by itself, no. It is bad if the author is trying to write a story that aligns with the world built by the original author, in which case it would count as not doing their research.

However, because “Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality” is a massively AU story, one in which the basic premise and the very baseis of the original story are taken and then everything else is built from scratch on top of it, instead of making it bad it makes for an interesting “what if” scenario due to all the world-building done for the story.

That being said, some of the things he did give an explanation to for his version of the story actually could be explained in a much better way. The bit about the gold and making money, for example, uses the old and trite “galleons are worth more gold but sold for that much only because both wizards and goblins are utter cretins and nobody ever had noticed for reasons that make no sense” thing, which does fit the setting and all but is kind of a poor man's exit from the problem. Though, of course, it is possible that in the world of his creation that simply is the case, but this means it is not because Rowling made it so but because he did.

** Shame there is only one example of Hermione dying in the troll attack although it's not surprising. Hermione is such a popular character and at the same time very important to the plot that removing her would give the writer a huge and difficult challenge.

Anyway the closest example I could think of is in Harry Potter without Harry Potter linkffn(7781192). In which Hermione is forced to leave Hogwarts by her parents after the troll attack.
