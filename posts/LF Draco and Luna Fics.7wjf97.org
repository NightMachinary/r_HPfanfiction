Sure, Hermione could open up Draco's mind to possibilities, however, Luna could reveal to him the impossibilities.

I have recently acquired a liking in Draco and Luna's relationship again. I mean, Luna was trapped in his basement for awhile... (I'm sorry)

It can be friendship or a romantic one, I'm down for either. Before, during, or post Hogwarts, just anything that involves those two as the main characters.

Also, to give some examples of what I would like, the fics below are my top favorite ones so far:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3624012/1/And-Things-that-Go-Bump-in-the-Night][And Things that Go Bump in the Night]] by The Treacle Tart is an extremely humorous story of Draco's interactions with Luna Lovegood.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7340133/1/Looking-through-tears][Looking through tears]] by Kailiata. The formatting is a bit strange, but the story itself is absolutely stunning. I adore how realistic Draco and Luna's relationship had grown into. It is not the sappy first sight of love kind of thing. They build their relationship to understanding and I love that in a fic.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11674288/1/The-Moon-Girl][The Moon Girl]] by xLillieRose. I read this awhile ago, so I can't give a proper review right now, however, I definitely recommend this story. From what I recall, it's a wonderful tragic kind of story.

  Held captive in the dungeons of Malfoy Manor, Luna Lovegood makes an impression on the troubled heir of the Malfoy legacy. She shows him kindness and hope one floor beneath scenes of terror and death; she shows him light in a place with only shadows. When she is free and at last they stand beside one another, will they clasp hands or will he leave her behind?
