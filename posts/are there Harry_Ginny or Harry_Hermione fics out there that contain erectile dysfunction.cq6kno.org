i got this idea partially from Breaking Bad, but maybe in the Fandom exist something similar, so Harry suffers an illness and a possible side effect of this is, that he cant get a hard on, like he and his Partner are used too. Or the Dysfunction is a symptom that shows first and later the Ill breaks out completely. Well, he goes for a treatment and as a side effect of this treatment (it was aimed for his Prime issue and not the Dysfunction), his potency not only comes back, but also more often then before he got the Dysfunction. Yes, through this Harry probably would get turned into a horny teenager like Adult, but its what im curious about.

â€‹

I leave it to the Fic if this "Hyperactivity" causes annoyance by his Partners or if they like this new activity of him (i can imagine, they would welcome it for a the First time, but at the latest, if the Partner reaches the menopause it becomes a Problem) I would like if Neither Harry/Ginny nor Harry/Hermione are married, but it would be no requirement.

** This reminds me of the Harry in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9615772/1/][Skeletons]], the multiple killing curses (or was it a quidditch accident?) don't do Harry any favors and at the time of this fic he has only a few years before he gets paralyzed from the waist down. He tries to get as much sex in his life before he can't anymore.

  We all have skeletons, when the Triwizard Tournament is hosted at Hogwarts to 'boost moral' and 'remember Cedric Diggory' all of Harry's secrets start to come out as he struggles with running the school and the tournament, working with his ex, facing a life changing injury and falling for his best friend! AU AFTER DH. Harmony. M for language and sexual themes!
