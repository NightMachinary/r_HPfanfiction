Whatever you think about the movie, there were some plot holes and confusing parts. Any recommendations for fics that help it out a bit. Can stick very close to canon or be completely divergent, fics from before either or both fantastic beasts welcome. Bonus if it works in what's going on in the muggle world but not compulsory.

*** I suppose I didn't really use the right word, more discrepancies in canon, like the presence of McGonnagal, Dumbledore teaching DADA instead of transfiguration, the clothing, Tina disarming Grindewald technically making her master of the elder wand, unbreakeable curse scars, and just some small nitpicking things. I'm choosing to believe that the whole things about credence will be explained in the next movie in a way that makes it possible for him to be the age he is because that's very timeline-breaking but I'm not labelling that a plot hole because it's obviously meant to be a mystery until the next movie.

we don't actually know how old she is in canon iirc. the retcon was to her pottermore writing

dumbledore told the DADA teacher to switch for that day because he's dumbledore and does what he wants. crack!reason: knowing students' fears is useful for manipulation reasons

movie choice because why wear silly looking robes when everyone can look like a smartly dressed model for vogue?

Even if you don't consider /Pottermore/ canon (and I think most people do, at least loosely), we actually do --- or, well, we don't know how old /she/ is, but we're told how long she's been teaching at Hogwarts at one point in /Order of the Phoenix/.

That explains why they made this choice, but it doesn't make it any less of a plot-hole in-universe. Of course, on that score, really the best anyone can do is throw one's hands up in the air and accept that it's just one detail of the film that really can't be canon --- otherwise we'd have to assume a random massive shift in clothing habits in the Wizarding World between the 1920's and 1990's.

which was my point. she could have done things before teaching. it was retcon'd on pottermore. the site changed it

***** Yeah you can handwave the Dumbledore thing and I understand why they changed the clothing for the movie even if I don't like it. I struggle to believe that mcgonnagal is that age but it's totally possible that umbrage got her data wrong which is where I got my guesstimate of her age from. It's just a bit messy hence my request for fics :)

In the screenplay it says Grindelwald dropped his wand and that Tina accio'd it, so not necessarily

***** I haven't read the books in a while so I might be wrong but is it because he's still alive and it was dropped? I remember it said the history of the wand was bloody and the first owner was murdered for it and grindelwald stole it from gregorvich I think. Grindelwald wasn't truly disarmed I think and he wasn't killed.z

****** In the original series ownership of the Elder Wand has changed without the previous owner dying or losing magically.

- Grindelwald -> defeated by Dumbledore and imprisoned for decades
- Dumbledore -> disarmed by Draco via Expelliarmus
- Draco -> disarmed by Harry Potter physically grabbing a different wand out of his hands

My verdict: The Elder Wand is a plot sensitive object that behaves however the writer(s) need it to at any given moment.

******* I've just headcannoned that Dumbledore seduced Grindelwald and stole the wand while "defeating him" in the process to earn its loyalty. Then he created the story of his duel and implanted memories and used a few compulsions on the nearest wizards to spread the tale of his victory.

​

Not to say Albus wasn't a capable wizard, just to say it should have been impossible to beat Grindelwald if Grindelwald had the Elder Wand and dueled him seriously.

*** That guy that gets his loyalty randomly questioned, and then randomly dies, because, oops, he's not loyal enough, gets my vote. Through the whole movie, I'm like, "Who the hell is/was that guy?" Is that a plot hole? I dunno, but it bugged me.

*** Not necessarily plot holes per say, but the lestrange plot was convoluted and not explained super well. Why were they going to America again, I think they mentioned it but don't really remember. And why did Leta quickly go back to Britain rather than stay in America. Why did they drop off the fake lestrange, whom everyone but leta thought was real, at an orphanage rather than the half elf lady raise him as seemed to be the original plan.

Also what was up with the magical fire dragon. How did it know who to burn and who not too, but even beyond that if we just assume Grindelwald was controlling that, why did it try to destroy all of Paris when he left. That doesn't seem like it would be useful at this point for Grindelwald's cause.

**** The fire looked like Fiendfyre to me. Grindelwald should be strong enough to control it as long as he is there and he can be fairly certain, that the aurors can keep it in check afterwards.

I feel like the whole Lestrange plot is filled with Grindelwalds lies, so we might have to wait for the series to continue for more answers.

***** It could be Fiendfyre, but I thought Fiendfyre would burn anything it touched, not allow anything to walk through it. Though it has never been explained in detail so I guess retconing it to not burning what the caster doesn't want to burn is possible.

However had Flamel not been there to tell everyone they needed to contain it, I don't know that they would have been able to, so counting on then to do so seems like a bit of a risk.
