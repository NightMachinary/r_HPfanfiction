Long fics would be preferred (80k words+) and completed fics only. They're the only two requirements I'd like on top of Harry disliking muggles. Bit of an odd request I know but I'd like to see some peoples take on it.

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

** Maybe a longshot, but I'd like to jump onto this post looking for a story in a similar vein. The fic has Hermione and Harry talking about Muggle rights, and Hermione is kind of shocked to discover Harry isn't as gung-ho about the topic as she had assumed. Not outright hatred, but more a repercussion of his childhood with the Dursleys. Not much to go on, thought I'd give it a whirl.

When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

  Harry Potter doesn't grow up in a world where other wizards know his name. At eleven, there is no giant to come and save him from his horrible relatives--- there's just Harry. At twelve, there are things going on that Harry is still too young to understand, but that doesn't stop him from landing smack dab in the middle of them.
