i'm having an issue with fanfiction, on chrome and safari it says that there isn't a secure connection. Is anyone else experiencing this ?


** I am having this issue! I can load it on my phone, but not my computer (same wifi connection on both). I've tried different browsers and fiddled with network settings, but no luck so far.

** I can load both the mobile and desktop site in Firefox and Chrome.

Try a different DNS server perhaps?

*** I tried adding 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 in network settings but no go. It seems to be a Mac issue as I can load the site from my boyfriend's desktop.

*Edit. I downloaded Firefox and it loads just fine. Still nothing in Chrome or Safari.
