Recently made a post and had great responses from multiple people about hp ff that hasn't been written and some were (i am assuming) authors themselves. My question is: is there a ff that has every chapter be a short story of a different HP ff written by a diff author. The ultimate goal may be to have reviews from people so authors get encouragement to write more on said short stories.

The post topic was on crossovers and a lot of them were on things I have never seen or watched and would love to get a glimpse of but not nessacairly read a whole story about (if that makes any sense). Let me know your thoughts on this and if something like this exists. Thanks!


** The closest I can think of is "The Bunny Pool" that was started by Genuka on AO3. A whole bunch of authors, including myself, post our bunnies in chapters. Some have exerts of what they thought it should go like. Anyone can claim a bunny, a bunny can be claimed by multiple people, and it not only has crossovers but straight up different genres.

Sorry for not finding exactly what you are looking for.
