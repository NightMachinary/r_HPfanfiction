I'm in the mood for a fic where Harry pulls to wool over the Dursley's eyes while living at Privet Drive, whether it be him having a feast in his bedroom while they eat tiny portions of Dudley's diet food downstairs or Harry escapes to extravagant places (via the cliche magic trunk or some other method) while they think he's locked away miserable in his room. I just want to read something where the Dursleys are smug and think they're in charge but Harry gets the last laugh.

Try Goblet of Fire, there's a scene exactly like that at the beginning.

*** That part of GoF has always been so satisfying to me that I've been hoping that there were more fanfics just like it
