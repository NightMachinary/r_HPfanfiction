Hit me with any stories where a lot of Voldemort's Death Eaters realize that their Lord is utterly unstable, and doing more damage to his own people then he is to any enemies to the cause, and thus start abandoning him in droves.


** [Self-Ad] I have written a one-shot on this idea from the other side as linkao3(16775806).

  The situation is completely around: Harry feels the need to help Draco, and he actually listens. What's going on? On Napoleon, Hitler, and why the hell Malfoys should ever support Voldemort?

** In my story "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief", Lucius does that, turning spy for Dumbledore (and covering for his allies Parkinson, Greengrass, Davies, Nott etc.).

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Canon! Karkaroff, Snape, the entire Malfoy family, Regulus, Pettigrew at the end there when he was going to let Harry go...

Seriously, fucking nobody wanted to be with Voldemort. :D It's hilarious just how many people betrayed him. He sucked.

*** How did he suck?

Wormtail let Harry go because he owed him a life debt and probably also because he felt tremendously guilty about his betrayal. Cant blame Voldemort for that.

The Malfoy's were with him for pretty much every moment it counted - only at the end did Narcissa stray and Lucius never did. They also only did so because they were thinking (irrationally) only for Draco - not Voldemort's fault either.

In Snape's case he was partly at fault; maybe he could have spared Lily. But really, why would he? Much of his success rests on the fear he incites - all who face him die. He spares her and he's left an implacable enemy in Lily who is a capable witch by all accounts and close to Dumbledore. Yes he loses Snape's loyalty in doing so but it was the right choice on reflection.

Karkaroff was a coward who outed his peers straight away. Was that Voldemort's fault for not inspiring more loyalty? Maybe. Theres only so much a leader can do, in the end, to secure loyalty. Men are men - some steel, some not.

His one true mistake was in putting too much stock in Regulus - using his elf without making sure Kreacher died. Even that didn't mean much in the end - had Regulus not acted Dumbledore would have claimed the locket much earlier than Harry eventually did.

Voldemort otherwise had legions of loyal followers who braved Azkaban and death for him.
