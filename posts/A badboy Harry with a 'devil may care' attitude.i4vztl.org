  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  Harry Potter is a thief and a lawbreaker long before he gets his letter. Upon discovering he's a wizard, he sets out for the wizarding world - but he's doing things his way. Dumbledore has no idea what his decision to leave Harry with the Dursleys has wrought. Harry/Multi, darkish, some Dumbledore bashing, rating may go up later.

** Luna would probably like Harry with a devil may care attitude because when draco kicked Harry in the face and Luna used episky (dont know how to spell it) to fix his nose but she asked if he wanted to stay that way so she probably likes boys who look “devil may care”
