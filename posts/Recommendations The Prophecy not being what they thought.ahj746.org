Any stories where there are different takes of the first prophecy that Trelawney predicted? Leading to a different out come?

What I don't want:

Harry/Hermione

Hermione/Draco


** linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor)

Hermione messes around naming pets "neither" and creating a new dark lord to fulfill the prophecy

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

** Hmm, it's not exactly what you're looking for, but maybe you may enjoy mine. I have an original prophecy in it as opposed to Trelawney's prophecy, so it kind of satisfies your different take on the prophecy requirement. Full disclosure, the prophecy chapter itself is not up yet, but it's written and will be posted soon. Anyway, if you wanted to check it out, that would totally make my day! :)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places][Trading Places]]

When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard as he learns to separate the magical fantasy world he's always known from its dark reality. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, Dan's happy days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. But what can Dan do, in Harry's place? And how high will the cost be... to switch them back?
