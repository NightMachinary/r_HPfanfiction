It's underwhelming how few decent/ readable stories there are for this crossover branch. I've been thinking I might as well as write my own.

For readers, what do you wish was out there? Personally, I would like to see more on spot characterization.

*** I've seen some, and one i don't wish is for Dimensional Travel to be a common enough occurance that ol dumbles can send Team Avatar in a mission or something like that. Aside from that, I wouldn't mind seeing something like how some FMA crossovers happen with Eddy getting flung into the Potter Verse during OotP in Grimmuld Place.

  The Gate was opening; the black arms stretched toward him and Pride. Ed knew he had no say in the matter. He would be pulled to this parallel dimension, alternate universe---whatever it was---and Amestris would be left to die. Truth merely grinned.

******* An ancient spirit-within the Spirit World- wants blood (preferably the blood of the Avatar). When a mortal interferes with their realm, it senses opportunity and hatches a plan. Avatar Roku senses it departing the Spirit World and fears this will cause an imbalance. Aang, having just defeated Ozai a mere day ago, is forced into another mission to save the world.

The summary is "meh" but I have a lot of ideas for this story that I think would make it very engaging. One of the story's main themes will be investigating the Avatar's role in the spirit world during their lifetime and then after death, with extra focus on their limitations.

I'm still picking cast members from the Gaang.

** I think part of the problem is the very, /very/ stark differences in the two mythologies of the work.

Harry Potter is a world that lives alongside the "regular" world. And the magic doesn't seem to have external sources acting in their own interests.

Avatar is a different world in its own right. Different animals, different cultures, primarily Eastern influence, and a magic system that couldn't be more different that Potter's.

It's an uphill battle for even the best of authors to make a crossover between these fandoms work.

Having said that, Avatar does have the best crossover fiction I know of. Stargate and Team Avatar anyone?

*** Astute observation.

Although, I think a story that acknowledges and explores the similarities and differences in their magic and culture as a theme in the story would be interesting.

I have not. I'm not all familiar with Star Gate.

** I enjoy crossovers (or AUs) where just the settings are merged, but not the characters. For HP/ATLA, this'd be either Harry Potter, but with bending instead of magic or ATLA, but with wand magic instead of bending. The parts I like most with those are the world building and seeing how they've interpreted parts of one universe in the other universe and seeing the effects the changed circumstances have on the characters. However, the changed universe needs to actually change things. Just changing the window dressing results in a boring fic. linkffn(Harry Potter: The Last Avatar by The Sorting Cat) would be an example for what I'm talking about.

Personally, I don't think crossing over main characters between ATLA and HP works well. If e.g. Zuko is suddenly transported to the HP universe, he'd have no knowledge at all about the world and no motivation to help either the Death Eaters or the Order or anyone else. It's possible to argue that someone like Harry or Aang would help out regardless because that's just how they are, but even so, they'd still need a reason.

On the other hand, if a character is born in another universe, they're basically an OC that borrows name and appearance from a character from another fandom. Both the HP characters and the ATLA characters grow and develop inside their respective universes, if you change that, you change their character. Harry that grew up first with the Dursleys and later with Hermione and Ron is going to be quite different from a Harry born and raised in a loving earth bender family.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night.

** I would have a actual way for the two to crossover, and for it to make sense. Send Harry to the Avatar Verse (especially since everyone send The Gaang to Hogwarts to protect Harry from School Bullies and the Late Spring Yearly adventure). But send Harry to the Avatar World and let him do stuff, let him be a hero, have him lead a rouge group of Earth Benders or something let him help the Gaang out, join them. To often with crossovers the Characters joining the other world kinda sits around they see what is happening or "help" defeating a group the Canon group was able to anyway but they have negligible effects on anything, often only stepping in for overblown moments of cool that often mean nothing.

One of the best HP/ATLA Story (which is sadly now lost) had Harry end up in the southern water village, just before they find Aang. Harry soon discovers he is a Fire Bender utilizing rare colored flames, Black. Harry joins the Gaang and acts as the muscle the enforcer they never had, he gets Suki to travel with them from the start. The point was that A) Harry had a role other than crossover Character and B) Harry became important to the Gaang, yet he never replaced Aang as the main character. Really thats all I want, have The Crossover mean something other that "lol look at how dumb/crazy/scary/funny this world is, hey I can Solo the Strongest here" and for the crossover Character to mean something but not become the main character of the adventure.

Also get the story the hell out of Hogwarts
