A really good ongoing fic, that details Draco's self-exile into the Muggle world, after Malfoys were stripped of their riches and wands.

The fic is kinda feel-good, it's optimistic and upbeat even at its lowest moments. Draco is kind of canon compliant, but after the war he suffers from severe self-esteem issues and a complete personality crisis. Overall, it's a coming of age story, that is clearly influenced by Salinger (which author acknowledged), but a little less decadent and more focused on overcoming limitations instead of running away from them (though Draco does try that a lot).

There's a lot of retrospection involved, as Draco looks back on the events from school and home and tries to see them for what they actually were. Also, we see his first connection to Astoria, though we do not know yet how exactly they are going to get together.

Book does have one weird quirk - at one point Draco discovers masturbation, and two-thirds of a chapter are primarily about it. From one point of view, that's too much detailed wanking in a story. From the other point of view - when I discovered masturbation, it rocked my world too, so Draco can be excused here.


** I like this story too. In canon and many fanfics we discover the magical world through the eyes of someone entering into the world for the first time. There's surprise, there's awe, there's a sense of discovery. I find that same sense of discovery in this fic, except it is the other way around, from the magical world to the muggle.

Here Draco is entering into a different culture and a completely different life than he is used to. He is not so much discovering a world as he is discovering a new life away from the demons of his past. Most importantly, Draco is discovering /himself/; he is actually thinking for himself for the first time in his life, now that his previous world-view has been proven to be untenable, now that he is way from the influence of his family and the expectations of his former society.

When Draco goes back to the wizarding world, he is going to be a much changed man. I look forward to how he handles the situation back home.

** I greatly enjoy this story. A fic that actually has Draco being the pathetic, mediocre fool that he is in canon? Finally.

The pacing is slow, but major changes to a person takes time, and Draco needs/needed to first figure out who he was. However, in the currently 45 chapters, about 3 years I want to say have passed by, so pacing isn't HPMoR bad.

[[/spoiler][If you read the author's other fics --specifically Ravenclaw, Ravenclaw? Ravenclaw!-- you'll find out that his wife isn't Astoria, but rather a woman named Vivian. And it's implied she's a Muggle. Just because the fic starts from a canon position, doesn't mean the outcome is canon.]]

*** Ah. Well, these news killed a /little/ bit of my payoff anticipation (mostly, because seeing Draco interact with a member of his former circle would be fun), but the fic is still great.

And yeah, three years in 45 chapters isn't that bad. Bennybear definitely manages to keep the book entertaining despite the slow pace. I especially like their idea of changing the refrain - despite the fact, that each summer starts in the same village, every time both village and Draco are different enough to make their interactions very fresh.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
