Hello! I absolutely love all powerful harry where his animagus form is a dragon or he can wield fiend fire on his enemies like a boss. Any fics that spring to mind? I absolutely hate incomplete fics. It simply hurts too much when I find out there aren't any chapters left. But good complete fics I would highly appreciate. Good day to you

It's the first in a series, Harry is OP and very entertaining.

#+begin_quote
  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.

*** In fact, the majority of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1282867/mjimeyg][mjimeyg's Harry Potter fanfics]] fit the proposed criteria. Most of them involve him becoming some sort of king or leader, often to his objections.

has a BAMF-veteran-Harry being thrown back to the start(ish) of Voldemort's rise... he is having a drink at a muggle bar when preDeathEaters storm in, and he smacks them down.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I just reread Runic Animagi by Kassien this week. It's complete and has the requested dragon animagi. Great story, hope you like it.
