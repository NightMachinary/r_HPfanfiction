** Well.......to be honest, I find that a rather inappropriate question and it would be some kind of media suicide for him to even try to answer it. Something would get misunderstood and suddenly he's either a "homophobe" or "sexual deviant who swings both ways" (or he thinks Harry Potter is one or the other).

You always have to consider,when asking these questions, that Daniel Radcliffe (and others) are /very/ public figures and anything they say can easily be twisted if they're not careful.

I also find it a bit silly to basically say that all hp fanfiction is just slash, because there is a tremendous amount of fanfiction without pairings or hetero pairings (Hermione/Harry, Hermione/Draco, Ginny/Harry, Hermione/Ron, Ginny/Draco, etc).

Basically, in my mind, asking Dan Radcliffe this question is the equivalent to asking Alan Rickman how he would feel about re-making the HP series with a sexual relationship between Snape and Hermione.

Sorry...but it's just not appropriate. *IF* you had just asked how he felt about fanfiction in particular and what he thought was the funniest pairing he heard of, then that's great. But, unfortunately, I feel you crossed a line and it felt uncomfortable.

Sorry if I came off as rude; I'm just honestly stating my thoughts on this.

*** First of all, the actual series already has a million hetero pairings. The only homo pairing is only alluded to in the very vaguest of terms, so much so that Rowling had to actually have a press conference to announce it for anyone to actually realize it was there. And it has a spectacularly UNhappy ending.

Second of all, Daniel Radcliffe has already one film where he has an EXTREMELY explicit sex scene with a man, and I believe Rupert Grint did as well in Cherry bomb. Besides that he's gone fully nude on stage in front of a live audience.

Third I'm fairly certain he's already discussed who he'd like to do a male on male sex scene on a late night british talk show

Fourth, the previous show I mentioned "Skins" is the iconic british teen television show, and the amount of shagging that goes on between people of ever gender on that show is ridiculous. I doubt most people in the UK would care and considering the gay sex in his recent film has done nothing to tarnish the American love for Daniel Radcliffe, I doubt that a question on Reddit is going to destroy his image.

Fifth, seeing how recent Rowling's interview was, its a relevant question.

**** I was just giving my honest thought about it. If you had merely discussed slash in general, it would have been interesting, but I felt that it went a bit too far. Especially seeing that Harry Potter is actually a series for children. Like they say in Firefly, "we try not to (overly) sexualize (them)" in public because children read the books.

Also, just because it's on reddit doesn't mean it stays on reddit. When Robert Downey Jr did his AMA, he confirmed they were working on a new Sherlock film. The next day, five news articles from different sites announced the same thing, misquoting or jumping to conclusions. Same with any other celebrity AMA, you have people scouring them for details that could make an interesting article.

And just because they've done a sexual performance in another genre/show doesn't mean that they feel comfortable answering a question.

Rowling confirmed the sexuality of characters, she didn't go into detail saying Harry should have various underage and explicitly sexual relationships with other characters in every chapter. That's one huge thing: Harry Potter is underage throughout the series (except for DH). The only books they might be willing to do would be HBP and DH, and, to put sex and sexual relationships at the front of the series undermines the rest of it. Also, if they did do the earlier ones the focus on the main character's storyline would be taken away by simply having an 11-year-old engaging in a lot of sex (hetero or homo). I think that this point, especially, needed to be clarified in your question. Because, like I said, Harry is underage for the majority of the series.

A a fanfiction perspective, it's a neat concept. However, realistically speaking, I don't even think JK Rowling would have answered it. I just don't think it was appropriate or something he (Dan) wanted to answer. Or perhaps Victoria thought it was inappropriate and didn't read it to him (depending on the way they did it). Would I like to have known an answer? Perhaps. But, I don't think it was appropriate in the context that Harry Potter was a children's book, starring underage youth.

All I did was provide my opinion and I'm sorry if I offended you but I, personally, thought it was an inappropriate question.

Like I said, maybe if it was a more general slash question, he might have answered. But, in my opinion, I didn't feel it was very appropriate.

Again, I apologise if I have offended you. It's just my opinion. I have nothing against homosexual relationships or sex in fanfics (I have written my fair share of oneshots and sex scenes), but I think that the wording, what it suggested, and the omission of discussing Harry being underage, made it sound inappropriate (to me).

Sorry if I came off as rude or offensive.

***** Actually in the UK the age of consent is 16

****** I am fully aware of this, which is why I said they /may/ include HBP. But for 5 out of the 7 books, he is /under/ 16. However, there is an addition to this law, stipulating that it is illegal for an individual over 18 who is considered in a "position of trust" to have sexual relations with anyone under 18 (Section 47 of the Sexual Offences Act, 2003). So that would definitely complicate things depending on the relationships.

I think that the idea you have would have worked best in the last two books, and perhaps as a pre-epilogue, post-final battle series. But it wouldn't work for the first 5 books at all, as it is pretty inappropriate (and most likely illegal) to sexualize anyone under the age of consent.

We just have to consider that just because explicit sexual relationships work in certain shows/contexts (e.g. Skins or True Blood), it doesn't mean it would work in the Harry Potter series. /Could/ it work? Possibly, but it would mean completely reworking a lot of the series, especially the ages of the characters, and possibly undermining the real story that JK Rowling created.

******* Anyway, the AMA is over and he didn't answer the question so I'm done with this but personally I think its more important to remain true to life than it is to be politically correct. The mode average age in America since the 1920's to lose your virginity has been 12 (as in adults late in life were asked what age they lost their virginity). Personally, I started a sexual relationship with my best friend when I was 11. Characters can have sexual relationships without anything explicit being shown on screen. Heck, [Harry rolls over in bed and smiles at Ron drooling on the pillow beside him. He rubs his hand on Ron's arm and Ron's eyes flutter open. "Morning." Ron says with a yawn before smacking his lips and give a contented smile, his hair entirely a mess. "Good morning, you were amazing last night." The boys kiss briefly. "You too. I guess we ought to get dressed before someone sees us in bed together. (he nuzzles Harry's neck) We wouldn't want that would we?"]

Seriously, not hard. It was a joking question, not serious, but it WOULD have been nice if there'd been an openly gay student somewhere in the books. I mean really, give the Weasley's a younger effeminate male cousin. Heck, show how cool the magical community is where being gay has never been a problem. Make it one of Voldemort's rallying cries about how inferior muggles are, that they'd abandon their own children for loving someone because of the way they were born.
