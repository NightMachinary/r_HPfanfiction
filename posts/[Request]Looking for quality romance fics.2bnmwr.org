I'm looking for /good/ romance fics, preferably Harry centric. I don't mind slash, as long as Snape isn't even considered a thing. Preferred pairings are anything unconventional and generally unexplored, but I don't mind Harry/Hermione or Harry/Ginny. Timeline preference would be years 4-6, but I'll read anything if it's actually worthwhile.


** Would you be open to a unconventional pairing for Neville? I don't to my knowledge think it's explored.

It's 6th year Neville/oc, but the OC is Draco's twin sister. It's my WIP and almost at 300,000 words. Very romance based, but also kind of tries to show what Draco and the other Slytherins are going through.

*** I've seen it before, but honestly I've never really liked Neville as a character. It's a bias on my part, I just really have no interest in him.

** One of my favorite Romance fics is called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/798255/1/][Checkmate]] by Naadi. It's a Drarry fic so it's definitely Harry centric. It's just out of your preferred timeline as it takes place 7th year (it is canon through GoF I think).

** I'm not much for most romance stories, so these will tend to be atypical. See what you think.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/The-Twine-Bracelet][The Twine Bracelet]] by CheddarTrek. Colin Creevey/OC. Short, sweet oneshot - click it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539035/1/Point_Game][Point Game]] by Silens Cursor. Harry/Tonks

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2925850/1/Everything_About_You][Everything About You]] by Lucullus. Probably the finest Harry/Pansy work out there. Inspired a story of my own that never got off the ground, available as part of my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900724/3/Seven-Deadly-Drabbles][Seven Deadly Drabbles]] story (the Auror training one would have eventually been Harry/Pansy with a similar relationship to this).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3943025/1/Antithesis][Antithesis]] by Watermage. Watermage's great comeback to fanfiction after a long hiatus, and how glorious it was. Harry/Ginny.

*** I've read 'em all besides for Everything About You, I've been following DLP writers since I joined the forum like 8 years ago. Really enjoyed The Twine Bracelet, tons of feels for such little content.

** Isolation by Bex-Chan The Good Morrow by Anyavioletta Witchcraft by a Picture by Anyavioletta

Three really heavily impacting ones I've read this past year. The Good Morrow is soul-rending so be warned.
