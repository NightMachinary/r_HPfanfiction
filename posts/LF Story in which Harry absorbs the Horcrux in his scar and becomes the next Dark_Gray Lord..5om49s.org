I'd prefer a stern Gray lord who does what needs to be done to achieve his goals over an insane Dark lord who kills for fun, but either is good. No Slash also, and preferably Harry/Hermione or Harry/Luna,

Thanks!

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

** linkffn(11574569) Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches

That one fits pretty well, and seems well-written. It's also WBWL, Harry/many, and time-travel, so it might not be your thing.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
