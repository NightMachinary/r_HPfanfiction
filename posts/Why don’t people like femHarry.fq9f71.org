I've noticed on a lot of requests people specify fem!Harry as something they don't want to see in a fic. I'm just curious about why this is such a popular view. What don't you like about fem!Harry fics? Is there anything that a fic could do to make you read it regardless?


** Some of them are cringe-inducing because of any romantic pairings they have. Also, when they feature rape or near-rape as a plot twist to add "drama", I want to barf. They also tend to stereotype girls.

I have read a few good ones that don't make me cringe. I prefer if they are gen, but for some reason the gender switch tends to go along with a romance.

I like Always a Girl!Harry better than "Suddenly a Girl Involuntarily", but I would read a Trans!Harry that was well-written.

ETA: If there is interesting magical detail, cultural details like wizarding religion, or intricate plot, I am more likely to read it. A long (100,000 words or more) story is more appealing, as is one that is completed or regularly updated.

** I don't like it most of the times because the fics with FemHarry that I've read focus all the plot hole in Harry being a girl and just doing girly things, like they use a lot of stereotypes and don't developed the charactes very well

*** IMO 3 is a perfectly valid excuse, as long as it ultimately leads to a genuinely different experience. Which is rarely the case. Slytherin!Harry or other house fics have similar problems, most just rehash canon which makes the switch largely pointless.

I have nothing against fem!Harry per se, just most fics with it.

** I like FemHarry as long as it is done as a single point divergence (only Harry's gender changed, nothing else). That little change has a ripple effect (eg Ron would not be Harry's best friend because they spend less time together, and the dynamic with Hermione would also be different because they spent a lot of time together before the troll, IF that happens at all) which ought to be explored. Maybe the whole train ride to Hogwarts goes differently and Harry wants to end up in Hufflepuff because she befriended Hannah and Susan, who both go to Hufflepuff before she is sorted. Or maybe Harry influences them to end up in Gryffindor for some reason.

Canon does not have a power disparity between the sexes which would explain a patriarchal society, so I roll my eyes whenever that makes an appearance.

I am also partial to "Harry is turned into a girl" fics, as long as Harry does not start to act stereotypically girly. He would not, for example, be fine with dresses the next morning and any change in thinking patterns would come slowly.

Of course, the one annoying thing about FemHarry fics is that it is used to sell slash ships as straight, and most of those are unbelievable IMO. Harry/Justin FF or the like would be fine, but Harry/Malfoy is wrong no matter which bits the participants have.

*** Wait I'm curious as to what you like about the fics in which fem!Harry is the only divergence from the plot. Does that mean the rest of the fic is basically the Harry Potter plotline with a different name and pronouns? And why does that appeal?

I agree with most of the plot diversion examples you list that result from genderbending Harry are usually bad stories (and result in Mary Sues) but the reason I like fem!Harry fics is the potential to make more intelligent plot divergences based on the intricacies of the different ways gender is treated.

**** Single Point of Departure means that there is one specific thing where the plot splits off of canon. In this case, OP is saying that when the only thing that changes is Harry's Gender, it leaves room for ripple effects to change everything. It's the idea of what affect the change would have had on canon without adding anything. Just Harry was born a girl, as opposed to Harry was born a girl and is also part dragon in a world where everyone is smart magical creature.

**** Most FemHarry stories I've read had an involuntary change around year 5, so you are in the interesting part of the plot. And I've noticed that the most enjoyable bits were the ones which did not have the extra inventions, plots or themes but were just Harry as a girl. And at that point, Harry should not be significantly changed by a change of reproductive organs.

And what you mentioned about the intricacies is pretty much what I'm talking about. If FemHarry is suddenly into a marriage contract or the like, that's just bad writing IMO. But if you can trace back your changed plot to your divergence, that's interesting. And obviously that can snowball into a very different fic very quickly. But a FemHarry fic which also has her super intelligent and evil is more than a single point divergence unless the author provides a reasonable explanation on how that's related to Harry being a girl.

Because most fem!Harry stories are porn, and the author doesn't want to go (thanks $DEITY) into the underage sex world.

****** Years 1-3 are rather trivial when it comes to the problems Harry has to face. Year 4 can be solved by "compliance to the letter" where Harry just sits around and deliberately loses the tournament, but is the first time where Harry is thrown into a bad Situation rather than ending up in one because he stuck his nose where it did not belong while all adults were incompetent.

** I hate gender swapping fics. I can suspend my disbelief about a lot of things, I don't mind canon- divergent sexualities, house changes, what have you. I think they can be exploratory and can be fabulous stories. But fem!harry/snape/draco, whoever, is typically an excuse to make a character stereotypically girly, or better yet, a “Tom boy”, or so they can have a hetero romance. I guess the question isn't why do I hate stories that swap out characters genders for no real reason, but why would I ever want that? If I want a female point of view I read about female characters, we don't need to invent them.

**** Most of the femHarry stories I have seen have been hetero romances- assuming Harry was born female rather than coming out as trans, a potions accident, whatever. Or, making two male characters into female characters for some femslash action. Seems thoroughly pointless to me. Other people like it, that's cool, whatever. I don't, and there are plenty of fics that run with my tastes so I'm not going to waste my time reading something that holds no interest for me.

** In a number of cases, (some but not all), I find gender swapping Harry is just the authors way of writing a slash story but being able to say it's not slash. If I want to read a story of Harry getting it on with a guy, I will read a slash story.

** I don't dislike an effeminate Harry but gender-bent Harry is something I steer clear from usually, unless very well written. I think for me it messes with the poetic justice of how Harry and Tom were the same but turned out different.

They were similar in their gender, upbringing, appearance, blood status, parsletongue ability (horcrux inheritance asside), Heir of a founder, sought out "immortality" or an escape from death, etc. But, Harry and Tom's reactions, reasons, and paths were very different. They were equals in every sense, but opposite.

While gender is a very minute part of that, for me it sets the balance askew just enough to set off my OCDP.

*** A bad character is a bad character, no matter what's between their fictional legs.

If anything, I'd argue that switching the gender dynamics would be more interesting with some of the stereotypical male characters. For example, "Macho Chick" is an original spin on the "Macho" trope/character because women usually do NOT act like James Bond, Barney Stinson or "generic supersoldier". If a guy is running and gunning in torn clothes because his home is overrun by terrorists or thugs, or being an ice-cold politician in a global crisis, that has been done 469496 times before. Switch the guy for a gal and you have something which is a lot rarer.

** most of those tend to be about romance, and while i do read romance on occasion, it's only when romance is the main plot, not a subplot which derails the whole story and ends up being a chore to read through.

For example;

a story about two people falling in love and trying to defy social expectations and being part of a rebellion where the girl has to make her choice between love and her family/duty to her country? yes I've read that, like twice now

or a story about a girl joining a rebellion and two guys are now in love with her vying for her hand and she doesnt know what to do? i dropped that the second when one guy's overly detailed description crossed my eyes

** I don't specifically /not/ like fem!Harry. My main problem is, I love to relate to characters. Harry, however, has a pretty unique child hood, which is hard for me to relate to except in certain ways. One of which, is that he's male. I may try a fem!Harry fic sometime, but it'll have to be easy to separate Harry and... Harriet, or whatever.

Also, aside from relating, I just love Harry's character so god Damn much, it's hard for me to read fics where people change it, unless they change it enough that I can (yet again) easily separate Canon Harry and fic Harry.

Edit 1&2: spelling mistakes.

** Actually there are plenty of good fem!Harry stories linkao3(Victoria Potter) for example. The reason most people prefer to read stories that don't have it is mostly to escape any romantic-centric story because gender-bending is classically used to make some pairings.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

** The entertainment industry having a run of terrible gender swap projects motivated solely by a desire for political cred? Bound to raise some hostility to the trope.

Second would be that most of them pair Harriet romantically with either Draco or Snape in the same style of story popular in slash. If you hate the "they're just misunderstood and really love him" crap, then changing the MCs junk isn't suddenly going to make it a good story. (Same issue with Bakugo in MHA to name another ship's captain I find enraging.) Although outside of Neville and Cedric there really isn't a lot of decent boyfriend material mentioned for fem!Harry admittedly.
