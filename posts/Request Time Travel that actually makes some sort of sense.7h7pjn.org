For instance freeing Sirius and throwing Peter in Azkaban, it would be difficult for the Tri Wizard Tournament to happen so it just doesn't happen, or it happens differently so that Harry isn't apart of it.

I don't get the people who do time travel and have similar or the same things happening, the point of time travel is to do things differently after all.

Also not doing anything about Quirrell, wouldn't you want him to be stopped sooner? Or take away Tom's diary that Ginny is going to write in or a number of other things.

Those were just suggestions as well so if you have anything else that they would do differently because of time travel let me know.

I'd also like the characters to know early or as early as possible that the person is a time traveler. I know most stories in general have them finding out, but it normally isn't until later on in the story; wouldn't you want to tell someone as soon as you could so that they could help you? Especially if you were suddenly an eleven year old again, you'd need more help.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash.

NO character bashing.

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Note it doesn't have to be centered on the Golden Trio Era, it can be any era.

I'd rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione; any other pairing is fine.


** Here is a list of time travels that BUST the timelines:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8669569/1/Don-t-Waste-It][Don't Waste It]], linkffn(8669569): one shot only, but with Wormtail and very much in character

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/Doubting-Thomas][Doubting Thomas]], linkffn(5492188): another one shot, but very nice

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455): basically an one-shot, but the only fic that has Hermione killing Tom Riddle instead befrieding/raising/shagging him.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days.
