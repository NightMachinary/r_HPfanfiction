As the title says, I'm looking for a story I read in the past but can't entirely remember who wrote it or what the title was. It was a Harry/Ginny story and most likely posted on fanfiction.net or siye.co.uk. I can't remember the overall plot, but can describe a scene very well and I can't find the story the scene is from.

I think the scene takes place at the beginning of a chapter, but can't be completely sure. Arthur wakes up in the morning to find that he can't hear anything because Harry and Ginny had accidentally completely silenced the Burrow when attempting a silencing charm for their room. Arthur then leaves to get Bill to undo the silencing charm since he can't do nonverbal spells that well. I'm pretty sure he goes to Shell Cottage to get Bill and is worried about not waking Fleur, so I think it's post-war. When Bill asks if Arthur is mad, he says he isn't and just asks Bill not to tell the other siblings so they won't tease the couple.

So does anyone know which story this scene is from? Please and thank you!
