I've been reading some fanfics were Harry gets saved from Patunia and Vermon by Snape. He usually says something along the lines "If you had died Lilly would have raised Dudley as her own" so I thought it would be interesting to see it happen.

Edit: Everyone who is commenting about my spelling english is my second language so chill

The Family Potter by dirgewithoutmusic

This is one of my favourite pieces of fanfic period, and fits your brief pretty exactly!

  Lily remembered her sister, how there had been a time she was curious and delighted about magic, before it slowly sank in that she could look and not touch.The last thing Petunia had said to Lily before she died was a chilly goodbye, ending a holiday dinner where they'd had a shrieking row in the entryway. Petunia had said 'freak' and Lily had hissed 'better than this, better than this being my whole fucking world, Tune, do you even see yourself, are you happy--'And now here was Dudley Vernon Dursley fussing himself to sleep as Lily walked the halls of the Godric's Hollow house. His tiny soft hands with their tiny soft fingernails curled under her chin, the same way Harry's always had.She passed James, who was gently bouncing his way up the hall the opposite way. "I think he's asleep," James mouthed over Harry's tousled head. His hair was the same mess, his head bent down as he peered at his sleeping son.Lily stopped where she stood, her nephew heavy on her chest, her husband smiling, her sister buried. "James," she said. "How are we going to do this?"

I'm working on one now, but it's not really what you're looking for - James and Lily are still dead, Petunia and Vernon are still alive but they're never getting the boys back, Dudley is a wizard, and the boys are raised (with an aged-up Teddy and an OC little sister) by Remus, Sirius, and an aged-up Tonks.

** I don't know why those two would die, but I guess in some circumstance where the Potters survived Voldermort or he never found out about the prophecy and the Dursleys died in some regular circumstance like a car crash then that could work. If they take him in as young as Harry was taken in then Dudley wouldn't grow up to be such a brat as his parents and Vernon's family were the ones who turnwd him rotten. He'd grow up in a magical household with Harry as his brother. With seeing how James and his friends act he'll turn out jovial and fun loving. He'd be all for pranks and would probably go around pulling pranks with his brother, Harry. Then they'd be scolded by Lilly who then fusses with James about how his bad habits are rubbing off on them. Since he has no magic he'd might get a little jealous down the line with being surrounded by wizards and witches but not having any power of his own. Not that the Potters would hold him being a muggle against him of course. They might even set up play dates with some child squib so he has someone to relate to with growing up with no magic in a magic community. He can't go to Hogwarts so they'll probably send him to a muggle school. He and Harry would send each other letters constantly with Harry mostly talking about how cool and mysterious Hogwarts is and probably complaining about Draco and Snape if Snape turns out to be a bully to Harry this time around that is. If that did happen then word would get to Lilly and she'd send a howler to the school demanding to know why Snape is being so unfair and immature to Harry and threatening to come down there or something similar that a scary, pissed off mom rants about to the school and their staff when their kid is treated bad.

I could get past the middle names, Hermione sounding 6 when she's 2, and even the character bashing because I love Harry and Dudley as brothers fics and they're so rare... Then 11 year old Harry gives Hermione a promise ring and acts like he's her husband, and none of the adults are concerned, and I'm done. Seriously? If you don't want to write about an 11 year old then skip to 6th/7th year!
