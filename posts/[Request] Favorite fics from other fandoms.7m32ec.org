  My AU retelling of ME1 in a darker, sinister universe. Much darker and more realistic views of the SA and the Citadel Council, a more dangerous, involved Cerberus, and a more conflicted Saren and Benezia. Changes much of the ME1 dynamic to remove plot holes with more focus on politics, military strategy, and space combat. Pairing is FShep/Liara. Rewritten through Chapter 12 so far.

** Here is an incomplete list. I might go back and add more as I remember them.

*Borderlands*\\
Linkffn(10382706), Linkffn(10656698), and Linkffn(10749093), all by CGAdam, are all great Borderlands fics. The first, /Leaving Pandora is Hard to Do/, is set soon after the events of BL2. They capture the spirit of the games as well as the humor. Sadly, the third one, /Still Hunting After Not So Many Years/ is dormant and possibly dead. But they are still worth a read.

*Borderlands/Mass Effect*\\
/No Gods, Only Guns/ (linkffn(8930158)) is dead, but still worth a read. It's a great mashup of the two universes. It's just as zany as Borderlands, but set in the wonderful world of Mass Effect.

*Mass Effect*\\
/Second/ (linkffn(6128675)) is a short but very good fic exploring the tensions between Miranda and the crew of the Normandy. Set during ME2.

*Elder Scrolls/Inheritance*\\
/Dragons/ (linkffn(8532059)) is also dead, but is in my personal top ten fics of all time. It balances humor and plot very well, while poking good-humored fun at both universes. The author explains both worlds fairly well. The fic features the Dragonborn being summoned to Alagaesia and his reluctant alliance with the Varden. The Dragonborn is a lot of fun and he strikes up an unlikely friendship with Arya.

*Star Wars*\\
Sarah1281, known here for /Oh God Not Again!/ and /When in Doubt, Obliviate!/, has written several fun Star Wars fics. /So Not My Problem/ (linkffn(5672156)) is a /very/ humorous retelling of the events of KotOR, featuring a Revan that really doesn't want anything to do with the plot. Its sequel, /The Jedi Kind of Had it Coming/ (linkffn(6726529)), romps similarly through KotOR II's plot with a very naive Exile and a still exceedingly reluctant Revan. The author also wrote a fic in a similar style, /Affably Evil/ (linkffn(11200645)), which explores what might have happened if Malak was capture instead of Revan. It's quite entertaining.

/This Wasn't in the Brochure/ (linkffn(4289720)) is a must-read for anyone who enjoyed the X-Wing books. Hobbie and Wes are on vacation, but as usual for them, things don't quite go as planned. It's not long, but it's written well and captures the spirit of the X-Wing series very well.

*Overwatch*\\
I don't read much Overwatch fanfiction, but there are a few good ones among the angst and heavy shipping fics. /Apocalypse, One Man/ (linkffn(12061036)) is an in-progress Roadhog-centered fic that explores how well (and poorly) he fits in with the rest of the Overwatch heroes. It's got hints of potential Roadhog/Mercy, but it's only one of several interesting plot threads.

/Accidental Genius, Intentional Stupidity/ (linkffn(11992883)) is another decent one I've found. It's still in-progress, but is being updated regularly. It's an adventure/drama fic that most closely follows Roadhog and Junkrat, but other Overwatch heroes get plenty of screentime. There's plenty of humor, and each character is well-written. Definitely worth a follow.

*Pokemon*\\
It's hard to find a good non-angsty, non-dark Pokemon fic set in the game universe, but /Speak Up/ (linkffn(7001716)) is about as good as they come. It's fairly lighthearted and is a quick enough read given it's slightly over 150k words. It's a retelling of the Kanto game storyline with an in-universe explanation for the player character's muteness.

I also second, third, and fourth /The Game of Champions/ (linkffn(7354757)). It's just amazing.

*Artemis Fowl/Avengers*\\
I'm not much for the fanfiction of either of these fandoms, but /Thrower of the Dart/ (linkffn(11231872)) was pretty solid. Merge the worlds of Artemis Fowl and the Avengers, and you might as well get this fic. Artemis is a bit OP in the story, but it's written well and is engaging throughout.

*** I certainly backup the recommendation of The Game of Champions (though perhaps with the caveat that it hasn't been updated in 2 years). For Pokemon fics, I'd heartily recommend Pokemon The Origin of Species linkffn(9794740) which does it's best to make the setting realistic while being amalgamation of the game world with pieces of the anime (with maybe a sprinkle or two of the manga)

At this point for me HPMOR is at best something of a guilty pleasure if I want to turn my brain off, probably partially because it was one of the first HP fics I ever read. And if you turn out to not like Origin of Species, That's no skin off my back. But I rarely go off the reservation of HP and Naruto fics so when I find a piece in another fandom I like I'm happy to pass it on.

  Ancient artifacts of immense power. Murderous synthetics. Ruthless megacorps. Unscrupulous mercenaries. Genocidal stellar god-machines. Incompetent galactic governments. Claptrap dubstep. The horrors of the galaxy are many, but there's one thing a good, mentally-unstable fortune-seeking antihero can rely on: the gun at his, her, or its side. Mass Effect/Borderlands fusion.

** linkffn(Dark Vader Hero of Naboo) is perhaps the most entertaining Star Wars fanfic ever. It's a bit slow to update but undeniably awesome.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-song-of-ice-and-fires-that-werent-all-my-fault-asoiaf-dresden-files.336499/][A Song of Ice and Fires that weren't my fault]] is the ASOIAF Dresden Files crossover you always wanted to read and never knew you did.

linkffn(Something That Will Last) is in my opinion, the best most heartfelt Mass Effect Fanfiction ever written.

Someone already linked Shinji and Warhammer 40k. I don't know if your brain is ready for the amount of mind melting awesomeness that fic has. It's like if someone took the world of Eva, mixed in 40k, and then made the entire world run on the same rules as Tegen Toppen Gurren Lagan.

** *Bridge to Terabithia*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3718824/1/Stars-Over-Terabithia][Stars Over Terabithia]] was my very first fanfic ever. The one that got me started on all rabbit holes. The one where I first experienced the joy of an update, and the agonizing wait for more. The premise is fairly straight-forward--Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke starting high school. But excellent pacing and detailed characterization, combined with several very tender scenes, put it among the best of its fandom.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4855679/1/The-Run][The Run]] is an overlooked, under-appreciated gem of a story. Almost unique in its setting--several years after a fight led to an estrangement between Jess and Leslie, they slowly begin to try and rebuild their friendship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3610077/1/Flight-or-Fight][Fight or Flight]] was another great one. Everything changes for Jess and Leslie when they receive word that the fields and forest behind their houses are due to be cleared out for a strip mall.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5630256/1/The-New-Life][The New Life]] is arguably the most spectacular. An AU that is damned near an independent novel in its own right. To say more would spoil the impact.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9069014/1/A-Place-For-Us][A Place for Us]] is simpler in scope than the aforementioned stories, due in no small part to its unfinished nature, but sometimes, simple is better.

*Avatar: The Last Airbender*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11855453/1/Talks-and-Mud][Talks and Mud]] is a simple conversation between Ty Lee and Toph. It's not much, but given that these two almost never interacted in common, and I actually think they'd get along, I'll still recommend it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5732344/1/What-Meets-the-Eye][What Meets the Eye]] is more or less a retelling of the series if the not-particularly-villainous Ty Lee had deserted Azula early.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5363809/1/Falling-in-the-Water][Falling in the Water]] is a bit darker, featuring the Gaang's struggle to get rid of a /very/ hostile spirit from a Earth Kingdom village.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5055912/1/See-Behind-the-Mask][See Behind the Mask]] is another fantastic story. Rather than tell any plot details, let me just sums it up as Toph and Iron have a life-changing field trip.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9058021/1/When-Past-Meets-Present][When Past Meets Present]] is another story featuring the fracturing of a friendship, and the struggle to rebuild. This is actually one of my favorites, and I prefer it to the sequel comics.

*Crossover*

*Stargate/Avatar: The Last Airbender*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7679074/1/The-Dragon-King-s-Temple][The Dragon King's Temple]] is one of the best fanfics I've ever read. A blast from start to finish. A love letter to both fandoms it takes from, while also advancing the plots and characters' storylines. Also, to quote Toph: "Zuko finally ponied up on my life-changing field trip."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11006893/1/Lucy-s-Birthday][Lucy's Birthday]] is sweet and sappy and there's no plot to speak of, but I love it all the same.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12314387/1/Concerning-Dragons][Concerning Dragons]] is almost straight from Lewis's books. Eustace Clarence Scrubb is at long last introduced to the right books.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12157916/1/Grey-England][Grey England]] is one of my very favorites--even if it is set in England. In short, how Narnia changed the Pevensies for the better.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2794699/1/The-Queen-s-Return][The Queen's Return]] is...quite simply, the best of the best. The Narnian fanfic above all others, and ten times the story for Susan than Gaiman's.

** A Song Of Ice And Fire/GOT :

linkffn(Dragons of Ice And Fire) is pretty damn epic, good plot and well written, it's a WIP but is 400K+ and gets updates at least every month.

linkffn(A Shadow and a Wolf) is a fic based on a different outcome to Tyrion's trial, very good plot, 900K words and regularly updated.

linkao3(Kingdoms At War) is a 650K+ WIP that offers an alternative to the ASOAIF storyline starting towards the end of AGOT. It's absolutely fantastic plot wise, and the writing is great as well.

And lastly, linkao3(A Knight's Watch), which is imo to the top of ASOIAF pics ever written. It's 670K and is finished, however the sequel is not out yet, which is super frustrating...\\
By the same author, linkao3(Our Choices Seal Our Fate), a 580K words WIP that is also incredible plot-wise with good writing to boot, it just needs some updates...

Hope you enjoyed my picks !

  is a fic based on a different outcome to Tyrion's trial
#+end_quote

How slow is the pace on this fic? I skimmed the first 10 chapters and there is no trial yet.

Edit - 25 chapters of rehashing the canon plot...I question your statement that this story has a good plot. I guess I like GoT so this plot is sort of good.

**** Yeah, it takes a while to get started. I didn't quite realise it was so long, mostly because I started reading the story along with the updates a while ago. I do sort of agree with your comment though, it's certainly a lesser fic compared to Dragons Of Ice And Fire, Kingdoms At War, and the two by DolorousEdditor.

***** After writing yesterday's comment, I'm actually enjoying this author's other story, A Rose and a Lion, a lot more. It's not perfect (why two people having sex daily in medieval living conditions don't have children after two years of this is a bit of a wallbanger) but since it diverges immediately it's a lot easier to get into. The author has a nice writing style, but they make some weird choices in some places.

** A lot of [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/sugamins/pseuds/sugamins/works?fandom_id=1002903][sugamins]] works for BTS. I'm a sucker for angsty and tragic fics and she's freaking amazing at that. Her character a n worldbuilding is really belivable and detailed.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5865541][sure I get lonely]] is very cute and has a happy ending.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/331765][days of our lives]] is the best fic I have ever read, hands down. It's based on the album concept of the band (which in itself is pretty angsty) and ties all the clues and Music videos together beautifully. While still making you cry out your eyes the whole time. I read it only twice and can't read it again cause I immediately start crying. She's rewriting it rn as original fiction and I'm not even mad. Usually I'm not a big fan of that but her is pretty OOC in itself and it fits. Just read it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5293532][house of cards]] is pretty dark and angsty too.

The story itself starts off a bit normal, with a slightly edgy ‚Äúself insert‚Äù style character put in but the whole thing spirals out of control (as seen by the word count) and a lot of stuff happens. It's about a peaceful land, and what needs to be done to keep it that way.

  Aoba Johsai's School for Demon Hunters and the Nekoma Institute of Magic both reside directly beside a Hell Mouth. It is prophesied that one day a half-breed demon will open it and wreck an apocalypse on all of Japan. That isn't on Oikawa Tooru's to-do list, but it's not like he can tell anyone that. Meanwhile, a demon with a human soul escapes hell and finds himself drawn to the reincarnation of his former love. Unfortunately, this reincarnation is a witch-in-training named Kozume Kenma, and he wants nothing to do with demons, lovestruck or otherwise.

  Many have said that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Few can attest that the road back is far harder to conquer. Now Anakin has to face everything he's become, avoid the suspicion of everyone from the Jedi Council to Palpatine, and try to prevent the future from turning out as badly as it had before all while somehow finding a way to bring balance to the Force...again.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where your allies can be just as dangerous as your enemies, sometimes it can be difficult for a criminal mastermind to find a little stress relief. That blonde idiot, Jaune, was just unimportant enough, just malleable enough, to be a viable option. It was meant to be a one time thing, an easy lay. Emotions were never supposed to get involved.

#+begin_quote
  When Jaune woke up back in his house with his sisters and family, all he could do was sigh. Every time he died he was forced to start over again, and this was what... the one thousandth time? More? If it doesn't matter how hard he tries, doesn't matter how much he fights. Then maybe it's time to just kick back and enjoy himself. Fate can find someone else to be its whipping boy.
