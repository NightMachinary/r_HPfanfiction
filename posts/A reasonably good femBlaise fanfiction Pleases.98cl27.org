  As far as Heidi Zabini's concerned, Draco Malfoy is everything wrong with the Pureblooded elite that her surname pushed her into. But the summer has been about as kind to Malfoy as he's been to her, and the school year seems no better. Little by little, Heidi can't help but try to keep him afloat. However, there's that minor matter of reversing 16 years of damage between them...

  Female!Blaise Zabini's life through her own eyes. Her take on Voldiemart, both the Ferret and Weasel Kings, freckles, Harry Potter and shagging in libraries. Cynicism can be fun, and even more, funny. R&R plz
