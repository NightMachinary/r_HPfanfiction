The pairing, genre, length, etc, doesn't matter - anything goes, as long as it's focused on Ron (and doesn't bash him).


** Not completely focused on Ron but I love how he is portrayed in Harry Potter and the lack of lamb sauce. And out of the trio he s definitively the most important.

#+begin_quote
  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."

** Since no one has mentioned this monster yet I'll add linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan) . Definitely a huge fic and one that evolves Ron in a unique way. It's slow paced which can be a major turn off for some readers and has him as a Slytherin. Currently one of a few fics that I'm actively interested in.

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

**** Agreed but the thing is kids are dumb. They do argue about the same thing multiple l. Siblings often hash out the same arguments quite a few times before they're done. But it does get annoying regardless of believability. Third year is better than second as people start to grow up somewhat and resolve their issues.

That said everyone does curse far to frequently in the fic, your right. I cursed a lot growing up but I've got nothing on them lol.

***** Knowing it's happening is fine but having to reading about it repeatedly is the problem. Even in cannon the trio have the same arguments over and over about Brooms or Rats or Draco or House Elves or Krum. But Rowling knew to summarize several months worth of arguments into a short paragraph and only actually wrote the individual argument scenes out when new information came to light and they had something different to discuss.

In Fate it feels like the briefest mention of Hermione has Daphne and Ron going at it again for another chapter.

And to me it's not the cursing so much as every swear being "shite" . Regardless of who's talking.

  [Trans!Ron; Ron/Hermione, various pairings] He learned his lesson a long time ago. Boys are boys, girls are girls. And Ron, Ron makes a good boy. He's tall, sturdy, manly, not like some of those long-haired Slytherins he sometimes mistakes for girls when they slink in the dark corridors with their robes floating behind them. He plays Quidditch. He loves Hermione, with a little too much intensity and adoration for a boy his age, but that's what constant brushes with death do to you. He shaves; he doesn't jerk off, granted, but apart from that, he's pretty much the poster boy for healthy, honest masculinity.So why is it, then - why is it he can't believe it, not for one second?

  Ron certainly knows how to recognize obsession when he sees it, thanks to feeling some of the same with Hermione. And he would rather that Harry's obsession with Draco Malfoy end sooner rather than later. Otherwise, Ron's afraid that he's going to spend the rest of his life hearing about how ugly all of Malfoy's girlfriends are.

  Being Harry Potter's best friend isn't always fame and beating off raving fans. It's also the anxiety of hearing your best mate's been cursed by another Dark Lord, or love potioned by some crazy woman. Or having his boyfriend you knew nothing about turn up on the Burrow's doorstep. Crime/Mystery fic.

** Linkffn (I've Had Enough) on ff.net is a story where Ron and Harry run away together when they're really young. From what I remember it focused heavily on Ron and his family, and showed him as a brave, selfless, an empathetic person. Also some family drama with the Weaslys and Ron trying to come to terms with some issues. A good read, its just a shame it was never finished.

** An oldie but a goodie. [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=1242&chapno=1]] This is Ron-centric story about love potions and the OWLs; it was written forever ago. As long as you are not too concerned with canon compliance, this is completely worth reading. It's one of my all time favorites!

​

Harry Potter and his friends? Professor Snape is terrified, Hermione runs amok and Ron runs to her rescue. Meanwhile, Harry writes some truly awful poetry. This story was written prior to the release of "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."

** Okay I know I'm super late, but here are my fave picks! There's a lot.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24897403]]) is also a time travel fix it, Ron-centric.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341]]) is just fucking good. It's where Hermione gets consequences for attacking Ron in HBP. I can't say any more cause it's just good.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12365883]]) is also quite good...Dark! Trio with OP characters and time travel to Lord Voldemort's time.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18561046]]) is also really good, follows Slytherin Ron. Oneshot

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16199003]]) is another Ron time travel fic. It's so good though. Like astounding.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16288199]]) is a time traveling Percy Weasley fic where he fucks himself up and tries to protect everyone.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23425024]]) is a hilarious Draco/Ron rom com.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498]]) is incredible. A series of what ifs, with 16 works, each about 8000 words.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2044746]]) is a poignant Ron whump fic. Oneshot.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13139083/1/]]) This one is simply incredible. The tale is spun so well. The anticipation. It's amazing. Follows Ron on his last case as an Auror, finding out Harry's family's darkest secret...

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1216035/1/]]) Chess game and Ron and Snape centric. Not a slash! Just good ol Death Eaters and a chess championship.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866134/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Weasley-Seer]]) Ron's Divination predictions come true somehow. Becomes crackish in later chapters.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3637489/1/Six-Foot-Of-Ginger-Idiot]]). Ron's 6th year journal. Semi-canon compliant.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). 4th year, PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry, for that matter).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]). AU 6th year fic where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.
