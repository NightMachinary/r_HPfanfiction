Are there any good fics where the "golden trio" are actually friends. Basically I want the 3 to be featured in the story. Usually Ron gets removed from the group or is a total jackass. One of my favorite parts of the books was the friendship between the 3.


** It's honestly kind of saddening how so many fics don't have the three of them as good friends. Is it because so many people don't like Ron as a character?

*** Yes and it feeds on itself through fanfiction. Plenty of people start out liking Ron, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Molly, Ginny, etc. just fine after reading the original books. But read enough terrible bashing fanon and you'll start to forget how they actually are and additionally think you must be crazy for liking them or that other people will not like your story if you give them a fair shake. Usually people who write fanfiction have read a fair bit of it.

**** Makes sense. For Worm there are people who write fanfics about Worm without ever reading the actual story, so all of their knowledge comes from the worm fanfics.

*** It is because while I see Ron as what keeps them human, the heart if you will, his flaws are so ridiculously magnified through out the series. Add the hyperinflation of traits in fanon and you get the trope of Ron the Deatheater.

While you might contest that is what being human means. People tend to think of characters as ideals or archetypes; thus, they either have near perfect characters with near minimal flaws or flawed characters with minimal good traits.

**** Ron/Hermione being canon probably has to do a lot with it. I remember that even after HBP people thought Harry and Hermione would end up together. Add the fact that in most fanfics Harry is "improved", I believe they blame Ron for Harry not being super powerful or taking his studies seriously.

If it came down to flaws, Draco wouldn't be so popular.

***** For Draco being popular, I blame Tom Felton. Lol. That and the whole bad guy redeeming shit that most people romanticize.

As for Potter's potential, based in the real world that would be true. However, in universe, Potter was abused, and would latch on anyone that first showed him a kindness. Thus, when Ron showed up, he owed him loyalty. If he was raised properly, he would have gravitated towards Hermione instead with maintaining wonder with magic.

Sometimes, I wonder if, in universe, the whole series is just Dumbledore's redemption plan/plan B for Tom Riddle since he epically screwed him.

** I love fics where the Trio are best friends as in canon:

*Divided and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994)

*Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water*, linkffn(12076771): they are a true romantic Trio in this fic

*Forging the Sword*, linkffn(3557725)

*Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650): this is more of a Quartet story

*Children's Crusade*, linkffn(6989327): another Quartet story

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: is an excellent rewrite of the canon series in a non-magical, sci-fi AU. The plot differs from the canon in several aspects, and Year 7 takes up a third of the overall story length.

*Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106): it's hard to believe, but Harrymort is actually 'best friends' with Ron and Hermione, although he did some seriously nasty stuffs to Ron in early years.

*We are the Golden Trio!*, linkffn(7405516)

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord.

but Forging the Sword was one of my favorite examples of their friendship. A oneshot called DUmbledores Weapon was nice too, but it didn't really focus on their friendship until later in the series. Another nice one that focuses on their friendship (Although the mediocrity of the writing made me gag) was recnac transfaerso.
