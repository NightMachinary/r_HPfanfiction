1. Terms of Matrimony by Galad Estel. It was originally on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9931566/1/]] but it is not there anymore. I have found something in some old dump and put it on [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/terms_of_matrimony.html]] , but I am not sure whether it is only these six chapters or somebody has more of it.
2. [[https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-best-works-of-novel-length-Harry-Potter-fanfiction]] mentions “Neville's Take: Philosopher's Stone Chapter 1: His Beginning, a harry potter fanfic” and points to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11339343/1/Neville-s-Take-Philosopher-s-Stone]], and it is not there and I haven't been able to find it in anydump or anywhere else on the Internet.

Can anybody help me to read these?

- The website also doesn't have a dump of the 2nd story, sadly.

Generally, the archive of ff2ebook tends to have an almost all stories with reasonable popularity, and also tends to be up-to-date.

A great place to search for vanished fics, if you have an old ffn link.

** the copy of terms of matrimony in my archive has 6 chapters.

The id for Neville's Take falls in the id range that [[https://archive.org/details/Fanfictiondump114]] covers

*** The version on ff2ebook has 26 chapters and it is apparently complete (although quite hastily finished). My review is on [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/terms-of-matrimony.html]]
