Presumably your intention is to get a notification from the bot in the first place, so the downvotes should be irrelevant anyway.

197 tabs open was the result. I couldn't decide which was important to keep and which wasn't.

I used the bookmarks, but I kept forgetting to check there. The bookmark section is neatly hidden, so I keep forgetting about it. Also, I kept losing stuff there. The reddit save function is worse.

Sounds pretty normal to me. I've had as much 500 when doing coursework for uni+ youtube videos+ fanfiction. The important thing is to close your browser. This way next time you start it won't load all the 197 tabs and kill your RAM, it just loads the ones that you click and open. And bookmarks aren't hidden. What browser are you using? Most of them can be customized and made to look the way you want them to. You've got plenty of options.

- For some reason, the bookmarks toolbar is turned off by default, so just turn it back on and use that.
- Or use the customize function and place the Bookmark icon next to your address/ search bar if you're not a fan of the Library one.
- Or simply press Ctrl+ Shift+ B to instantly open the bookmarks window

Edit: 0 points? I post a helpful comment and immediately get downvoted? Fair enough. At this point, you're simply displaying willful ignorance which seems a pretty lazy thing to do. It's a pity. I expected more from the Harry Potter fandom. This subreddit is such a miserable place.

PS. Oh, and you can't simply "lose" stuff in the bookmark section. It's all there. Unless you're dumb enough to open a virus and infect your PC. Hell, even then browsers have cloud sync. So it's next to impossible to "lose" stuff anymore. You do know that you can make folders and search your bookmarks, right?

You can do the same on Chrome. And while I haven't used it I'm pretty sure Opera is also customizable. Not to mention the dozens of browsers that use Firefox as a base. Hell, even Microsoft has been trying lately with Edge. Devs don't just sit on their bums, twiddling their thumbs, you know. They write new code and improve their products.

You obviously have no interest in improving yourselves and learning something new or adapting to the situation. I guess aimlessly spamming innocent threads with pointless comments is easier.
