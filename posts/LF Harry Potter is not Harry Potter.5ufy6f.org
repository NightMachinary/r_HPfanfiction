Hey, do you happen to know of a fanfic where Harry does a blood testing of some sort and it results in saying he is not Harry Potter ?

It just popped in my mind a moment ago... Thx !

It seems like quite a few of the Harry-turns-into-a-girl stories fits that as well, though.

I won't spoil with specifics (unless you ask) because the reveal blew my mind in an awesome way.

  Harry's life up to his eleventh birthday was painful and harsh. Dumped in an abusive home by dead parents, running away from that home to take his life into his own hands and then surviving by his wits and his feet. Then a letter came, and opened a whole new world... An AU fiction with hopefully enough action and comedy to entertain.
