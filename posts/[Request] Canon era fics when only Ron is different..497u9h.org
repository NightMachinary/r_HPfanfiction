Something like this [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7467796/1/Choices]] in which Ron is a seer and sorted in to slytherin.

However, that one has a fair bit of canon rehash and Ron's power is more used to keep him involved in the plot despite being in a different house, rather than to make significant changes. So I'm looking for something similar but better.

Thanks.


** In linkffn(Weasley Girl by Hyaroo), Ron was born a girl. The story does an excellent job maintaining the whimsical feel of the early books, and canon is derailed very quickly. There is also a sequel.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.
