As the title says, i'm looking for some well written romance fics, preferably Harry centric, but i'll take what i can get. That said, no bashing, i just want some fics to maybe cry at, thanks folks.


** I'm a fan of Reversing Course. Ginny joined the aurors and Harry plays quidditch. Nice slow burn if you're into that.

** I would have to go with “Grow Young with Me” by Taliesin19 linkao3(16405130). Yes, it should be cut down, but otherwise it is pretty well written.

Also, with [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/overall-post-on-breakfast-in-new-york.html][plenty of objections]] (especially, cutting it to one fifth or something) “Breakfast in New York” by Radaslab linkffn(5141159).

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.

** I'm a big fan of linkffn(Time is the Fire)

Not your typical fic, but it starts as canon compliant up to the epilogue and has a lot of twists and turns after. From what I recall there is zero bashing.

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.

**** I also recommend linkffn(The Debt of Time)

It's a soul bond fic that focuses on Hermione. It's very long but 100% complete, has some parts that were genuinely heartbreaking the first time I read it but is mostly a romantic comedy.

I recommend this one all the time and some people love it while others don't. Definitely worth a try though.

** The Purpose of Wings[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13745570/1/The-Purpose-of-Wings]]

It is a rarepair of Harry/Fleur and has some of the best romance I've ever read fanfiction or otherwise. Really mature and thoughtful (I did a full review of it not too long ago) and also has some bigger subplots of a murder-mystery.

Also has scenes that made me blubber like a baby, some from sheer beauty and others from melancholy.

The author also has oneshots that are part of the world, Stuttering Hearts and Quickening Strings and A Lily By Any Other Name will also make you ball tears of happiness.
