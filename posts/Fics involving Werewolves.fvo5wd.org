** I set this in Greyback's pack. It is not a cheerful alternative to the news.

#+begin_quote
  When a human is captured by werewolves, escape is impossible, but she might be able to accomplish one thing: kill Remus Lupin. He's the most evil werewolf in the pack because he's the best at pretending to be human.

*** It's an interesting concept, certainly. I've never read a fic quite like it (particularly the philosophical discussion in the first chapter) and after reading said first chapter I kinda want to read more of it just to find out what the heck happens next. So, yeah. Thanks for the rec, and thanks for writing it. :)

**** I'd better hurry and post the last chapter before you catch up.

***** Heh. No rush. I'd rather wait for your best effort than rush something you're not happy with.

And because I posted a lot of similar requests in series (fics with centaurs, fics with dragons, fics with werewolves, etc) that could've all been done in one post - technically that counts as spam, so it was quite fairly removed.
