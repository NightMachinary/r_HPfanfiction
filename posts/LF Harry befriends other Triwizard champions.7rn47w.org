I'm looking for fanfics where Harry, Cedric, Fleur and Victor are friends during Tournament and after it.


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11534019/14/Euphoria]])

Harry becomes friends with Fleur and Victor. Has a Fleur/Harry pairing.

it is upfront about what kind of story it is, and I enjoy it.

Hopefully you do as well, even if it isn't quite what you are looking for.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** I've written "Patron", where Harry becomes friends with Fleur and Viktor, visiting both of their families after the Tournament, but it's an AU - Harry is the Hogwarts Champion, not Cedric.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
