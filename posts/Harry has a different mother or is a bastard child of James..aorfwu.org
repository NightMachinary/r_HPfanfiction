** I think it depends on the circumstances and how you characterize Lily.

Was James dating Lily and cheated on her with someone else and had Harry? She may be resentful towards James and not love Harry, but still be kind towards him because he's a baby. Or she might be more like Catelyn Stark and be cold towards Harry, eventually favouring her own children. She may even feel conflicted because maybe she does learn to love him but also resents him because he's this living proof that James cheated.

If James had Harry before dating Lily, then Harry would probably be treated as a stepchild. Perhaps Harry's birth mom was killed in the war or perhaps she and James co parent. Lily could be a loving step mom towards Harry and treat him like her own son. If his birth mom is dead or out of the picture Lily might even adopt him. She could be distant towards him but still kind, leaving James to do more of the parenting and her taking on more of the fun role of being a step parent. Or she could be a cruel stepmom, neglecting Harry and trying to get James to neglect him in favour of “their family”. Perhaps Harry has half siblings and doesn't feel like he really belongs with his dad's family.
