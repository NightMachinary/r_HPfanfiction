An example being when Snape dies in the shrieking shack he wakes up as a kid or a fifth year or sometime before the Potters die and tries to change the future. Personally it's not my thing but I'm kinda curious


** I do lots of time travel. IMO, you have to have a believable explanation for travelling back... so there's reasoning about how the character can go back to his time/timeline if they want to (even if they never return, you have to have a possibility open to drive the story or reasoning why it is impossible to go back). Also, pulling time travel out of your hat with the user only guessing the rules for it seems lazier to me. You either keep to established ways of time travelling (Time-Turner), or come up with yours and fresh it out.

Good examples:

Time Traveling necklace that you build up to for a chap or 2 before the actual time travel. Mystery how it works, but character knows the place where it was invented and its restrictions. That is, the necklace can only go back to Wednesdays.

Time Traveling machine which character learns to understand and use

Bad examples:

Character stumbles with a rock, that happened to be a time travelling rock. Is sent to the past. Rock isn't mentioned ever again.

So about dying... I buy the veil. I mean, is mysterious enough, and it is a doorway... sort of a gate to somewhere else. No one knows what's on the other side, so there's no one who could tell you it cannot send you back in time. It has a bonus that the character in the past might try to find out about where did the veil came from or who created it, so he can understand what happened. Character also knows where to find the object again and who could give him answers about it. There might be a possibility open of using to return. Author can come with plausible explanation of why character was sent to that particular point in time... etc...

Dying from snake bite doesn't have that mystery or magical powerful expected to justify a time traveling. I mean, is author going to explain if other people who died of snake bites also traveled back to the past? Or why only Snape did so? IMO, if you want Snape back at this particular point in time, you either come up with a time-traveling device(or spell or potion or etc...) and make it activate with Snape dying to in some other way.... or go good old Fate talks to Snape after death and sends him back. Fate or Death is kind of overused, but you can use Merlin or Dumbledore or a being taking the form of a person from his past (Lily) or Herpo the Foul... whatever. It might be too common, but you can still fresh it out, focus less in the "I'm Death" part and more on the "why you" and what rules does this have.

But that's just me. It's fanfic and if you want to write about time traveling rocks, there's nothing stopping you to do so.

*** Like I said I was curious what other people thought. It doesn't necessarily have to be Snape he was just the example. But yes I agree with what you said

** No one knows what happens after death so probably anything works. I'm not personally a fan of time travel though especially because the way it is established in the universe (not everything added after the books) it would indicate that events in the present are directly influence by someone coming from the future so timeline cannot really be altered.

** I was gonna list things the story would need to adress in order for the dying/waking formula to work....but then there were just too many impossible aspects lmao.

With this way of travel you're basically limited to a diverging timeline, ie. everything is game, no paradoxes or time-travelling-related dangers. I suppose it's the easy way to get your unfortunate heroes to achieve their happily ever afters....or fuck things up beyond anything that would've happened without their intervention :^{)}

Maybe you could have some self-fulfilling prophecies shenanigans to create some tension, but otherwise the plot is basically unaffected by the time-travel itself. As types of time-travel go, I feel like this particular formula is rather limiting and better served as a plot device in a romance fiction (or setup for overpowered Lord Hadrian fiction ðŸ™ƒ) rather than for a time-travel-themed story, if that makes sense?

Edit: What I talked about above is specifically about waking up in your own younger body rather than appearing as a new person at any point in history. So it's more akin to gaining memories of the future than actually travelling into the past.
