Some of mine: I had more, but didn't want to over do them.

1: Dumbledore being obsessed with Lemon Drops, Dumbledore enjoyed a lemon drop, but he wasn't offering them every single time and taking them out of his pocket or beard or whatever to eat one, whenever.

2: Fred and George don't use twin speak every time they talk. They also don't call each other Gred and Forge all of the time, it was just once, as a joke.

3: For being a rule following person, Hermione often broke the rules when she saw fit. She thinks Snape is cursing Harry? Set him on fire! And other similar things to that aspect. But a lot of stories have Hermione as being absolutely perfect, when she's not.

What are some of yours?


** Pet peeve thread #420342?

- Killing off characters in an AU fic to preserve the canon timeline. The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][Boy with a Scar]] AU Harry series (well known for the "Harry raised by a loving Petunia" oneshot) is guilty of this, killing Sirius off in multiple timelines, in the same canon DoM battle, even if the set-up circumstances were different.

- Making characters woobies when they weren't woobies, in a way that reduces their character. Snape isn't a woobie and would never become soft and nice around people he liked, if he liked anyone at all. Draco isn't a woobie who is abused by Lucius.

- Sexualizing Luna. Why is she made into a manic pixie nympho girl so often? Especially when she's 11-12 years old? What exactly is the appeal of this.

- Badass Flawless Hermione. The real Hermione is bossy, socially awkward, insecure, and close-minded when she gets an idea in her head and refuses to hear other people's side. Seems to be a symptom of mixing movie canon with book canon.

- Short Harry. Harry was smaller than the other kids back in Year 1 and 2, but he got taller by DH. I don't mind if Harry's childhood stunted his growth and that is remarked on, but 5-foot tall teeny tiny adult Harry is weird. It shows up a lot in slash where Harry is the "bottom".

*** Yeah I don't get it either. You have fanon, it's a wide web of stories you can write about. Why still write about Sirius dying? Why still write about Dumbledore or another x character here dying? And they often die in a similar manner that they died in canon, which is just ridiculous.

The characters are three dimensional people, who have real conflict and thoughts and different opinions. Writing them in a way that reduces all of that is incredibly annoying.

Hell sexualizing anyone, especially at a young age, rather it be Luna, Ginny or Hermione is a quick way to hit the back button for me.

**** It's the power of the plot railroad.

Seriously though, I think it's because authors want to see how characters react to the canon situations, like how Ninja AU Harry would handle the TWT and the Graveyard scene, which only happened due to a number of set-ups, like the Weasleys going to Egypt, Pettigrew dropping his Scabbers disguise, and the whole PoA plot. It's the same reason why Harry makes friends with Ron and Hermione in so many fics, and so many crossovers and Muggle AUs, even though they only got together because of the Troll in the Dungeons. Their friendship dynamic is good, well-established, and the author can't think of any other friends to pair Harry up with as an alternative.

Might as well ask why so many authors write stories with Harry as the protagonist, instead of another character.

Which makes no sense tbh. Hogwarts does not offer a balanced diet (I think there is no mention of salad or raw vegetables in any book). The Dursleys interrupt even that each year, sometimes pretty badly (especially years 2 and 4). The substitutes are often candy and cake, so not exactly healthy either (lots of carbs, maybe fat but little else). And the hunt has remarkably bad food quality.

I could get behind Harry out-growing his childhood malnutrition if there the proper steps were taken (eg supplements or a potion regime) or he had a constant supply of moderately healthy food, but there is nothing in canon which suggests he could grow back what is missing.

#+end_quote

Eh, I find the first half of that sentence really debatable. I agree he definitely would never come anywhere close to "soft", and his idea of being nice is probably to always sneer at you instead of constantly making cutting remarks. But that doesn't necessarily diminish the emotional suffering he went through. There's such a trope as "Jerkass Woobie" --- a character who still deserves to be felt sorry for, but is nevertheless a hugely unpleasant person aside from that.

¨shrugs¨ I'd say half of it is the fantasy of the wholly sex-positive hippie girl, which Luna is the closest canon fit for if you want to shoehorn it into the story, and the other half is people who got a crush on the actress playing her in the movies.

I wouldn't say "at its highest". The Dursleys are definitely emotionally abusive to some extent, with a bit of debatable bordering-on-physical in specific instances, but mostly they seem to be guilty of criminal levels of child neglect, rather than active abuse.

The point OP is making isn't that the Dursleys are blameless, but rather that "they treated Harry badly, bordering on abuse" doesn't necessarily translate to "Vernon beat him with his belt buckle every other weekends" as many authors jump to assuming.

Sure, he doesn't get beaten until his bloodied and barely breathing, but for me that qualifies as a form of child abuse, especially when you realise Harry was only just ten or eleven at the time. One of the things a child needs most is love, a warm feeling of safety, support and acceptance and Harry never had any of that.

But that doesn't necessarily make it "abuse", and even if it fits some legal definition of it or other, it's kind of misleading to call it that in conversation: again, it gives the impression that the Dursleys were actively out to harm Harry, which I really don't think is the case for the most part.

Your only argument seems to be that there wasn't any physical violence (which there was, albeit to a /much/ lesser degree than the edgelords would have us believe), therefore it's not abuse. Which, y'know, is implicitly dismissive of real people who have lived through similar abuse, because make no mistake, the Dursleys' treatment of Harry /is/ abusive.

******* And I understand the word abuse normally implies physical violence and that's mostly not the case in Canon other than a few instances where Dudleys were overzealous with their reactions.

But I also think that is abuse at its core and stories, if leaning towards angst and drama, should carry the undertones of that past, without being all whiny about it, because, sadly, there are millions of children who grow up suffering far more than Harry did. Most of them make it into adulthood as relatively well-adjusted people and not at all spineless cowards who flinched every time a door opens. Nor do they tend to cry all that often.
