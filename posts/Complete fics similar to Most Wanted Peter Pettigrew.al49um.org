I started reading Most Wanted: Peter Pettigrew linkffn(11331155), but it's incomplete. Are there any similar fics that are complete?


** Placing bounties? I can't think of any off the top of my head. edit: I found one where he /claims/ bounties on death eaters [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4544334/1/Harry-Potter-Mercenary]] and here's the sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6568694/1/Harry-Potter-Hit-Wizard]]

Here's one where harry lost the trial 5th year and was like "no u". Featuring: harry wank, and even some other things.

Want more wank but with more buildup?

BAM! Harry wank takes all the boring parts of your story and turns it into an enjoyable turn your brain off read.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is fed up with the lies of the ministry, the slander of the prophet and the inaction of everyone around him in the face of Voldemort's return. After careful thinking he has come to a conclusion: find Peter Pettigrew and you find the truth. Hence Harry puts a 100,000 Galleon reward on Peter's head and watches as the entire magical community goes mad in the race to find him.
