I'm specifically looking for a story where Rose goes to Hogwarts, though a story focusing on another Dhampir going to Hogwarts could be nice too (Dhampir Hermione would be fun, and she'd get additional prejudice for being a 'halfbreed').

I prefer novel-length or longer stories. I tried to find some using ff.net's browse feature, but only found really short stories.

*** Never heard of that site, but with 500k words and romance/drama genre the story looks promising, I will give it a shot, thank you.

** It's not something I've come across, I'm afraid. Plus, vampires. Why is it always vampires? Why can't we have some of the more neglected supernatural murder machines take centre stage once again?

*** Dhampir aren't vampires, they don't need blood (in the Vampire Academy universe).

Besides that, I like vampires in general (the twilight kind notwithstanding) because of the darker atmosphere their very existence brings to the table. throw in a nice redemption story and it's very sexy. This might be consequence of growing up watching Buffy and Angel (and Spike). Even in the Vampire Academy universe the nicest Moroi still needs human or dhampir blood to survive, and they can irrevocably turn into the evil Strigoi with just one act at any time.
