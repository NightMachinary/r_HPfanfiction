Tom grows up at the height of the British war effort, has anyone seen a fic where he gets drafted ?


** to nipick a bit,

Unless my math is wrong (possible) he wouldn't have turned 18 until December 31, 1944. So the absolute earliest he could have been drafted would be January of 1945.

However, he is still a student during that time and students were, I believe, exempt. So given that he doesn't graduate until May/June of 1945 he couldn't technically be drafted And by that point the war in Europe is over.

While conscription continued past the end of the war, it seems like a wizard would be able to avoid that quite easily. Even if just showing up with your arm disillusioned and being like 'so yeah I don't have arms'.

More historically, he'd be more likely to be 'drafted' into the Korean war than WW2. And a lot of that would depend on how long you think he's putzing around with Borgin and Burke.

It'd be very hard to come up with a legit reason for him to actually have any interest in going into the service and not just ignoring it entirely and oblivating/killing whomever showed up to try to collect him.

That being said, there is probably an interesting fic to be written around like Tom Riddle and the Battle of the Imjin River.

*** Wartime conscription rolled straight over into National Service - which didn't end until 1960. Riddle fell into the awkward period between the end of the War and the National Service Act 1948, which mandated peacetime conscription - 2 years in uniform and 4 years reserve service. He would have been liable to register on his 18th birthday and would have been called up for at least basic training if he had actually done so. He would have been a reservist at the time of the Korean war, and almost certainly wouldn't have been mobilised.

It basically depends on him being registered for conscription, which he could have been prosecuted for not doing. Not that they'd be able to actually catch him, or would be trying terribly hard after VE day. One dodger more or less in jail wouldn't be huge priority, they largely depended on picking them up for something else: since demobilised veterans were taking all the honest jobs, conscription dodgers gravitated to petty crime.

Edit to add: Even if he had been called up for Korea, he wouldn't have been an infantryman at Imjin River. As a london boy, he wasn't from any of the recruiting areas for the infantry regiments present. There were tanks, artillery and engineers, though, although I'm not sure they were taking conscripts by that point. The Glosters definitely had some, but they'd all , or at least mostly, be west country lads.

*** Depending on how far you're willing to stretch things he might sign up willingly in order to have cover to get to an artefact he really wanted. It seems likely he could go about it in another way, but it's always a possibility.

*** Audie Murphy used a fake ID to get in the Army at 16 and became America's most decorated soldier. It wouldn't be drafted, but there are ways to get Tom into the +Royal+ British Army.

And underage soldiers were common, either by conscription (Volkssturm) or by volunteering (especially in the first world war).

This makes me cringe when I see it in fics. We don't have a Royal Army in the UK. The Navy and Air Force are Royal, the army isn't. It traces its descent from the New Model Army, which, unlike the Royal Army, /won/ the Civil War.

***** Don't you have a couple Royal Brigades and Regiments though?

And wasn't Britain's professional army ground to death in 1914/15 and de facto replaced with a conscription based?

Edit: And your Marines are Royal as well.

Regiments and Corps. They're parts of the Army, not the army itself, and some of them can trace their lineage back before the New Model Army.

Explaining the intricacies of how defence spending, defence cuts, military doctrine, the exigencies of empire and several centuries of tradition born out of the settlement of a three-cornered civil war interact to produce the current confusion is more than one can do in a comment. Just remember that Bill Bryson quote to the effect that the first requirement of any British institution is that it be utterly incomprehensible to foreigners.

The pre-1914 professional army didn't die in the trenches: there were regulars throughout the war and right through the conscription years. The trick was to volunteer before you were called up so you could join your service of choice and, if you went for the army, your regiment of choice.

(And the marines aren't a separate service, they're part of the Royal Navy, first formed as The Duke of York and Albany's Maritime Regiment Of Foot, then IIRC unofficially renamed the Admiral's Regiment, they didn't get called Marines until the mid 18th century, when they came under Admiraty control)

  1943. AU It was supposed to be Tom Riddle's sixth year at Hogwarts. A few more months then he would 17 and be free of the Muggle World forever. No one expected that he would be drafted. Grindelwald's campaign doesn't seem as righteous as it did before.

*** Holy shit. This would be beyond amazing... if there was more than one chapter. The potential is literally blowing my mind. I really like the first 2000 words, I would not mind another.... 200 000.

Can somebody please do this? This is great.

  It begins in 1943. Tom Riddle searches for his place in the world, and ends up getting captured by HYDRA. After being saved by a crazy muggle in spandex, he must learn to adapt to the new playing field, and have some odd friendships along the way. AU. Soldier!Tom Riddle. No pairings. Starts in CA:TFA but will spread to the other films.
