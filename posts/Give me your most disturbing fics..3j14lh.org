** I actually stumbled across this just a couple days ago on an AskReddit thread.

I present to you: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5523410/1/Ron-s-Secret][Ron's Secret]]

Summary:Can a boy fall in love with his best friend's owl?

Whatever levels of weird you're imagining from that summary, know that it goes sprinting straight past that line in a feathery gimp suit

  Severus Snape is given everything he ever wanted. Still, what kind of family produces a child like Petunia? Had Lily survived, who would she have turned out to be? Dark, not my usual story.

  You see, all it takes is a bit of sacrifice. A little tit for tat. A bit of a 'you-help-me-and-I-help-you' sort of thing. And death isn't so difficult to conquer, after all.

Lovely prose which works well to add a layer of darkness and grit to this story. The narration is so despairing and grim; it's a lovely mix of melancholic and creepy.

  Pairing: Snape/Voldemort, Snape/Tree

  Summary: A brief history of a damaged man. Part of the Severus Snape Fuh-Q Fest. Written in response to Tricky Pairing 57: Whomping Willow.

  Notes: Darkfic, slash, violence, S/M and adult themes. This is a version of Snape that's a little more damaged than usual. Thanks to Bernice for beta, much appreciated.
