I wanted to read something with a powerful Hermione as the main character.

However I would like for an actual flawed Hermione, someone who makes mistakes and does learn from them. Not just an invencible Hermione.

I would just like a really good characterization of her basically

Thank you


** Confectionary Chronicles is an interesting Hermione. It's a Supernatural Crossover, but you don't need to know shit about Supernatural to read it - literally all I know is that they have a gay angel and they went to hell a few times and that there are two dude main characters (damned if I can remember their names though). If you don't enjoy the first one, definitely try the second - it's more about Hermione at Hogwarts than Hermione growing up and being around Loki.

Also, trigger warning for a vivid, but entirely non-graphic depiction of suicide in the opener of the first story. If you wanna skip it, move down past the first line break to the part that starts "After the funeral, Helen and Richard decide to move away from the area."

** Hermione is a strong character in pretty much [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][all my stories]]. Not perfect - but neither is she a bundle of flaws that wouldn't be able to function much less thrive in society.

You might like "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief", which shows her learning how to become a master thief from a gentleman thief in order to avenge her being framed for a crime she didn't commit. Expelled, her studies don't go as well as they would've gone at Hogwarts, but she still becomes a skilled witch. Although she makes a few crucial mistakes as well.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  What if it had been Hermione's name that the Goblet of Fire spat out? A complex spell cast one summer with the most innocent of intentions results in the Brightest Witch of her Age being entered into the Triwizard Tournament. How can she get out of this?

  A complete re-write of Book Seven:(mostly Hermione-centric, features other character POVs, and Harmony is the main pairing - though this fic is about more than just their relationship, it is a story about the war)‘So why are you still here?' Harry asked Ron.‘Search me,' said Ron.‘Go home then,' said Harry.‘Yeah, maybe I will!' shouted Ron, and he took several steps towards Harry, who did not back away...What could have happened between Harry and Hermione in the Deathly Hallows after Ron leaves.This story mostly follows canon but provides a different look at how the relationships in HP could have formed had Hermione realized that she and Ron did not fit well together and that Harry, her best friend, was really what she was looking for the whole time. Includes added subplots and a gritty and realistic view on the war.[Updates on Sundays +/- a few days. Things are crazy right now but I'm still trying for biweekly]**NOTE: this fic contains mature content, explicit language and is dark in nature. PLEASE READ THE TAGS**

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

** linkffn(The Arithmancer) is worth a look, especially the first book. However, I do sometimes feel in the sequel like Hermione is more of a plot device, to explore the world-building, than a character, so it might not be ideal for what you're after. Still an interesting read.

Perhaps linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds)? I've read and enjoyed it and /still/ don't have idea what the title means. But it certainly has an interesting characterisation of Hermione, who is sent back to first year to avert a disaster, but has to be in someone else's body to do it, so she ends up in Slytherin, and has to embrace that aspect of her personality - sacrificing /whatever it takes/ - in order to keep her cover and complete her mission. Of all the Peggy Sue fics I've read, I think this is the one where the protagonist worked the hardest to preserve the timeline until the right point to change it.
