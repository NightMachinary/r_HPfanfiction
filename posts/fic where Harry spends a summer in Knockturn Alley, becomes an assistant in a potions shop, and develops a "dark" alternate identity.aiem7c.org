It was one of the best fics I've read, but the author deleted it from FFN to focus on their serious writing career.

Think it took place after fifth year (I think). Harry wanted some time alone and out from under Dumbledore's thumb, and ended up moving to Knockturn Alley and disguising himself to live in peace. He used a different name but I don't remember what it was. He discovered that he had "Dark" heritage and decided to learn more about rituals and dark magic, and I remember there was a scene where he performed a midsummer ritual in Gringotts?

At some point he started working in a potions shop for an old man whose name was "Zeek" or something, I don't remember exactly. He had a friend who worked in a robes shop, and befriended Draco Malfoy in a special library that Zeek had a key to.

The whole conception of "Dark" wizardry as a misunderstood pagan religion was really interesting--- true Dark witches and wizards had a blue mark on their faces.

If anyone could help me find this fic anywhere I'd be so so grateful!

  After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-

**** Welcome! I glossed over the 'been deleted' bit, but it looks like his profile has a link to it anyway.

** To add onto this: Out of the Night has long since been abandoned (and deleted), but I /think/ the author did invite people to continue it, if they wished. Has anyone done so?

*** I don't get why delete it. I understand abandoning it in order to focus on a more solid writing carreer, but what is the point of deleting it instead of leaving it there for people to enjoy?
