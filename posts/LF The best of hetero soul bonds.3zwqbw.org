I've mostly avoided this section of the HP fandom. I'm looking for the best soul bond fics you know of preferably Harry with a female. Thanks


** Probably the best I can think of is Jeconais's [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]].

#+begin_quote
  A man who is lost in his own country. A girl who needs her mate to survive. A tale of Quidditch and romance, of anger and betrayal, of friendship and enmity. A story of the power of hope.
#+end_quote

If you don't mind seeing the trope subverted, there's linkffn(A Mother In Law's Love by Perspicacity).

  Distraught over Ginny's death in the final battle, Harry gambles desperately and travels back in time to set things right. Unfortunately, not everything goes as planned. A twist on the classic Soul Bond tale.

*** Soul bond like marriage contract fics are an easy way of getting Harry and someone together usually when their souls merge or some other BS reason. They find that they have to be in contact with each other all the time call it love at first sight, or in some cases they have a direct link into each other's minds.

I hope that answers your question. Other tropes include the "Veela Bond"

** linkffn(8490518)

This is the only soul bond story that I've been able to enjoy so far. It has a unique, realistic take on soul bonds - where the bond has more negative effects than positive, causing the couple to fight all the time. And, like all good things, it's abandoned :(

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

** When Harry soul-bonds with anyone, the target is usually Ginny, and often as a result of CoS incident. There are several decent fics about theme:

*The Bonds of Blood*, linkffn(5435295)

*The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond*, linkffn(9818387)

*The Ties That Bind*, linkffn(6497669)

*Remember*, linkffn(4936039)

*If You Can Help Her*, linkffn(2788096)

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382), is my favorite one. Hermione was part of the bond, and as a result Harry's life really took a positive turn. Although a Harry/Multi story, the number of bonded girls was limited to three, as his bond partners would ACTIVELY prevent others joining their bonds. The overall story makes for a funny and light-hearted reading.
