I saw a fic that looked really awesome the other day where Snape had to pretend to be Harry and spend the summer with the Dursleys, but it had some really bizarre attempts to retcon James' bullying that really turned me off. Now I'm thirsty for this trope.

I don't particularly care about seeing Harry in Snape's place or anything.

Tangentially, I'm always looking for fics that force Snape to be nice /without/ trying to retcon his canon awfulness or pretending it doesn't exist. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/601118/1/Yet-Another-Snape-meets-the-Dursleys-story][Yet Another Snape Meets the Dursleys Story]] and In Care Of are my favorites but there isn't much like them.

PLEASE no noncanon pairings.


** This sounds very interesting! :) I would like to read this story too!

** It's not exactly what you are asking for, but it does have Snape at the Dursleys. He shows up at privet drive badly injured after a death eater meeting and ends up stuck there with Harry without a way to contact the order. Snape is in character and the writing is good although sometimes heavy on hurt and comfort. The fic is abandonded though and ends on quite a cliffhanger.

  Harry didn't think life at Privet Dr could get any worse, until Snape showed up, half dead and bleeding on the Dursleys' new floor. Starts summer after OoTP, keeps everyone in char, follows canon, or what it could have been with a summer like this...

** I can only think of one that has this trope: /You Broke Him, You Fix Him/ linkffn(3024822). It's been a seriously long time since I read it and I don't recall liking it overmuch. All I remember is that Occlumency lessons went badly, Snape had to take Harry's place at the Dursleys, then there was there was the sort of stuff you get in a Snape and Harry hurt/comfort story (if I remember correctly.) Not slash. Don't recall any pairings.

*** Yes, unfortunately that is the one I disliked. Thank you for the effort, though.

I didn't think there was a huge chance of finding more on that topic but I figured I'd give it a go. I don't know as much about Harry Potter ficcing communities as I do other fandoms, so I was hoping that perhaps there were some un-Googleable LJ entries floating around somewhere :P

  After a brutal Occlumency lesson has disasterous consequences, Dumbledore insists that Snape fix Harry and take his place at the Dursleys. Rated for language and abuse.

** Have you read the sequel to In Care Of? It got removed from FFN, but it can be found at [[http://jrkywsy.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-23.html]] (about halfway down the page - just ctrl+f for 'tightrope' and you'll find it =) )

** Wouldn't Snape just simply kill them within an hour? I mean, he was able to cast a killing curse at a friend, so people who torture "his kind" and are basically his abusive father reincarnated would not even merit a moral consideration. And he always had a fascination with the dark arts, invented dark curses during his teenage years and later joined magical fascists, so he is not exactly one for finess or mercy.

And that's not even taking "they tortured */Lily's/* child" into account. I mean, I am all for Dursley torture porn, but I don't think that's what you are looking for. So, in your ideal story, why wouldn't they end up dead within minutes? It can't be about the protection since Harry is not there.

*** I'm just looking for a fic I'd like to read, man, I really don't care how stupid you think I am or how much you hate the idea. Constrained circumstances are a very basic trope. I can't see why you even thought it fit to comment. Nobody comes here to be criticized for their taste.
