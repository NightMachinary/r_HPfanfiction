No, I don't want the fics where Death Eater somehow buddies with Harry and tortures Dursleys, Harry goes Dark and kill them, or Dumbledore or any canonically good wizards punish them by standard legal methods. I want to see Dursleys that suffer miserably and slowly with their self-worth destroyed to bits because I think Dursleys got away with their abuses too easily. I personally would love to see Dudley prostrating in front of Harry for money(i.e. because his family went bankrupt) only to be rejected and humiliated in the cruelest way.

...what is wrong with me lol? Anyway, it would be nice to see fics like that.
