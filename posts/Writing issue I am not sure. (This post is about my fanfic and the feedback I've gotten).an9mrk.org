So my fanfic is about a Grindelwald, and no, not Gellert. Some may know about the story as I've tried promoting it here.

​

The issue I've had is that a 'few' people assume the oc is the main character which is definitely correct. But, they've also considered him the hero of the story which definitely isn't true considering what I have planned. He's also not intended to be the main villain either.

​

To put it simple, he's a Grindelwald. A Grindelwald taught by his grandfather, I wasn't sure if it was due to my writing but I wanted to emphasise the fact that there was no chance of him been the 'hero' simply for the fact he was brought up by his grandfather. The Gellert Grindelwald in this story is without a doubt different to the one in canon, far more... 'Uncaring' in a way.

I've had a few reviews complain about the magic the oc has used, at first it was due to the fact that he was young but a few chapters on and they understood why, after that it was more due to the nature of the curses. I am fairly certain a few people expected him to be the hero? In a sort of redemption thing for the Grindelwald name but that was never my intention. I wanted to build on a more of a anti-hero kinda story. Someone willing to do what Dumbledore couldn't.

I was curious how others have tried that? For me I went with the whole, willing to use dark magic including unforgivable and spells that are far worse, for 'good' reasons. The reasoning is sound as long as morality isn't brought up but considering I'd never intended for him to be a hero that wasn't an issue for me, and of course considering the backstory I'd given him. Some of the readers in question seemed to expect something else entirely, considering the number of them, I was a bit disappointed in my own writing, I wanted to find out a better way to go about it.

​

Any tips or hints are all fully appreciated.


** Well, I think the summary is part of the reason people expect a hero - it carries a slight "I'm not my grandfather; I don't want to be my grandfather" vibe. You might want to drop the Disclaimer - put that in a note at the start of the story - and add something that clarifies that this isn't about a "Good Grindelwald Character".

*** The disclaimer was something one of my readers gave me, the original one had been made at the start of the story and quite frankly was a terrible one, I am not really sure what improvements I could make to it as the current does describes Rodrick's personality, before going into Hogwarts, very well. Any tips or hell a new disclaimer would help regarding it. I am not sure how to improve it myself without any spoilers.

**** You could add a line that describes his morals. What and who does he care about, for example. People generally don't expect heroics from a selfish character, for example.

Although some readers won't care anyway - I've had a similar issue in one a story with some readers rooting for the POV character supporting aristocracy instead of democracy.

**** OC/SI-centric fics in general are also a tough sell. I'm not speaking to your fic specifically here, but they get a bad rap, and people are generally interested in reading about the canon characters they know and love. The common effective use of OCs is more to further flesh out the world. In practice, you see a few absolutely standout OC/SI fics, plus a few "HP fanfic in name only" like Alexandra Quick, but there are biases you need to overcome if you want that kind of fic to reach a wider audience. Most don't really do anything interesting enough to appeal to overcome that bias. Not only that, but you're writing an OC-centric fic that also has a lot of focus on largely name-only characters like Daphne or

And honestly, some of the things you brought up in your main post above sound good, and glancing through your fic you definitely bring in a lot of fairly original ideas, even if you're following the same story beats. At 300k+ words, you've clearly put a lot of work into this and have likely improved as a writer. So just keep in mind that not all commentary/reviews you get from your readers needs to be taken at face value.

**** It seems that you introduced a new OC and basically rehashed the same canon plot?

Wormtail obviously escaped in chapter 65, and you railroaded everything onto canon stations. Don't tell me you plan to have Wormtail stun Harry in the Graveyard again.

This sub hates canon rehashes. We know what's going to happen, we don't want to see it regurgitated hundreds of times over and over. We appreciate authors who can develop ORIGINAL PLOT consistently and logically.

Therefore, if we want your story to stand out, abandon the canon plot rail immediately and surprise us readers.

***** Wormtails 'escape' occurred for a different purpose entirely. I don't, and never really planned on having Pettigrew take Harry's blood.

I was fairly certain that my fic been a canon rehash was essentially dropped following second year, first year the only change I think I made was regarding what Dumbledore found out and the troll incident but that was mostly due to me trying to build relationships in said year and of course due to Rodricks character, second year a lot of things ended up changing due to Rodrick's presence.

Following third year, it's practically impossible to go back to canon.

** Like someone else commented, the summary makes it that people can very easily expect a "good" main character.

#+begin_quote
  Follow Rodrick, grandson of Gellert Grindelwald, as he struggles with his own identity in a world both magical and dangerous.
#+end_quote

This part of the summary implies to me that he struggles with his identity as a Grindelwald and the things that are associated with that name.

#+begin_quote
  Will he ever be able to step out of his grandfather's shadow?.
#+end_quote

This implies to me that he doesn't want to be seen as a dark wizard.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe if nobody finds out his family name in the first place. Of course, things don't always go to plan
#+end_quote

This implies to me that he doesn't want to be associated with the name Grindelwald at all.

Nothing about this summary hints at this character becoming a dark wizard, or not being "good". If I read this summary I'd expect a redemption story for a young wizard whose name is marred by his families actions in the past.

*** The first part of the summary was based off him in first year in a way, at the start he has an identity crisis not because of what his name is but because he has to hide it. He wasn't upset with the name but more of afraid of the consequences that came with it.

'Will he ever be able to step out of his shadow' wasn't intended to be about whether he was a dark wizard but more that his grandfather was infamous and he himself thought it'd be difficult to live up to such a reputation, power and influence wise.

And the last part was, I thought, meant to show that he didn't want his name to be shown for the same reasons above.

The OC has never been ashamed of the name, just afraid of it.

I'd never really seen it the way you put it until now. I am honestly unsure how to change it to better fit what I intended the summary to be about.

** Something I'm not sure anyone has mentioned yet (although I agree firstly with everyone else!), is that people tend to want to follow a hero/good person. Have you heard of the writing technique of "save the cat"? Whether realistic or not, people tend to want to read a good person going through struggle coming out on top, or the downfall of a bad person. Morally grey characters are interesting, but they're not always what readers look for. You will probably end up with a better story, but it won't be mainstream.

*** I don't really have an issue with that, I am more concerned the story isn't living up to what people expect going in. I can definitely understand the disappointment of reading through a story to suddenly finding out the main pov isn't what you expected to be, even worse when it isn't the kind of story you'd enjoy.

** I'm not interested at all in these kind of OC/SI fics. Especially if it's a self-righteous prick showing those stupid gryffindor's how it is done...

Just a piece of advice: You appear to be writing from a third person limited perspective, but your narration occasionally slips into omniscient narration or into other people's heads. I've only skipped through a few chapters (for example chapter 43) and found it really jarring.
