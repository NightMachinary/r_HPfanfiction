I have read the well known Harry x Tonks fanfics (e.g. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6740130/1/The-Rebel-and-The-Chosen]]) but i was wondering if there were any other well written ones?


** Linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall) has enough Harry x Tonks to warrant a read.

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  In the summer prior to fifth year, Andromeda Tonks finds out her daughter Nymphadora has set her sights on Remus Lupin. She's not happy with this, and tricks Tonks into going for Harry Potter instead. What starts out as a way to "get back" at her parents, turns into an uncommon romance... Canon until the start of Book 5 'Order of the Phoenix', mild lemons. NOT ABANDONED

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** Have you read Harry Potter and the Summer of Change?

Not particularly well written grammatically, but I enjoyed the story immensely. One aspect of the writing that irritates me is the seeming inability of the author to use contractions.

*** It is far from perfect, still has oodles of cliches like Gringotts trips, will readings, "I like your natural form better", etc., but I still reread parts or the whole every couple months just because despite its flaws it is just a good story overall. Part of me wishes it had a sequel, but it stands on its own and it isn't hard to imagine where the story would go from where it was left.
