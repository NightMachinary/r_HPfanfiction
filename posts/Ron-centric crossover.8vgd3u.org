I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10305062/1/Speed]] not too long ago and liked it. I've since found that Ron-centric crossovers are very hard to find, much less the good ones. Anybody has a crossover rec or two that wouldn't require me to be familiar with the other fandom(s)?


** If you're into crossovers I suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11230962/1/Son-of-the-archer][Son of the archer]] by Melancholy's Sunshine. This series is a HP and MCU crossover, but the story focuses on the two most underrated characters in their respective franchises. The fic really gives Ron and Clint more character development. Basically, baby Ron is kidnapped and saved by Clint. Being a muggle, he does not know about the wizard world so he could not find Ron's family and decides to raise Ron himself. Very well written series with lots of adorable interactions overall.

  Third installment of the Son of the Archer series. Ron has survived his first year at Hogwarts. But it's never that simple is it? After all, he still has his family he was raised with, and the family he was born to in his life. Add in one of the most egotistical muggle men to grace technology and famous magical author and watch things get out of hand.

** linkffn(9249261) A Harry Potter and Naruto crossover where Ron is reborn as Naruto, while it hasn't updated for a long time I really like the inner turmoil Ron has as Naruto and is honestly trying his best to be someone else in new world and I quite like how the last chapter ended.

linkao3(12805206) Not quite a crossover as it has Gordon Ramsey in it but it does diverge from canon and has rather excellent characteristic of Ron in it as he is one of the main character in the story

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

  Reincarnated!Ron. Ron lives. He dies. And somehow, he lives again. Only it's not him this time, it's not the Wizarding World, it's not magic, and he wishes things weren't this complicated.

** I'll recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12888333/1/Champions-of-the-Two-Worlds]]

It's a HP/Warcraft crossover, and Ron's story arc is brilliant.
