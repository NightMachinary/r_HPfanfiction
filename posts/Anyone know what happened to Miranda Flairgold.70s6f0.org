So, I figure everyone knows about the A Second Chance at Life series by Miranda Flairgold. I recently stumbled across that series again, but she seems to have rather suddenly vanished about 4-5 years ago. Anyone know what's up with that?


** [[http://mirandaworks.freeservers.com/][This]] seems like their website, it has an email address. Dunno if it's still checked or even active.

Honestly, they might've just moved on from fanfiction and used a different handle for whatever involvement they still do have. Might've set up the account in their teens and wanted to distance themselves later on. Prolly happens to a lot of people.

** She was active as late as April 2014 (sort favorites by publish date).

My guess is she just burned out on fanfiction. Happens a lot, even to authors with the best of intentions (looking at you GreenGecko).

** It's sad that it's abandoned. A second chance at Life is one of my all time favorite stories. I absolutely loved the blood magic and runic magic system, and just the general badassery going on.
