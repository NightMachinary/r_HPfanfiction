*** In my headcanon she has deep black hair that barely shimmers purple in the light, and bright violet eyes, so anything else is weird for me, but I've gotten used to the standard Blonde/blue eyed girl everyone writes

**** Minus the violet eyes....I can totally believe that. Cornflower blue. Medium height. Quite bubbly. Just as smart as Hermione but doesn't get noticed because it's not shoved in your face. Should have been a Hufflepuff, but asked for Slytherin because of her parents or sibling.

** Sex hound Sirius is usually a lot of fun. His death was the only part of the series that teared me up and reflecting on how shitty his life was only compounds it. Universes where he gets to be immature and have fun make me happy.
