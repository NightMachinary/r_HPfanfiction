You know the power fantasy dark!harry fics right? I think it would be great to see some about Ron.


** I always thought I would love to read something along the following lines: after Ron leaves the tent in DH, he is actually captured by Snatchers, but since he is a pureblood, Voldemort pardons him with the condition that he becomes a Death Eater. Ron accepts with the condition that his family or Hermione won't be harmed. In order to win his trust, Ron gives Harry's location to Voldemort, as well as the fact that he is hunting Horcruxes. Voldemort finds Harry and kills him. This makes Ron one of Voldemort's proteges and everyone (not knowing that Voldemort is immortal) expect for Ron to be Voldemort's successor. Meanwhile Ron is hunting Horcruxes and destroying them one by one. Once he is done, he poisons Voldemort and takes his position as the leader of Magical Britain. From this position he gives Muggleborns protection and more rights to the House Elves. Despite being hated by his family and the love of his life, turns out Ron did all this for Hermione.

*** That might work but Voldemort kills anyone who even suspects of his horcruxes, and that Hermione is a Muggleborn and knows of the horcruxes (as does Ron), and Voldemort is a master Legilimens and Ron doesn't know Occlumency so can't lie to him or betray him like that. So Voldemort is far more likely to take what he wants from Ron and then kill him.

I posted a prompt once that got this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/egtpoi/-/fcm4u0m][amazing comment]] in answer. You might want to take a look.

Edit: Grammar

**** Thanks for the link.

Also my comment was but a fanfic prompt. I would have written it if I were not so shitty at writing dialogs but I think, that while what you said might be very valid for canon, I think there could be ways to develop the story while avoiding the conflicts you mentioned without altering the story prior to that point. For example, Ron might have taken seriously the fact that Hermione was insisting on Harry to learn Occlumency and while still being supportive towards Harry., he secretly learned Occlumency using tips that Harry was telling him about that he got from Snape. Also Ron could play the Horcrux hunt as Harry doing something that he didn't feel like sharing with his friends so that's why he left. All he knew was that Harry stole a locket from Umbridge.

** Well, I know one with a shitty but well-writter Ron.

And another Ron who's totally grey - started out as bright as a beacon but he gets so dark as the story progresses due to the amount of shit he has to do, but even then although his methods are bad his intentions are good.
