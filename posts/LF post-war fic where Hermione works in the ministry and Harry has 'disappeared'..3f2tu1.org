Details: I don't really remember much beyond the fact that it was long, Hermione had kids and was a fairly prominent member of the MoM and Harry had disappeared for a while (years, probably), for some reason. I think some of the kids knew about his return before Hermione, and kept it from her for some reason. That's pretty much all I can recall, unfortunately.

Any chance somebody remembers which this was? I know it's a tall ask, given how vague my description is, but...


** Is it Coming Back Late?

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?

**** Technically, Hermione doesn't have children of her own in this one, but yes, Harry contacts a certain member of the next generation before Hermione.

****** OK, maybe I misremembered. But, IIRC, it's [[/spoiler][Teddy Lupin]] that Harry contacts first.

  COMPLETE. One-Shot. Hermione Granger has to locate Harry Potter or she'll lose her job. She's more than a little curious what he's been up to the last few years. Perhaps, she'd be better off figuring out where he's going rather than where he's been.
