Alright I'm just writing this to get it of my chest and this might sound a bit nitpicky but as the title says for the love of all that is holy, stop using the word smirk in every other sentence. I mean come on there have to be some other way for the writer to give the character an apropriate facial expression because for me seeing the word smirk literally make me cringe and kinda kill the story for me (just once or twice every chapter depending on the chapter length is fine but when it becomes the goto expression it just feels unatrual and akward to read).

Sometimes it also feels like the writer doesn't know what the word mean and use as a form of a smile which it is but not using it in the right context. It also kills the story for me in the way that there never really is any other facial expression to speak and that it's never really goes branches out in other way that just writing "he said with a smirk" insterad of telling us more of what sort of smirk it is so if this post accomplishes anything it will hopefully be to shed light on the meaning of the word smirk and why I feel it's overused sometimes

Verb: smile in an irritatingly smug, conceited, or silly way.

example:"he smirked in triumph"

/noun/

a smug, conceited, or silly smile.

Example:"Gloria pursed her mouth in a self-satisfied smirk"

Sorry about this I just needed to go on a bit of a rant and I know that HP-fanfictions are not the sole offender in this but seeing as I read mostly this I will post it here.


** I agree, however in my defense it's really hard to write about Draco Malfoy without having him smirk or god forbid -sneer.

Now, here's some useless data about the word "smirk" in the Harry Potter books.

Throughout all 7 books, the word "smirk" appeared a grand total of 11 times. The word "Smirked" appeared 20 times, and finally the word "smirking" appeared a whopping 36 times, 15 of those times appearing just in Order of the Phoenix!

In total, these "smirk-related" words appeared 67 times throughout the entire series. (I hope I did my math right.)

Of these 67 times, the word was used to describe Draco Malfoy 27 times. So around 40% of all the smirks in the books was just Malfoy. (Snape smirked an unimpressive 8 times, because screw Snape amirite?)

The remaining smirks were done by other villainous characters including but not limited to Dudley, Pansy, Fudge, Crabbe, and Goyle, however Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George also got in on the smirking action every once and a while.

I hope you find all of this information very useful, because I have chose to do this instead of working on my math test. If anyone has any questions regarding the word "smirk" or any unrelated topics, I will be happy to procrastinate longer to answer them for you. Thanks.

*** Tbh what I got from this was that 'smirking' was used a hell of a lot less in Canon than most people do in ff. 67 uses in 7 books is pretty miniscule compared to the overuse in some ffs and other fandoms. It's just such a common trope to use for antagonistic characters in lieu of actually antagonistic actions.

After all, why spend hours coming up with something for your villain to say/do with lasting consequences of finesse when you could have them just throw out an insult before tossing a sledgehammer in the readers face with a solid 'smirk' to make sure they didn't miss it.

**** While hilarious, is it really always /that/ bad? I am sorry, I am a bit inexperienced with bad fanfic. I thought in the books, it tends to be that a character does smth villainous and /then/ smirks, which also makes the most sense. Or one character does smth and the rest smirks, grins, giggles or laughs. And Draco has shown himself to be a teen,not capable of doing truly villainous things, so... yeah. Most likely to insult and smirk.

*** This made me laugh, I admire your research.

As a person who writes primarily Draco fics, it is one of those terms that truly resonates with his character. But as OP stated, I try to alter the term with things like 'the corners of his lips curled into a menacing smile'. Still, I'm pretty confident my chapters include at least one 'smirk' per go.

** We need a fic where all of this happens constantly - Snape sneers, Dumbledore twinkles, Ron chortles, and Malfoy smirks - and Harry gets really concerned and goes to the library to read an ancient looking tome (sighing over the fact that even the textbooks that he knows are duplicated with an enchanted printing press look like they were handwritten by medieval monks) called Tome M.D (Magical Doctor) that tells him each and every one of those people doing those things so often... are dying. He goes to talk to Dumbledore about it, and through the course of a conversation several misunderstandings (and revelations) are made and the newly-made Indy!Harry takes it upon himself to be their personal Make a Wish Foundation. He has lots of money and many titles, so he has the power to help them check off their bucket lists before they die.

Since they are not dying, this causes some confusion.

Could either take it in a redemption-friendship direction where they all get chummy and do activities together, or a full dark-comedy where Harry starts to get more and more desperate about them all being in denial.

** Yea, many years ago "he/she smirked" has lost all meaning to me when reading HP fanfiction. It is used so often in places where it makes no effing sense for a character to smirk that I just started to assume the author has no idea what it means and be done with it.

Also, different from many other annoying trends in the fandom, this one is not recent. Even 15 years ago in the mid 2000s it was already something that stood out to me.

** I agree! Sometimes its hard to push through a fic when this happens. Yes, a smirk is a smile, but there are other connotations to the word that limit its use! Its a big turn off when a character is "smirking" when they're actually grinning or beaming or what have you. It really breaks the immersion in my case.
