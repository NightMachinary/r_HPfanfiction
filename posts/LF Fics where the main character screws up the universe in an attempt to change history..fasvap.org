  When only one Hogwarts letter arrives for identical twin sisters, Juliet and Jennifer Belstone find themselves separated for the first time in their lives. Desperate to be reunited, they ask...could a Squib ever become a witch? Soon, they embark on a difficult and dangerous journey; travelling far beyond Hogwarts in their search for a source of magical power to bridge the divide.
