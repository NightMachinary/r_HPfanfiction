It's been at least a month since someone has talked about this and I feel the need to drag it into the limelight. The question I pose: What is the best piece of Harry Potter crack fiction you have ever read?

  Scorpius really should have listened to his father's numerous and dire warnings about the Potter clan. Harry feels his pain. Gen crackfic WIP, yo. Seriously, so cracky.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

*** It took a lot of effort to finish that one. And, I'm in search of the best as in actually the best and most humorous. Though, that is an entirely subjective matter so any suggestions are appreciated.

** The two that take the cake for me are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11136995/1/Potter-Ever-After][Potter Ever After]] - A bad writer decides to write a fanfic (with lots of tropes), but the characters are all self-aware. Highlight include Ron and Harry having a conversation about Ron-bashing, and McGonagall joining the Death Eaters (because she wants to be more relevant for the plot).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] - Needs no introduction. A piece of Voldemort takes over Harry's body by accident on 10/31, and decides to live life. With the added bonus of everyone being ridiculously stupid.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
