***** Teachers injured maybe? Or the Board is wiped out, since LV put his lads in and they all got a bad case of /reducto/ during the battle so the Ministry takes over on an interim basis? Dunno.

It'd be much more reasonable than most marriage law fics, honestly.

** This is actually kind of a good idea. I've never gotten why the school seems to encourage separation and competition within its own community (secluded tables, different uniforms, quidditch battles, points/house cup, etc.). It makes it really hard to befriend other house members and basically chooses who you hang out with and who your enemies are. It's pretty much a segregationist society.
