Rowling said in an interview that Hermione goes back to finish her newts. Would she have just commuted? Or stayed with Ginny in her dorms? Had a dorm to herself?


** I like the idea that the school builds a special tower for students returning to retake seventh year, where all the houses are mixed and they have a shared common room

** I'm of the opinion that Ginny is the head girl of that year instead of Hermione. While Hermione was instrumental in finding the Horcruxes and defeating Voldemort, Ginny was there at Hogwarts leading the students and suffering alongside them. Ginny, not Hermione, would have far greater pull among students.

I expect both of them to be at Hogwarts. The badly traumatized students need their lead, and it will be an extremely difficult year

*** Absolutely. I'll add that Ginny is known as very popular and sociable, which would make her more likable as someone who's got authority over the rest of the students.

** She would be just a seventh-year like any other, so yes, she would be in the same dorm as Ginny.

** My head canon is that Hermione became head girl, and Ginny was Gryffindor quidditch captain.

** She obviously has a private dorm room that inexplicably shares a common room with Draco Malfoy who weeps nighty. But that's ok, because she's usually at her late night private torturing with Snape.

The second half of the year she's the transfiguraton apprentice and assistant professor. This is great because Harry is teaching DADA and they make a great team.

However, her career plans are detailed when a marriage law is passed that causes her to discover she's an omega.

To avoid a distasteful ministry pairing, she travels back in time and redeems Tom Riddle with tough love and sarcasm.

The end.

**** Rated T for swearing and canon typical violence.
