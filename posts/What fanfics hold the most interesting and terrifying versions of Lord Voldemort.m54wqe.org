I'm not looking for stories where Voldemort is some uber powerful evil wizard god so much as stories that take a dark psychological horror approach to Voldemort. I'm looking for stories where he's creepy, intelligent, calculating and carries an unnerving presence when he's on the page. A Voldemort that shows why wizards and witches fear to speak his name. I have no issues if he is somewhat different from canon, has different goals or methods of seeking power and immortality. Hopefully presented in well written stories,


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368][There is Nothing to Fear series]] has a terrifying and very successful Gryffindor Tom Riddle. As things stand now, [[/spoiler][he already slew Dumbledore with the Sword of Gryffindor and has Britain firmly under his control]]

**** I've been reading through the series now, and it's amazing! And definitely fits the prompt here: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,” Riddle sang softly, as the basilisk began to circle the room.

He's so scary! Extreme psychopath!

*** I'm worried he'll be the uber powerful Voldemort I'm trying to avoid but I will give it a shot. Thank you!

** Sorry for hijacking this post but I hope someone may be able to identify this story which I've been searching for for months.

It's essentially the charismatic sociopath Tom Riddle that JK (not so successfully) tried to make him be. It's a pretty long one shot (could be a novella) happening immediately after the closing of the Chamber of Secrets. Tom Riddle is universally loved and respected by pureblood, half-bloods and muggleborns alike. He also has a teacher who is married to the first muggleborn head of DMLE. He manipulates her, seduces her and eventually rapes her. After that he poses as the innocent student who was raped by a teacher and blackmails her husband to resign in order not to make it public. That's a scary Tom Riddle. Especially that he is portrayed so realistically and it makes you think that you can always encounter such people and you can not do anything about it.

** Hm, I'm picturing some sort of Hannibal style Dark Lord--which reminds me of the scene from Prince of the Dark Kingdom where Voldemort eats the flesh of one of his horcruxes. That was pretty creepy!

** I found Benefits of Old Laws quite interesting. Voldemort isn't scary or ultra evil, but he is interesting still

** I would say maybe The Lost Horcrux, The Many Deaths of Harry Potter and Brutal Harry.

** Shameless self promotion here, but I'm currently aiming to do that with my own story on Wattpad. First book had Quirrell essentially manipulating the reader into helping him due to the fact that he knows about his crush on Hermione. Yes, it's a Reader/Hermione pairing, but with emphasis on actually trying to focus on the trauma and the heroes getting help
