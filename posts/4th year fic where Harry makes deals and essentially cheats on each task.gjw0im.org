:END:
First task, he learns that dragons can speak Parseltongue, and makes a deal with the Horntail to send her firewhiskey and a lot of hot peppers; in exchange, she allows Harry to "defeat her" using an overpowered Lumos Maxima (which, considering that a dragon's eyes are vulnerable in Canon, might have been a viable tactic. Moving on). He ends up being the godfather of her eggs once they hatch. Second task, he trades a couple pallets of peanut butter for his hostage. In the graveyard, the young dragons all come to his rescue.

** There's another fanfic in which Harry basically dithers around every task, called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11610805/1/Dragon-Chronicles-1-Muggle-Raised-Champion][/Dragon Chronicles 1: Muggle Raised Champion/ by Stargon1]], the premise being that Harry never got to go to Hogwarts because the Dursleys denied him the opportunity, and being his legal guardians, they were allowed to. He ends up being forced into the Triwizard Tournament anyway.

To be clear; This isn't the fic you're looking for, but since another user already pointed you in the right direction, I figured you might like this one as one in a similar vein.

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
