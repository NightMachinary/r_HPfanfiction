I often avoid crossovers because I feel like I won't understand the story if it mixes HP with a franchise I know nothing about, but surely there are some interesting stories I've missed because of this.

What stories are they?


** I read quite a few of the MCU crossovers before actually sitting down and watching a single movie. So that's a pretty big arena you can play in. I imagine that most Tolkien (Hobbit/LotR) crossovers would be similar in that we've all absorbed some of the plot via simply existing and it doesn't matter if you've ever watched the movies or read the books. Ditto for other famous fandoms like star wars and star trek for example.

The sole MCU fic I linked (Finding Home) was the first one I tried. It's not the best available (there are threads upon threads of Avengers crossovers if you care to search), but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

Same with Browncoat, Green Eyes - it's a Firefly crossover, and I watched the TV show after finishing the fic.

Not as Grimm as it Seems. This one you can probably get away with too. You know that TV show with the cop that sees the dudes with monster faces? It was the competitor for Once Upon A Time? Yeah, it's a crossover with that.

Hermitage: it's a Vampire Hunter D crossover that I read that I was fine with. This is apparently a series of Japanese novels? I was a bit confused about part three of the series, but the rest was fine.

I've also included a Lucifer oneshot: City of Angels It's rather self explanatory, I think.

I've thrown a Bewitched one in too (Elder Sect), simply because it's such a rare crossover (for good reason). Odds are you've seen at least one episode in your life and therefore should be fine.

I was fine with the linked Stargate fic (Guardian). All I knew about the series prior to that fic was that Egyptian gods were involved somehow, and that there was a gate that somehow involved stars. Soooo.

ffnbot!slim

Edit~ The Grimm one is incomplete, but it's just a series of connected oneshots/drabbles. So it doesn't actually matter, since there isn't really an overarching plot. The rest are finished. I also added the names of each, since I forgot that the slim bot skips the fandom list and I had omitted a few.

  Many years have passed since the great battle of Hogwarts, and Harry's life has only gotten worse. Of course, he had imagined that after the battle ended, everything would go back to normal; at least, as normal as possible. But it wasn't long until the Ministry was taken over by yet more evil, dark, corrupt wizards. Wizards who wanted Harry out of the picture. After a series of unfortunate events, Harry is left on the run. Running from both the ministry and himself, it seemed. He has nowhere to go, and year after year passes by. He doesn't want to live like this anymore. He wants something better for himself; he wants the life that he once had. Being compared to Voldemort takes it's toll though, and the wizarding world no longer looks upon the boy who lived with wonder. They look upon him with disgust, with suspicious eyes and wands at the ready. He is an outcast in the only place he could call home. Stories about him are riddled with evil and lies, being passed down from generation to generation. But it all changes when a storm above London, England, at 9:46 am on August 13th, brings an outsider to earth, a powerful sorcerer with shoulder length black hair and and charming yet somehow malicious smile.

** linkffn(What's in a name? by muishiki) is a Ranma 1/2 crossover, but there's enough explanation of Ranma's situation in the story to understand it.

linkffn(Big Trouble in Old England by meteoricshipyards) is a cross with the action-comedy movie, 'Big Trouble in Little China'. There's enough explanation to get by, but all you really need is to know that Jack Burton is a brash American trucker who had a prior run-in with an immortal Chinese sorcerer.

linkffn(The Sea King by Doghead Thirteen) is a cross with the TV show, 'Deadliest Catch', and you don't even need to know that, really.

linkffn(The Traveler in Black meets Harry Potter by meteoricshipyards) is a cross with John Brunner's short story series, which is about an individual who has been tasked by a god with bringing Order out of Chaos. You don't need to know anything else, really, and that much is explained in the story.

linkffn(Plantagenet by HiBob) is a cross with Randall Garrett's 'Lord Darcy' stories. IIRC, there's enough explanation in the story, but it involves contact with a dimension in which the rules of magic were codified in the time of Richard the Lion-hearted, and there is no separation between wizards and the rest of society.

linkffn(The Crow: Phoenix Rising by Belcris) is a cross with the movie, 'The Crow'. It has enough exposition in the first chapter to understand what's going on.

linkffn(Harry Brown by mjimeyg) is a cross with 'Mrs. Brown's Boys'. I've never seen the show, but I quite enjoyed the story, and I don't think there's anything in it that needs more explanation.
