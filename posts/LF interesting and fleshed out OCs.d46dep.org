Basically, OCs that have some depth to their character and personality, who introduce something new to the story or have an interesting background. Maybe they represent something about the wizarding world we rarely see, like magical theatre and arts, or ministry employees. Maybe they're a werewolf who isn't like Remus but also not like Fenrir Greyback. They're just caught in the middle of the madness.. or a vampire since we barely get anything about them at all.

Edit: no crossovers

  Horcuxes were the pits. Dark Lords with prejudicial god complexes were worse. Ones that abducted & experimented on every magical variant they could get their hands on to 'enhance' their powers were enough to make Harry outright murderous. And it definitely didn't help that his girlfriend was a variant, & Harry really wanted to hang on to his snogging life. Dark Harry/OC -AU OotP

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter)

It's a full AU, so it introduces several new characters. Fem!Harry is basically an OC as her background is very different, and about half the cast of main characters are OC.

** "Mistakes" is has a fantastic, frustrating OC who is paired with Neville. He is an Indigenous Canadian wizard.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17186567]])

The most fleshed out OC in "Bloodcrest" presents a side of magic we don't know- necromancy- and portrays the life of a dark wizard who isn't a Dark Lord or some other megalomaniac. The vampire character was also intriguing. And, apparently it's not abandoned!

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.
