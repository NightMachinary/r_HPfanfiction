**** You know I want someone to like make a fic like this with all the cliches, except turn them on their heads so it makes Harry's life more difficult instead of easier! Like, friendly goblins are just conning him, his inheritance involves historical artifacts that get taken to a museum so he can't use them, his trunk breaks several chapters in, the Potter mansion will take like months of renovations to even get it livable for him so he can't stay in it yet...

And if there's a stupid marriage contract harem thing, make it so in the magical world the women have more legal authority and control over Harry than he does them, so he ends up stuck listening to them and doing what they want instead.

Also Harry's massively long string of stupid names and titles "Hadrian Gryffindor Perverl whatever" includes a long history of atrocities and crimes that make everyone who hears his name hate him for being of that terrible lineage.
