I was wondering if anyone knew any good fan fictions about smart Draco? My favorite one is currently [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21414103/chapters/69398121#workskin]] yet it is not finished. :(

I would love it if you would give me some suggestion, also I would rather not had a dramione fanfics. Im not a big fan of that ship, so please respect my opinion. If you do like that ship though, no disrespect to you, we all have the right to our own opinion.

If you do find a good fan fiction, I would like to just give you my preferences. My favorite ship is drarry, but again if you don't ship that I respect your opinion. So, if you do find a good fic I would either want it to be drarry or no ship, like the one I linked above.

If you are still hear, thank you for reading my post, and I would love to see some suggestions that you have.

(Also, please no fighting in the answers and don't forget to respect each other.)


** Correct me if I'm wrong, but the fanfic you linked is the version that the author is rewriting. There's a completed version on ff.net!
