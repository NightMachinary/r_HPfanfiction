:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfiction where harry got pulled into an alternate universe, I remember even whole phrases of dialogue the characters had but the problem is a google search only finds fanfictions if you know phrases in the first page, while what I remember is in different pages of the fic, that's why I can't find it.

Basically, in this fanfiction harry is used to being simply hermione's friend, however in this alternate universe they were together, which gives hermione the idea harry is acting weird when she meets\talks to him, at some point even threatening to hex him, eventually believing his story about coming from another universe.

At some point he is interrogated by mcgonagall, if I recall both her and dumbledore were suspicious, knowing he wasn't really from their universe, while snape plots to kill harry, and in fact the harry that was originally in this alternate universe is for the big part of the story in hospital, severely wounded, the story is supposed to have plenty of words, 10k bare minimum, possibly a lot more, and something like 10-15 chapters minimum.

I've tried sooooooo many searches about alternate universe fanfictions but I can't find this, anyone has any suggestion?


** I don't think it has Minerva (I can't spell her last name) and the wounded part but it has everything else. It does feature Bellatrix which makes me think this isn't what you are looking for. On the off chance it is, what I'm thinking of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2896398/1/]] (Only Enemies).

*** Indeed, bellatrix isn't supposed to be a main character, nor to be teleported with harry; harry is the only one who swaps universe in that fanfiction I'm looking for, thanks for trying though.

*** Wow, found, found, found!

I did more google searches as tests and found out I must've been mistaken in my previous test: you can find words even not on the first page, I managed that for shadow walker for example.

Therefore, I did a google search for "not the same person i was" "don't want you to be scared" both of these phrases, quotes included, else I wouldn't filter well at all, which are phrases harry tells hermione when revealing what happened and I got 2 results, 1 has nothing to do with it and 1 gave: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4108875/7/Free-Will-and-Fate]]

It's that, at last, found what I was looking for at chapter 7, searched through many english harry + hermione pairing stories with 10k+ words, turns out the only problem was they weren't marked as pairing, hence I'd have had to search through 30k + stories instead of 700 if I were to find this again!

Give us some examples. Someone on the sub might remember it.

*** Ok, for example when hermione initially meets time-travelling harry, thinking he was the one she knows, greets him with a kiss and he responds to it, and some chapters later, when the truth about not being the same harry is revealed, it goes like this: he asks for a "meeting" with her to explain why he's acting weird, and then he says something like: "I don't want you to be afraid of me...", (hermione pulls the wand out) "I'm not the harry you know... not the same person I was", (gets worried by her reaction) "I am, just not in the same way", then explains about coming from another universe and at some point hermione thinks about what happened the previous day "so the other day, when you kissed me back...", harry apologizes, which doesn't work, "I thought... nevermind what I thought, if you cared about me as a friend, you never would've done that to me!", and then when the situation gets better I remember harry asking some info about the letters they sent each other in that world, cause he needs information to know what snape is up to (who I think is the one who wants to kill him in that story).
