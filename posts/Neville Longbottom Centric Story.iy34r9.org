I'm currently writing a story where Neville gets thrown back in time after Harry's death by Voldy, becomes a Slytherin and eventually a death eater, all while in pursuit to destroy the horcruxes. But I'm wondering if there are any Neville Longbottom time travel stories that are similar to this please? The only one I found even close to this was a peado Sirius Black/child Neville smut one shot (something I wish I hadn't found).

Any recommendations please?
