I read the Rise of a Dark Lord by Little Miss Xanda a while back and I especially loved the numerous similarities between young Tom Riddle and Harry. Is there any more fics like that? Ex: Harry grows up in orphanage, Harry is very polite to all teachers and students, etc..... Thanks

*** Great fic, but I don't think it quite fits the request. Izar is very disinterested in any kind of social climbing and he is not even polite, as far as I can remember.

**** Thats true, on the other hand he does grow up in an orphanage and seems very gifted so there are at least some similarities...

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.
