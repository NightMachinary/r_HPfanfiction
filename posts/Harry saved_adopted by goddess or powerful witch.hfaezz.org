I am looking for fanfictions that follow this theme. It can be purely harry potter or it can be a crossover, it does not matter to me. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: It does not have to be a goddess specifically, just a mother figure with a lot of power.


** I mean, the big example is Harry Potter, Squatter, where he's basically adopted by Hestia and Artemis from the Percy Jackson Greek Pantheon. I was able to follow along with pretty much everything aside from some of the 'past events references' that the PJ wikis didn't seem to cover. I've never read any of the books or seen any of the movies, but I have a pretty decent knowledge of Greek Mythology, so I don't know fully if that's a useful statement to you or not.

**** Sure. I'll keep an eye out for others. :)

This one is sort of similar? Ish? It's really hard to explain without sounding quite mad, but it's a fun, weird fic where Harry is saved by something big, powerful, and female, so I'd say it fits. Ish. :D
