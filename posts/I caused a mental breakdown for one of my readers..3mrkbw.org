Laws against child abuse are not a modern invention. Even if there was no definition of or punishment for abuse in the wizarding world, the HP series takes place in the muggle world as well. Describing the conditions at the Dursley's as abuse shouldn't be an issue, since it happens outside of the "bass ackwards" world where people know that locking a child in a cupboard for 11 years results in an orange jumpsuit. And as a comment on the view that muggles shouldn't impose their views on magicals I'll submit this quote as an example of how two societies with varying views can coexist:

#+begin_quote
  /"Be it so. This burning of widows is your custom; prepare the funeral pile. But my nation has also a custom. When men burn women alive we hang them, and confiscate all their property. My carpenters shall therefore erect gibbets on which to hang all concerned when the widow is consumed. Let us all act according to national customs."/ -Charles James Napier [Said to Hindu priests complaining to him about the prohibition of Sati religious funeral practice of burning widows alive on her husband's funeral pyre.]

***** I'll start by saying that I did not, in any way, say that muggles shouldn't impose their views on the magicals; you live somewhere, you abide by their laws, no matter who you are. I'm not sure why you took anything in my message as being about the non-imposition thing, as it's quite different, but I'll just assume it was a mistake.

What I did mean was that people should not automatically assume that everything is automatically the same in the wizarding world as in the muggle one when it's a separate society that exists alongside the muggle one and is not going in the exact same direction and especially not at the same time. I mean, seriously, it's a duelling society, a world where at least on some level “might makes right”; it's bound not to be the same even if it were technologically at the same level which it is not.

Going back to the laws, the first law against child abuse in Britain happened in 1889; the separation of the muggles and wizards happened about 200 years prior to that. So no, those laws are still too modern, and considering that wizards---including children---are harder to damage and nobody amongst seems to be much concerned about emotional damage, I really don't see them coming up with any law of that sort on their lonesome; likewise, considering how much wizards tend to disregard muggles, I don't see them “borrowing” any such laws from the muggle world.

If it is written well then I can accept a story in which there are such laws. But people who claim that “no, 100% certain, there are laws like this in canon” when there's neither proof of such nor reason for them to exist, should stop for a really long moment and think.

Though I do concede, as per the first paragraph, that the Dursleys should have gotten in trouble with what they are doing due to the muggle law ... supposedly. I do agree that the whole issue is skipped and there is potential to explore, but some people do ignore how messed up the situation actually would be for Harry had he tried to go that way on his own (he's got a reputation as a disturbed kid, and there are holes in his history due to his involvement with the wizarding world, holes that would confirm his status as disturbed had he actually tried to explain them; and when I say “disturbed” I mean, basically, the very same as the reputation he has in Little Whinging due to Petunia spreading gossip about him, so one of a liar and a ruffian; also, due to him being a wizard he's harder to damage so heck knows if anyone would be able to find any actually detectable injuries that can be connected to the Dursleys at all).

Edit: /Shortly put, the whole thing is complicated, and I don't have issues with the laws themselves but rather with some people automatically assuming that different things are the same, which with law in two different societies that are mostly isolated from each other, is quite a mistake./
