these are the filters I'm putting on ffnet.

Sorted by publish date: all ratings, english, over 100k words, complete.

I'm going to read through all of the completed fics starting as far back as I can go and go forward.

I think I might die before I accomplish this goal.


** Oh Jesus Christ. I am pretty sure that is an impossible task, and for some fanfics, you'll come to regret it.

*** I know. I think I'll probably get a few pages in and then I'll give up.

** "Largest" and "greatest" are not the same.

If you really want to tackle a challenge that's time-consuming but not otherwise really difficult, how about choosing one of your favourites that doesn't have a TVTropes page, and filling one out?

Or just find the longest fic you can and read that. I'm not sure what the longest HP fic is, but I can recommend some from other fandoms if you want.
