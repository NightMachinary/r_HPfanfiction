Hello all, kinda new to the fanfiction scene, but I just reread the HP series for probably the 15th time at this point and I'm looking for some new Wizarding world content. (Other than cursed child, which I can't wait for).

What I'm looking for is specifically extended universe type stuff that follows canon (No crossovers, if sex is in the story it fits the current established canon, etc)

Side character stories are okay. I heard there is a book that focuses on Ginny's perspective over the course of the 7th actual book, stuff like that sounds like what I'm interested in.

Also, preferably completed works.

Basically, if it exists, I want to read some stuff that feels like I'm reading the real deal. Any help is appreciated.


** In the wild world of Potter fanfiction, there is a sliding scale of variance starting with 'Could've been canon' or canon-compliant, edging out to 'one change could have made a world of difference'. This is sometimes called Alternate Universe [AU], though even that is a floaty term. From there things explode out to the realm of 'Potter characters are like dolls/action figures, so here's my playtime story'. You're looking for canon-compliant.

Short, poignant, (mostly) compliant and the story I offer when someone asks 'Why bother with fanfiction?' - linkffn(Cauterize by Lady Altair)

Another short in the same vein: linkffn(the Twine Bracelet by CheddarTrek)

A longer story, as yet unfinished but closer to the style of the books than most can get - linkffn(Strangers at Drakehaugh by Northumbrian). Actually, Northumbrian has over 80 stories that all are part of a greater continuity that cleaves fairly close to canon, so that ought to keep you busy for a while.
