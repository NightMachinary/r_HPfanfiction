Has anyone written something based on [[https://youtu.be/TSQJ9W4SxiQ][Austin Mcconnell's "Let's Fix Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" video]]?

It's an interesting basis for a story that I would really like to see fleshed out.

^{Yes,} ^{I} ^{know} ^{there's} [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxsH8zEhEkk][a play]]. ^{Sorry,} ^{but} ^{I'm} ^{not} ^{going} ^{to} ^{a} ^{different} ^{country} ^{to} ^{see} ^{it.}


** I dunno, I watched that video and I'm not convinced the storyline is any better than the original. I don't think /Cursed Child/'s problem was in the basic concepts, it's just really lackluster execution. You don't need to turn the concept of Delphini inside out, you just need to actually explore the implications of her nature. Same for Cedric, same for the Trolley Witch, same for everbody. McConnell's synopsis, written in the same mindset by the same people as the original, would have, I think, turned out precisely as rubbish.

*** I agree. However, part of the issue of Cursed Child is that the basic concepts of Cursed Child spit on canon. Cursed Child has some fundamental issues.

** I think this is a great example of why critique is easier than creation. I remember watching his critique video and it was quite insightful, yet his suggestions for how to fix this are terrible.

** I mean, the plot's wildly different but there's no time travel, so here I go I guess...

  On his seventeenth birthday, Albus runs away. Years of arguing with his dad and struggling at school have worn him down, and he just wants to be free. With Delphi's mantra 'the future is mine to make' echoing in his head, he sets out to change his life, leaving everything and everyone behind.Years later, an accidental meeting with Scorpius forces him to question the new life he's built for himself. Is his life complete without his family? Was he wrong to leave Scorpius behind? Is he really any happier now than he would have been if he'd stayed? And does he truly know Delphi, the person who convinced him to walk away?

** I haven't seen that but I did have an idea for a different take on the CC as soon as I read the script, and started writing it within 24 hours of the script being released (while I was still sticking pins in a model of Jack Thorne). I didn't finish it until last year and it didn't get many reads. I don't think there's much of an appetite for CC fics unless they are Scorpius/Albus. Or maybe it's just mine.
