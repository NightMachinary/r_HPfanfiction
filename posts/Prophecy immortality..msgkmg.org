I've seen a few stories where if Harry dies Voldemort becomes immortal because only Harry can kill him.

Wouldn't that mean, then, that Harry also becomes immortal after he kills Voldemort?


** Potentially. I've also seen it were they're immortal against others as long as the prophecy is uncompleted. Leading to them making a non-interference pact.

** Yes. I've seen it happen where it meant Harry's immortal.

*** Usually happens in Master of Death stories, in a way. But I never seen one where what I suggested it's said outright.

**** Ah shame. Becoming immortal through the prophecy itself seems like a really intriguing premise. I wonder if Voldemort could "scrap" his horcruxes in such an event.

** Yes. This is actually my favourite alternative interpretation of the Prophecy, [[https://imgur.com/gallery/QsXxDWg][more fully explained here]],
