Any stories that dive more realistically into what happened to the stuff in the books

For instance: Harry tells someone that his scar hurts him when he's at Defence Against the Dark Art classes with Quirrell.

Harry tells someone that he can hear a voice coming from the walls in Chamber of Secrets. Or tells an adult about Dobby visiting him and warning him away from Hogwarts.

When Fred, George, and Ron brought Harry to their home in the car and told their mother about how there had been bars in Harry's room she reacted differently.

The Ministry or someone else realizing that the Defence Against the Dark Arts class seems to be cursed and tries to fix it.

Or other things that should have been handled differently, in a more realistic manner then they had been in the series.

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if there's a bunch of chapters it's fine I suppose.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.
