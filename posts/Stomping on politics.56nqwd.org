Basically looking for Harry getting into politics and stopping on everyone. Just... please, god, no 12 year old genius political master.

Over 150k+ words! I'm looking for some longer stories!


** This is a perplexing request because stories where Politically Involved Harry destroys the opposition are 1. Gary Stu stories 2. 11-12 year old super!indy!grey!animagus!lordEverything!billionaire!Harry.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
