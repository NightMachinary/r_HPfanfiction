I wrote a fanfic on the Marauders. This is a one shot and my first ever fanfic. I would be extremely grateful if you all could read and review it. Also, please suggest places where I can improve my writing.

It is about James Potter's first day at Hogwarts, mainly written in a narrative style.

** It's there. The writing, aside from a few noticeable grammatical issues here and there, was fine. The style was on the blander side, but the improves with time. I suppose the main issue I saw with it was the story. The story was essentially a minor change to canon on James' trip to Hogwarts. It was executed in an okay manner but the issue is that there doesn't seem to a reason for the change. There are no new implications or a new storyline. James meets Sirius and Lily argues with James on Snape's behalf. I think it's certainly understandable because it is your first fic but a good next attempt might be a story with bigger changes to canon.

*** Thank you so much!

One question though, is writing from prompts a good place to start?

**** Of course. The best prompts are going to be the ones with a lot of tangents because it lets you take it in your own direction.
