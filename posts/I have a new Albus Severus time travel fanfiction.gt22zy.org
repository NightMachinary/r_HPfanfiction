I'm writing a new fanfiction called "Albus Potter and the Journey Through Time" on fanfiction.net. It's a next-gen story focused on the two eldest Potter siblings (James Sirius and Albus Severus). After reading a bunch of next-gen fanfics which make every single next-gen kid (Teddy, Victoire, Hugo, Rose, Fred, Roxanne, etc.) meet the Order of the Phoenix, I got tired of reading the same thing over and over. With every fanfic I read, it felt like story was more or less the same.

The plot is essentially the same formula, I realized: James II and/or Fred II smash a Time-Turner, all the kids are alerted and check what's going on, they all somehow get sucked back to 1981, 1995, or 1996. The kids stay in Number 12 Grimmauld Place and share the information of the terrible deaths that occur in the SWW with the old generation, and they somehow find a way back to the present (and everyone starts hating Al for some reason because of his middle name). I realized that making all the next-gen kids travel back is a huge hassle and there's almost little to no character development in any of the kids (or the adults, for that matter).

This is why I've decided to deviate from this over-used plot formula and create my own. I'll give you the summary here (on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and [[https://ao3.com][ao3.com]]):

Happy reading, folks!


** I haven't read one of these fics in a while because of the exact reason and plot you described. I just read your fic and it's really well done. I left a more in-depth review on the actual fic. Great job and I hope you keep going!
