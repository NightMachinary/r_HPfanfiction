I really like Sirius, but I don't like how he died in canon quite as much.

I'm not going to read slash, but if it fits link it anyway.


** I did write one where he dies at the end followed by a sequel where he comes back several years later, They are both romances but maybe not what you are looking for?

** Linkffn(The Debt of Time)

This one is a Hermione centric time travel fic. Sirius does go through the veil, but he is brought back. It is a very good one. It's also on AO3 is you want to read the smuttier version. 154 chapters long and complete.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

  Sirius Black never expected to fall in love. That was James's thing. It wasn't that he wasn't interested in finding the right girl, he just didn't think she existed. The problem is that she does exist, just in the wrong time. Time Travel. M for language and eventual smut.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
