looking for a fiction where Harry isnt a friend with the weasleys nor Hermione , for pairings anything but Harry/Ginny Harry/Cho prefer completed stories but if frequently updated in-progress story dont mind , can be single Harry but no slash or Friend Draco


** This is actually pretty rare. Some time travels into other eras might qualify, but then that Harry was still friends with Hermione/Weasleys in his previous timeline. No friend Draco pretty much rules out most Slytherin!Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), seems to be the only one that fits well, but is still incomplete (although the chance of it finishing is good).

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
