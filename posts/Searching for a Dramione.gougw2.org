:END:
The title of this fanfic is eluding me but this is what I remember:

The five starts at the beginning of year 7. Snape helps Draco escape Voldemort's anger and finds him sanctuary hiding in Hogwarts. Hermione is head girl and is tasked with hiding Draco in her room. They fall in love but the war catches up to them and they get separated, with Draco going to a safe house run by Andromeda. Hermione goes to help Ron and Harry hunt horcruxes.


** Isolation. Bex-chan.

It's the top fic on FFN let me see if I can link it.
