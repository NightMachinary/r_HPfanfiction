In so many of the manipulative Dumbledore stories Dumbledore is supposed to be this master manipulator who convinced the entire Wizarding World (Except maybe Amelia Bones or Andromeda Tonks) that he is this paragon of light, and his schemes fall apart because Harry checked his bank statements. Are there any stories where Dumbledore is an actual threat? I'd prefer stories with no Weasley bashing but that is probably a tall order for this type of story.


** I remember one where Harry was dramatically confronting Dumbledore. Then Dumbledore said a trigger phrase and Harry's response was "I hear and obey". It was a one-shot.

** Phoenix Corrupted by iamneverwhere

This one seems to have a manipulative Dumbledore, it's really long and a big AU but I think you may enjoy it.

  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.

That said, I'm super eager to see the responses here. I don't think Ive read one where Manipulative Dumbledore is competent (looking at you, Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches).

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

** This would mean writing a Dumbledore that could spot Gellert Grindlewald for a wrong 'un like everyone else /including the faculty of a dark-arts aligned school/ was able to. Which means a somewhat different history of magic and a different view of Dumbledore taken by wizarding Britain, one where he's not driven by guilt at the felony murder of his little sister.
