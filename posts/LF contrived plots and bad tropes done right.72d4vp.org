** My fic, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) has both a political AU and Lords in it, although I based it off of actual British government/politics from the 16th-18th century rather than what sounded cool.

**** Hi! Glad you're reading it :)

So, volume one is looking like it's going to cap out around 22 chapters (about 50-55k words). Volume two has been outlined conservatively at about 27 chapters and if I had to put an estimate on word count, probably closer to 70-75k words. I'm planning on doing a seven part series in total, and if it follows my current outline/writing improvement schedule, each volume should be longer than the last.

I will absolutely be exploring more of the lore! For one, Trelawney has her own subplot (not going to give away any spoilers, but she's a recurring element). I've also created an entire Wizarding historical culture and religion based on actual history that varies between England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Ireland. That information is slowly being worked in because I don't want it to be too much of an info dump. But yeah, I have tons of world building information that I'm putting out in small doses as to not overwhelm anyone. Volume two will reveal a bit of historical information, which will tie in with mythology/lore, HP history, and actual history.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkffn(Digging for the Bones) is Severitus with abused!Harry executed perfectly. The premise is believable, the characters are realistic, and there is an overarching plot to the story. There are very emotional tearjerker chapters throughout the story. It doesn't delve into bashing or and pairings, both of which would detract from the story.

** Linkao3(Hermione Granger and the intended vessels). I am not sure if I should recommend this since it's a pairing and trope that not many people like on here and it does have some content that is somewhat questionable, but it's just done so well. It's a marriage law fic with Snape and Hermione with a kind of weird premise (the new law forces people to have babies, and some other stuff..). It has a fair amount of smut (at least in the beginning) and some seriously dubcon and dark moments.

At the same time though, I do love the writing and this fic. The plot is very well thought out (even if it seems completely ridiculous at first), with lots of twists and some things that seem completely stupid or confusing ending up with a perfectly logical explanation. There is lots of humour, great dialogue that perfectly captures the characters, lots of sarcasm, great action scenes and at times AU world building.

It also has a perfectly in character Snape and in character Hermione which unlike the majority of SSHG fics where Snape is some kind of sex god for some reason or even where he is perfectly normal in his private life, actually manages to portray his reactions to sex and relationships in a realistic way that's true to his character. This fic is certainly not for everyone, but it's really quite well done considering it's premise.

#+begin_quote
  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

** Just about anything by White Squirrel does the trick. linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) has Lord Potter and AccidentalMagic!Animagus, linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them) is about the ultimate Peggy Sue story and a Harry/Hermione to boot, and linkffn(Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue) deadpanly spoofs marriage contracts while also playing a straight "muggles take over" plot. Not to mention linkffn(A Dramatic Reading), the sole good "the characters read the books" story anyone seems to have ever written.

Also, linkffn(Core Threads) takes the "Harry is extremely OP" and "magical cores are a thing" tropes and makes it into one of my all-time favourites, through the carefule excision of anything resembling /angst/. It's phenomenally /light-hearted/ and just puts a smile on my face any time I read it. Not sure it fully stands up to the "well-written" criterion, as it can be a tad too cracky for some people at times.

** Have you tried laventadorn's other stories? Come once again and love me, for example is a pretty good Snape/Lily fic.

In recent times, linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste) is a "Snape mentors Harry" story with an in-character Snape.

** Well, there's "Sekrit Project" by Chilord, which is essentially one huge gathering of bad fic tropes and cliches that are actually done well, or at least done entertainingly enough that I didn't mind that they ARE bad fic tropes and cliches.

The plot involves a potions accident that turns all the Slytherin students into super-hot girls. No, really. It also features a chattier Marauder's Map that gives Harry more secret knowledge, which in turn makes Harry work harder and become more successful in school, it's got Ministry-bashing and early Sirius pardoning because Harry pointed out that the Ministry were a bunch of stupid-heads. Oh, and it gives Harry and Ron a friend in Slytherin (Tracey Davies) who just informs them that Slytherins are sooo not all evil.

It's the sort of fic I normally wouldn't even touch, but somehow it works. The characters are all well-written, with the curious exception of Hermione who's just this shrill harpy obsessed with rule-following and her own prejudices. But ... well, a fic that turns Ron into a Potions prodigy and acually manages to make it believable and in-character... it can't be all bad.

** Linkffn(the darkness within by kurinoone)

Harry was kidnapped by voldemort when he was young and raised to become Lord's assassin.

Avoided it like a plague for years, but once I've finally decided to give it a go, I basically left the reality and resurfaced only after I finished the 3rd part a week later. It is a bit clichéd at times, but the relationship complexity is amazing. And Harry is definitely very dark and edgy in there but still so stupidly Griffindor.
