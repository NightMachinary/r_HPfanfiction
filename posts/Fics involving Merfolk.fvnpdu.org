  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

*** Ah, that is a classic. I've not read it in ages and can't remember the merfolk at all, so I'll be rereading it again now you've pointed it out. Thanks for the rec!

** In linkffn(time to spare), somewhere in the middle of it, Harry goes to the magical university (Atlantis University, it's located under water)(where he is the only human) and makes friends with a mermaid (and a goblin and a centaur). Closer to the end he, knowing Mermish, asks help in defending Hogwarts from merfolk in Hogwart's lake.

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

  Harry messes up the animagus process and begins a new journey. New friends and old share his discovery of life. What is in store for The-Boy-Who-Lived? What dangers will he face? Find out inside! WARNINGS: Begins entirely in HP world, crossover starts later. Harry is bisexual. Rated M to be safe.

******* Heh. Well, you Huggleborns can think that way if you like. :)

In case you're interested, my tag actually came from a D&D twitch show called Critical Role that did a single episode of a Harry Potter Tabletop Roleplaying Game. For copyright issues, they couldn't have the actual houses, so they had Horfleporf, Smitherpin, Pigeonclaw, and Driffingor. It was quite fun, so I adopted it as my tag. :)

********* Heh. No, 'fraid not. It's a pretty fun episode, if you've got a some time free to check it out and the patience to watch people roleplay for two hours and forty minutes. :)

If you've seen a certain John Hughes High School movie, you'll probably enjoy their little homage to it as well.
