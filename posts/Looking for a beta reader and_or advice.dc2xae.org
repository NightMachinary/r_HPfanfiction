While thinking about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bevfuu/lf_harry_ginny_are_brother_and_sister/][my prompt about Harry and Ginny being siblings]], I got hit by a plot bunny, so I started to write it down. What I thought will be a brief one-shot, has know almost eight thousand words, and I am bit lost what to do with it. Given the length it would probably deserve some plot, but I don't want any. I certainly do not want to rewrite HBP and DH with just this one thing changed, and I don't have much idea where it could go. Therefore, I will probably end when the plot bunny leaves me, and then (and after plenty of rewrites and fixes), the story will be up for the adoption to the good hands (good hands means for me no slash, certainly no incest, no super!Harry, no indy!Harry, no bashing).

Does anybody have any ideas for the story, or do you want to be my beta-reader, please, and give me some good read over? Thank you very much for any reply.
