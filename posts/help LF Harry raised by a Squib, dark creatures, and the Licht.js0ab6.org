:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello, help! Can you help me find this fic for a friend of mine?

I've read a fanfiction before where toddler Harry's horcrux affects dark creatures positively--- the aura from the horcrux keeps werewolves from being rabid creatures, prevents vampires from burning under the sun kind of thing.

The story starts when a werewolf married to a squib Black (I think her name is Alice / Alicia, and her grandfather was Marius Black) moves over to Privet Drive, and Harry encounters the werewolf after it transforms.

Instead of eating or marking him, the werewolf snuggles with the toddler for the night. Wackiness ensues.

It's a fun little fanfiction with werewolves, vampires (feat. Judas the Damned (?)), Prudence Potter the hag, some dragons, and the Licht as they move to the area too!
