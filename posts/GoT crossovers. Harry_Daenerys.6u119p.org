Read some of the GoT crossovers on ft.net. Tried to search on AO3 but that's just a mess. So I'm asking for good GoT/HP crossovers on AO3.

Looking for stories with a Harry/Daenerys pairing if there is a pairing.

Thank you!


** There are no good Harry/Dany stories. I'm not just saying that out of edginess, I'm serious. It's something I've wanted to read as well. There's a few stories, but they're all multipairings, or just not good. I've tried to write it myself, but it's actually quite hard to get a proper story out of it. I've seriously got about 15 decent attempts at writing it.

Dani is hard to write. Basically, Harry Potter coming into her life with all his magic is the "Get 1 Westeros for free" card for her. Its just really hard to write it in a way that makes the conflict of the world still somewhat viable.

**** I feel like I've tried pretty much everything at this point, including a lot of the popular tropes, like Harry being the person to rescue Dany before she's married to Khal Drogo. I've also had Harry be a substitute for Khal Drogo, whereas Harry would lend his support to Viserys cause. I've had Harry be a lost hero from the Age of Heroes, I've had him be Azor Ahai, I've had him be an Other, I've had him be a wayward wizard, inventing things in Myr and looking for an apprentice, I've had him be the ruler of his own new city, I've had him be a shadowbinder from Asshai, I've had him be the cause of the Doom of Valyria, I've had him be a member of the Thirteen of Qarth, who just happens to know dragonlore when Dany strolls in...

None of them worked, and some of the ideas are trully atrocious. My most recent attempt is kind of a mix of a few of them, such as Harry being an Alchemist in Qarth. I can get that to work, but still, the problem is having a story with actual conflict that just isn't immediately solved with Harry involvement. But, if you hamstring Harry enough (like by taking his wand away or something like that) for the sake of plot, then he doesn't really feel like Harry, and more like an OC, and at that point, why bother?

There is one crossover I really like. Its "The Difference One Man Can Make". In it, the only reason Harry isn't just roflstomping Westeros is that he doesn't want to. That is literally the only reason. I like it because it deals well with the world, but the problem always remains that he's just way too powerful with a wand.

****** Could you make something work where Dany and her dragons/Army gets slapped down by Harry defending whatever city he makes his home. The idea of great power comes great responsibility etc. Harry's from a time of democracy, he might find the idea absolute monarchy silly. (Now I have images of Harry taking the place of one of the peasants in Monty Python's Holy Grail.) Harry doesn't want to get involved in the war, he's a one man army who would rather make a nice home for himself.

You'd have Harry's modern day sense of morality vs a young woman willing to unleash dragons on a city yet she's trying to do the right thing with regards to slaves etc. A man who holds the potential to rule as a god or a king and yet chooses to live a simple life. He might be the answer to all her problems and yet he doesn't want to be involved. Would he join, not to fight for her but to prevent loss of life? To save the common person and make the 'kings' fight without the lives of their people? A reluctant guide and moderating influence all while not believing in the cause but seeing no way to stop her trying to seize her birthright with blood and fire.

******* Now I feel kinda stupid. Thats an approach I never took. I never even questioned the status quo of Westeros.

But you're totally right. Harry would be absolutely shocked by the circumstances of Essos and Westeros, as well as by the morals and thinking patterns of potential rulers.

I may need to write another sketch...

******** I can't see him not being one of the most intriguing people in the world to her. He holds the potential for power that she's always sought and his reasons for shunning it would disagree with what she's heard her whole life. That's before anyone argues between the Others vs Fiendfyre. I don't know where Harry would settle, have you read linkao3(7551730). I think it was Anarchy who linked it the other day. While obviously not completely compatible I could see a story being similar to this. The whole magical defender aspect.

Obviously internal conflict and morality are much harder to write about than smashing obvious bad guys, especially without them descending into angst fests but who would compromise? Over what? How long would it take and how would the other characters react? Obviously Danny isn't going to give up her dream of conquest because some stranger powerful or otherwise said she's being silly but she'd want to know more. How would you motivate Harry? You threaten those around him. How would he work with someone willing to do such a thing? You've also got the whole religion things going on. Harry hates prophecy and people think Gods are real. Where does Harry's power come from, where do people think it comes from? Is he there for a purpose? That's before you get into the whole Dragons + Fiendfyre vs Others stuff that other fics get hung up on.

***** I'm currently dabbling in a crossover where Harry is basically stranded in Westeros/Essos, a world where magic for all intents and purposes is on the brink of extinction. The main driving force of the story is for Harry to find a way to bring magic back in the world with his extremely limited magical capabilities (And the birth of three dragons do not suddenly bring magic back into the world, like it does in the books). You need to curb or divert Harry's magic in some way, as he's pretty much unstoppable with his full capabilities.

***** My first thought was that Harry should talk Dany out of the whole fire and blood thing but they would never be safe because the mere existence of the Mad King's daughter is a continuous threat for the Iron Throne, no matter who sits on it. And due to Dany's appearance simply posing as Lord and Lady of Bumfuck somewhere in a small castle in the Reach would not work either.

About the lack of conflict. Unless you go with Dark Lord Harry who razes everything with fiendfyre and uses the imperius on everyone there are quite a few things that could stop him. Magic is not that effective against assassins in the night, poison or a crossbow ambush if you have no time to react. He cannot apparate to places he had not visited before. He would be overwhelmed by a cavalry charge or the good old human wave tactics.

If I would have to go with a plot it would be:

Harry mysteriously arrives in Pentos (maybe during the DoM battle so he is not so much older than Dany) and has a vision of Dany's less than pleasant first night. He basically sees a girl getting raped and wants to stop that from happening. Magic makes survival easy (just make yourself invisible and steal some food) so he walks around and tries to figure out what is going on and where in Merlin's name he ended up. After a couple days he sees Dany and follows her home. When everyone is asleep he breaks in (again quite easy with a sleeping charm and some magical lockpicking) and warns Dany, who does not really believe him. Harry stays in Pentos and keeps a low profile while reading up on the history (or uses magic to make someone talk and forget about the whole thing afterwards).

When Dany is told that she has to marry a Dothraki she realises that Harry is right and contacts him. They run away disguised as merchants and head to Westeros to get away from the whole Dothraki scheme. After finding a temporary home in the Stormlands they think about the next steps. Magic is powefull but since Harry is not a cold blooded murderer he cannot take out armies or capture cities. Ned hears a rumour about the return of a Targaryen and decides to look into the matter. He is not in KL when Jamie goes there to attack him and Robert dies without Ned nearby.

Ned arrives in the Stormland hideout and takes some time to track down Harry and Dany. Once there they talk and Ned is conflicted since he has another Targaryen hidden away himself. News of Robert's death reach the hideout and Ned refuses to swear loyalty to Joffrey so they make their way north back to Winterfell to get a better picture of the situation and talk with the Northern Lords. Ned stays out of the war of the (now) four kings or commits a token effort to Stannis and simply holds the Neck. He takes Harry and Dany to the wall to find Jon where he finds out that the Nights Watch marched north.

I could come up with more if you are interested. And if it is a little messy, I wrote this at 1am and can provide an updated version.

***** I'm not entirely sure whether this is decent advice, but maybe transport harry into the GOT universe somewhere in 3rd/4th year? He'd still be overpowered but it'd be less pronounced than if he had apparition and all the stuff learned later on. It'd also make the age gap between them not as huge.

****** I think it's more about mindset, than age. A 14 year old Harry's prime motivation would probably be trying to find a way back home, rather than worrying about who sits on what throne of a Kingdom he's never heard of and has no interest in. It would be a pretty tough job to try and sell the idea that Dany is his way home, unless she's literally the first person Harry comes across.

Not to mention, if Harry is 13-14, Harry would actually be younger than Dany, if you go by the show (which you should. She starts at 13 in the books, but that's really creepy to write about, and not my kind of thing.)

The first idea that comes to my mind is to play off the whole "low magic" thing, where magic all but died out when the last dragons were killed. Perhaps that gives motivation to Harry to want to see the dragons grow and flourish. Then again, that same idea could act as the reason why adult!Harry isn't super OP.

******* A fourteen-year-old Harry has no real home. I personally would go with after the DoM so that Harry does not particularly care about returning since Sirius just died but fourteen works as well. He has no way of returning, there is no Hogwarts library in Essos so he accepts that fate. And Dany's age is no issue. Simply avoid anything more than a teenage romance (although the age of consent is 14 in quite a few western countries so if they need to fuck it would not be too amoral. A contraceptive charm takes care of any surprises nine months later. Again, they could stick to French kissing and petting for some time since "Hey, I just got here, let's bang that chick" is not a good story.

*** They're two incompatible worlds, Magic in GOT is more nuanced and less pronounced aside from Dragons. And Harry Potter Magic is both at the same time. I guess you could take Harry's wand and only allow him to use Wandless Feats of Magic, and then, in turn, he can't cast wanded spells. So we have a Harry with Telekinesis, Elemental Creation/Control, and some Transfiguration/Illusionist Abilities.

**** Does he really need a physical way to limit what he's capable of? As I said earlier, I'm not a fan of the loss of his wand being the limiting factor. Plus, I'm not a huge fan of wandless magic either, at least of the kind we typically see in fanfiction. However, I am a fan of Animagus!Harry. If there was any story where a dragon animagus would be cool, it would be this. I know there's a story where Harry is literally born as one of Dany's three dragons, but that's not what I'm thinking. Regardless, I still probably wouldn't go with a dragon (or a wolf) as his form, but it does bring up some interesting ideas.

The Shadow of Angmar - linkffn(11115934) - does it pretty well, with a similar situation in magical disparities between HP and Middle Earth Universes as there is between HP and ASOIAF.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
