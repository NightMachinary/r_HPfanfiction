** There's a story that's similar enough for me to recommend it, though I apologize for not being able to remember the name.

Sometime after the epilogue, Auror Harry Potter gets a package in the mail that, when opened, causes him to go insane (or die/headaches/get angry/breaks up his marriage?). Hermione does some time travel shenanigans that helps solve the situation in a, well, unconventional way.

It's HP/GW and HG/RW to start but ends as HP/HG.

*** that sounds familiar. Does it have something to do with a deatheater and a trial where he does a spell or something and they remember all of the obliviations?

**** Not if I'm right about the fic in question being TitF. Though the one you're referencing might be interesting to read as well.

  The war is won, but at a terrible price. Seventy-six years later, Hermione decides to go back and make things right, once and for all. Time-travel fic. Eventual Harry/Hermione, some mature content. AU, but still closely follows the general story and universe.

** Linkffn(Pride of Time) has this. Hermione travels back in time to the Marauder's Era. I won't spoil the plot but it's a Severus/Hermione with non-romantic relationships with other Golden Trio Era characters. I really enjoyed it!

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...
