I'm looking for a fanfiction that is,

1. Set in the fourth year, or with a great fourth year, specifically the triwizard tournament

2. Harry/whoever the main character is has some sort of out of context powers, where everyone just goes wtf how does he do that and everyone is impressed/suspicious.

3. Alternative challenges would be great, 3 lame events months apart from each other and 2 of them having no way for the audience to observe seems unrealistic and stupid. This is supposed to be a multi national tournament that is a huge attraction and something people will talk about for a long time.

4. Preferably harry will see it as an opportunity to show off rather than an angst fest. Bonus points for obviously impossible stuff and playing it off as accidental magic or something.


** Off the top of my head the two fics that come to mind are The Lie I've Lived by jbern and Temporal Beacon. TLIL is an all time classic as far as I'm concerned and has much more interesting tasks. Temporal Beacon is a time loop fic that goes through the tournament a few times. I really enjoyed the early chapters of TB but personally I think it went a but off the rails eventually.

*** I never heard of temporal beacon so I have read since you have posted this. I have to to disagree I really had trouble getting through the first part of the fic, it was really hard to get over the stupid/badly done Ron bashing. The interesting stuff happened when stuff get going in the latter stuff. a lot Peggy sue stories have trouble understanding cause & effect and randomness.

Author plays with the idea of time travel. Harry and Hermione essentially construct a “save-load”\checkpoint mechanism which resets them to the end of the third year in case if they get killed.

*** Is Temporal Beacon good? I read the first 10 or so chapters WAY back when and never went back to it because I didn't think it was worth it, but I recognize the name.

**** I personally really liked it.

I've just looked what the first 10 or so pages are, and---yeah... the first chapter is generic intro material while the 2nd starts with silly “humorous” situation about accidental innuendos and such. But IIRC it gets back on the rails and generally keeps good pacing all the way afterwards right after that bad mini-scene (in my version it starts with “there's one more thing I want to ask of you”).

/(some spoilers follow)/

Depending on your preferences, you may also not like that the story has some Ron bashing and doesn't include him in the adventures, and that Dumbledore's version in the story is of a manipulative flavour.

The key concept itself is that they make a time machine in the chamber of secrets based on Hermione's research project (she decides to not waste her opportunity with the time turner under her temporal possession), and by activating it they get a chance of returning to that point in timeline from anywhere in the future---provided that they “die” in the appropriate manner (so far, certain rune tablets should be activated or certain rune sets should be carved on their bodies).

**** It's an excellent story, but has not been updated in a while. Last count it was 70 chapters and sitting since sept2013, but worth the read.

**** Hi. I'm sorry for the confusion---it /was/ intended to reference the trope article, not a story with that name. I.e. in /the Temporal Beacon/ tournament tasks get changed on each iteration because each time they are “reloading” the world, something they change manages to influence how the tournament is going to turn out in the span of the ~4 months (their checkpoint is at the end of June).

** fairly short fic, not a lot of action but an interesting challenge, in case you wanted to read something completely different.

Hermione's mum has "the talk" with her before she leaves for school

** [[https://fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters][Letters by TheEndless7]] is a good triwizard fic, though it focuses less on the tasks than I imagine you're looking for. It has a quidditch tournament though, which is really well written.

** Try [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9225260/1/][revealing ink]] At first glance it would seem gary stu (and it still gives off that vibe IMO) but the task and clues are vastly different

I remember a fic about potter being sort of unhinged and had an expanded triwizard. I think the title was Hp and the power of the mind (or the sorting hat's gift).
