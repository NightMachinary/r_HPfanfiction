This was the biggest point of contention back in my childhood, and only now it popped in my mind that fanfiction might have the anwser...


** Gandalf would deserve the win, but he wouldn't get it. I just don't see a way for him to beat Rowling's hard magic system.

*** Gandalf's a walking deus ex machina and, were he in the "real world" of Harry Potter, would best be described as a literal angel. Tolkien's magic "system" is metaphorical and mythical and driven entirely by the needs of the story. If the story needed Gandalf to win, he'd just use the music of the ainur or some shit to unmake Dumbledore.

HP magic is just as bullshitty, but there's still some underlying mechanics (wandwork, potions, runic artifacts, etc.) that would constrain Dumbledore.

*** It really is rather restrictive as a system of magic, isn't it?

I've not really thought about it very much before. I suppose that's a good thing about fanfics- you can butcher the shit out of the canon magic system and make what you want. Or expand on it and make it better.

** I think Dumbledore and Gandalf would be much more likely to just sit down and have a long chat about various things.

Neither of them strike me as very likely to want a fight -- Gandalf is more temperamental, more snappish and quicker to anger, but he's in no way quick to violence. He generally prefers to try and talk sense into people before a fight even becomes an issue. Dumbledore, likewise, is never the first to draw his wand; he only fights in defence of himself and others and usually not with lethal force. He's unfailingly polite and friendly, much more so than the pedantic and occasionally surly Gandalf, and he never seems to take offence at anything.

Even if there was a minor misunderstanding between the two, Dumbledore would defuse the situation by apologising profoundly and ask Gandalf if he would care to join him for a cup of hot chocolate or maybe some particularly fine honey mead that he recently purchased. And Gandalf, not being unreasonable by nature, would agree to solve things peacefully.

Now, what the two could accomplish TOGETHER, that would be something to write a fanfic about!

** I recall a fic that may have had the title "With a little help from my friends" where Dumbledore gets the help of Gandalf and Optimus Prime in resolving the events of Half Blood Prince. With a premise like that, you can see that this fic is crack. It was also written right after HBP came out so no Deathly Hallows events were ever mentioned.
