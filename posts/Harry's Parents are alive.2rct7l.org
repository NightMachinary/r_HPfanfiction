Title says it all. I'm looking for a fanfic in which Harry's parents didn't die. Preferably 100k+.

Just updated after a long hiatus, and it's very good.

*** Good story. I'm sure someone could pick it apart for reasons it's bad, but it's enjoyable to read, and interesting. Very interesting. Need.... more... updates....

** I liked [[http://fanfiction.net/s/9604296/1/An-Alternate-Chain-of-Events][An Alternate Chain of Events]]. Its sequel (technically part 4, with parts 1-3 being in the first story) is still updating as of a couple of weeks ago.
