I think it had Neville or and OC as the Boy Who Lived. There was a tower in London that Voldemort wanted control of. After a bit the action moves away from Hogwarts and Harry is leading a group in guerrilla warfare against Voldemort. I think that Harry takes over a train at one point.

Sorry that I can't remember much else. Thanks.


** Could be linkffn(4985330). There's a dark tower, and Neville is the BWL.

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.
