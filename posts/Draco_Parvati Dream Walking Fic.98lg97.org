Been trying to find this Draco/Parvati fic for years. In like the first chapter they're all on the train going back to school and Parvati, Padma and one other girls were talking about the guys they thought were cute or whatever and how much they've grown up since the last time they saw them. They get to talking about Draco, meanwhile, he's eavesdropping on them from out in the hallway. In later chapters Parvati starts having these really sexual dreams about Draco and when she wakes up she's got hickeys all over her neck and doesn't know how they got there and everything. Eventually she goes to Hermione and asks her if its possible for someone to invade someone else's dreams and she says yes, but the person would have to be really strong magically. She tells her how to make a counter-spell to block the person from invading your dreams. Parvati has to go down to the slytherin dungeons and get a lock of Draco's hair. Along the way Blaise almost catches her but she hides behind a statue and Peeves distracts him and he walks away. Parvati thanks Peeves and he says its payment for when her father helped him with something when he went to Hogwarts something like that. When she gets to Draco's room she tries to get a lock of his hair but Blaise walks in and she runs out and he thinks she's  some random girl, but she accidentally leaves her cloak behind and he finds out.

If anyone knows of this fic, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you! ðŸ˜Š
