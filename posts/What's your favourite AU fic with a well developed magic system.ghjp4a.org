** Definitely the sacrifices arc. I never got around to finishing it but it had some really interesting concepts and ideas about magic and the such. linkffn(Saving Connor) is the first one (and arguably the best in the series). There are, of course, many deal other fics which have great theory behind them but I cannot recall the name of since a) i didn't write them down and b) I lean more towards character development than theory/world building in general.

However I liked linkffn(Prince of Slytherin) s culture thing, with the elemental Asian thing and the parseltongue thing, though its been a while since I've read it and I didn't finish it.

*** The amount of patience necessary to read Sacrifices Arc, especially with Harry's character oscillating between the same two points all the time...

It's good, but it gets tedious.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkffn(13438181)

This one merges a high fantasy magic system AND cosmology pretty well with HP.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, Real Magic, & The TWT in a way you have never seen.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8494264/chapters/27188238]]) has really in-depth world building with its magic system. However, you almost can't call the world a Harry Potter world anymore and there are lots of OCs. That being said, I liked it a lot.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.
