*** I've always just assumed that the other schools are somehow even worse. Something like the students Durmstrang lose 10% of their student body to frostbite every year since they have a shifty death eater in charge of the students' wellbeing and Beaubatons not only has Maxine choosing teachers based on who looks the most dangerous (think hagrd but with people) but is in France as well.

** Linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School by Kwan L) seems to fit the bill. The story is modeled off Ender's Game, so if you've read that you know what to expect.

It is fairly bleak however. The school maybe be successful at churning out competent witches and wizards, but it doesn't have any of the whimsy of the canon Hogwarts.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow][Harry Crow]] involves Harry fixing up Hogwarts (firing Binns, getting Snape to clean up his act, etc.)

The story is far from perfect (it's more of a cheesy clich√© feel-good story), but it does involve a fixed Hogwarts, which is one of the main reasons I read it.

** History is easy to fix. Just exorcize Binns and hire someone competent, ask other ghosts to become guest teachers.

Snape needs some serious pressure from Dumbledore, and he must drop the requirements of only accepting O for NEWTS students.

Defense needs a workaround when the curse is still active. Try renaming the class or adding a new class.

Divination only serves the purpose of protecting Trelawney. Might as well send her off to Australia or hide her behind a Fidelius.

It's probably not practical before the war is over, but Muggle Studies and Astronomy should eventually be combined and changed into Science and Social Studies. Charity Burbage was a good person and a poor victim, but she basically knew nothing about the Muggle world.

Then a whole new standards need to be introduced to address safety, bullying, and etc. Unfortunately, bullying remains a serious problem, as Albus Severus and Scorpius later experienced. The Minister's daughter pretty much leads the bullying.

*** a) I... Don't think that's how Ghosts work on the magic world. They're here to stay. Of course you can still easily get rid of him.

b) I guess he did, since lot's of people were able to enter DADA on the 6th year. Favouritism is still a problem tho.

c) I'm pretty sure that if there was a workaround to be found that was as easy as that, it would have been done.

d) Yeah, that whole class is pointless. You clearly can't teach it, it's an inate talent. Is it just to discover seers?

e) THis I don't understand. A class involving both Muggle studies and Astronomy? Why wold you have two things so diferent in your curriculum? Who would know of both with enough ability to teach it? And where does it say that Burbage was a bad teacher? Hermione certainly never complained.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** Linkffn(A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool) sort of addresses the issue about Hogwarts needing to improve curriculum and how they deal with bullying and such. It's actually a big plot point that Hogwarts has to improve to keep Harry as a student. It's also a good fic regarding a Sirius-adopts-Harry plot, but there is an overpowered Harry trope and a bit of a pureblood formal world trope.

**** And maybe that's what makes it great. Maybe magic isn't geography, and if you just tell students how to do something they'll never be a great wizard. Maybe Hogwarts' educational strategy isn't to cater to the lowest common denominator but rather to create an environment in which the creative and talented have the freedom to flourish.

For all Hogwarts' apparent lack of teaching excellence, it still seems to put out graduates of equal or greater quality than the international norm. This might indicate that teaching quality has little relation to the quality of magical education.
