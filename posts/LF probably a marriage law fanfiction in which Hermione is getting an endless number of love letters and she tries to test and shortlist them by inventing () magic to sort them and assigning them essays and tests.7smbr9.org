See title - that's basically everything I can remember. I feel like it was a famous one but I'm unable to find it now. Can anyone help?

EDIT: I think it was a humorous/crack fic rather than a serious one.

EDIT: found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12335024/1/Eminently-Sensible]]

** Are you sure it's a crackfic or a oneshot? I think you might be remembering Reign of the Serpent, chapters 19 and 20. linkffn(9783012)

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
