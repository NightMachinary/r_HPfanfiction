Authors seem to write horcruxes in one of two ways from what I've seen.

1. Horcruxes make the maker an insane, psychotic, and unstable bastard. (This is usually how Voldemort is portrayed)

2. Horcruxes, other than being painful to make and re-absorb, DO NOT provide any ill effects, such as insanity. (This is how Voldemort is portrayed in The Son of Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter and the Descent Into/Breeding Darkness. This is also how an "improved" horcrux spell works in a fic I am currently reading)

In one fic I read (Rebirth by Athay, IIRC), Herakles Jude/Harry made himself "immortal" in his first life by doing some tweaking of his "soul tether". But that also had its own drawbacks.

Has anybody ever written alternatives to the methods above?


** Pre-HBP fics will often have an alternative explanation for Voldemort's "immortality" (if they don't handwave it). I also remember linkffn(To Fight the Coming Darkness) having it be an effect of contract with Dementors. Warning, the fic is bad, though it reads well enough.

**** One of the first long fics I read. I don't recall the dementor contract thing from when I read it, though. Did the author elaborate on how it works?

****** I've read the whole thing. It had some good elements (like Voldemort's and Pettigrew's characterisation and humorous bit), and I like reading the super.Harry trianwrecks.

**** Both, there are cliches aplenty, but there also deep flaw in the storytelling, starting from instapowerup and going through instaromance (with author promising that there won't be instaromance).

** I like to write it as similar, but not entirely the same, to your first point). The creation of Horcruxes don't cause insanity, per se, but make you lose something that makes you /human/. The need to sleep, the ability to feel hunger or thirst, the ability to age, the ability to empathize etc.
