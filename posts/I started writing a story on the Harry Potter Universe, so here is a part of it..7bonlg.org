Hello, as the title implies, I'm thinking of writing a story in the HP Universe.

I don't plan on touching the characters from the books, I just like the ambiance and universe so much, that I will write something that touches some of the same aspects while also telling a completely original story with my own characters and maybe (maybe) some references to the original characters, totally unrelated to the events in the seven books.

Truth be told, even though I have read the books several times, I don't consider myself a big scholar of Harry Potter Lore and tend to forget many things, so expect my story to have some glaring problems from time to time, but be sure that I am totally open to criticism and will try to fix as many problems as possible along the way.

Be also aware that, even though I have been learning English for almost 17 years now and have been studying it as my university degree for 5, English is not my first language and will, from time to time, waver and fail at my attempts of describing things. If you think there is a better way to describe or say something that I said in the story, please feel free to tell me and I will try to improve.

As of now, I have only a small part of the first chapter ready, but I wanted it to work as a preview of what there is to come.

So, without further ado, here it is, a preview for

*"Magika: A story of Witchcraft and Wizardry"*

Beneath our world, lies a different world. Hidden from us by a curtain of smoke and mirrors a magical society has grown and developed alongside our own throughout the years, similar in places and completely different in others.

/In this world, 26 years ago, a young boy, known all over the magical world for surviving the death curse and causing the disappearance of the most powerful and dangerous dark wizard of all time, entered Hogwarts, the biggest and most important school of wizardry and witchcraft in the United Kingdom, in order to learn how to be a wizard./

/Seven years later, that same boy ended the life of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, Lord Voldemort, in the battle that came to be known as the Battle of Hogwarts, thus ending the Second Wizarding War./

/Many stories are told about that boy, but our story is not one of them. Our story takes us to a small city in the eastern coast of England known by housing the building that would inspire the creation of the most iconic vampire in Human history or Muggle history for those readers of a more arcane decent, Whitby./

Gregor Abbott sat in his bed contemplating with wide eyes and disordered hair what was left of his room. The myriad of books that used to fill the shelves on his wall now lay in the ground, some open, some slightly burnt and other torn apart.

One of his wardrobe's doors hung from its hinge and all of his clothes were scattered across the room. The previously locked bedroom door had been forced open, as if an incredibly strong wind had come into the room and had found its way out by busting it open.

His window was no more.

“Wow...” He said as he tried to comb his blond back down to a more normal hairdo. “That was quite something.”

He looked at a book that lied open next to his feet, took it in order to check that it was in good condition and put it next to him in the bed.

From his pocket, he took a small notebook with a plain black cover and a mechanical pencil. He went through the pages, glanced at his annotations while mumbling things to himself. Someone else that would look over his shoulder and into the book would have seen only doodles and an almost unreadable handwriting, but for him, that small notebook was almost a friend, and with a glance he was able to read what was written in the pages.

Not like he needed to, as he was the one that had written them and knew them by heart.

He went to a blank page and put the pencil against the paper, then stopped, rose it and bit his lip, as if he was thinking about something very important.

He put the notebook away, opened the big book that he had picked up from the floor moments before and rushed through the pages until he found what he was looking for, a page that showed a large symbol, reminiscent of a rune, with text below it written in a seemingly false or invented language.

He left the book open on his lap, took back the small notebook and went back to the blank page. This time the pen didn't stop when it touched the paper and carefully drew the symbol from the book into the small notebook.

He wrote something more beneath the symbol in English and then looked around room.

“Yes, I think that name will fit you... ‘Force'...”

He then looked down into the notebook once more, and started writing a detailed explanation of what had transpired minutes before.


** What you have seems interesting so far. What's the timing of the story? Does it occur during the second war? After? You might also want to describe the room that Gregor is in. Presumably due to the presence of a bed and wardrobe it's a bedroom. Is it small? Big? Dingy? Bright? Is this in a standalone house? A flat? Are there neighbors that he should worry about? What time of day is it? What is Gregor wearing in bed? Obviously something that has pockets, but what? Is he huddled in an old, moth-eaten bathrobe or wearing a Versace suit? See if you can add more description to draw the reader in, but don't do it in a laundry-list way. You did well with letting us know he has blond hair by describing his action of running his hands through it. What does he pull the book out of the pocket of?

Your writing is very good for a second language learner, but there are definitely some awkward phrases and odd word usages. I would advise seeing if you can hook up with a native English-speaking beta.
