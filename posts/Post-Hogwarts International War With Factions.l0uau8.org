I remember the story was centred around Hermione who had become a diplomat. There were 2 major factions is the war with marked out land and annexing - these were ruled by Severus Snape in the British Isles and Bellatrix Black in Russia (?). Hermione was the voice of reason for Snape but ultimately switches forces to join Bellatrix ranks. It ends as a Bellamione.

If I recall, it used brilliant terminology of actual war tactics.

Hermione also discovered after finding her parents that she had a very young sister - I believe she ended up moving them to a Nordic country in Bellatrix's jurisdiction to keep them safe.

Thanks!
