I love Slytherin!Harry fics but just recently I came upon one in which Harry gets sorted into Slytherin. Background-info: He time-travels and meets Voldemort, tries to keep him from being evil (it's a tomarry fic) and the whole time he is super whiny and does not act like a Slytherin at all. I was so fed up with it, I stopped reading. If he was sorted into another House that fit his character I wouldn't have cared that much. Generally there are so many fics in which Harry is a Slytherin but there is nothing that would indicate that his character fits it. I just want to read some badass Slytherin!Harry.


** Are you kidding? That fits /PERFECTLY/; Draco was a whiney little shit the entire time he was in Slytherin too!

On this note, seriously, fanfic authors, stop trying to make characters act like one dimensional caricatures just because they got into a certain house! Pettigrew was a cowardly shit and he was in Gryffindor, Crabbe and Goyle were mentally...lagging...and they were in Slytherin! Luna was in Ravenclaw, and she was a spaced out conspiracy theorist, not at all some logical cool headed bookworm!

/THAT/ is your problem. You want to make every single human being into some one note embodiment of "House traits," which in canon was never a thing! You guys just are totally missing the point. Reality doesn't work that way. People don't work that way. CANON didn't work that way. JK Rowling at least could make actual human beings for characters. But you guys? You just suck at writing real people, I guess, since you want to reduce everyone down to their House traits all the time...

Bottom line is: There is no "acting like a slytherin," or "acting like a gryffindor." There's just people being people. The House traits aren't even requirements! And they don't just become /ALL THAT YOU ARE/ when you get sorted (though, that'd be a pretty awesome dystopian fic, your whole personality automatically getting altered on sorting). Jesus.

*** I would love to see a fic where every Ravenclaw acts and speaks like a surfer dude/valley girl

**** For some reason I feel like that is a Hufflepuff thing XD Because they're all so laid back, and such.

*** No thats not what I meant. I perfectly understand what you are saying and I really love to see the different facettes of a person in a fic.

But in this fic there was not an ounce that would've justified putting Harry in Slytherin in first place! People are sorted by character traits they already have but in this fic it would've made way more sense to put Harry into Hufflepuff because of his loyalty. Draco at least was ambitous and Pettigrew had enough courage to sneak out to meet a werewolf every full moon even though it probably took some convincing. Luna is a intelligent creative person which are both traits of Ravenclaw. There was at least a reason behind them being in their Houses. It was just that throughout this whole fic, Harry was only fixated on Voldemort in everything he did. There was no character behind that whatsoever. He was loyal that could have been the only thing you could say about him. But there was not a single thing there that could've justified putting him in Slytherin. My critique is that if you are writing a character don't just put him into Slytherin because you want him to be. Think about why he should be put there.

*** This is literally just because j.k wants to paint one house as saints, and others as unholy. She's biased. It's literally for plot. Can't have an evil Hufflepuff, now can we?

*** The only reason Crabbe and Goyle are in Slytherin is because Rowling wanted a house that everyone in was evil.

** I'd argue the opposite of this. Most fics force the characters into the extremely binary personality stereotypes characteristic of the house they end up in. The problem with most "Harry in Slytherin" fics is that they have a harry who fits the role of a "perfect Slytherin" so well that it feels forced. I'm not sure exactly what fic you are talking about here, so you may have found the exception to the rule, but that has generally been my experience.

*** Yeah. This is true. But I've often seen the opposite end of the spectrum too, when there is no reason for Harry to be put in Slytherin in the first place. Alltogether it's probably the middle-ground we all want.
