Yes please see the title! I want like fics where Harry lives on his own and ignores the war and stuff, except he still loves his friends and has fun and is happy and nice to people and he's just relaxing and being good!!! :)

Fics I have read that are like this is "The Greatest Gift" by Abbyngton, and also "Realizations" by Wishweaver.

  Harry comes home after finishing his fifth year, the happenings at the department of mysteries and Sirius death heavy on his mind. He finds the Dursley household in chaos and learns that sometimes great gifts come in small packages. As usual no slash!

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.
