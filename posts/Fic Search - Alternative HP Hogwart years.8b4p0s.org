I was into fan fics before the order of the phoenix was released. I remember that back there I was reading a fanfic that was suposed to then continue the story being it self an alternative 5th year in Hogwarts. I don't remember much else because my english competence was very poor back there. So I was thinking that there should have been a lot of thoses back there: alternative Hogarts years written before JK released the official ones.

Is there a best-of list of those? Idealy with out short or pairing ones, I'm not interested in those, and classified by Hogawrt year/book it would replace. It would also be good if focused on the ones written befere the release of the JK official version. In my head it makes more sense as the writer could go crazyer with his/her imagination.
