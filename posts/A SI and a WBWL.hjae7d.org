I was reading a WBWL fic earlier. The story was at the point Harry meets his brother for the first time, obviously all pissed about the ten years his Father had him under Dursley's care, as is tradition in these fics, and I had this idea pop into my head.

So, the Potters gave birth to twins. After Voldemort's raid, Harry's brother is wrongly deemed the boy who lived.

The remaining parents (one or both should have survived the raid) decide to ship off Harry to the Dursleys.

In our world, a HP enthusiast dies in an accident, and finds himself reincarnated as Harry's brother.

After 10 years, Harry finally learns his parents are still alive, which makes him furious.

Their first meeting, Harry expects this brother to be an entitled brat, his unearned fame having gone to his head.

His brother, obviously, is nothing like he expects.


** That could certainly be interesting - particularly if the SI had no idea they were in... a fanfic, as it were. James and Lily? Not that unusual names. Uncle Sirius? Maybe out of the picture because screw you James for abandoning my godson. Magical World? Parents keep SI out of it because of the hero-worship and they don't want it to spoil his character; the most they do is say "when you go to magical boarding school". Magic? Yeah okay neat, but on its own, not necessarily the indicator that "hey, they think I'm Harry Potter, but what is this, my name is Alphonse, where's the real Harry??"

And I mean hey, they're a child, with a child brain, particularly if it's without the whole "I was fully cognizant from the womb and wow being breastfed is traumatising but not as much as birth", more a slow "wait why do I know random things and have random memories, what odd dreams... ohhhh waiiit... could it be...? no don't be absurd" dawning realisation that they're /maybe/ reincarnated. They have enough to deal with to focus on small hints that aren't in your face (particularly since it's a quite far-fetched thought, to be reborn as Harry Potter, but your parents are alive, and your name isn't even Harry).

Enter Harry Potter. As in, the real Harry Potter. And suddenly... oh shit. Reincarnation is the least of my problems.

...I'm very into it and I'd definitely read it if someone wants to get on writing this lol

*** Nice way to go at it. Upon learning about Harry and all the Voldemort stuff, Alphonse immediately realises he's likely not the Boy Who Lived despite how adamant everybody else is.

The Potters would have to go Muggle for it to work, though, cause I can't see a HP fan watching new Daddy draw his wands and perform a spell and not immediately go /'wait a minute...'/

Another fun idea would be Voldemort doesn't know which of the twins he hit with his curse, and just assumed Brother is the bwl.As a result, SI becomes Harry's unwilling meat shield.

Not only that, but Harry, obviously sorted into Slytherin and wanting to spite his family, starts getting cosy with the wrong sort (maybe Malfoy and his crew).

Chaos ensues.

***** See I'd probably not be a good candidate for that SI's position, I'm too tired for drama lol. If James & Lily, my parents, are good people, they'd 1. have to have a very good reason to have given up Harry, and 2. feel very very guilty about it nevertheless.

Ohhh, maybe the horcrux in Harry's scar played a role? Since the one in the locket did have the ability to affect people around it, and without Lily's sacrifice to act as a shield, maybe it's all Harry's magic can do to keep it separate from Harry himself. It can't prevent it from affecting others around them, not when Harry is still an infant. (Maybe as his magic grows stronger, it starts being able to.)

So James & Lily notice that they feel unreasonable resentment towards Harry, that being around him influences them somehow, they take him to healers and everything but nobody knows why, and then paranoid Dumbledore makes an appearance and is all "what if Voldemort isn't really dead... what if he's in Harry..." and they don't believe him but can't discount the possibility completely either. They can't bring themselves to permit harm beign done to Harry, but as time goes by the situation turns increasingly dire until they agree to send Harry away. To a place without magic, for reasons.

...anyways what I was getting at, I'd probably get my parents to take Harry back, because obviously Harry isn't evil I mean look at him. Also he's my brother.

I'm not really into the resentful revenge shtick, which probably makes me the wrong candidate for this trope, I think...

**** Well I mean obviously Alphonse would know about magic, but I was thinking, parents having magic that they use wands for doesn't automatically lead to the obvious conclusion "they think I'm Harry Potter". It could just be a random universe that has magic. Particularly since James & Lily probably do the simple spells we know of non-verbally, and a lot of other spells we don't know of at all because they're household spells and were never mentioned in the books.

You're right, it would have to be done delicately; it only works if James and Lily are super over-protective and careful. Maybe half because Alphonse as the BWL would be a target, so has to be hidden & protected, and half because having gone to school with the Malfoy & Co of their time, they're very wary of spoiling him and turning him into an arrogant twat. (Or an anxious mess, knowing he's a target.) So they shield him from the general public in the magical world.

It'd be very interesting, the dynamic between Harry & Alphonse! Harry would probably be wary and resentful, and I don't know if he'd have the wherewithal not to blame Alphonse for their parents' actions (having grown up with Dudley, who is very much his parents' son and can easily be lumped in with them, particularly from a child's POV).

Also what if Alphonse gets sorted to Hufflepuff. Because loyalty is important to him. And the rift the drama would cause between him and their parents... and knowing how Harry is treated at the Dursleys', Alphonse would probably throw a fit at even a hint of a suggestion that Harry should go back to them. I mean if I were a child, I'd definitely make the best of the opportunity to throw temper tantrums while it's still a somewhat acceptable thing to do lmao.

****** Possibly - but I mean, look at it from the standpoint of someone who doesn't have HP on their mind first thing in the morning. They're a child and slowly starting to realise they're reincarnated. I mean this would be happening before he's eleven; he's probably busy realising that he's reincarnated, processing the fact that his old world & life are gone, that his family & friends are effectively dead to him and think him dead, that he has new parents now. All of which is probably difficult to accept. Add in the part where magic is apparently a thing now, there's a lot he has to process in the first ten years of his life. And /possibly/ he'd pause a little at Lily & James Potter, but well, they probably aren't going by Potter in the muggle world for security reasons, so while he technically knows their last name, it's not like it comes up often. Making it easy to forget, for an under-11-yo. In addition, he thinks of them as mum & dad, not Lily & James.

Yeah, even if he never were to go to Hogwarts, if he makes it to 15 and still doesn't get suspicious, that would be a bit slow of him. But a child? With a lot going on already? And a child brain? I don't think it's unreasonable at all. Even if the thought did occur to him, vaguely, he'd probably brush it off easily, seeing as there's no Sirius Black, and his name isn't Harry Potter, and it's quite the far-fetched thought to begin with really. From the outside looking in, it'd be more obvious, but living it, with all the aforementioned caveats... I don't think it's unlikely at all he wouldn't realise until something really obvious happened.

***** Harry was a quiet child. A bit lonely, a bit weird. But who wouldn't be in his shoes?

His only friend was for the longest time only a neighborhood dog that no one claimed was theirs, that he named Mr Cuddles and totally adored Cuz it bringed him untouched (not counting dog slobber on the box) burgers suspiciously often.

Except he sometimes met this bizarre boy who looked a bit like his own reflection in a puddle after the rain. The boy, named Leopold, appeared in the weirdest moments, always in rush, always hiding or running. Sometimes they hided together. They played games and Leo stayed till a weird loud crack took him away.

Harry was a bit sad but not overly worried. Mr Cuddles slinked from the shadows and he just knew Leo will also appear again in a week or two. He always did.

** I could see Lily and James both surviving along with Harry and his twin. Then Lily and James ends up fighting over how everyone is treating Harry and his Twin differently. Fighting enough that they end up splitting up. With how rare divorce is in the wizarding world, I can see them having a law that if there are 2 kids, that the oldest kid goes to the parent with the strongest magical family, and until the kids turn a certain age the relatives from the other side of the family can have nothing to do with them. So the Twin ends up with James and Harry ends up with Lily. Then some time later Lily is killed/dies and Harry ends up with the Dursley's because neither James or any of his relatives can have anything to do with him until he's 11 or 13 or 17 or whatever age the law says. And Sirius being James's 2nd cousin(?) is close enough that he counts as Harry's relative on his father's side. Maybe James and the other marauders don't even know about Lily's death until Harry reaches that age because of how the divorce laws work.

** I say do away with all the WBWL stuff and abandoning one child at the Dursley's. Neither are believable anyway. To my knowledge people don't call Harry The Boy Who Lived in universe and it's a mouthful of a title anyway, and there is no universe in which Lily and James would just leave their child on some doorstep while also being the same people who would sacrifice themselves for their child, squib baby or no. (Also unbelievable because you can't tell if someone is a squib when they're a baby.)

So now you just have a pair of twins, their parents just died and they've been shipped off to live with relatives. As they grow older one of the twins starts noticing odd things, memories keep surfacing in dreams of a life lived outside of England, of having friends and family he's never met. And these Dursleys, why do they seem so much more familiar than they should? He doesn't know why his aunt petunia seems to hate him and his brother but sometimes he feels like he should, like it's just on the tip of his tongue.

And it just keeps unfolding until he's forced to accept the reality of his situation. At which point you can start true canon divergence and wreck all his canon knowledge. The moment he does something new, everything changes, slowly at first but more noticeably down the line.

I'm not so sure about that.

Obviously, in such a story, it's gonna be an Evil!Dumbledore, therefore we have two extremely powerful wizards with decades of experience (three if Grindelwald is included) plus an unknown amount of others who could be there despite not being mentioned in the books but could very well come into the game if SI makes enough waves.

We don't really know how the prophecy works (in canon it was self fulfilling, but this is a fanfic), and anyway, SI isn't protected by it since /he's not the boy who lived./

SI has never used magic before and has no knowledge of it. His talent is unkwown, as is his intelligence. Even if he's the greatest genius since Merlin, I very much doubt it's enough to surpass the real players before the deadline. Decades or centuries of training and experience aren't easily overcome.

This is a WBWL story. Harry is driven, ruthless, extremely perceptive and talented, he will more than likely be an occlumens/legillimens before starting Hogwarts if he's not a natural. And he's pissed at SI on principle. I don't know about you, but I think I wouldn't enjoyed getting reincarnated into Jim Potter in Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches.

This one might be more frivolous, but SI's the wrong Potter. The one James choose to keep. The one Snape hates the guts of. SI's not gonna like potions.

It's very possible to make a story where SI is really gonna be in danger, outweighted and outsmarted by just about anyone who's someone around him and is gonna have to fight more than hard to have a chance to prevail (or even remain a minimum healthy).
