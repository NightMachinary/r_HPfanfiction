Been a while since I've read a fic.

One thing I dislike about a lot of political fics is that they generally portray factions as just "good" and "bad", which usually results in a pretty one dimensional storyline. Any good recs that explore politics/factions in a more in depth manner?


** You mean politics are many, varied, ever-changing and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.

** I'm not sure if these are exactly what you're looking for, but I think Percy centric fics usually does a pretty decent job in Percy's involvement with the Ministry.

The best one in my opinion was the sequel to Proving Them Wrong, New Age, which is about the aftermath of the War. There was conflicts on how they wanted to take action to rebuild though. So I think this is the better fic that is catered to your criteria. * [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5715586/1/Proving-Them-Wrong][Proving Them Wrong]] by GriffinSky linkffn(5715586) Status: Complete

The Scarlet Pimpernel has a more humorous tone to the story, but Percy is more politically incline in the fic. However, there is more of the ‘dark' versus ‘light' thing. It involves Umbridge, so it's understandable. I'll recommend it anyways. * [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3784000/1/The-Scarlet-Pimpernel][The Scarlet Pimpernel]] by AMarguerite linkffn(3784000) Status: Complete

Finally, Order of Mercy is less political, but Percy's contribution to the political side of things were still prominent in the story. * [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12181042/1/Order-of-Mercy][Order of Mercy]] by MandyinKC. linkffn(12181042) Status: Complete
