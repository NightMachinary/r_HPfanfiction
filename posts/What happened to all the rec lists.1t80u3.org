I'm coming back into fanfiction after a good 6 year hiatus. Started reading in 2003-ish, stopped around 2007/2008 after I started getting bored with the content.

Anyway, there used to be metric shit tons of rec lists available online for fics. Livejournal was really good for this, as was DLP and several other sites. Nowadays, it's like I can't find a rec list to save my life that's been updated in the last 3 years.

Did they up and disappear with the rest of the fandom, or have they just changed locations and I'm completely out of the loop?


** fanfiction.net has "communities" that are basically themed rec-lists.

*** I can't stand using AO3. Finding a particular ship is such a pain, with the asinine tagging system they use.

I've been using fanfiction.net with DLPs search script, but honestly it's still pretty bad. The best I can do is narrow searches down by word amount (generally 150k+) which gets rid of the worst of the worst, but length isn't a surefire way to quality unfortunately.

It's a pain in the ass finding those 20k+ word fics that were either works in progress, or oneshots. Rec lists used to make it so much easier.

** The [[http://www.ladyimmortal.org/beyondtheveil/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=7][updated fics]] thread of Beyond The Veil reports on story updates. The same forum has recommendations lists, though they are only infrequently updated.

Also, C2s on fanfiction.net and authors' favorites lists are good for recommendations. I tend to look at the favorites lists and C2s of authors whom I like to find other stories. The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/][DLP C2]] regularly adds new stories. It's by far the most popular C2 on fanfiction.net.

** DLP is still there, I also recommend fanficauthors.net if you haven't read that stuff yet.

** Some threads for completed fics.

Communities are a good place to find newer fics and also putting up requirements here and asking for recommendations is a good idea. I actually have over 108 follows and I am sure that there is something I am following that will fit your fancy. (Unless you only read slash)

** [[http://www.favoritestracker.org/publicLists.php][Favorites Tracker]] has a lot of good lists in my opinion. But there are obviously a lot of lists on their, so doing a Ctrl-F search for the category you are looking for is useful. Also if you have a fic you like, you can click on it on there and see all the lists it is also in, helping you find lists you may like.

Otherwise I find it useful to look a the favorites of an author you particularly like on FF.net
