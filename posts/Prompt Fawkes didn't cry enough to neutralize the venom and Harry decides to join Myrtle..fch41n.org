It would be interesting to read about Ron Weasley managing the rest of his Hogwarts years and the Second Vold War without Harry. In canon, they were best friends.


** If you want to make a crack fic out of this, expand on it by creating a hilarious series of misinterpretations and misunderstandings to ensure that Harry's name still come out of the Goblet of Fire in 4th year, resulting in either Voldemort getting got early or somehow resurrecting Harry for World War Wizards 2: electric boogaloo.

*** "Wormtail, you are useless! Can't even get me some blood!"

"But master, he's not ali-"

"Crucio! Silence! Do not backtalk! If potter isn't alive, then we have to make him so! A little alteration to the ritual and we can make him a body good enough to give blood for my own! Now get me the essence of dittany, and place it in the brew when I tell you to!"

** The problem with this prompt is that Harry would never become a ghost. Ginny is safe, so is Ron and everyone else. the Book is dead and so is the Snake.

His biggest and deepest desire is to be with his family.

He would never even consider it.

*** It could be set up that he's forced to come back because of the prophecy and then he either somehow fulfills it as a ghost or is brought back to life. I think it would make for a great crack fic

**** But isn't the prophecy complete? He died at the hand of Voldemort. Yes, Voldemort was a spectre, and yes, his "hand" was actually a gigantic snake under his control, but prophecies like that kind of convoluted garbage.

He died at the hand of the other, and now said other can live while he doesn't.

** I think Hermione would be the one to take the ear up not Ron. I like book Ron just fine but I don't think he has the motivation to do it. It least not until everything starts going bad.
