Any recently updated/published/completed Sherclock!Harry/Moriarty!Harry stories, where Harry is either Sherlock/Moriarty, or greatly resembles/takes after Sherlock/Moriarty.

I would prefer if he has at least, finished first year, or 40k+, or if you think it's too good to apply to my preferances.

Thanks,

Warryn.

Updated half a year ago, not sure if that qualifies as recent.
