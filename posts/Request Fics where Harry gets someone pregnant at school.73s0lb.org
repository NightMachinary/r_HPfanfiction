Basically, what the title says. I am looking for fics that have Harry getting someone pregnant. As long as it is not a male, I do not care who is impregnanted, how it happens, whether the school is Hogwarts or not, what their ages are, what they do about it, relationships post birth, etc. If it is nice and light and happy fine, but as far as I am concerned, nothing is too dark or depraved for me to read.

I rather liked Harry/Maeve/Amaris in the denarian renegade triology and ai reccomend that to anyone who has not read it.
