:END:
This is going to be both a vague and specific request. I'm in the mood for Dark/Gray Harry and Sirius where they learn different magics or Sirius teaching Harry family, dark, or traditional magic. I would also like Harry to be smart (not super smart) but wanting to learn, not just magic, but how to defend himself, maybe politics. I love stories where Harry joins (or teams up with Diary Tom) Voldemort or at least befriends some dark wizards, Draco, Blaise, Theo. Are their any where Sirius accepts being Lord? and uses that in their fight against Voldemort (if they don't join him) or Dumbledore?

As for the more specific request. Do you guys know any stories where Sirius stands up to Molly or Dumbledore? making sick of them treating him like a child or telling him and other's what to do in his house? I'd love one where he kicks everyone (but Remus haha) out. Or one where he goes after Mundungus for stealing shit out of the house?

Pairings Gen or slash please. Not a fan of most Harry/female character sorry.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.
