I.e. An AU where Hermione grew up in the roughest parts of London. And her parents aren't actually dentists.


** I mean, punching someone in the face with brass knuckles is sort of like dentistry... :D

I do love the idea of Hermione Kray, though.

They /do/ still remove teeth. Most of their... customers aren't exactly willing, but they're used to that.

  Sirius Black and Harry Potter went into seclusion in November of 1981. Albus Dumbledore had lost his chosen one. But the wizarding world still needed a hero, when Voldemort rose again. In fact it needed three. FW/HG/GW

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle
