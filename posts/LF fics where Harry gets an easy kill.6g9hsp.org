Looking for fics where Harry gets an easy kill against Voldemort. Bonus points if its an accident. These can be serious fics where the adults are competent and take out the horcruxes themselves or Harry finds some ancient ritual that takes them all out at once or crack fics where harry gets hand jobs from Hermione as part of a ritual to find the horcruxes (admit it, you've read that fic). Additional bonus points if Voldemort feels pain every time Harry has sex. For some reason I find those fics hilarious.


** Easy kill. Check. Accidental. Check.

Absolutely not serious at all. Check. Check. Check.

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

  A Harmony story. Hermione is a Veela and discovers this shortly before their fourth year. What will Hermione's new powers do to alter Harry's fourth year? Warning- there's Ron-bashing ahead. If you dislike Ron-bashing, don't read.

  Oneshot from Ron's POV. Ron tries to explain to the twins just how Harry made the Ministry of Magic make a new classification for magical creatures, and why the puffskeins were now considered the scariest magical creature of all time. No pairings.

** I remember reading fic where Voldemort was stoned all the time and came up with plan to turn Harry into girl... eventually he got killed by accident (somethin like !girl Harry kneeing him in the balls and he dying from the pain, was hillarious) but I stopped reading the moment it turned out that it will be Draco/male Harry... Don't remember the name tho, it's been a while.

*** Sure when "Literally walk knowingly into your own death" is your definition of "easy kill". And "break into Gringotts and eacape on a dragon". Than there is also this pesky basilisk and some fiendfyre.

These all are parts of killing Big V, but sure - easy kill.

**** More or less - Harry only succeeds because Dumbledore set him up to succeed (that wandlore thing with the Elder Wand, having that horcrux in his scar etc.)...Harry himself does not grow (that's such a missed opportunity IMHO!), he has no "heroes journey"! It's sheer dumb luck, crazy coincidences and the sacrifice of good people that enable Harry to win!

ps: Note: Those "good people" are also lazy and stupid, too because they don't really fight Voldemort - they more or less wait for Harry to save the day :(

That's a far cry from the boy who sought to kill Sirius Black out of vengence, and who tried to use Unforgivables on Bellatrix.
