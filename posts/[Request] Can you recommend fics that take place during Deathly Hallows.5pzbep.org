Hey there, I would be interested in either Deathly Hallows AUs, whiich would ideally diverge after Half-blood prince or canon-compliant fics that take place during Deathly Hallows and focus on characters other than the trio, seeing different things that were happening during this period of wizarding war.

I was recently reading a couple of Percy Weasley centric fics which were suggesting that he was helping to save muggleborns as an insider during the ministry which really got me interested in this idea. Any recs would be much appreciated. Preferably longer stories if you have any. Thanks!

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

**** I only just found this thread and I am not one of the downvoters - I hesitate to say even this as it makes me look petty and jealous given my own story, but...

It's just not a good fic. It was marketed heavily and for a bit was the only one of its type, but it doesn't stay true to canon, is poorly written with ludicrous plot lines, has serious problems with the portrayal of women and ethnic minorities, involves gratuitous sexual violence unnecessarily, and is written by a psychopathic cult leader who is legitimately entangled in a possible murder case. People downvote it because it is not something that should be recommended, on many levels.

As it happens, I won't downvote it because I think people are being honest when they say they enjoyed it. I just wish it wasn't recommended so often.
