Hey,

I discovered fanfictons about a month ago and a lot of them have manipulative Dumbledore and the little old wanker is getting on my nerves.

Any fics where Harry shits on him, preferably 200k words.

** Not really my jam, but Linkffn(dodging prison and stealing witches) is a pretty solid fic and Harry gets a pretty big one over on Dumbles at the end of year one.

Also, because it sounds like you're in a pretty dark place where dumbeldore is concerned, maybe you'd like to read linkffn(dumbledore's next great adventure), where a "Good dumbledor" replaces an evil Dumbledore and works to fix his doppleganger's mistakes.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

** linkffn (Lord of Time by Debtheslytherinsnapefan) completely ruins his life. First, they get him imprisoned then defeat Gellert thus taking away any glory he might have had. The whole world finds out about Ariana.

It's slash, I just skipped the slashy scenes and went on to the story.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path)

Harry is a Rune savant and invents rune stones for literally anything. He gains friends and powerful allies in the ministry and tattoos them with his runes. Dumbledore sees disturbing parallels to Tom and decides to prevent the rise of a third dark lord. For the greater good.

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
