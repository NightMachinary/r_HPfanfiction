I've read all the best ones, like Amortentia or Blue Steel, though the latter one is not really Harry/Romilda.

Just that Amortentia was an awesome fic, so I wondered if there are any other deleted fics or floating fics out there with that pairing. And no, Whatever Happened to Bromance does not count. :D

While that may not count, one of his [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407725/1/A-Question-of-When][other fics]] definitely does. Sure, it's a oneshot, but it's kinda creepy and well done so give it a go.

*** Yeah, I vaguely remember them. They were fun but very very short. Thanks for the reminder.
