So, I can't remember if it's canon, or just widely accepted fanon, but I seem to remember Voldemort kind of walked over Lily and James the night they died.

But what if he didn't?

Imagine the Aurors and Dumbledore arriving in the morning, only to discover that there's a three foot deep trench that starts at the front door and then goes twenty meters down the street.

A huge chunk of the floor is missing, because James transfigured it into a gigantic animated statue as a distraction.

The staircase that goes upstairs? It's been replaced by what can best be described as "a sloped wall of spikes", some of which have bits of blood on them.

The entire top floor of the building is just /gone/, because Lily blew it up trying to kill Voldemort.

And so on. Basically: What if Voldemort had to fight for every /inch/ in that house?

***** Then since he is Pettigrew instead of literally anyone with a drop of competence baby Harry is promptly dumped into both his parents' sweet stash that they keep hidden from each other as to pretend to be keeping to their agreed diet, fast-forward to Voldemort's arrival and baby Harry completely trashes him in the Taz style through sugar-rush induced and extremely chaotic accidental magic ultimately culminating in Voldemort accidentally hitting himself with an AK while targeting Harry on some kind of space failure caused by Harry's attempt at space-expansion. His parents arrive soon after when Harry is soundly sleeping away the sugar-rush and compliment an utterly exhausted wormtail for managing to get Harry to sleep so peacefully and (to his horror) remark that he is going to be their to-go nanny from there on.

Wormtail decides to cut his losses and goes with his cannon approach of faking his death to become the Weasley's pet rat the second James and Lily imply having him babysit Harry again.

Since there is no telltale of Voldemort getting to the Potter's house and just some half-crazed shouting even hinting that he was planning on it later on everyone is extremely confused about his disappearance and the fading of the dark mark. Some death eaters decide that he died and some start in-fighting for leadership while others quietly retire; others think he is testing them, but since they don't know what to do to pass said test they end up acting randomly ranging from some trying to carry-on as if nothing changed, some stoping moving altogether, some going muggle and even some invading Azkaban and giving themselves a cell there.

Eventually Voldemort manages to resurrect himself and is dividing his time between continuing his conquest, trying to hid all information about his first defeat and prevent Harry from getting his hands on anything even slightly sugary (without letting anyone know since he is still trying to hid his humiliating defeat at the hands of a baby)... Dumbledore is quite baffled by all this.

I mean... Pettigrew was a spy in the order of the phoenix without anybody suspecting, played Sirius, escaped Sirius and Remus and kids, set out to find Voldemort and succeeded within months, and was skilled enough to do Voldemort's resurrection ritual thing.

******* Maybe, he is still portrayed mostly as being the less skilled and weakest wizard of his generation, I think I once saw him and bashed!Ron fighting for the title of *The Most Worthless Being EVER* capitals included.

But being serious for a sec, true enough, while we don't have an exact measurement of how easy or hard all of it could be we can at the very least safely put him above Quirrel and Bellatrix in the competency department (equaling Quirrel to Snape based on their confrontations) just based on him being able to set the resurrection ritual up and finding Voldemort. Though most of his spying can be attributed to him already having an in with the order previously and not doing anything too attention grabbing that could blow up his cover, same with him being able to incriminate Sirius plus the fact that Sirius wasn't in the best kind of mindset at the time, the whole escaping give him some points since he managed to steal a wand (don't remember whose) even after being captured but he doesn't get full grade since he only managed it because Remus' transformation distracted everyone. So canonically he would be skill wise somewhere between post-Azkaban Sirius and Moody.

That could explain why the only wand we see break is Ron's in a car crash and Harry's getting blasted by Hermione's spell.

And I mean if Moodys not paranoid about it, it should be fine.

But they aren't. We can tell because they do break in reasonable circumstances. Movie Harry breaks the most powerful wand in existence by snapping it in his hands. Harry's wand wasn't hit by the explosion, it was just nearby when it went off (and it didn't even hurt Harry, so it wasn't a large or destructive one).

Again, it wasn't hit by the curse. Furthermore, that's just taking their weight and air resistance into account. By that same token, a stick would break in circumstances a wand wouldn't, like sitting on it.

James was trusting to a fault, so he probably wasn't expecting an enemy to be there, but even if it was an ally, the noise should have suggested they might need help, and therefore he should still take his wand.

Every hogwarts graduate that had gone to school with the potters laughed when they heard the theory about Harry Potter defeating the dark Lord instead of his parents, And then they would always bring up what happened with rose mcnally and the Fletcher incident from their 5th year and the crowd would get quiet and nod quietly in agreement. By the time Harry Potter thought to hogwarts the theory of his parents victories over the dark Lord was firmly cemented in Magical Britain. Harry Potter was still the boy who lived but he was more famous for his parents Vicious defense and brutal dueling skills rather than the whispers that the toddler had somehow managed to defeat a fully grown wizard. Every sensible adult magic user firmly placed the defeat of Lord voldemort in the hands of Lily Potter. With her husband James coming in at a close second. Harry Potter was still famous but he got more questions about his parents dueling tactics rather than the scar on his forehead.

It made defense against the dark arts kind of awkward in his 1st year when the captain of the Gryffindor dueling team Went ballistic when she found out he didn't know even the basic dueling stances. In addition to quittich practice harry found himself being frog matched down to the great hall three times a week by Helen Chambers and the other dueling club participants being drilled on dueling protocols and stances until they were instinctive. Chambers was terrifying, Enough so that even Oliver wood didn't object when Harry was late to practice because of the dueling instruction he was receiving.

When asked by many of the other students Harry had just shrugged and said Helen had taken personal offense to the mere suggestion that Harry was ignorant of his mother's great achievement.

The 7th year had made it her personal mission to make sure Harry Potter understood The incredible nature of his parents dueling skills.

Harry just way along with it because Helen was scary and she got the house elves in the kitchens to withhold the treacle tarts From the dinner dessert dishes if he skipped practice... Those bloody things were addictive... So harry shouldered both dueling and quidditch Just for the small benefit of a magnificent desert and Hermione and Ron when along with him..... Neville started tagging alone towards the end of 1st year after Crabbe and goyle managed To stupify him... You could never have too good of a casting speed for a shield charm if Harry's and Helens terrifying opinion

** Voldemort entered the courtyard of Godric's Hollow, his wand in hand, and his serpentine eyes blazing with a barely restrained fury. As quick as lighting Voldemort shot out, his body blurring as spells rapidly fired at the house. A translucent blue dome appeared for a brief moment before shattering like glass; its essence falling apart at Voldemort brief touch.

James and Lily were quickly alerted that their Wards have fallen, a grim frown making its way onto their faces. They shared a brief look at each other momentarily, their eyes connecting with a knowing look. James ran down the stairs into the living room, Voldemort was there, waiting for him; the monster's scaly skin glinted in the dim light.

They faced each other on opposite ends, one was fighting for himself, and the other his family. The tension was palatable, enveloping them both with a strange sense of anxiety.

Voldemort tilted his head and a sickly green spell shot out from above his head. James rolled out of the way and transfigured the carpet below them into a titanic lion. The beast barely slowed Voldemort down, with barely a flick of his wand, the lion was dismantled and Voldemort attacked. The air around him cackled and sparked as Voldemort bent world to his will. Pure unadulterated magic stabbed at James, a hasty transformation of his own robes saved him from a quick death. James retaliated with a quick snap of his fingers and the front of the house blew away with shrapnel going everywhere.

Voldemort conjured a muted grey shield around him; the dust congested the air and Voldemort cleared it with a lackadaisical wave of his hand. Just as he did James jabbed his wand at the ground and a burst of flames rushed towards Voldemort.

"I grow tired of these games!" Voldemort spat out. He raised his wand and a burst of air spiraled through the fire and stabbed viscously into James. James torso was just a pile of disfigured meat.

With a sneer on his face Voldemort brushed off his robes and walked past the sack of flesh. He continued past the living room and up the stairs, his pace slow and methodical. He knew that the remaining parent was helpless to stop him.

The door to the child's room was in front of him, the prophecy stated that the disgusting thing would be the downfall of him. He would prove that no child, man, or beast could ever stop Lord Voldemort. A casual reducto to the door nearly blew his head off, his spell bounced right back at him. The damn thing was warded.

Voldemort's fists clenched and a snarl overcame his features. With a jagged motion of his hand he reached out and grasped the entire room. The whole building shook as Voldemort attempted to crush the room and the remaining parent within.

Lily grasped her wand with a death grip, her face stony and grim. At Lily's command the door of the room flew open and she blasted an Avada Kedavra at the monster in front of her. The thing smiled as he let it hit him and, to Lily's shock, it did nothing.

"I have delved deeper into the dark arts than anyone ever before me." Voldemort stated calmly.

"Good." Lily replied before an enchanted circle lit up below Voldemort.

"A trap!" Voldemort shot spell after spell at the circle below him in a desperate attempt to escape. All the while Lily got paler and paler.

"What have you done you foolish girl, you'll kill us all!" Voldemort's voice was guttural.

"I am just doing what is needed to be done."

"Ill kill you! Ill get out of here and torture you into insanity! Ill make you wish that you were dead!"

As the circle glowed brighter below Voldemort more obscenities were screamed in agony. Voldemort's body, mainly composed of magic was being stripped, layer by layer of each of his rituals that gave him his strength. With each layer gone Voldemort became disfigured, his face distorted and his body seemed to melt into the ground.

All the while in the background little Harry Potter watched his wide eyes. Voldemort spotted him behind Lily and in an act of desperation shot a Avada Kedavra at the small child. Voldemort's arm liquified with the spell but it was still sent out. Lily reacted too late, too drained by the spell she was barely powering, and little Harry Potter got his trademark scar as it bounced off his forehead and slammed into his mother; overloading the spell she was powering with her soul and causing a tectonic explosion which destroyed the remainder of the house. The only survivor being Harry Potter, still in his crib with protection wards dying quickly.

** It was a normal evening for Lily and James Potter. Lily had just put Harry, her son, to bed, and she was hoping to finally unwind after a long day of hard work with the Order. James was reading the Daily Prophet, and had just finished reading the obituaries. "Monty died, Lily." James said with a sunken face, "that's awful!" Lily replied with a gasp, "When is the service?" she asked as she hauled a blanket over her shoulders. "Doesn't say." James answered. "We should send a nice arrangement," Lily proposed, "With a nice card alongside it." she suggested. James smiled and rose from his armchair, placing the paper beside him onto a very worn oak wood coffee table.

From upstairs, Harry began to stir into a soft whimper, Lily seeing this as her call, retreated to the nursery while James rummaged through the kitchen for a late night snack. As Lily approached the nursery door, an uneasy feeling shot at her stomach. She pushed open Harry's door and waltzed into his nursery with a dance a kin to a flower waving in the breeze. Harry was uncomfortably shifting around in his pajamas as a heavy aroma smoked his crib. "Oh, what a heavy load!" Lily gagged, lifting a now cooing Harry onto a changing table. "I don't even want to touch that." she groaned, whipping out her wand. Lily waved her wand around a few times, a gentle light shooting from it every other flick of her wrist. A repulsively stained diaper flung itself into a trashcan beside the changing table, loudly shutting the trash can lid with an echoing slam.

The slam, however, kept echoing. It stretched into the downstairs living room, and crept up the stairs before fading into the nursery door. Lily paused as she slipped Harry back into his crib. "What was-" but before she could finish her sentence, a loud boom fell through the house, an ominous cackle clawing at her ears. Another boom drew Lily from the nursery and into the upstairs hallway. A stag was lying on the last few steps below Lily, it twitched and shook before getting back up. It charged into a hooded figure standing somewhere off to the side of the staircase. the cackle began to grow louder and the stag stabbed into the figure's stomach antlers first. with a flash of light from the receiving end, the stag, now James, launched back into the wall. "Get Harry, Lily!" he ordered, drawing his wand. "But-" Lily gasped, "No, just get Harry and leave!" James screamed, blood running down his forehead.

Lily ran upstairs, the fighting continued as sounds clashed below her feet. She grabbed Harry, who was now crying, and rushed to her and James' room, locking the door behind her. She rummaged through her closet before holding up a starry cloak that illuminated a purple velvet. Lily wrapped Harry in the cloak and placed him under her bed. "James!" she shouted, "I'm coming, James!" Lily rushed downstairs, James now standing, and drew her wand. "Expelliarmus!" James screamed. A flash of light shot from his wand and hit the hooded figure. Light kept flashing as Lily shook. "Curcio!" the figure snarled. black light zapped James in the chest, causing him to crumple to the ground and scream. Lily pointed her wand towards the figure and shouted. the figure was sent flying into the ground, taking a large chuck of it up alongside the fireplace. Lily stepped closer to the figure and flung her wand upwards, a deep cut formed on the figures cloak, leaving a stained gash on his neck. the figure grabbed Lily by the neck, "Avada-" it he began, but James rushed in front of them. "Kadavra!" the figure finished, and heat washed over Lily's face.

** My head canon is that they didn't fight back because it was part of the ritual to activate the protection on Harry. The Potters 'thrice defied him' either in battle by escaping him alive or they disrupted his plans and because of that they knew they had little chance to defeat Voldemort and his minions while protecting Harry so they decided that if the last defense, the fidelius, failed they'd do the ritual. Which also included Lily asking 3 times to spare Harry/kill her instead, you know a magically powerful number. Cause otherwise it's just a bit disappointing that such 'incredible wizards' didn't even have a wand on them during a time of war when everyone was said to be jumpy and terrified. And yea, love is a wonderful thing but Lily cannot be the only one who protected her child/died in defense of someone. I'd believe that loving him enough to be willing to sacrifice themselves was a requirement for the ritual. It could have been ancient/blood magic, considered illegal by ministry, which is why no one really knows about it but we know Lily was the 'smartest witch of her generation' so she could have rediscovered it or created it herself. (It was the magical rebound, Voldie's body being destroyed and his escape as wraith that caused the destruction that Harry found when he went there in book 7)

But yea, an intense magical battle would have been bad ass and I wonder how it would have affected Harry pov in regards to that night and his parents. Could have spurned him on to be better in school, terrified him even more or a combination of both.

** Everyone who had even a passing acquaintance with someone even tangentially related to a student of Hogwarts 72-80 knew the name Lily Potter nee Evans.

The muggleborn terror, rumored to have been brought in as an unspeakable during her third year. Her morals were best described as what amused her the most at the moment.

That she was a natural born Animus Mortuus. A wizarding term for an extremely rare magical gift, of sorts. One that was exclusive to redheads, though even then maybe one was born once a century at best.

They were notable by having an absolute command of their innate magical gifts. Along with a complete lack of understanding of human morals or values due to having an unbound soul. In modern muggle terminology she would be classified as a highly intelligent psychopath with extreme magical potential. They were also singlehandedly responsibly for the soulless ginger stereotype.

There were laws in place concerning Animus Mortuus. Laws which protected them as every single one known to wizarding kind had advanced some facet of magic by several orders.

The last known Animus Mortuus was Sandra O'Dowd, who was responsible for the creation of a majority of current magical vaccines and medical knowledge. Which it is believed she learned through extensive illegal human experimentation of her enemies. However the sheer weight of benefits severely outweighs the negativity of the means used.

Lily Evans was a clear savant in charms, potions, and, it was quietly rumored, rituals.

James Potter was an outstanding battlemage who had trained battle transfiguration under Albus Dumbledore himself.

The entire block of houses where the Potters lived in Goodrich Hollow was still a deadly war zone of floating curses, transfigured horrors, and more for over a week after that deadly night.

It took over a month for the Unspeakables and DMLE to release a finding of the probable events.

Voldemort approached the Potters residence and began casting some detections spells.

They slipped around the house before returning the information to him on what they had discovered.

There were some simply, yet powerful, charms to keep the house clean and safe for the child. Oh, and he could clearly see the magic of the unique spell they had used to hide the house.

He ripped down the whole lot while throwing up a quick set of anti-travel jinxs. He moved towards the front door only to have to leap to the side as it lashed out at him. Turning into a spinning wooden abomination of teeth and claws hurling itself at him.

He cast a speed charm on himself and dodged back before lashing out with a fire lance. His focus on disrupting the transfiguration willed into his intent smashed the wooden beast into flaming shards the scattered across the yard. He banished them back through the doorway into the house. The he sent a darkness curse after the flaming wooden remains.

Casting a shielding charm ahead of himself he approached the door again. He had made it a step in when the darkness coalesced into a ball with the flaming wood. Taking on a metallic luster a bear formed on the magics ran towards him only to dissolve in a sickly yellow wash as it hit his shield.

James Potter stood there his wand dancing through the air as he transfigured object after object in the front room into monsters of death.

Five birds made of silver and gold with diamond claws launched themselves at Voldemort as he dropped his shield and brought up another.

An acid shield spell was useless against base metals and carbon jewels. Instead he brought up a brightly shining shield of air that bounced the airborne birds back. He noticed a badger made of silver liquid headed towards his left leg.

Stepping farther into the room he cast a balsting charm in front of the creature splattering it across the walls.

The birds bounced off his shield once again followed by a brace of arrows. They looked to be made of liquid silver as well, mercury he realized. Knowing they would easily bypass his Aueris Proxima Shield, as would have the badger, he dropped it before the birds could return and rolled forward casting a Maximus Aegis.

Which he was ecstatic to know as the floorboards had ripped up into spears that tried to impale him. The arrows splattered against the wall behind him take a 10 foot space out of said wall.

He didn't have time to stare in shock as he felt the birds ram his shield. He threw out a quick blood boiling curse that would also dissolve anything it hit.

James sidestepped it enough to avoid it but the couch behind him popped in a shower of acid.

The Potter man screamed as the acid burned his back yet he clenched his teeth and finished his latest transfiguration.

The chandelier ripped itself free from the ceiling dragging several dozen feet of chain behind it that had been hidden in the ceiling with it.

"Herpo's Hairy Nutsack boy! Are you insane!?"

A wild and bewildered shout broke from Voldemort as the whole thing twisted in a Gryphon. A gryphon made of Cold Iron and Sun Gold!

A fist of either is was worth several years wages for most people. That the Potters had /several hundreds pounds/ of it laying around to use for transfiguration was absolutely a total shitshow of a situation.

He began swearing even more as he noticed the wife upstairs standing at the doorway downing what he was sure was a large vial of Felix Felicis.

This was going to be a long night...

Tbc possibly.

You mentioned that Lily was good at potions, so I imagine there's a fully outfitted potion lab upstairs, and lots of potions stashed throughout the house for emergencies.
