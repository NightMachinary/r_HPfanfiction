I'm trying to find a story I read years ago (before the movies came out) Harry and Dudley ends up being raised by their mothers cousins . His grandmother Hazel (I think) had a sister Marigold (maybe) who had 4 daughters Hyacinth Bucket, Daisy, Violet & Rose (from Keeping Up Appearances) Harry starts out with Violet and her husband Bruce but is removed from them due to their fighting and Bruce's issues. He ends up with Daisy and her husband Onslow, their daughter Stephanie (who's about 10 years older than Harry), Rose and Mr. Walton (the sisters father). Dudley ends up with Hyacinth, Richard and their son Sheridan (who is about the same age as Stephanie) The Dursley adults including Marge had died in a car crash when the boys were at school. Harry and Dudley were about 7 years old. I would also love to read some other Harry Potter & Keeping Up Appearances crossover were Lily was related to the Walton family. There is only one story on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] were she was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9763377/1/No-Sparrows-Allowed]] There is one story were she was related to Richard, but it was in Finnish and I read it using a google chrome translation that is not perfect [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10875491/1/Siniset-talviot-Royal-Doultonin-kahvikupeissa]] There is also a short one were the Bucket's stumble onto Hogwarts rather then being related to anyone.

** I hope you find it. I adored Keeping Up Appearances as a child
