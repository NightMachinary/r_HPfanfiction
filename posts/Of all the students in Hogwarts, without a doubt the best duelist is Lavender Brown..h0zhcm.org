** "You hurt my Won Won! I challenge you to a duel."

"Bring it!"

â€‹

Harry was awaiting the duel with dread. If Hermione was so eager to attack /Ron/, what would she do to the vapid blonde who Ron was interested in.

Brown walked in, twirling her wand around, dressed in loose robes and in high heels. Harry winced, this was going to be worse than he thought.

Hermione walked in, lips thinned and eyes narrowed. Harry rushed over to talk her out of this.

"Listen, Hermione-" Harry stared.

"-No Harry, I don't care. I'm going to destroy her," Hermione said.

Hermione walked to the podium that some seventh years had transfigured.

"Ready, Brown?" Hermione asked.

"Bring it buckteeth!"

Brown and Hermione stood at the ends of each podium. A hankerchief was thrown. It touched the ground.

"/Depulso/," Hemione shouted.

Lavender's wand flashed through the air, and Hemione's spell undid itself before it was even cast. "Verbal casting? From the so-called brightest witch of our generation?"

Hermione was shocked but the insult seemed to shock her back into anger. Harry stood watching, slowly growing worried at how calm Lavender seemed to be.

"/Confringo/!" Hemione shouted. Lavender did not repeat a block this time and a fiery orange light left Hermione's wand.

Harry shouted. This had just turned lethal. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw two prefects raise their wands, but he knew it would be too late.

Lavender casually lifted her wand, her other hand checking her nails. She flicked and the spell was redirected away from her. Harry's mouth fell open, and he turned to see what had exploded. To his amazement and horror, it was Hermione's favorite desk that she liked to study at that had been destroyed.

"/Avis, oppugno!/".

Lavender's mouth thinned and she straightened, looking angry at the reminder of Ron's injury. Lavender tapped herself with her wand and the birds swerved around Lavender to slam into a wall. She whispered "You would dare to hurt my boyfriend?".

It was Lavender's turn to cast. A red jet of light left her wand, her casting silent, followed by a gold light. Her third wand movement was another complicated wiggle.

Hermione hadn't been idle. She had cast a shield after her oppugno with a cried "/protego/!", and Lavender's block had stopped her body bind from being cast. Lavender's first spell shattered her shield, and her second slammed into Hermione, knocking her to the floor. Hermione got off the floor, hand raised to touch her now lengthened teeth. Lavender smirked at Hermione.

"Shall we call it a win for me, Granger?"

"/Sectumsempr-/!" It was blocked.

"/Cruci/-!" Blocked yet again with another complicated wiggle.

"Again, Granger, nonverbal casting is what any serious duellist uses."

"/Avada Kedavra/!".

At that Lavender's facade of calm had left her, face twisting into an expression of fear. After all, the spell couldn't be blocked or shielded. It was all for naught though, Hermione couldn't cast the spell. Still, Harry was shocked that Hermione would even try, and if the expressions of everyone else in the room were any indication, they were as well.

Lavender flicked her wand, a purple flame leaping to collide with Hermione's shouted "/Protego!/, which held, if barely.

Lavender's followup shattered Hermione's shield and knocked her to the floor. Jinxes, followed by more hexes left Lavender's wand. Hermione sprouted boil-covered antlers, a thin pelt of fur, her eyes were hexed, and she sprouted a tail. After a few more hexes, Lavender finally cast a spell, the distinct color of the stunning spell.

"Anyone mind summoning the aurors?" Lavender asked sweetly. With that, she walked back to her dorm.

Obviously OOC for pretty much everyone.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

**** Actually in the book it's never really clear, Hermione sees greyback getting back up from attacking her and sees lavender stir feebly. I choose to think that she survived, but got turned.
