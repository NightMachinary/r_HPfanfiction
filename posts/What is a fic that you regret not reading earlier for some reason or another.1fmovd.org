I am reading Becoming alpha [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6389117/12/Becoming-Alpha]]

and I have previously avoided it because I thought it was a creature!harry and I can't stand when Animagus is part of the main plot. Now that i am reading it I wish I would have started it earlier!


** HPMOR, aka, Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. You can go to the webpage [[http://hpmor.com/]] there's also an android app [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ebooq.uidHPMOR&feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5lYm9vcS51aWRIUE1PUiJd][here]] - basic premise? Petunia married a professor, Harry grows up reading science and science fiction. It is completely AU, lots of fun if JKR's world sometimes makes your head implode.
