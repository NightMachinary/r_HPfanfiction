I've been piecing together the first inklings of a story recently, set in the aftermath of Voldemort's attack on the Potters. Except trying to scrounge together a basic timeline of who was doing what and where during that time is maddening, and a lot of what we do know makes no sense. Here's the best information I've got pieced together so far.

Hagrid gets to the house and picks up Harry, closely followed by Sirius. Hagrid was sent by Dumbledore to pick up Harry and bring him to Little Whinging, and Sirius lends him the flying motorcycle to better achieve that, while going off himself to chase Pettigrew. McGonagall spent November first casing out the Dursley house. Dumbledore (and later Hagrid) shows up at the Dursley house late the next night/early the following morning, talk with McGonagall, confirming the rumors of the attack and that Harry survived. Hagrid arrives, they leave Harry on the doorstep.

And... that's it. Can anybody think of any canon information to add to any of this that I'm not remembering?


** Oct 31: Voldemort Kills James, Lily, tries to kill Harry.

Oct 31: Hagrid retrieves Harry from Godric's Hallow

Oct 31: Hagrid receives flying motorcycle from Sirius

Nov 1, near dawn: McGonagall arrives and Little Whinging

Nov 1: Wizarding world is noticed celebrating by muggles

Nov 1, near midnight: Dumbledore arrives at Little Whinging, Hagrid arrives carrying Harry

Nov 1/Nov 2: Dumbledore leaves Harry along with a letter to Petunia on the doorstep

Nov 2: Petunia takes Harry in. "She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you."

--------------

There is some lost time. Hagrid didn't spend 24 hours traveling. There is a passing of information from Hagrid to McGonagall, but not directly since she's only heard rumor.

Someone talked and information about Harry's part in Voldemort's death. Though this rumor alone isn't what spurred wizards into celebration. When Voldemort was defeated his power broke, those who had been cursed by him came back to themselves. The death eaters noticed his spells breaking and their dark marks faded. Only the most fanatic kept activity the others went defensive, protecting themselves.

Another consideration is Voldemort's wand. Which was at Godric's Hallow, then comes into his possess in GoF. The line between those runs most directly through Wormtail. So he might've been present that night.

** As far as canon cues go, [[/u/EpicBeardMan]] has the accurate information.

In my head-canon, I put together what was known and what seemed reasonable and came up with this:

Wormtail led Voldemort to Godric's Hollow and pointed out the house to him- there's no way Voldemort would accept him just telling him and no doubt suspected a possible trap. Wormtail watched as the Dark Lord entered the house; heard the shouts and saw the spellfire. When the sacrifice reflected the Killing curse onto the Dark Lord, but couldn't actually kill him, it resulted in a physical effect that blew up Voldemort's body and the top of the Potter's house along with it.

Wormtail saw this, ran up to see what had happened, noted the wreckage and probably apparated to Harry's room to see that the Dark Lord's robes were empty except for ashes, and grabbed the wand (no doubt sticking out of the wall nearby). He then fled.

Dumbledore detected the situation at the Potter's house in Godric's Hollow mere minutes after Voldemort killed Lily. Albus sent Hagrid to the Dumbledore family house in the village via the Floo with orders to sneak over and see what's what.

Hagrid did so, found Harry and then encountered Sirius, who had come when his own tricks revealed that his friends were exposed and/or dead. Sirius gave over his bike to Hagrid and then changed into Padfoot so that he could track down Wormtail by the scent he had left at the scene.

Hagrid returned to Dumbledore's house and Floo-called to tell him who survived, and he was directed to fly Harry to Madame Pomfrey's house in Swansea. Dumbledore then sent Pomfrey home from Hogwarts to check Harry over (as they couldn't trust St. Mungos to be safe and bringing Harry to Hogwarts would take hours since sending him through the Floo or Apparating might harm him), while Dumbledore headed to the scene to investigate. Barely an hour had passed since the Potters died.

Hagrid, bored at Pomfreys but ordered to stay at hand with the cycle, started chatting with other Order members via the Floo. Dumbledore called Pomfrey from his house, because he had detected an unusual protection from around the remains of Harry's crib. He ordered Pomfrey to keep Harry safe for the day while Dumbledore figured out how to leverage this.

Hagrid, still bored and listening in, called back his gossip friends to update them about Dumbledore's findings- 'Harry killed Voldemort, uh huh!'

Albus came up with a possible solution, but found that there weren't many Evans' left alive for some reason. He ordered McGonagall to Surrey to check out his best prospect.

About here was when Albus started getting inundated with Floo calls from various and sundry, asking for info on Harry vs. Voldemort. He spent what time he wasn't researching blood-based protections doing spin control over everything that Hagrid was heard to say (and given Hagrid's accent, much misinterpretation was at play).

That evening Albus arranged for Hagrid to deliver Harry to the Dursleys, meeting McGonagall there even though she'd already confirmed that they are Lily's family, and not cannibal serial-killers. The letter was the keystone of sustaining Harry's protection, and it relied on Petunia accepting the role of substitute parent and host. She did, and the rest is history.

*** Most of this is fine, though the conversation between McGonagall and Dumbledore in the series prologue indicates that they hadn't spoken. In fact I expect she went there to see him more than anything else which indicates that Dumbledore was exceptionally busy during and following the events of that night.

If we're creating a story around it instead of just laying out the timeline I think a planned distraction of some sort coinciding with Voldemorts attack makes sense.

**** Yeah, I'll have to revise that. Albus would have dug up the address for Lily's sister under her married name, then told Hagrid that he would need to bring Harry there (without telling him why) well after nightfall, assuring him that the street with all the lights burnt out would be his destination. During a Floo call gossip, Hagrid would have mentioned to the irate McGonagall that he 'was meeting' wi' Professor Dumbledore later' if she hadn't caught up to him yet.

Motivated by her preference to get the facts straight from the source and curious as to why some address in the middle of muggle suburbs would be worth the attention, she went there and spied on them. We can only assume that it was a weekend or that her classes had been cancelled, since Hogwarts would have been in session around Hallowe'en.

Presuming that the calendars in canon are the same as ours in every way; then October 31, 1981 was a Saturday.

*** we know from an interview from jk rowling that wormtail obtained voldemorts wand but not when. if it's true that wormtail was around the house when voldemort was defeated, he could have lifted the fidelius charm at this point which would explain why everyone can see the ruins of the house.

** Rough timeline in my headcanon:

- Voldemort kills James and Lily and gets himself "killed"
- Immediately, Death Eaters feels a surge of magic in their Dark Marks, which then proceeds to almost vanish, catching their attention, and the Fidelius fails
- Peter realizes something is wrong and goes to Godric's Hollow. He notices James' and Lily's deaths, finds Voldemort's wand and (tries to) go underground (he is a coward and doesn't really care for either side of the war, so leaves Harry alone)
- Dumbledore, probably using one of his many devices, gets a heads up on James and Lily's deaths and Harry's survival and goes to Hagrid, instructing him what to do, and explains his plan to McGonagall. He then proceeds to deal with the fallout in the Ministry
- McGonagall decides to investigate the living situation of the Dursleys
- Severus, noticing his Dark Mark acting oddly, after talking to other Death Eaters over what is going on, eventually approaches Godric's Hollow out of worry for Lily. He's devastated over her death, but Apparates away as someone (Sirius) approaches
- Sirius finds Godric's Hollow in ruins and is devastated over James and Lily's deaths and vows to keep Harry safe.
- Hagrid shows up, confronts Sirius about Harry by instructions from Dumbledore, overruling him, and, using Sirius' motorcycle, drives to the Dursleys. Sirius, realizing Peter sold them out, goes to hunt him down
- (Other) Death Eaters (via Ministry moles) realize that Voldemort is somehow "dead". The Lestranges and Barty Crouch Jr. talk to each other over what to do and in the end (after several days) decides to confront the Longbottoms
- The rest of the Wizarding World is made aware of Voldemort's "death" and celebrates, to the point where Muggles notices odd things
- Sirius finds Peter and confronts him. Peter blows up a street and escapes. Sirius gets hysterical that Peter got an one-over on him, misleading Ministry officials into believing him to have been the traitor
- Dumbledore, being done with the Ministry for the time, confronts Snape about the fallout, to make sure he doesn't do something stupid after Dumbledore's own end of their bargain wasn't upheld (The /"I thought you were going to keep her safe" .../ scene)
- Hagrid and Dumbledore reaches the Dursleys. McGonagall has concluded that the Dursley living situation is very dubious and confronts Dumbledore about it, but is overruled. Dumbledore delivers Harry on the doorstep with a letter
- The Dursleys take Harry in
