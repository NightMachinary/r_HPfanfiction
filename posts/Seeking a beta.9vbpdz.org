I made a previous post that was complaining about how hard finding a beta is, and some of y'all suggested I make a post here. Well here it is. Need it be reiterated, I'm looking for a beta. My grammar is pretty stellar, but I'm human. My main concern is plot and characterization. Also, if y'all couldn't tell (haha), I'm an American. Particularly an American from the South, so my Britishness is lacking while my hick-ness is high. And so y'all know, I don't say y'all in my real writing, so don't let that scare y'all away.

I'll PM a google doc link to interested any interested party. Also, I'm happy to beta for you in return.

I hope that some other people can benefit from this post and find betas here too, so I don't feel guilty about my selfish post.

Anywho, here's my synopsis:

AU. Ginny Weasley dies in the Chamber and Tom Riddle returns. Harry Potter has an older sister. Snape's past becomes entangled in his present. This story takes place in what would be the Goblet of Fire in canon. Forces in the Ministry conspire to gain power, using Hogwarts and the Tri-Wizard Tournament as their means. Certain characters will have non-canon, OC family members.


** I'm intrigued! I'm also an American, but if you'd just like to get as many eyes as possible on your story, then I would happily take a look at it. I'll PM you.

** No promises I'll go the distance, but my grammar is pretty stellar too and I can britpick with the best of them, so if you feel you've got nothing to lose by PMing me your writing, feel free. That goes for anyone.
