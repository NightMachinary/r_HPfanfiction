Well before you start posting crack fics, I want to know the fics that really try to seriously explain, how Hagrid was conceived, though if you don´t know anything else, or know a particular good crack fic please share them too. Also now that I think about, every pure giant, was depicted as significantly less intelligent than Humans, to a degree that they would be considered as people with special needs, if they weren´t so big, if anyone wants to add to that train of thought be my guest.

There was a short discussion about that some time ago, and my view (supported by the extended, Pottermore-friendly canon) is that Giants are /not/ inherently less intelligent than humans --- their civilization is just stuck at caveman level. As evidence I will cite the historical Giants created by Rowling for the Chocolate Frog Cards, one of whom was no less than /a good friend of the King of Ireland/.

My personal headcanon is that Mr Hagrid was an open-minded wizard (of the same type as Regulus Moonshine with the Hags, Rubeus Hagrid with the Acromantulas, Hermione with the House-Elves, etc.) who developped a temporary size-increasing potion to turn himself into a Giant and live amongst Giants for a while. During his stay he fell in love with Fridwulfa, nature took its course, and boom, Hagrid Jr. However, the potion wore off and Hagrid Senior realized he couldn't just stay a giant forever --- like staying under Polyjuice for too long without interruption, it'd just be too much for his body to handle.

So in what I imagine was a tearful farewell in Giantspeak, Mr Hagrid leaves Fridwulfa, taking Li'l Rubeus with him., as both of them realize that (especially with how careless giants can be of smaller creatures) they just couldn't live together while their true sizes. Leaving Fridwulfa to remarry (or re-mate; I doubt Giants have officialized weddings) with some random giant and give birth to Grawp.

*** Well canon says that, Fridwulfa left Hagrid´s Dad because she was disappointed, that Hagrid was so small and left, that´s why she also neglected Grawp, he also only remembers her as being a bad mother. Though your headcanon is really intriguing and yeah considering everything in canon, the giants behavior is more likely because of nurture than nature.

*** What if Fridwulfa took a shrinking potion, which permanently effected her eggs. Which would explain Gwarps shrimpy size compared to other full blooded Giants

** I can't remember which fic, but there was one which said that Rubeus and Madame Maxime were the results of an illegal set of experiments. Rubeus was taken in by Mr Hagrid, who was one of his rescuers.
