The scene I remember was Harry in Severus's class and Snape takes points as usual Harry ends up looking up in the air and announcing for Hogwarts to intervene about unfair points taken.

Snape ends up getting 2 out of 3 warnings I'm fairly sure maybe it was a time travel fix it kind of?'

I know Snape ends up getting punished as all his points don't mean anything so he gets a bit petty by assigning points knowing they aren't given.

Thanks
