Looking for Fem!Harry fics that are at least 100k words and any pairing. I've read many fics so far, and was looking for something new to read, preferably fanfiction.net, but ao3 fics are fine as well.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.[ON TEMPORARY HIATUS FOR PERSONAL REASONS, NOT ABANDONED â™¡]

** I like *Black Sky*... it has fem!Harry being raised by a extended Black family being all posh and gathering followers.

The pairing boils down to 'Can't find any in Britain, better preform ritual to escape forced Marriage^{by Wizangemot}' and is used to transfer to the crossover after HP-story is just about finished.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family...

Also not really what you asked for, but the Alexandra Quick series has a female main character and is great. It's it's own original story set in wizarding America, that features a girl named Alexandra Quick attending Magical school there and going on a somewhat similar journey to Harry's.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
