As the title says, what was the fic that made you look at a pairing of people that didn't occur in the original books and think "Yep. That's a relationship I can ship."

Any relationships okay, het or slash or femslash, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome.

Just please, mark the pairing in your comment. No details if you don't want to - though I'd love to hear your thoughts on why the fic made you think the pairing could work - but at least just the link and the pairing please.


** As a Harry/Luna shipper for years, honestly, it was linkffn(Protection From Nargles), as cliche of an answer that is. Luna's always been my personal favourite character in the series and when I've written her in my own fics I've seen her as a bit of an author avatar. The way the fic treats the relationship between the two as growing very naturally, very sweetly, cemented pretty much instantly for me that it would be the ship that I die on a hill for.

*** Haruna Matata. What a wonderful phrase. It means no worries, for the rest of your daaaaays. :)

I agree completely for completely the same reasons (aside from writing her in my own fics as I've not written anything for this fandom yet), so all I can really say to you is 'true that' and thank you for the rec, so...

True that. Thank you for the rec! :)

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE.

  Harry makes three rules to survive fourth year: 1) watch the new DADA professor like a hawk, 2) suspect all animals of being animagi, and 3) avoid Cedric Diggory at all costs. Shame Diggory didn't get the memo. For a tumblr prompt by johnlocked-starkid: maybe a Harry/Cedric thing where the Triwizard Cup isn't a portkey and Voldemort doesn't happen, and instead they just win together and are happy and celebrate together. (bonus points for shy confessions of a crush from one or the other)

** The Muddy Princess by Colubrina wasn't my first Dramione fic, but I felt like it was the best one at showing a working Hermione/Draco relationship for me.

Shadow Magic by Lomonaaeren is the first Harry/Theo I read that made the pairing seem

Vellum Voices by Lomonaaeren is the first and so far only Harry/Blaise I've read, but it works.

Roundabout Destiny by Mary Royale is the first and best Hermione/Sirius for me.

I can't remember what fic made Harry/Hermione work for me, but it was probably early in my fanfiction reading and so something by Robst or someone similar. Similarly I can't remember the first Harry/Luna that I really liked. There was a good Luna/Ginny I read but can't remember the title of, I think it might have been by FullParagon/Mugglesftw. I really enjoyed a Sirius/AuroraSinestra fic but can't remember the details on that one.

I've yet to find many Tom/Anyone fics that I like as most Tom pairing fics don't have Tom redemption (or predemtion if they save him before he goes bad) and instead have him corrupt whatever character (Harry, Hermione, etc) that is paired with him. The best I've seen is Tom/Ginny/Draco in Things in Common.

** Gelosaþ in Écnesse - linkao3(2352896) is the fic that made me give slash pairings a chance. Harry/Salazar. Yes, time travel. I love me some time travel.

The Green Girl - linkffn(11027125) was the first dramione I read, and so confusion ensued when I realized that so. many. people. hate. it. And yeah, a lot of the stories with this pairing that I read afterwards were terrible. But this one? It works, yo. Honorable mention for Rebuilding, an 8th year dramione by the same author that does a fairly realistic job at rehabilitating him.

One Hundred and Sixty Nine - linkao3(1124404) Another time travel, yay! Prior to this story, the only Hermione/Sirius fic I had read was Debt of Time, which icked me out a bit with the problematic ages. 169 does a damned good job at the pairing though, and the dynamic is sweet.

Of a Linear Circle - linkao3(11284494) This is what is chipping away at my dislike of Severus Snape involved in a pairing. At all. I hated that character, so so so much. This though is such a goddamned amazingly wild ride that I can't recommend it enough. Updates in part 8 are arriving on a regular basis and I want to give the author a big sloppy kiss for this epic tale of well over a million words and counting. And no, I'm not saying who he's paired with. It's a spoiler. Sort of.

**** For basic Harmony, Harry is not stupid a bit of a slacker(Ron's fault imo) he is intelligent enough to hold a intelligent enough discussion with Hermione to be at least a soundboard for her. He's even canon a good and caring guy who can tend for her emotional needs. Hermione on the other side is a loyal to a fault. Even if she totally disagree with him she stand by his side. Something what with Harry's abandon issues harmonies. While she has a mile wide bossy streak(something he can stand up against, especially in later year's) she has a as-such-as big caring heart. She push him to be better while he ground her controlling issues. I could go on but I think that's enough for now.
