So I'm writing a fic and I want to establish the characters and their home life before Hogwarts. The train journey and the sorting will be important as well, but I can't stand writing children so I want to skip to the 4th year, any tips on how to do this without ruining relationships or seeming out of place?


** There is only one way to learn how to write, which is to write a lot and fail at it here and there while you're learning. No one can teach you how, any more than anyone can teach you how to perform any other skill; at best a teacher can guide you a bit, but in the end, you are the one teaching yourself just about everything you learn, with practice being the medium by which you teach yourself. All learning is self learning, we just often don't think about it that way.

So, try your best to work through your plot problem by actually writing. It might not really be a problem at all, but if it is indeed a problem, and if your solution isn't working, try again until you feel you've got it.

**** There are literally hundreds of books on creative writing out there. You can try reading a couple if you like. That said, I think that you'll find that no really good writer started that way; they almost all started by writing and writing and writing. The single most important thing is not to be afraid that what you'll write at first might suck; indeed, just start by assuming you will indeed suck at first, the same way that you sucked when you started learning how to drive or learning how to play a game that you like. There's no shame in being a beginner, and many things can only be learned by working past that. No child is born knowing how to walk.

** Personally, I would recommend a prologue that happens before the characters would be Hogwarts age (pre-11). Set up important family information and anything that is particularly important to your fic.

Then, you can skip ahead to the time where you want to write. Then you could do small flashbacks if they are appropriate (do it well, bad flashbacks are hard to read) or you can just mention any informtion you need in a subtle way throughout the chapters.

This is how I would do it but there are definitely different ways to do it :)

** There are two ways to do it: prologue and time-skip. It all depends on whether you can do all your early set-up in a single chapter. A prologue can be anything from super-short to rather long, but the main point is that it's a single chapter.

If it's too long to do in one chapter, then you have to do a time-skip, where you do as many chapters as necessary for the set-up, then start your new chapter several years later. Readers being what they are, you'll need to warn that a time-skip is coming up. (Some will whinge anyway, but that's the nature of fan-fiction.)

If you go the second route, try to minimize references to canon things that you didn't specifically cover. There's a reason you didn't cover it.

**** Basically, write out all your early stuff, then see whether it makes sense as a single chapter (even if you have to cut stuff).

Keep in mind that you can do flashbacks after your time-skip, too, if there's stuff that you'd like to keep but can slide into place in the later part.

** I would suggest prologue chapters; one for each character where you introduce the character and get them where you want them to be for the main part of the story.

When reading, I always hated to see a notation that indicated a time skip. As long as you put some kind of reference in the next part then you don't need to do that. I feel like it insults the readers comprehension skills. E.g. Harry woke up to the rap of Aunt Petunia's knuckles on his cupboard door letting him know that this was going to be just like any other day: feed the Dursley's, chores, Year 4 classes, attempt not to get beaten up by Dudley, come home, chores, feed Dursley's, and then sleep.

** Outside of just skipping, one other approach would be to simply shift the Hogwarts ages. There's no reason to stay wedded to the canonical starting age, really - if you want to approach more adult topics, it makes sense to bump it up to more of a university age.

So, unless you have a reason that those 3 skipped years are important, just have the students start Hogwarts at age 14 (like students starting 4th year would be).

Alternatively, if you're doing anything like a rehash of canon, or where there's nothing interesting for a year, you could always speed through it in a chapter - just giving a quick overview.

** Prologue.

Then write down all that you mean should've happened in the first, second, and third year.

Start writing the first chapter without mentioning what happened in the previous years unless it's natural. Flashbacks should be the last resort for bringing it up. Nightmares comes ahead of it.
