** Thanks for the rec! The story is pretty decent, some parts are unrealistic (all generations of the Weasley's going to Wisconsin???) but Harry's character background is unique and engaging. Hopefully the author will complete the fic.

*** Yes I thought so too, but also it was the Christmas holiday's and families usually try and meet around those times. I hope so too!
