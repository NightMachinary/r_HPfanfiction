#+TITLE: If a firstborn female has a son and the second born is a male, who is the Lordship passed down to? The grandson or the second-born son? I'm also wondering how you would title a son or daughter to the house when there are already heirs. Would it be Son __ of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black?

I'm obviously using this for a fanfiction. There are other titles to look after, too. Would the second-born son be the heir apparent or heir presumptive? Or would the grandson be the heir apparent or heir presumptive?


** Depends on the system of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture][primogeniture]] involved. Traditionally:

First-born daughter would be heir presumptive until the birth of the second-born son. The second-born son, being the first son of the lord, is heir apparent. A second son of the lord would also jump ahead of the sister/grandson for succession.

If the heir apparent has a child, whether male or female, that child moves ahead of both their cousin and uncle for succession.

** First of all, I want to specify that in Canon, Magical Britain does not have any Nobility. No matter what the Blood Purist may think and say behind closed door, all the Witches and Wizards are legally equals. Families like the Malfoy, the Lestranges or the Black can be considered as Bourgeois, and their wealth plus personal connections can still help them advance in life.\\
Calling themselves the "Most Ancient and Noble House of Black" was just a way for the Black to show how they considered themselves superior to others, even other pureblood. The term doesn't have any legal weight and the normal reaction of anyone when asked to call a Black like this should be to laugh at their face.\\
The term "Sacred Twenty-Eight" came from "The Pureblood Directory", a Directory published anonymously by someone (widly believed to be Cantankerus Nott) during the 1930's to list which family he believed to be "Still Pure". It's just a bunch of Blood Purism propaganda and it's not even accurate since the Potters (at that time) were Pure and were not included only because their name sounded "Too Muggle" and they were seen as too "Pro Muggle". Other families (like the Weasley) deplored their inclusion and proudly noted that they had Muggle ancestors.

​

I just wanted to say this because, since the story you are writing is obviously a Nobility AU, you are basically free to do whatever you want without caring for Canon.\\
Now, concerning your question, the first thing you should do is to write the rules of inheritance you will use:

- Are the women unable to inherit a title (French law)? Are they able to inherit, but only when there is no Son to inherit (British law)? Or are they the equals of men when it comes to inheritance (no example there)?
- It's more for Muggle nobility where titles were tied to a physical land, but are the Titles divided (like in Early Middle Age) or condensed (late Middle Age/ Renaissance)?\\
  As an example, if Lord Potter marries Lady Greengrass and they have 2 son together. With the first son be Lord Potter and the Second Lord Greengrass, or will the first son be Lord Potter-Greengrass while the 2nd doesn't have any title?

​

To answer your question, if we take a Agnatic Cognatic Primogeniture system (Females can inherit, but only behind Males like in the UK), the succession goes like this:

- The oldest living son inherit everything
- In the absence of Son, the oldest living daughter inherit everything
- If the oldest son married and had children, his children have priority over the 2nd son (in the UK, the children of Prince William are over Prince Harry in the Succession list)
- In the cases where there is no sons, and the daughter married and have children, the daughter with a son has priority over his elder without a son (if the eldest only has daughter while the 2nd has a son, the 2nd is set to inherit. But the eldest will take back her place the moment she has a son).

With this system, /the 2nd Son would be the one to inherit the Lordship/, even if his nephew is older than him.

Concerning your 2nd question, I think you should just not bother with it any title and just give the house they belongs to. If we take the Canon pairing, it would gives something like this:

- Harry, Lord of House Potter
- Ginny, Lady of House Potter
- Sir James of House Potter
- Sir Albus of House Potter
- Miss Lily of House Potter

You don't have to say "who" is the heir everytime. In an Aristocratic society, people "who matter" will always know who is who anyways (just like you don't have to say Lady XXX nee YYY).

** Depends on the system.\\
First, who did the eldest daughter Marry? If Fem Black married Mr Greengrass thereby becoming Lady Greengrass, the son would be in line for Lord Greengrass not Lord Black.\\
If it's patrilineal, it's eldest male child so yes, second born son, not grandson.

** Wait, why wouldn't it be passed on to the firstborn female? The wizarding world is supposed to be big on gender equality.

Anyway, to answer your question it would probably be grandson (line of succession and all that).

**** Extended canon had a female minister in the 18th century IIRC. How much that says about the universe in general is a different question. It could be an utopian ideal, or it could be an exception for an outstanding person. Or some weird shenanigans like you see in mediaeval history of Eastern Europe, where a Queen could not rule but a woman still could if she styled herself King rather than Queen.

Homosexuality is a bit difficult to judge IMO since the very concept of sexual orientation only really came to be in the 19th century. The Romans for example did not care where you sticked your dick in since fucking was considered manly and being fucked being feminine.

**** Technically that just means one house is patrilineal. They're also the only ones we know who use the 'ancient and most noble' thing, so they could just be really traditionalist and outdated by Wizarding World standards.

** I would suggest making the heir be whoever is considered more worthy, which has some canon precedent. Sirius was disowned (ish) in favor of Regulus, until they the younger died and the estate reverted back to the firstborn.

One fic has Tracey Davis as the second born (illegitimate affair with a muggleborn), but her trueborn brother is an idiot. The brother will get the title, but be a figurehead. Tracey is going to inherit all the business authority and really run the family.

Wind Shear has Orion decide he endorses Andromeda and Ted, but 'Tonks is no kind of wizards name', and makes Ted become a Black. And there's several fics where Tonks is made Black heir instead of Harry and she grudgingly become Nymphadora Black.

** If fem!Harry marries Neville Longbottom (just an example, not necessarily the best idea), their first son would be Heir of the House of Longbottom, but the second son may take over the House of Potter again. At least, that's how I understood the nobility worked.

** I would use the title of Heir Apparent for those designated as the Heir of the House, and Heir Presumptive if there isn't a apparent heir. Perhaps use scion as a less formal title.

In regards to who would the lordship pass to, think of other ways the lordship passed on. Perhaps it's the oldest Male relative, or the oldest child of theres. Are you adamant on a male being the Head of the House? Look into primogeniture and the other types of how a lordship pass down. Think on the genders and how transgender heirs may work, or if the lord goes from male to female and whether they stay as head. Think on non-binary members of the house and other genders. Maybe magic plays a part and who ever has the most comparable magic to the lord. Maybe genetics? The person who is most genetically similar to the lord could be the heir.

I would maybe have a system where each house decides who is heir by the lords word. Some conservative families may have the first born son, while progressive families may have the firstborn child.

Think outside the box if you want a really good story. Having the eldest son for all houses, regardless of preference or whether the house is progressive or conservative ( often called dark, light, and grey houses in stories) Seems a bit of a cheap shot. Look into how inheritance of titles of the past worked, how the celts, Roman's, Vikings and more passed down titles and such.

** Since canon didn't tell us, you could assume magical Britain has the same system as muggle Britain, or you could get creative and make up something new. Different cultures have had all different systems.

Something I haven't seen explored yet in this thread is the issue of legitimacy. Does the son of a lord have any legal right to inherit, if he was conceived on the wrong side of the sheets? What if he's older than the son whose parents were legally married? Different cultures handle this differently.
