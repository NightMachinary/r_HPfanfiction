Hi,

I was quite active in the HP fandom a few years back (around OOTP/HBP came out) but have since lost contact. I still subscribe to some LJ communities, but they seem to feature the same 3-5 authors over and over.

I am looking good stuff too read. Romance is good, action adventure or character based stuff, ... Gen preferred, but will take anything that is good and finished.

I have lost the bookmarks I used to have and cannot remember the website urls, plus a lot of them seem to be dead. So I have no clue on where to start looking. (Aside from fictionalley and ff.net.)

Thanks!


** What is Gen, exactly?

*** General, so not geared toward a specific ship.

**** Ah ha! I always thought "gen" was short for "generation," as in a ship featuring people from different generations.

*** Short explanation - no romance and no porn.

Long explanation - most of the fanfics are relationship specific, lots of cheesy romance or other events designed to get people together and or naked. Harry/Ginny is a classic or Ron/Hermione, but I have also seen [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=299][Dobby/SortingHat]] - don't click the link, this is the fic your mother warned you about. :D

Traditionally the relationship the story is about is designated by a tag following in the title. Generic or Gen was used when such a relationship was absent.

** [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/15vrei/postwar_afterlife_run_recd_many_months_ago_but/][Run]] is great (details in link, it's an adventure fic, but also like an ensemble character study of everyone who died in the war). [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=315682][Serenity Hill]] is another one of my favorites, about Charlie, switching between his dragon keeping days and his childhood.

Do you mean you want to read fic published after HBP or fic set after HBP?

*** Mainly published after HBP, bc I've already read almost every good (and some not so good) fanfic that that got published between GoF and HBP. * blush *

As for the setting of the story, I've found I am not too fond of stories with the children in them - most people just use them as an easy vehicle to write OOC versions of the parents and I hate that.

**** There's a lot of great next generation stories that don't fit that bill, especially ones written more like coming-of-ages, which are the ones I like to read, but I'm assuming you prefer fic with the canon characters?

I really suggest reading through [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=168043][Celestie's]] author page, even the stories featuring the children (I adore Some Kind of Beauty). She writes a lot of different characters, and her romance is very subtle. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=141880][celticbard]] also writes a lot of great, darker and richly-plotted novels (there are more completed stories toward the bottom of her page). [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=166448][Alopex]] has a lot of great canon character oneshots.

Also be sure to go through this reddit! There's lots of links lying around.

** I posted this earlier but I didn't really explain it. This is The Serpent Master, the first fic in my Power of Two series. It's set two years after the epilougue but does not focus on the kids of HRH etc, its main focus is a new group of characters. I am currently half way through the second book as we speak and I have written plan for five other stories so check them out :) /shameless plug [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6272461/1/The-Serpent-Master]]

** The Golden Age - great, fully canon compatible, completed [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age]]

The best description is

#+begin_quote
  take canon and mercilessly extrapolate it to its logical conclusions
#+end_quote

from one of the reviewers.

** "The Dark Lord's Equal" - Competent Harry and powerful Voldemort, amazing humour (time-travel, "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think)

** "Oh God Not Again!" is IMHO the funniest HP fanfic - and it is complete!

post-HBP, than time-travel happens
