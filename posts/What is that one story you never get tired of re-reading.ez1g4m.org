For me, it's linkffn(Make a Wish). No matter how many times I read it, it never fails to make me laugh. It's just a light hearted, fun story where Harry gets a vacation (sort of) and the death eaters get exactly what they deserve.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

** I'll browse Rorschach's Blot's works occasionally, and usually enjoy it!

Browncoat Green Eyes: linkffn(2857962) - Harry only, and crossover with Firefly. You really need to be familiar with Firefly to not get lost!

Luna's Hubby: linkffn(2919503) Fluffy, fun

Hindsight by Loralee1: linkffn(3160980) Quick read. A sort-of Do-Over where Snape gets a message from future Snape which causes him to drastically change things. Normally I have no love for Snape but this one did a really good job.

When is it a Contract, by Aelkat: linkffn(7382549) One shot. Different look at Luna. I also enjoy the much longer "Help of a Seer" by the same author: linkffn(7548963) I've re-read several of this author's works. Definitely a bit off-the-beaten path, but that is actually enjoyable as so much fanfic is very cookie-cutter.

Dancing in the Green, linkffn(11703507) Fun one-shot that I really wish had a sequel.

Lots of stuff by Clell is worth a re-read, but I'll just mention "Inspected by No.13" which is a short hilarious humour piece: linkffn(10485934) But check out some of his other works as well

I'm also surprised that no one has mentioned Darth Marrs. I'll recommend "The Katarn Side of the Force" which is a Star Wars crossover: linkffn(11576387) that I enjoy because he made Kyle Katarn such a fun badass.

And this is COMPLETELY non-Harry Potter, but I've reread "The Last Jedi" by Darth Marrs at least 2 or 3 times: linkffn(5704904) Which is a purely star wars story set far in the future after "Return of the Jedi". HIGHLY recommended.

**** Okay, this is pretty much going to be 100% spoilers so stop reading now if you don't want to read those.

The tragic losses refer to the disappearance of basically all Harry's friends: Ron, Hermione, Arthur, Molly, Fred, Ginny, Fleur and Fleur's parents, in a Portkey accident - a Portkey that Harry was due to take. They were travelling to Romania to go to Charlie's wedding. Harry eventually makes the trip and Charlie persuades him to take care of Gabrielle who is totally shell-shocked by the loss of her whole family. Harry eventually suggests that she spends the summer with him at his new house, which he shares with two Quidditch team mates.

The reason I love the story so much is that the characters develop almost perfectly. The summary I've given you there suggests it's about Harry swooping in to save poor Gabrielle but that's only a fraction of the story. The story may start with Harry taking care of Gabrielle but by the end she's the one who saves him.

Some people say it's too slow but it's just right for me. It's tagged Romance/Hurt/Comfort, not Action/Adventure. If there's a better character-driven story out there, I'm yet to find it.

  Sirius broke out of Azkaban a month before Harry's eleventh birthday. After finding Harry at the Dursely's he realized that Harry has social anxiety, so he became Harry's service dog. Keeping what he really is is harder than he thought it would be as Sirius accompanies Harry to Hogwarts. Especially when it becomes clear that Harry has a knack for getting into trouble.

I really enjoy the writing style here too, probably because it lacks drama/tension/whatever.

  Harry Potter has disappeared from the Wizarding world, and has been missing for more than 2 years. His two best friends set out to find him, and hire a competent but unlikely companion - investigative reporter Pansy Parkinson. Pansy finds him in a Muggle pub and brings Hermione and Ron there to retrieve him...or so she thinks. Harry/Pansy, background Hermione/Ron

** I've read these fics atleast twice

The Double Agent by bourkem. It's a one shot where Harry is not the BWL and he's like Itachi. You'll enjoy it more if you get the Naruto reference

linkffn(5102870)

Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion by Driftwood1965. I don't usually enjoy bashing fics, but this is amazing.

linkffn(5483280)

A Black Comedy by nonjon. I think people have already suggested it, but I still want to put it here. The Harry in this story is what cannon could have been like if he was raised by Sirius.

  A Harry Potter Oneshot. Follow Harry's journey through the shadows of the war with Lord Voldemort, and watch as he does everything necessary to ensure the survival of his family. Non-BWL Harry! BigBrotherHarry! Rated M to be safe.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
