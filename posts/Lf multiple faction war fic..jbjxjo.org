Read a fic recently where Salazar discovered immortality and still lives and runs the wizarding world.

Riddle is also still alive and was a general on the border (similar to the wall from GoT) and his underlings were called the death eaters. He is currently headmaster with the death eaters as teachers. Hates the empire and Salazar and is obsessed with finding salazars secret for immortality.

Dumbledore and the order are labeled a terrorist group because they are intercepting muggleborns from salazars empire and freeing g them so they're not separated from their chdren/parents.

Grindenwald was never defeated and leads a dark army on the other side of the border.

The fix was pretty good, unfinished, and I personally hate children politics but I'm looking for something similar.

My only request is no Dumbledore or Hermione bashing also no manipulative!Dumbledore.


** There are several factions (Order, Ministry, Death Eaters, Resistance) in my story "Divided and Entwined". No Dumbledore or Hermione bashing.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
