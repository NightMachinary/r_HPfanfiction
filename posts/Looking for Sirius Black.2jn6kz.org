For some reason, Sirius was always one of my favorite characters and I don't find many stories that do his character justice. Lately, Remus and Severus have grown on me as well. Anyone know good (well-written, decent plot) stories featuring one or more of them? (Preferably not as villains, but if it's properly written, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.)


** Try Innocent (and the sequel Initiate) by MarauderLover7. It's pretty long, and a bit slow in parts, but the characterisation makes it worth it. Sirius is such a good character, and really develops throughout the story, and Remus and Severus both feature in it quite regularly. :) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] has a good Sirius, Severus and Remus from a happy universe, Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna from a universe where things went badly, and yet they all mix together nicely and in character. Also, it's easily one of the top five fanfics of all times (across all fandoms).

** I highly highly recommend A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles]]

It's the single best (pretty long) well written canon compliant saga of the life of Severus Snape. It completely changed my mind about him from a mild dislike to complete reverence and respect.

The author, Rannaro, also writes an AU story that picks up where Snape should have died that is a great bandaid for the end of The Snape Chronicles.

** If you want a really bad-ass Sirius (plus seriously bad-ass Regulus), check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/2/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina][Harry Potter and the Deux Ex Machina]]. It can be a bit confusing at the start because it includes a lot of time travel, but absolutely worth it to sink into it, and is great for re-reading. First half-or-so of the story focuses on Regulus, then it switches to focus on Sirius.
