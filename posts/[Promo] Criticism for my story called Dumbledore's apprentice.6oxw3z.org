** A few things, there isn't too much written so I'm going to extrapolate off of similar stories. Secondly my criticisms will revolve more around the story than the technical side of the writing. The only writing thing that leap out at me is the auror calling Hermione Mrs. That means she's married. You'd use Miss when you're sure they aren't or Ms when you're unsure. You do the same in your latest chapter to Daphne.

Now onto problems I have with the story. The war aid act could work but 12? At 12 they can full body bind, they can jelly legs, curse of the boggies, ticking charm and a few more spells that can be cancelled out with a finite. Magic and wands aren't like guns so far as you can give a child one and expect them to contribute. Wands are like swords, you'd need years of training. 15 going 16 would make more sense. Its when they take their OWLs. Its a major mile point that tells you if they're a good wizard. Maybe ministry service would act as credit towards the grades if you're drafted before you sit the exam?

The Basilisk was killed by the sword. Gryffindor's sword, the one that can only be wielded by true Gryffindors and yet your Harry is a Slytherin? I don't know exactly what you mean by 'an early age' but if they were closer than in the books you'd expect Harry to get more help facing Slytherin's monster than in the books. The staff would go with him.

Draco. This is where I have the most issue. An OOC Harry I can deal with. There's a good reason for it. Draco in the books was extremely pro-pureblood, and very much in awe of his father and wanted to grow up to be just like him, snake and scar tattoo and all. For someone to change they have to be willing to change and in the books Draco never showed any signs of willingness. I'm all for a grown up, Draco who looks back and realises he was an utter prat but its a defining part of Draco's character. Its like Hermione if she didn't read books. You've got a OOC Harry, a Draco in name only and blank slate friends. What purpose does changing Draco have? You've taken away so many things we take for granted in the Harry Potter world why not give at least one fixed reference to remind us where we are.

You need to calm down. Harry has been trained from a young age so is more cunning and pragmatic making him a slytherin, fine. Harry isn't there to save Hermione so she and Ron aren't close friends but when exactly does Harry not being in Gryffindor mean she dates Neville, what change does that add to the story, maybe its something to come but for now it just feels like you're tinkering because you can. You have to be able to justify your changes or else you're just creating more things you and the reader have to keep track of. Reading should be a joy not an exercise.

Your Defence 'lessons'. Harry spends a lot of time in the hospital wing after various injuries in the books, we also hear about pre-qudditch jinxing in the corridors ending in trips to the hospital wing. Why exactly would teachers want to encourage that behaviour? If someone is in the hospital wing then they aren't in their next class so unless you've got it so Defence is always the last lesson of the day I very much down the rest of the staff would be happy with this. In the last lesson where the bloody hell did an inferius come from. Why is there an animated corpse wandering Hogwarts?

Its a neat idea but I feel your execution is, at the moment, clumsy. There is no doubt potential here but Its not for me. I have no doubt that if you continue on your current trend you will do very well in the FFnet favs/follow system, I just doubt it will become an instant classic, which is of course fine. Its much easier for me to be a critic than a writer so good luck and I hope you enjoy writing it.

*** Thank you so much for your sharing your true criticism of the story, and I'm really appreciative that you didn't hold back!

1. In my mind, I would assume they wouldn't send anyone at the age unless they absolutely needed too but there's also a valid unstated reason that it starts at twelve. Still you made some excellent points that I haven't considered!

2. Valid point! Wow, didn't even think about that!

3. I do agree that my Draco isn't written like he is in canon, but I think the reason it feels even more OOC for him is that there's a lot of missing pieces from the previous five years that led to this character development. I think he still is very much prejudiced, and unsavory, and he still has a complicated relationship with his parents, but I think I've done a poor job at conveying that. Very Valid Point about that and having a reference point.

4. I do agree, I seem to tinker a lot, but again, there's a lot of backstory that influences these decisions which I try to reveal tastefully(debatable). I will definitely try to calm down though haha.

5. Valid point! In that â€˜obstacle' course, it was implied(not well enough haha) that aurors were guarding and monitoring the course to make sure the rules were being followed , and that no one got seriously hurt. I'm sure the aurors dealt with the inferius!

Thank you so much for your thoughtful and insightful criticism! It really has helped me, and again, I'm really glad you didn't hold back! It's about having fun, but it's about improving too. Really helpful :)

**** The revealing thing is an interesting device that often adds a good pacing and a sense of mystery to a story. In my opinion however, fanfiction is unusual because we already know so much about the characters. That means we can make assumptions and normally its safe to do so. We don't need a 15 year old Harry described for example because we all know what Harry looks like, we know who his parents are etc There is an assumed level of knowledge that both author and reader lean on. AUs blur that line as some of the assumptions become invalid but we'd still make them unless we're told not to. Normally I'd say your pace of revealing is fine but you don't just have to tell us stuff you also have to correct what we think we know. As such in Fanfiction you have to use this sparingly because else when you tell us we disagree since we think we already know stuff about a character.

Have you read linkffn(2859327)? Its one of my favourite stories and while incomplete it seems like its pretty close to being finished. It has a mystery and slight AU aspect to it that you might find interesting.

  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?

** It's basically working off the premise of Dumbledore training Harry at an early age, for the return of Voldemort, rather than leaving him oblivious. I would love to hear criticism/advice/concerns from those who hate it and who might like it! Thank you!

*** I'll give it a read later tonight. The only thing that jumped out at me in my short skim was the War Aid Act. The concept is sound, but try to add a bit of Harry Potter-ness to those things.

They usually spell out something humorous or absurd, giving the reader more immersion into the HP universe.
