Seriously, if you're not using characters from the books, or any magic from the books, or are even set in the same universe as the books, how the hell are you a HPfanfic?


** This happens frequently with reincarnation crossovers. Harry gets reborn into someone else in the Game of Thrones world, for example, has a completely new name, a different personality, no memories of his HP life, and magic is never fucking used.

*** Yup. I just saw a witcher one where Harry is taken as a baby to a different universe and raised as a witcher.

Not sure why that couldn't have just been a piece of witcher fanfiction about a young witcher in training...

*** Do you have some examples of this ? Usually there is a connection that remains (mostly it's the memories), haven't yet crossed a fic like you mentioned, but it would not surprise me.

** Well, quite. But where does an AU stop being fanfiction? It's about more than just names, it's about having recognisable elements of canon regardless of what they are called. But people will post their stories where they have an audience, and there isn't much of an audience for amateur original fiction.

We can always choose not to read. it's not worth losing sleep over.

** for me its the combination of the factors you mentioned, no or different kind of magic is okay, new characters are okay too but both together are not hp fanfiction

** I honestly don't care as long as the fic is entertaining to read.

Creative fics without magic are far more preferable to me than reading the mandatory Graveyard Resurrection Scheme ad nauseam.

AUs and Crossovers exist. So ... not sure what the problem is here.

** I always try to keep at least over 50 percent of recognizable canon stuff, from magic to characters to locations, while still adding in my own original stuff where it's necessary to tell the story I want to. :) Yes even my total AU has like 30 percent canon stuff in it. :)

** There was a fic I read I forget the name of it but it stopped being a Harry Potter fanfic when Hermione, Harry, Sirius, Ginny and the twins went to a carribran island and became pirates... the story stopped having anything to do with the regular plot and devolved into a crazy shit show.

*** Well, if it's an AU that tells a story about how those characters would act in that situation (or even just a crackfic), why should it adhere to canon? It would be weirder if for example the triwizard tournament took place on a carribean island just so that canon station could be checked off.

If they went away from the canon setting, stopped using magic, behaved completely different from their canon counterparts, changed their names and never talked about their past again, then I agree, there's not really a reason for it to be called a Harry Potter fic. At that point it's basically original fiction with characters that vaguely resemble the HP cast in looks only.
