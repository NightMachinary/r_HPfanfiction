Uh so I'm looking for a good fanfic involving Theodore Nott, I know that there is some ravenclaw Theo fics out there but I'd prefer slytherin. Like something with goes into his home life. Would anyone have any good recommendations?


** Theo becomes a significant character in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24476011][Six Pomegranate Seeds]]. Takes a little while (OWLs forward) but then we see a lot of him, this continues on in the sequel.

*** This link seems to link a very different story called ouroboros. I believe this is the correct version for Six Pomegranate Seeds, but I haven't read the story. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847/chapters/18163144]]

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.
