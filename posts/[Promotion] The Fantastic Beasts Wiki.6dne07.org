Unlike, say, the /Harry Potter Wiki/, [[http://hp-fantastic-beasts.wikia.com][this wiki]] is a work of pure fanon. I'm alone on it at the moment, but others are welcome to join in. The idea is to expand the /Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them/ book into a more believable encyclopedia, with Latin names and biological notes for all species, precise behavior, and a developped history. This includes no contradiction with the canon books (and ideally with Pottermore) but allows you to add a lot of details, or even create new beasts altogether. So far I have created pages for:

- Puffskeins
- Dementors
- Banshees
- Onyros (reimagined as an Asian relative of Banshees and Dementors)
- Common Phoenixes
- Eagle Phoenixes (imagined relative of the canon Phoenix, looking like their film counterparts)
- Vampyrs


** Interesting. Make sure you clearly state on the main page that the wiki includes fanon elements, just to avoid any confusion down the road.

Concerning common phoenixes - have you come up with any ideas for species of them? That sounds like a cool idea as long as it doesn't detract too much from the implied mysticism of the phoenix from canon.

*** 'Common Phoenixes' /is/ a species (namely, the Phoenixes seen in canon: those with long necks, a swan-like shape, and immortality). "Phoenixes" are the larger group, which also includes Eagle Phoenixes, Augureys and Thunderbirds.

** I love this idea.

I created some new magical creatures for the fic I'm working on at the moment, so I'll make pages for them.
