Royal road is a platform for writers to publish their work, find support and advice.

It has a clean and modern look and an very active community.

In contrast to other platforms royal road understands itself as a place to support writers in starting a career in writing. Therefore it is less aimed at fanfiction and more on original, but still has its own under category for fanfiction.

The review system is vastly superior to ffn, you can only once review a story, but comment each chapter. Additionally how detailed you review is determines how much it is weighed. The system is 5star based and therefore reviews really reflect the quality of the story and not only the Popularity.

The search system is more barebones with relatively few tags, but still better than ffn.net.

I really like this side and have read most of the popular stories. As I have seen more and more fanfic pop up over there I thought it nice to start a discussion.

** Interesting. I took a look at the site and read through the TOS. Doesn't seem to be too restrictive WRT type of content, just no infringement. Will have to delve deeper.

** I've been reading stories on RRL for a while now, mostly thanks to the Litrpg community. I don't read fanfictions there though, I prefer ff.net or AO3. I don't like the search/tags/bookmark/favorite because it's really too vague, and I also dislike the review system. Not many people take the time to write long review on RRL and thus stories ratings can be judged on just a few fans. I use RRL for reading original works and will continue to do so though. It's a good plateform for authors who want to start a career in writing.

*** Yes the bookmark/favourite/whatever function is really cluttered and reduntand. Most needed cleanup on that site. I just can't figure out how to bookmark nowadays.

**** I wish you could create some kind of personal lists or at least rename what you get as default. It would be great if it gave you more details as well, like basic information on the story and when it was last updated. Right now keeping tracks on what you're reading on RRL itself is annoying :/ I read great stories on the website and it helped several authors to publish their own books, so it's a shame that basic things like this aren't up to date.

*** I don't say the system is perfect, but it is way better than the kudos/review number system. Bad reviews shouldn't count towards an positive you look for.

**** I personally like the kudos system and usually filter stories by it. I don't like writing reviews for personal reasons, so for me kudos is like a thumbs up on YT. "I really liked your story" basically. I agree that bad reviews shouldn't count towards a positive since the system doesn't tell you how many good reviews a story received compared to bad ones, but the alternatives like kudos/favourites work fine for me.

***** Well you can just give a five star, no need to write something, it will count not as much as a written review, but you can leave just with the stars

** Mm, I did see it once, one of those 'X character wakes up as a dungeon and starts building themselves' stories. The site's decent enough on mobile.

*** Yes the community is a little bit entrenched in certain types of stories, but I feel like that has softened up a lot over the last years.

** I was on royal road a couple of years ago. It was great. I used it pretty much everyday. The only reason I stopped was because I had temporarily exhausted literally all of the fics I was willing to read. It should have some new fics now though so I'll try to get back into it.

** A great website that needs more of a mobile presence. I recommend it if you don't mind reading on a desktop or laptop PC.
