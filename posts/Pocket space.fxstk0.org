*** While I like that story I don't think/remember that Harry uses a "pocket reality/dimension" to store/handle things like the OP was looking for....of course I could be wrong as I haven't read it in a while. 😁

** The ones I instantly thought of are both time travel. The first is about 13K words and is abandoned. The 2nd is complete and ~102K words. Shall We Try That Again Harry uses a "pocket reality" to store stuff in. In 260 Going....Harry has an entire "pocket dimension" that he uses.

** Fairy Tale by Araceil. linkffn(9596404)

Yes, this is a cross-over, but I had never heard of Fairy Tale before I read it, and still have not read any Fairy Tale, and the story still makes sense without that knowledge.
