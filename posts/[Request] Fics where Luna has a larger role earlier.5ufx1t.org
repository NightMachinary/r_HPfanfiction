Basically any fic where Harry meets Luna before fifth year and she becomes a main character. Any time during second, third, or fourth year, really. Can be for whatever reason- different sorting, changing electives, whatever. Pairing fics are fine, but fics don't have to pair Luna with anybody to be recommended.

** Harry slinked into the great hall at 6:03AM that day. He hoped to avoid overhearing students whispering about him being a dark wizard today. Well, he at least hoped to make it through breakfast in peace. Just as he was about to sit down he noticed that he was not alone.

Seated at the Ravenclaw table was a slight girl with blonde hair that was working on her breakfast with a Dursley-like passion. He could see why. Her plate wasn't even visible underneath the massive cinnamon pastry. He couldn't ever remember seeing a larger roll, or a person eating sweets so early in the morning. Dudley rarely saw the early side of 10 if he could help it.

Apparently drawn in by the sight Harry found himself sitting across from the small girl and her giant breakfast. She was wearing odd earrings and had a bottle cap necklace. Harry was in the midst of wondering if this was typical attire in the magical world when she interrupted his thoughts.

"Hello Harry Potter. Are you a narglemouth too?"

"Um. Maybe. What's a narglemouth?"

"That's a silly question. Narglemouths speak nargletongue. It's the language of nargles. So can you speak nargletongue?"

"Hmm. I don't rightly know. What does a nargle look like?"

"Haven't you read any books? Nargles are mostly invisible, but they can look like anything if they want to."

"Oh, well do they look like snakes sometimes? If they do, then yes. I am a narglemouth, but only when they look like snakes."

"Hm, just what I thought. Another conditional narglemouth. I'm sorry be the one to say this, but you're nothing special Harry Potter."

Harry grinned, his mood just a bit brighter than before. Maybe he'd gained one friend from this mess.

``

Sorry, couldn't resist the pun.
