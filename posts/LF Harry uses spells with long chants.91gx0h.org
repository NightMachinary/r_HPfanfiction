Things to the level of Megumin's Explosion. To the level of;

Darkness blacker than black and darker than dark, I beseech thee, combine with my deep crimson.

The time of awakening cometh.

Justice, fallen upon the infallible boundary, appear now as an intangible distortion!

Dance, Dance, Dance!

I desire for my torrent of power a destructive force: a destructive force without equal! Return all creation to cinders, and come from the abyss!

This is the mightiest means of attack known to man, the ultimate attack magic!

*/EXPLOSION!/*

Or the Dragon Slave... Or things to that level of "If i get this off I win, but you could totally kill me whilst I'm casting" actively and ridiculously overpowered Spells but with such long chants that Voldemort could actively wait til right toward the end of the spell before casting Avada Kedavra to balance them out


** Has to be linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane).

Great Mentor Dumbledore, awesome magic, amazing world building, and long chant to call on the power of the gods and nature. You should read it anyways, it's a great fic.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

** There's some chants in linkffn(6995114), it's not Harry Potter magic but borrowed from Fate/Stay Night though.

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

** I remember a fic in which some of the most powerful spells were basically a prayer for help from a certain god/goddess. I think it was Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse but it heavily suffers from the "11 year olds talk like 50 year olds" syndrome. If that doesn't bother you i'd recommend it, it's a very cool concept imo even if it isn't finished and hasn't been updated in a while.

*** As long as it doesn't suffer from Fanfiction's "Hermione is our God, so we write her as literally perfect, and her flaws are cute not flaws fuck off" syndrome, or Tropeygreengrass, then it doesn't bother me. Is it any good?

**** The first time i read it when i was starting fanfiction i really enjoyed it. I don't remember off-hand how Hermione was portrayed. I don't think Daphne is featured very prominently. It's a very cool concept based on the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse. 2 books are finished and the 3rd one was started. Unfortunately the chants aren't a very prominent part, only used sometimes. I also absolutely love the end of the 1st book, it was really good.

** Of my own creation, based on the Red Lantern Oath, for a Patronus variant based on anger, rage, and desperation:

--------------

The crimson mist of my final breath's plea -

Let it rise and strike down the death that would take me...

My Anger unchained, I shatter its cage

My fires unbound strike down with my Rage!

Expecto Vindicum!

** in linkffn(11157943) Harry uses a long chant to call upon destructive chariots of fire and meteors of flames to destroy a whole army of droids.

In one of my own fics that I have had to take down because criticism made me rethink my writing, Gellert Grindelwald uses old german folklore/tales to call upon a spirit, who is gunning for Gellerts head.

I shall link the fanfiction once its online again.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
