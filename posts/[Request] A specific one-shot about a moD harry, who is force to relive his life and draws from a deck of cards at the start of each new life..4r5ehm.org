I also remember Hermione crying over Harry's death bed, then Harry waking up under the stairs as a child. He finds the deck and draws a card the is/implies the use of Death Dolls will be his gimmick for his incarnation. He fakes his own death, frames the Dursley's and we get a couple of snap shots of his fight with Voldemort before Harry dies again and repeats the process with a new card.
