I remember a fic (standard Harry rebels and shouts at things after his name comes out of the Goblet fic, which is why I'm not bothering to link it) where the apparent consequence for breaking a contract is that you can't ever make another. No house rentals, no mortgages, no marriage contracts, no employment or employing, etc etc.

I had an idea that it could be an inspiration for the concept of Karma, where you breaking the contract causes an appropriate threefold-return-esque punishment for you. I'm sure it's been done before, but it has interesting implications, I think. A dash of divination and a soupcon of analysis and you could have the Goblins providing predictor services for breaking contracts. "If you don't marry this woman, you'll... end up frying your left foot for food after a troll tribe ambushes your trade caravan and forces you to retreat into the mountains, where you'll play cat and mouse games with them for three days before a passing Frenchman offers you rescue for your final selkie matchstick." etc.

Are there any other interesting consequences for breaking a contract that aren't just 'you lose your magic'?


** I imagine much depends on whether it is a repudiatory breach of contract or not.

If it is a repudiatory breach of contract, the innocent party likely has the right to accept your repudiation and immediately terminate your life. Past contractual obligations would remain in place, but following your instantaneous demise, no further obligations would accrue.

On the other hand, if it is not a repudiatory breach (i.e. one that does not substantially deprive you of the benefit of the contract), then the innocent party's only remedy likely resides in the Damages Curse. Notably, the contract would remain in force.

Now, the tricky thing is knowing the difference between repudiatory and non-repudiatory breach of magical contract. You see, if it's a non-repudiatory breach but you mistakenly identify it as a repudiation and purport to accept that repudiation, you have in fact committed a repudiatory breach yourself. In that situation, it is in fact you who will be terminated.

*** Nice legal jargon. :)

I like the idea of it being as complex and arguable as modern law is. A person having to 'appeal' to Magic (or a Court) and actually having a possibility of ameliorating or even eliminating entirely the contractual punishments does sound like an interesting plotpoint - for a one-shot, at least. Maybe that's where the Faerie Courts arose from, to keep up Rowling's integration of mythology into her world. Extra-dimensional, sociopathic adjudicators who judge Contracts without bias, without any interest in the 'spirit' of an agreement, only the letter. Put a fun spin on that 'Harry rebels against the Goblet of Fire' trope.

So, to follow your first point on repudiation, your death would be the consequence for the breach or deprivation, and the obligation to continue the contract would pass on to someone else? You could hardly maintain your obligations in death, and IIRC the Rowling-Magical Brits are implied to be against Necromancy.

** Even though the DA parchment wasn't technically a contract, you can probably charm an actual contract similarly. So it could likely cast on the breakers any low to medium strength hex or curse, and perhaps even a high powered one if you're strong enough.

I would expect Voldy to be able to make a crucio-contract. Maybe a mortgage contract could ward your home against you. Employment contract could simply alert your boss if you slack off, or the ministry if the boss breaks labor laws.

Of course, there's no way to be sure that the punishment trigger is actually set according to the contract stipulations - you have to trust whoever cast the charm. Just like the DA parchment didn't have any stipulations written on it, and the goblet didn't actually require consent. So there is plenty room for abuse - probably why magical contracts aren't more popular.

I wouldn't expect there to be some other kind of magical contracts - besides enchanted objects that cast specific magic upon some trigger. After all, the HP magic in general behaves like a tool - it doesn't care about justice and fairness.

*** Heh. I like your last point about Rowling-Magic being a tool, but contracts don't necessarily have to be fair. Only perceived as such enough for both to sign them. We click Terms and Conditions agreements all the time, right? Could be signing ourselves up to anything.

So, would you say that it's limited to "If you break the contract, then a spell will be cast on you?" only? Just a charm or a curse or whatever to punish you afterward?

Rather the opposite. I don't think it would be limited in the ways we expect a contract to be. I expect you could use most whatever trigger you want, and cause most whatever effect you want, if you're powerful enough.

Some examples from canon:

- If you tell about the DA, you get 'SNITCH' in pimples on your face
- If your name comes out of the goblet (regardless of whether you put it in), you have to participate in the Triwizard (we never learned the penalty)
- If you say 'Voldemort', your location is announced to the death eaters, and (weak) protections around you are cancelled.

But considering how broad these triggers and consequences are, it seems with enough magic you can do most anything that you can do with spells. I assume it would be much harder than to do it directly with spells, though.

In all three examples, consent from both parties was not required - just a person or object powerful enough to unilaterally enforce them. Of course, you can probably modify the spell to only take effect if both parties have agreed. But you don't have to - so if you want security, you would need to get a trusted neutral enchanter to enchant the contract.

** Well my headcanon is that most contracts are just ink and paper but the foundational treaty's and such like the DA paper have consequences for breaking them determined by 1 the punishments dictated in the contract 2 the age of the contract so for example if the da contract was left unbroken for 50 years the consequence would be harder to destroy or remove 3 the power that was placed into it at time of conception and 4 the amount of times its been broken for example the first time would be more severe than the fourth

*** I like the idea of the power of contracts building more over time. Like the fanon ideas around wards, or the canon of the Grimmauld protections.

So, you'd say that a consequence of contract violation could be anything, it just has to be agreed to first?

** I've never been a fan of the whole "lose magic" thing. It's just so incongruent, and I don't know if JKR really thought that through beyond one line by Fudge. The way I rationalize it away is that the Goblet of Fire was created by some dark lord in the ancient past, and the punishment for breaking its contract is unknown. People just made up the worst things they could think of for it.

One fic I read had secrecy contracts where violating it meant you'd lose access to the secret, and be told that you just lost it to contextualize the hole in your memory.

An idea of mine was a subversion of the whole "on my magic" thing where random characters swore oaths that came back to bite them, and a magic loss usually also led to a life loss because magic is of the soul. Basically people brutally metaphysically mutilating themselves because they're idiots.

Another fic I read had contracts that would slowly cause pressure in your head if you kept violating them, with the eventual consequence of your head exploding. It was wild, and exactly the kind of whacky shit that fits into the wizarding world.

*** I mean, yeah, I kinda get that. I don't know about incongruent, but I think it'd be a little more of an exclusive punishment for a society built around magic and magic use. Like that fic (forging a sword, I think?) that has Harry and Ron argue about using magical vows to keep violence down despite them taking bits of magical power away from people. It would likely be way more of a cultural stigma, especially since that whole 'muggleborns are stealing magic' thing (though I can't remember if that's fanon or canon).

I don't think I want to believe they'd be quite so stupid to tie their children to an object they don't know the effect of, but it's possible. Rowling-Magicals do seem very stupid.

I mean, if you take away the certain-death, this is one of my favourite approaches to villains. It's the one 'Tom Riddle was less of a Villain than Voldemort' thing that I can kind of get behind - him creating a Horcrux by accident initially and then becoming so absorbed by fear and insanity that he made more and cracked himself further until he became the fundamentally incompetent and insane grandstander we saw in the books/movies.

So, yes. Can definitely see that happening. If there were psychological effects instead of just death, that could make for a fun fic where the Rowling-Magical World just goes more and more mad as time goes on due to their usage of Contract Magics.
