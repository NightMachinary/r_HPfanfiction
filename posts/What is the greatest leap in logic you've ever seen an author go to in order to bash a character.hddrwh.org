** Bashing Neville because he is good at herbology, so obviously, he /must/ be good at potions, and he's just lazy and bluffing. As a result, Snape is justified in his treatment of him. It's a really strange sort of thing, bashing Neville, I just didn't know it could go hand-in-hand with Snape glorification. Well, the more you know.

******* Writing sex scenes with Luna would be quite the challenge. I can see her being oblivious to many of the rules governing human behaviour in this sphere, but because she's a fundamentally decent person, it would be in a way that doesn't quite creep people out.

Saying that, in practice I wouldn't' know where to even begin writing that.

Honestly, while personally I don't think I would try, one approach might be to make her understanding of the norms be whatever the norms are in 2020. Since I imagine most fics are set in the range from the late-90s--early 2010s, you could make the other characters think she's a tad off, but play it off as the prudishness of the past.

That said, it still seems hard either way.

******* Eh, I prefer thinking them as metaphors. the Fudge one is basically saying Fudge is biased towards Goblins and prejudiced and stuff.

The Rufus Scrimageour is saying that he's cold and uncaring etc., though I see it as a possibility that Luna's actually right but let's not stay on that topic.

Then I think Luna is trying to say either that the Auror office/department is corrupted or trying to bring down the ministry down through the inside.

The other Fudge one though... that's definitely bluffing I can't figure anything out of that one.

And I'm honestly not surprised if the Quidditch one end up being true, I mean at that time the entire Wizarding world is pretty much corrupted by DEs and Voldy's sympathisers.

As for the Sirius Black one... Maybe it's her way of saying that Sirius is famous and is actually hiding literally in plain sight?

  "Hi," he said. "Shall we get going then?"

  "Oh yes," she said happily. "Where is the party?"

  "Slughorn's office," said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. "Did you hear, there's supposed to be a vampire coming?"

  "Rufus Scrimgeour?" asked Luna.

  "I - what?" said Harry, disconcerted. "You mean the Minister of Magic?"

  "Yes, he's a vampire," said Luna matter-of-factly. "Father wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry. Obviously, they didn't want the truth to get out!"

Or later this

#+begin_quote
  "I don't think you should be an Auror, Harry," said Luna unex pectedly. Everybody looked at her. "The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They're planning to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a combination of Dark Magic and gum disease."

*** I think Neville could actually be really good at potions if Snape wasn't his teacher. He probably knows all of the theoretical stuff and what each plant does when combined with another ingredient. The only thing he'd really have to learn, realistically, is what the other non-plant stuff does. I'm pretty sure he's capable of reading.

Also, even if Neville was lazy, Snape's a dirty petty-ass motherfucking bully who probably picks on him because he's the other child of the prophecy, and if he had been attacked instead, Lily probably (most likely wouldn't have, though) survived.

I'm very confused to why so many people seem not to understand Neville failing at Potions when it's made painfully obvious it's all his awful teacher's fault.

Like here on OOTP when Harry dpes a better job because of Snape's absence and notices Neville seems to do the very same

"The afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected it to be. With Snape absent from the proceedings, he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions. Neville, who was sitting very near Harry, also looked happier than Harry had ever seen him during a Potions class. "

Not that this excuses Snape's behvior in the slightest.

But I also assumed it was the same for Hermione, in their third year her boggart takes the form of McGonnagal telling her she failed her exams. Yes, Hermione cares about exams and grades but I also assumed it was a representation for how Hermione felt compelled to prove herself in a world which looked down on muggleborns.

Same with Lupin's boggart being the moon, he's not scared of the moon but of what the moon represents - his loss of control and lycanthropy.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny!

** One that's always stuck with me is a story where Hermione is a homophobe and an evangelical Christian. That's right, Hermione Granger, queen of logic and demander of equality, believes in a literal interpretation of the Bible and is bigoted about people's sexuality. Because of course all muggles are homophobic in 1991 but the Wizard world has always had gay marriage since the year dot.

Molly Weasely doesn't really care about the twins. The authors evidence? A rather bizarre scene where ahe couldn't remember what foods Fred liked that George didn't and vice versa and kept serving George onions when he didn't like them. This was enough for the twins to move out and try to get Arthur to divorce her. Probably based on that one time in canon where George pretends to be Fred and says "honestly woman, call yourself our mother?"

Any of the Ron is being paid to be Harry's friend and Ginny is love potioning him so she can kill him and get the Potters fortune, all based on the fact that Mrs Weasley asked which platform it was /which is a really well known parenting trick to involve the younger ones - of course she knew which platform it was, she was giving Ginny a chance to show off her knowledge and feel involved./

Any WBWL fic that has Lily and James living, but abandoning Harry to Petunia anyway because he's not as "interesting" or as "powerful" as his twin who they think is the BWL. As if Lily "mother's love" Potter would ever behave like that.

It's such a potent fear that it makes her(the same Molly that f***** Bellatrix up) unable to even banish a Boggart. Don't get me wrong, i've never been a big fan of Molly. She was too over bearing, and stubborn, and the way she treated Sirius in his own house was a little uncalled for in my opinion, but she is a mother to several children.

I know there was a part where Dumbledore made attending Hogwarts forceful, and held students hostage over holidays to get parents to swear an oath declaring their loyalty to him, and it was only breakable by death.

Harry also had Bellatrix and a Lestrange twin adopt him, kind of.

Hermione is an idiot lackey who gets a harsh punishment.

Dumbledore was doing this all for his dead lover Grindelwald.

#+end_quote

Was he? He was a nice kid in school with a sense of fair play. The idea of him as the unwavering paragon of Hufflepuff virtues is pure fanon.

Ron becoming a Death Eater is much less believable than Cedric, because Ron has a big family, whom he is very close to, that is staunchly anti-Death Eater. Either of them could go dark, but Ron would never follow Voldemort. And Ron the Death Eater is usually even worse, since it usually just sort of happens overnight. For either of them to go dark, it would take years... which it does for Cedric, in the alternate timeline. The humiliation was just the initial catalyst

****** Then I retract my statement of him being the embodiment of Hufflepuff. But I will say that he has many of the traits that make him a commendable one. As you stated: He played fair.

I'd say he's also loyal. When the 'Potter Stinks' badges were made during the Tri Wizard tournement he told his friends to not wear them. Now you could argue that it was fair play to not humiliate Harry, but it's stronger to say that he supported Harry even when nobody (himself included, to a point) believed that Harry hadn't entered his name into the Goblet of Fire.

We know he's honest, though a better word would be modest, about how he views his achievements. Cedric's father tends to play up his son's achievements (e.x. Hufflepuff vs Gryffindor game), but Cedric, because he's fair and honest, admitted that it was a moot victory. Now, I say modesty as a synonym for honestly here because I really mean honestly in a moral or virtuous way rather than truthful (which is how honestly is often and rightfully defined lol).

Now was he the embodiment? I don't know. Again, my wording was terrible and people are complicated. He probably had flaws that made him un-Hufflepuff like and, if I've failed to notice them, I'm sorry.

You are correct in saying that the humiliation is the catalyst for Cedric becoming a Death Eater in that timeline. You are also correct in assuming that small events (such as his humiliation) can lead people astray and cause them to preform irrationally.

However, the reason I find Cedric becoming a Death Eater ridiculous is because: Why would he ever feel so humiliated? I haven't read the Cursed Child (so please inform me if I'm wrong), but from what I understand Cedric was humiliated because he didn't win the tournament.

Cedric valued was fair play so if someone else had won (and I'm assuming this was Harry in this AU?) why would he be humiliated if someone one won fair and square? Maybe he's humiliated that he couldn't meet everyone's expectations though? Perhaps, but it seems like an easy choke out for a character who has been established as having this as such an important character value. I'm not saying it couldn't happen in real life, but I'm saying that it doesn't make sense for his character.

Cedric was loyal to a fault. He may have been ambitious in wanting to win the tournament, but we know he supported Harry. And unlike some of the other characters in the books, Cedric is kind and sincere in his words. I may be wrong, but I believe that Cedric did actually want Harry to do well. Maybe not so much that he'd let Harry win, but enough that he wouldn't be surprised or devastated if he lost. He might be upset that he didn't win, but humiliated seems a little far. We don't see him interact with Fleur or Krum much, but I imagine the sentiments are the same.

As for modesty, Cedric would have underplayed his skills on the tournament if he did win. Not because he's humble bragging, but cause he truely believes that anyone in his position could've done it. Yes, the tournament was important to him. Yes, he wanted to win. But would he put winning above all else? Would losing be the thing that breaks him? I don't think so. And I say this because winning (or I suppose more tightly, the value of ambition) wasn't everything to him. He wanted to be grounded so that he was friendly and popular. He valued playing fairly. He supported people who didn't have it. None of these values would absolutely prevent someone from turning sides. However, it's these values that make it hard for me to believe that he would be humiliated to a point that he'd abandon everything that he is. It could happen, but it would be selling such an amazing character short (if, for example, it was in the main books).

Also I admit to having a bias. Cedric isn't my favourite character. I am a Hufflepuff though. I don't want to argue though, I want to have a discussion. I still think your thoughts are valid and I'd love to have more HP conversations with you if you're willing? DM me if you're down.

Also, I will admit that I can be wrong. I seek to learn more about HP... There's not enough canon :'(

P.S. to the OP of this post, this conversation has gone really off topic XD

Ah, no. Albus and Scorpius go back with the aim of keeping him alive, so their plan is to make him lose the tournament so he doesn't go along to the graveyard. But their way of doing this is to sabotage him in the first two tasks, so he loses lots of points and doesn't have a chance in the maze.

So in the first task they disarm him just as he faces the dragon, which looks to everyone else like he just fumbled his wand and dropped it. Then in the second task they massively inflate his bubble-head charm so he's stuck floating on the water. He doesn't just lose, he fails spectacularly and looks like a total klutz. Of course Cedric knows that someone sabotaged him, but no one else notices, so it seems like he's making up lame excuses.

Cedric is a good person and has many Hufflepuff virtues, definitely, but he's still just a normal kid. He's been successful and popular his whole life - the Golden Boy - and now, after being chosen as the most worthy student in Hogwarts, he's made to look like a complete idiot in the most public way imaginable. Not just the students at school, but the whole of Wizarding Britain now see him as a laughingstock. We know how cruel the kids at Hogwarts can be with teasing, especially when they think someone has let down the side. Even the Hufflepuffs aren't going to stick close, because he's just confirmed all the worst stereotypes about them. And then he's also going to lose his chances at getting the sort of job he deserves, since every employer knows how much of a screw-up he is.

Everything he built his life around comes crashing down; it's not his fault, but no one else believes him, and he doesn't even know who sabotaged him or why. Anyone in that situation would easily become intensely frustrated and resentful, and probably start being angry at the world. He's going to feel suddenly alone, where once he had a great support network. That makes him a prime target for radicalisation.

The time travel in Cursed Child is all about the butterfly effect. What seem like small changes in the past cause large and unexpected changes in the present. Cedric is one of those. He doesn't become a Death Eater during the events of the alternate GoF, nor is it inevitable that being humiliated will make him one, but the sabotage by Albus and Scorpius puts him on that path. I don't think that's unbelievable.

******** After reading your points, I actually agree with a lot of what you're saying. Someone (even as kind-hearted and morally cemented as Cedric) could become follower of Voldemort under those circumstances. And if the point was to show the butterfly effect then that would certainly do this. Thank you for breaking it down for me.

I think the reason many readers and I don't like this plot point is because it changes such a heartfelt arc drastically. He becomes humiliated, which starts a drastic change in his character and actions, but we don't get to see this. The point, as you said, is to show the butterfly effect. But because we don't get to watch him become a Death Eater, we feel cheated as readers. Even if it's realistic that Cedric could become this way, it completely dismisses everything he was during the Goblet of Fire. That's why so many people hate this arc in the Cursed Child. I'm not a writer so I could be wrong in this argument. As a reader, though, it feels like Rowling did Cedric dirty in order to show the butterfly effect.

It's likely that was Rowling's intention. And even though it makes sense plot, theme, and character motivation wise, it completely messes up a previously well-done character arc. Again, that's an opinion not an argument. I'm not a good writer nor am I adept at analysis.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts though, I find your analysis very well done.

Also Dumbledore at minimum knows that there are horcruxes in book 2 where he all but explains that Harry is one and could also be less justifiably said that he knew back when the potters were attacked from his explanation to McGonagall and the fact that hagrid tells Harry that he and Dumbledore don't believe Voldemort is really dead in book one.

Also no one on the Dark Side to prevent Dumbledore from just roflstomping them in battles.

And to bring him back they would need to do that ritual again and it's implied the part we saw was just the conclusion.

**** I've just posted about the homophobic Hermione trope and how odd it is. Firstly, she's too logical to be fundamenally religious (which some of these make her), or even to judge people on something as innocuous as being gay. Hermione has two main traits - logic, and a belief in equality and fairness. Secondly, the wizarding world clearly is not down with the gays, Dumbledore and Grindelwald having their relationship sort of secretly even before Gellert turned into a dark lord and Albus then living a life as an unfulfilled bachelor for a hundred years shows that the wizarding world has is not built on a history of LGBT rights.

Mpreg is one of the most bizarre tropes I've ever come across. Like, I mean, men can give birth because trans men are men and if it was being done to further a trans equality point - that having a uterus doesn't make you a woman, I could accept it. It would be an interesting way to get people to think about the relationship our bodies have with our gender. But it's always, and I literally mean always, done because Draco luuuuuurves Harry, but Harry is worried that Draco needs an heir because he's sooooooo rich and important. But silly Harry, didn't you realise that in the magical world men can be bearers of children? But of course they're both still men. Big ol' manly men. It also usually has a scene graphically describing how Harry gives birth. Out of his arse. No one can rectally beget a child and even though magic may make it possible, it absolutely does not mean you should.

***** I like the fact that Hermione can be religious despite being logical and intelligent. It really shows that those two things don't correlate, you tcan be religious and be logical. Your raised with a belief which is hard to break especially If it's been constantly shoved down your throat your whole life. With Hermione's trust in authority figures, I could see her being religious.

I just don't see how Hermione can be religious and then attend Hogwarts as a witch with out having a major breakdown/crisis where her parents get all uppity and bring up the devil and the lot.

Just to put this out there I myself am not religious as it seems absurd to me but I definitely see why people do still believe in their gods, life is hard, it's nice to know theirs a happy ending at the end of the tunnel.

I guarantee however that if you introduced religion to a child at 18, they would not believe in it, it relies on an impressionable mind aka the mind of a child that is oh so trusting. Though some will say oh but you can't prove there's no god well you can't prove there's not invisible unicorns flying through the sky doesn't mean it's true. It is more likely that it is not true if your a grounded individual with know prior I say this lightly ‚Äúbrainwashing‚Äù the you would know that just because you can't prove somethings not there doesn't mean it is there, as if you did have the opposite line of thought life would be pretty fucking weird, that is if you kept that line of though constant and not just made an exception for religion.

This was basically the premise of the fic, her and her parents both believed that she was off to some sort of "devil school" and her parents wanted her to convert people away from magic. And that just wasn't realistic, any couple who are that religious wouldn't let their child attend magic school no matter how many coffee tables McGonagall turned into pigs to prove magic existed.

I don't think religion is at odds with the magical world Rowling created at all - they celebrate Christmas at Hogwarts and it's fair to assume there are students of other religious backgrounds there as well. But I think believing in a religion so literally that you judge other people's sexuality is absolutely at odds with Hermione's personality. She's not just logical, she's a huge believer in equality. Plus she's smart enough to think "hmm, Bible was wrong about magic, maybe it's also wrong about sexuality."

You know what I'm actually curious about the religious diversity of Hogwarts, for a book series about coming of age and a magical adventure, the books are very POV and we know so little because Harry never really learnt or bothered to ask. I think that's where the frustration of Harry's character comes from, we're for the most part reading from Harry's POV, so the lack of information, world building and depth to the world of Harry Potter is Harry's ignorance as much as our own.

  She brandished the sheaf of parchment at them.

  ‚ÄúI've been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf enslavement goes back centuries. I can't believe no one's done anything about it before now.‚Äù
#+end_quote

And like, even /if/ it was true that canonically they need a bond (which it isn't!), the treatment of house-elves is still abhorrent. Four house-elves have a name in canon

- Winky\\
- Dobby\\
- Kreacher\\
- Hokey (the house-elf of the previous owner of the hufflepuff cup)

Out of those four, two hated their masters so badly that they betrayed them. Both were physically abused. Winky was forced to do things she hated (being in the Quidditch stands high up) with no say about it, was thrown out unjustly and rendered homeless. And the last one (Hokey) was unjustly framed for murder.

All the house-elves we know the names of are severely mistreated. If you were to treat a dog like the Malfoys treated Dobby, everyone would be up in arms.

But with house-elfs it's /they like it./

And Hermione is stupid because she doesn't like the slavery going on in the books. Haha how dumb is that book character that she doesn't know the rules of fanon hahaha

The house-elf / spew stuff has been the reason I've dropped multiple fanfictions.

**** The canon behavior towards house elves is absolutely terrible, your right. You're also correct that that the fanon "need the bond to live" is a cop out but when writing a fic you really only have 4 choices and none of them are great. You can take the canon route and have almost everyone just condone slavery. You can take the canon route and have to dedicate an enormous amount of time towards a side story with no overarching point towards the main story to avoid condoning slavery. You can take the fanon route which is messing with canon a bit but makes it an easy one off cop out and ignore. Finally, you can just not mention house elves at all. But that leads to have to f up canon anyway because unless you mess with canon politics the muggle protection act will pass, Mr Weasley will raid Malfoy manor, Malfoy will try to get revenge by placing a cursed diary in Ginny's hands and Dobby will try to 'help' Potter. No action canon Potter could take in the one year he knows about the magical world would provent these events.so canon is out the window regardless.

****** Or you just point out that elves have been enslaved and brainwashed for so many centuries that they fear being free, they hate the idea of being paid even more than anything else. Dobby is exceptional in that. We saw that Winky feel in deep depression and alcoholism when she is sacked and feels she feels.

An elfe without a bond might not die because of the lack of bond, literally, but going by Winky's behavior and how Hogwarts Elves reaction to Dobby, it seems that they'd go deep in depression brought by shame for their freedom.

And as well-meaning as Hermione is, she is way too forceful about it, especially toward the elves. It would need years even decades, and a whole generation or two of elves for them to accept the freedom offered and to undo the centeries of brainwashing that have been done to them.

You can point that out, mentions that they working on it more or less behind the same, have people treat Elves like they would an employee (with respect, like equals, without overworking them, no punishment etc etc), convince little by little the elves that they should be treated with respect at first.

**** The problem with House Elves is that most really like their position. Even the ones you used as example (which are, I hope, the worst extremes unless Hogwarts is a model of good treatments toward them) were more angry toward their personal situation rather than the one of Houses Elves in general :

- Kreacher loves being an House Elves, he just disliked serving Blood Traitors, Half Blood and Mudbloods. Give him to the Malfoys or the Lestrange and he would have loved his life.
- Dobby hated the Malfoy, but still wanted to work, and even had to bargain with Dumbledore to reduce his salary and days off.
- Winky, will disliking some of his Master demands, still loved serving him and kept her loyalty even after her dismissal.
- Hokey had no complain before the murder accusations

My point is that, while I agree with Hermione sentiment that slavery is bad, I believe the actions she took with SPEW were just bad. As an example, the clothes she sew and put everywhere in the Gryffindor tower just made their Common House a place where no House Elf was willing to go outside of Dobby. And that's without mentioning the fact that these Elves serve Hogwarts, not its students, meaning that the action was useless since only Dumbledore (as the Headmaster) would have the power to dismiss them (and would probably be more than willing to let them go, should any make the demand).\\
I'm also pretty sure that should Hermione demands be met (all the House Elves are free to leave the House they serve at any time if they want, and they have to be paid), most House Elves would just end up unemployed and be in a situation worse than before.

Anyways, I agree with Hermione sentiment, not with the actions she took to correct the situation. But bashing her for that (as seen in some fanfics) is pushing it a little, her caracter is supposed to just be a teen, and that's the kind of actions teenagers do (wanting to fix the world and everything).

We're literally not given enough information on house-elves to determine why they're bound or anything like that. Like why does giving them clothes free them, why are they compelled to not betray their masters etc. They're a subplot in Goblet of Fire and are pretty much forgotten otherwise.

I agree Hermione is young, but her activism consisted of browbeating people into joining SPEW and trying to free house-elves without their knowledge (which really shouldn't work...) Hermione doesn't deserve to be bashed for caring about the house elves issue. I'm just miffed because she could have gotten some character development finding a successful solution rather than dropping the issue.

Otherwise, I don't think anyone would appreciate being told how much someone knows about them from books, whether fact or fiction. It just seems wrong, as if instead of talking to the person you just read some books and now you know about them. The problem with House Elves it is just is widely conjecture. We have three house elves really portrayed in canon, which have bad lives. We don't know anything about them really. So I can see it being a symbiotic relationship of sorts, but Hermione with a normal upbringing thinking it's slavery. To be fair, there is a basis for bashing of the three.

No. She's portrayed as /substantially more/ socially inept than Harry.

I really think some people don't remember cannon. At the age of 11, when a teacher asked another student a question and the teacher gave the student a few moments to answer the question, Hermione was literally so eager to answer the question that she jumped out of her seat in her effort to make sure her teacher saw that her hand was raised.

Do you remember kids like that? I do in elementary school, but not in middle school. By then, even the most obsessive of teachers' pets had realized that the teacher was trying to get participation from the whole class and they could just sit calmly with their hand up instead of jumping out of their seat.

** Super! Dark! Neutral! Genius! Harry spots Molly Weasley loudly talking about Hogwarts at Kings Cross station. He comes to the brilliant deduction that she is obviously working for the evil and manipulative Dumbledore by trying to gain his attention, so he'd have to approach them for instructions on how to get onto platform 9 3/4. Thereby ingratiating him to the Weasleys and inserting a light family into his social circle which would open him up to be a manipulated pawn. The annoying, whiny, self entitled git, Ron, would clearly be an agent of this manipulation.

Yes! Of course! It was so obvious because why else would a witch be complaining out loud about crowded muggle train stations and have trouble finding the barrier to the hogwarts express?!

It couldn't possibly be because she is harried mother trying to navigate a fast paced, densely crowded, and largely foreign enviornment while accounting for five children. No! Definitely not!

Honestly, it was such a leap of logic that the fic should have qualified for the Olympic long jump.

But the bashing I hated the MOST was when an author once made Hagrid into a rude, uncouth, drunkard pawn of Dumbledore. Weird how I never noticed how much I cared about Hagrid until that came up. I hate bashing in general, especially when it's cringely overdone. But man, I did NOT think anyone would have attacked Hagrid of all people! He's practically a saint in his own right in HP canon and fanon. Almost as much as Harry's parents.

I remember reading this super long wbl fic. Harry had a twin named Sky, or Skylar, who, while at the beginning was arrogant and annoying, slowly over time became someone that Harry, while he couldn't exactly call him family, could trust to help him defeat Voldemort in the end.

*** Bashing sucks. Especially when the fanfictions isn't about the character being bashed. Those I can avoid. If people enjoy bashfic, all power to them, I let them read them, not for me.

But say you're reading Hermione/Harry fanfiction....and bam, you have Krum bashing, or Ron bashing more or less out of nowhere.

Why it seems so hard to just leave the character you don't like out of the story ? Especially when it's an A.U and you can just have harry not met the character in the first place.

*** Ah, His Greatest Wish. One of the most favorited LESS fics on ffn, so when I got interested in the ship for the first time, that was one of the first fics I read. That scene pissed me off, and while the fic has other flaws, that scene alone basically ruins it entirely. While James does have his flaws (especially younger James), that scene and fic in general just made me angry and made me read some other ships instead for a time. Blatant bashing that ruined a perfectly good character, especially after the whole Imperius thing it had going for him.

***** The omnipresent James bashing is easily the worst part of the LESS ship IMO. What's worse is that LESS is one of those ships where you don't actually need to bash the "competition" at all (which is the most common reason people bash characters). There's several flaws to consider for the ship to work (/cough/ Slytherin housemates, the whole DE thing...), and compared to this, James isn't even worth considering -- at the point in time where the ship is plausible, Lily doesn't exactly think highly of him. Turn Severus away from his canon path somehow, making him get his shit together, and I think LESS is a far likely endgame than LEJP assuming nothing else changes. There is no need for the bashing.

Allthough, if James is going to be good straight-away in a dual-Peggy Sue, I don't see how the fic would plausibly end up being a Snily rather than Jily, since Lily comes from her own future having just had James as a husband.

And probably rightly so, he yelled what amounts to a racial slur at her in front of half the school. "Sorry" isn't really good enough. The best SSLE fics start from the premise that the mudblood incident never happened, or if it does, they have him doing some proper work on himself to make it up to her, like dropping his blood supremacist mates.

I really like fics where Lily is able to be friends with both Snape and James though, or date one without the other going mental about it. She's a person, not a prize, and in canon neither of them really seem to see that.

**** This was the first SSLE fic I'd read, and the first Marauders Era fic I've read. In hindsight, it was probably one of the worst fics ever. It completely changed Snape's character, he was literally the polar opposite of what he used to be, just to make him the perfect match for Lily.

And just to make sure he had no competition, the author decided to write James as a rapist, and oh, I'm pretty sure Lily became completely helpless and had to have Severus rescue her.

So many poor tropes, morphing of canon characters to the point of them becoming OC's... I could go on.

Many also swear by linkffn(Come Once Again and Love Me) but I found the fic too angsty for my tastes.

Snily is my otp but most fics with it are far from flawless. The most typical issue is making Snape too nice or James bashing. The former fic above is one of few that doesn't, and it also has a more unique take on the normal SS Peggy Sue plot (instead of him basically being whitewashed and made a Gryffindor in disguise, he instead takes on a sort of mentoring of Slytherins, showing them that not all of them are destined for Voldemort). It also tries to show his character flaws and let him develop over time into something better, while showing James as growing past his youthful bullying.

To begin, the Dursleys were threatened at the end of OotP. Whatever magic Dumbledore invoked around the house lived on until Harry left in DH. The choice is in taking him in and allowing him to call it home. Not in forcing them to treat him better.

Furthermore, Dumbledore tells Harry he only needs to return there once a year and that he needs to know the place as home, but we also know Harry views Hogwarts as home, too. We also see Harry spend one week at Privet Drive in HBP. 2 at worst. As such Harry needn't have spent "ten dark and difficult years" there. Unless one wanted to keep him from being too arrogant in his fame. And while that was a good intention it /is/ easily twistable.

Dumbledore believed they would, so I am gonna guess they likely would. It's not like we see it in canon, since the Blood of Blood charm would have stopped them if they even tried.

I mean, when Dumbledore placed Harry's with the Durseys the Lestranges and Crouch JR were still free, is easy to assume that they would have killed Harry instead of torturing the Longbottoms if they had the chance. And contrary to popular belief, Dumbledore is not omniscient, he doesn't know every single Death Eaters Identity, for all he knew there could be another five Death Eaters with loyalty similar to Bellatrix.

The Charm is on Harry himself, its sealed by Petunia's choice, and as result Harry is safe as long they live in the same home.

How do you not see that is Petunia holding all the cards in that situation.

She knows its her decision that keeps Harry alive, she doesn't want Harry dead, but she doesn't want him happy either, so she decidesd to take him in and ignore Dumbledore's request(and he did ask the to treat Harry like a son) .

It's quite simple, Petunia did not want Harry living with her, thats clear from the first chapter of Philosophiser's stone where its mentioned that she fears he would be corrupting Dudley. But she also did not want her nephew to be murdered so she chose between two options she did not want.

He did ask her to treat Harry like a son in the Letter, we dont know why he didn't tell her it would be necessary to keep Harry alive, but its easily imaginable that you cant lie about the content of a magic pact.

He could have been killed by Quirellmort if he had used a spell, he could also have been killed by the Basilisk or the Shade in the Diary if they had succeeded.

In this one Sev is helping Dumbledore and Harry kill Voldemort but Harry joins Voldemort instead. I can't really remember why he does that but he makes a horcrux and so does Tom. Harry gets caught with a Horcrux (of Tom's? I think?) and Dumbledore thinks it's Harry's (I think) and for some reason THE ONLY SOLUTION IS FOR SEVERUS TO BASH HARRY'S HEAD OPEN.
