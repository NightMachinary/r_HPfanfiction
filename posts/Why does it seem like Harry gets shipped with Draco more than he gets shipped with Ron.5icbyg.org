I've always kind of wondered why Drarry is such a huge fandom even today while Harry/Ron is incredibly uncommon and you end up having to search it out to find it.

Does anyone mind discussing this with me? It's always puzzled me because I always felt like Ron/Harry was almost better than Ginny/Harry.


** Because Draco is much more popular character among female HP fans.

** Someone has mentioned this before so I can't take credit, but it's because Drarry makes a great story full of conflicts and steamy resolutions. They noticed each other at the very beginning of the series and continued to mock, out-best, and generally antagonize each other over their Hogwarts career. I like the depth that comes from both of them having to get over themselves and also forgiving each other's past transgressions. They were the pairing in the first fanfiction I read some 10 years ago and I STILL can't get enough of them. However, now I prefer to read them at ages 24+ haha.

*** I suspect that a lot of the people who assume that Drarry shippers are reading the really awful stories where Draco has a sudden epiphany and becomes this sweet, cuddly guy who finds homes for stray kittens and knits sweaters for orphans in his spare time. There are bad fics no matter what pairing you like. I'd argue that there are some truely exceptional Drarry fics out there as well. Ones where the author actually bothers to develop the characters to a point where they'd work as a couple.

**** Absolutely I think you're right! Sure, older aged Drarry tends to skew them both as more mature and (especially for Draco) not as dogmatic in some fics so there's not as much of a hurdle to get them to understand each other! Even I can't stomach the awful Drarry fanfics and am really quite picky now. If you have any recs let me know!

** I like the Drarry ship. Personally, it's because I see something in the two characters that would work well if they'd get over their differences. They have chemistry.

I disagree that Ron bashing is the problem (you can't blame /everything/ on Ron bashing, you know). My counter question would be why Ron? Yes, he's Harry's friend, but I have friends too and I don't want to date any of them. Just because you get along with someone does not mean you'd be a good couple.

*** I'm always reminded of this quote from PoA when Ron's leg is horribly mangled but he still managed to step in front of Harry (something that was given to Hermione in the movies):

“No, Harry!” Hermione gasped in a petrified whisper; Ron, however, spoke to Black.

“If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!” he said fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.

Something flickered in Black's shadowed eyes.

“Lie down,” he said quietly to Ron. “You will damage that leg even more.”

“Did you hear me?” Ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully to Harry to stay upright. “You'll have to kill all three of us!”

** This might be just me, but I have a hard time seeing Ron as gay. A lot of the characters have a pretty fluid sexuality for me (Draco, Severus, Fred, George) but there are a few that are pretty solidly straight in my head (Ron, Ginny, Percy, Neville) and a few that are absolutely gay (Harry, Albus Severus, Scorpius). So I would never ship Ron with Harry because Ron is straight. /shrug/ I wouldn't have a problem with it if it was well written enough for me to believe it. I actually recently ready a fic that had Draco, Ron, and Hermione in a threesome. It was a background relationship, but I thought it worked really well.

**** I'm not sure I can explain it, but I'll try, lol.

The most important factor for me is that I can't see Harry having a lasting relationship with any of the canon female characters. The canon books don't deal with the aftermath of the war. It goes straight from "The Dark Lord is dead" to "19 years later everyone lives happily ever after". Harry had a really hard childhood, was forced to grow up much too fast, repeatedly lost the people he cared about... I know that Hermione made sacrifices as well (wiping her parent's memories, though my head canon is that she restored their memories after the war), and Ginny had to deal with being possessed by the young Dark Lord and losing a brother, but I feel that Harry would have been much more messed up after the war (he was already showing signs of PTSD when he was 14). I think he would have had a hard time settling into a "normal" life, and I think that the canon ladies (especially Ginny) would have been too "young" to really relate to him.

But then you take a look at the canon male characters. My personal favourites are Severus Snape and the Dark Lord (sane, usually time travel or soul restoration). Both of these characters had childhoods similar to Harry's. The Dark Lord grew up an orphan with no knowledge of his family, like Harry, and Severus grew up in an abusive household where magic couldn't save him, like Harry. Then you've got Draco, who had to deal with the Dark Lord first hand, and really saw the horrors of the war. Even Charlie, who fought with the order, has more of an ability to relate to Harry and help him through the nightmares and such after the war.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/304714?view_adult=true][Chrysalis]] is actually a perfect example of what I mean, with Harry having (very well written) PTSD, which causes a rift between Ginny and him. This is a Snarry, set after the war (Severus obviously survives).

But even without all of that, I still can't see Harry with a girl. I've read a bunch of fics that have a really messed up Hermione, because she became a spy, or Dumbledore put her through training to help Harry or whatever, but I couldn't see even that Hermione paired with Harry. And I really can't explain why.

***** Thanks for the detailed explanation!

I guess I can understand the emotional parallels you've drawn with Harry and some of the other male characters, but I'm still intrigued that you can't imagine him with a girl. It's probably due to my interpretation of the books, but I felt that Harry was physically attracted to multiple female characters throughout his Hogwarts years, so he'd be at the very least bisexual if alleged subtext was accounted for - but all of that is another story.

** I believe the most popular slash partners for Harry are Draco, Snape and Tom (usually the diary one) You can immediately tell that Ron doesn't fit in that little list he doesn't have a bad boy aspect, nor has a tragic love aspect, there is no forbidden love aspect, the actor that played Ron isn't considered as attractive and I don't think that all three characters being in Slytherin is a coincidence either.

** Yeah, it's weird, isn't it?

It's one of those things that took me a while to figure out. I always wondered why I hated Slash fiction so very much in HP (I always think of myself as a pretty tolerant guy). For a while I was honestly a little worried that deep inside I'm a little bit of a homophobe.

But then I realized that like 99% of Slash Fanfics focus on pairings with assholes, bigots or literal murderers. I'm not gay or bi so I'm not sure, but I guess the "bad-boy" thing is a similar turn-out for gay guys as it is for women. I think I had that epiphany when I was reading a Fic with a Sirius/Remus pairing in the background and wasn't at all bothered by it... (kinda relieved, not a homophobe after all).

*** You should try some main pairing Sirius/Remus then and see what you think! They are one of my very favorite pairings. A good one to get you started on the ship IMO is [[http://rosie-writes.livejournal.com/1468.html][Bring Me a Boat]] which is a fic where Remus does not believe that Sirius killed Peter or betrayed James and Lily. He doesn't figure out everything that happened, but he knows Sirius didn't do it and goes on an epic journey (a lot of it on foot) to break Sirius out of Azkaban and convince the world that Sirius is innocent. It's really the ultimate fan service fix it fic and not smutty at all.

Another not a bad boy pairing I love is Harry/Neville in [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=11240][Becoming Neville]] . It is a Neville coming of age, over the summer after 5th year when he lives at Grimmuald place with Harry and Remus. Even though it is AU, the way it is written and the plot feels so much like canon. The Neville POV is also perfectly written.
