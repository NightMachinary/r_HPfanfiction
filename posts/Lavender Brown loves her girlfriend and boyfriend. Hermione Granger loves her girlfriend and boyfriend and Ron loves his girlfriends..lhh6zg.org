Basically they are in a polyamorous relationship and the cutest couple in Hogwarts


** Ron couldn't make up his mind on who he cared for more, Lavendar or Hermione. They were both so perfect he realized he couldn't choose so he took a page out of his mother's spellbook, just a few drops of love potion to get a possible relationship going.

°•○○•°

Lavender had never been able to admit it out loud but she knew Ron also loved Hermione. And she had to secretly admit to herself she found herself crushing hard on the girl as well. Perhaps a little bit of love potion would help smooth things over so they could see if it would work.

°•○○•°

Hermione was still remembering what Molly Weasley had told her over the summer. That a little love potion, small doses only, would be enough to get others to notice you but not enough to do more than fan any already existing Flames.

She had tore into her books seeking confirmation and been astounded. Love potions were such a common way of showing interest most considered it no different then perfume or dressing especially nice. So long as the does was low that was, a high dose was considered excessively rude and showed clear signs to anyone paying attention.

She had feelings for Ron for a bit now, so she was somewhat jealous of him and Lavender. Lavender had what she liked and she found Lavender to rather fetching. She had the talk with her parents years ago and knew she was bisexual. Still being in a poly was not something mainstream even in the magical world.

Perhaps a little bit of love potion would let her see if they had any interest or not?

°•○○•°

Madam Pomfrey could only shake her head at the foolishness of her three newest cases. It seems all three decided to show interest in each other with a little bit of love potion, at the same time coincidentally.

So they were all three bound to their beds are they yelled their desire and love for each other while the potion worked its way through their system.

What a mess, well at least they could rest easy, once they got over the embarrassment later, that they all three cared for each other.

Ron visits to the Infirmary became almost as numerous as Harrys to heal him broken arm after all the boy in the school wanted to high five him (legend say he even got one from Snape, though it was never prouved and the instigator of the rumor mysteriously disapeared after a detention in the dungeon).

** Harry feels depressed because he feels Lavender is gonna take his place. To help his self confidence, Dumbledore starts lessons on Voldemort's childhood early, but they seem pointless to Harry so Dumbledore skips the mystery and straight-up starts teaching him manipulation.

Harry thus joins the threesome with his good looks and charm, the threesome becomes a foursome and Harry takes savage joy fucking Ron up the ass.
