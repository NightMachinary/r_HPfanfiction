*** A "Reading the books" or "Accidentally time-travel" type of stories I think? Mainly I just like the idea that the young scrawny looking Harry is in shock that he actually found love in the future with the beautiful French champion, Fleur Delacour. Plus, he can't really deny because those children are the LIVING PROOF that they eventually fell in love with eachother at some point of their life.
