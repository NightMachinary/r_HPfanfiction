/His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,/

/His hair is as dark as a blackboard./

/I wish he was mine, he's really divine,/

/The hero who conquered the Dark Lord./

Ginny's valentine was delivered smack dab in the middle of the Chamber of Secrets fiasco, a time when she was pretty much completely trusting of Tom and his friendship. (*edit*: wrong. fake news.)

This poem is /so bad/ and borderline derogatory (a toad, really?) that I'm like 90% sure Tom came up with it at Ginny's request. Not to mention the fact that it refers to 'the Dark Lord', a title only used by Voldemort's supporters and sympathizers.

Does anyone have a fic with this idea featured within? I'd shed tears of joy, probably. (*edit*: kinda still want to see this scenario tho)


** Actually no, Ginny didn't have the Diary with her on Valentines Day. She got rid of the Diary for several months between late November 1992 until well after Valentines Day. That was why Hermione could brew Polyjuice potion in that bathroom in peace. That was when Harry could get his hands on the Diary and find out the story involving Hagrid.

It was during this Valentines Day when Harry's backpack was ripped open and Ginny found the Diary in Harry's possession. I believe it wasn't almost until May that Ginny managed to steal it back. Then Hermione and Penelope were petrified soon after.

***** But did she?

It's been so long since I've reread the series, but did Ginny ever admit to sending the Valentine, or was it just assumed from her reaction that she was the culprit?

I've seen other fanfics address how "Ginny" referred to Voldemort as the Dark Lord in the infamous poem (in some Drarry fics, Draco is the one who sent it, but blames it on Ginny after witnessing Harry's horrified reaction. Canonly, he could have still been the one to send it in order to humiliate Harry in public.)

Were we ever given a reason why Ginny chose to use "Dark Lord" other than that it rhymes with "blackboard"? Because "Voldemort" rhymes just as well, though she may have been hesitant to name You-Know-Who.

********* Sorry, I can't remember the title nor any specific details...

From what I recall, it was quite cute, basically a pining Draco's POV of their Hogwarts years, and him trying to get closer to Harry, but only to make mistakes (often due to his pride) and further antagonizing him in the end.

I only remember the Valentines part because I had never paid attention Ginny's choice of names for Voldemort in the poem before, and the idea that someone else wrote it and let her take the blame was intriguing.

** Does Voldemort ever refer to himself as the 'Dark Lord'? He seems to prefer going full 'Lord Voldemort' if he's going to refer to himself in the third person.

It raises the question of if an evil dark wizard thinks that he's an evil dark wizard.

*** I'm pretty sure /Voldemort/ does. He keeps advocating the Dark Arts and claims that morals are illusions. So I'm going to say yes. On the other hand, I always go the feeling that Grindelwald shared a delusion of goodness with his Muggle counterpart Hitler ("I'm doing vat is best for the world! Wy doesn't Albus understand?"). And some of the Death Eaters (especially the Lestranges and Malfoys) might actually buy into the whole "pureblood rights" thing enough to think they're the good vigilantes, chalking up the constant torture and Unforgivables to an "end justifies the means" philosophy.

** This doesn't have that in there, specifically (for the reasons other users have mentioned--she didn't have the diary on Valentine's Day), but it does have Tom giving Ginny advice about her crush (and other things).

  What do adolescent girls write about in their diaries? Stop and think about that for a moment. Now, imagine you're Tom Riddle and the only obstacle between you and world domination is an awkward eleven year old girl with a fangirl crush, a Harry Potter Doll, several older brothers, and absolutely no idea about human reproduction. You might just feel sorry for Tom Riddle if he weren't such a manipulative bastard.
