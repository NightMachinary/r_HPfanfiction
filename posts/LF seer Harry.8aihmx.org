** Umm, linkffn(The Inner Eye of Harry Potter)? It's crack though, but I really liked it.

If it's divination fics you want, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Weasley Seer) was really nice. Also, there's an amazing one shot in linkffn(Flying & Other Scenes).

  Imagine Harry Potter raised under the guiding hand of Sibyll Trelawney. He arrives at Hogwarts versed in the higher arts of Divination, Arithmancy, Numerology, and Palmistry - you know 'real magic.' Prepare yourself for one humorous ride.

  A prank in Professor Trelawney's class leads to Ron being hailed as a seer. But nobody could predict how that would change Harry's fate. AU, starts 3rd year. Powerful!Harry. Adventure/Humor.

#+begin_quote
  A series of unrelated scenes from various POVs (Harry features in every other one). Begins with "Flying," in which Harry learns that there are still a few things able to challenge him in the air, and goes from there.

** Femharry seer fic, one of my favourites. It is an Avengers crossover but only because of Loki and a bit of shield.

** Ugh, I can't remember the title or author, but there was one story I remember reading awhile back. It was a time travel (I think, either that or an alternate/parallel universe) where Harry... something about needing some leverage?

I remember [[/spoiler][he pretends to be a seer so he can give hints/push people toward certain decisions or warn them about events. Later, he's at some party, and he gets requested (or just starts doing it?) to "read" the personalities of some adults I think,]]

I think it was abandoned, because I remember that scene being the last updated chapter, or one of the lasts, unless it updated and I just never got back to it. I wish I could remember more details, but I think that was a pretty specific scene. Someone might know what story I'm talking about.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

***** I just really liked it, spent some time searching for similar stories, but this one is still one of my favorites in dimensional(+time) travel genre. Others usually involve too much angst, romance or overpowered and edgy Harry. And this fic had very interesting relationship development between Sirius and Harry just before it was abandoned, when Sirius starts to kind of forget Harry is not really his son.
