I'm currently reading the amazing fic linkffn(13436100) where a grown man, like past middle age, dies in a car accident and is sent back by Fate to help Harry growing up at the Dursleys. It's easily the best "fix it" fic I think I've ever read and leaps and bounds ahead of any SI fic I've ever read in the 20 or so years I've read Harry Potter fan fic.

It got me thinking, I've read a plethora of fix it fics that involve the situation at the Dursleys improving. It's often Petunia leaving an abusive Vernon with the boys and trying to be a good mother to both. Some involve Snape. Others involve Petunia never marrying Vernon and having a completely different, good, husband.

However the one thing I've never noticed in all these fics, is addressing the root of Petunia's hatred towards magic. Usually in these fics Dudley and Harry carry on like the pseudo brothers they could be, and that's wonderful. I've just never seen it addressed that maybe one of the reasons Petunia keeps Dudley and Harry from being close is she doesn't want her son to go through what she did when she found out Lily was magical, and as such went off to Hogwarts and became a member of the magical community, while Petunia could not. I think it's heartbreaking that in canon she even wrote Hogwarts a letter begging to attend with her little sister and was turned down. She is never given any sympathy for that desire, it's always addressed as a logical outcome. To an adult that might be the case, but to a little girl that's got to be shattering, especially being dismissed so coldly. It really is a huge part of her character as it seems that's when she began distancing herself form Lily just as much as Lily lost touch with her sister by integrating with the magical community. At the beginning Petunia's actions are just a way of protecting herself from further hurt. As such, I can only imagine maybe one reason she doesn't want Dudley and Harry growing up close is because she doesn't want her son to go through that pain and rejection she did.

I'm not saying this in anyway justifies how she treats Harry in canon. But in all the fix it fics I've read, no matter how it turns out, Dudley and Harry almost always become close (on the rare exception Dudley just stops abusing Harry but those situations are more rare) yet it's never addressed h the inevitable hurt that Dudley will go through, not being able to attend Hogwarts and be special and magic like Harry when the time comes. No matter what steps Petunia has taken to improve the lives of herself, her son and her nephew, whether Vernon or another man are involved or not, this key issue is never addressed,

Thoughts?


** This has always been my theory. I also think it's why she spoiled Dudley so much. She never felt special, so her son was going to know that he was special.

Most fics make it seem like Vernon was the reason Harry was treated so badly. But in the first chapter of SS he seemed fairly reasonable about magic. He didn't like it, but he didn't have that burning hatred he has later on.

*** It is interesting, and I'm pretty sure Vernon's hatred of magic only really came about because every time he was exposed to magic, it impacted him in a decidedly negative manner.

*** Yeah that makes sense to me. And it's clear Petunia sought someone out like Vernon, someone so incredibly "normal" the exact opposite of how she feels the magical community is, to the point Vernon comes off as the guy who's likely racist, hates "foreign" food and other cultural elements and is a "meat and potatoes" English man. Then together with her trauma and Vernon's natural state, I can only see each of them growing worse in their individual pathologies far more than if they weren't together.

In Ghost of Privet Drive, the fic that I mentioned, the wards Dumbledore added to Privet Drive include a minor confundous charm, not because of that evil!Dumbledore trope where he wants Harry to grow up alone, neglected and possible abused by all the Muggles around him to become a perfect sacrifice, but because Dumbledore's arrogance believes this is the best way to make the Muggles accept the situation of finding Harry on their doorstep and not ask questions,. It's his own natural arrogance that he does this instead of putting the actual time and effort in to doing it properly and in person and rot being guaranteed of the results after that. The problem becomes that due to Vernon and Petunia's own less than stellar mental health prior to this, the charm ends up creating more mental trauma than they would have had without it, which only escalates the situation until you get the results from canon. It's well intentioned but it's still prejudice. I'm Native Hawai'ian so I'm kind of sensitive to this kind of stuff, it's the same reason the missionaries used to strip us of our culture, identity and values and give us theirs, but making sure we remained subservient and lesser than.

But solely within the HP universe canon, that's an interpretation I like because it's not cartoonish and not dependent on evil!Dumbledore tropes, it's subtle, realistic and is supported by Dumbledore's character and actions in canon. Instead of a trope, it's based on the realistic human flaws of each character. I can imagine canon Dumbledore is more arrogant than most, no matter how he claims he has tried to avoid taking power, for 40-50 years before this he's been idolized in much of the Wizarding World, especially Britain and while he is extremely intelligent when it comes to academics and extremely powerful, he knows this and he hears it from his admirers constantly. He doesn't have to take this to cartoonish levels of villainy, but even with good intentions and without outright narcissism it's easy to see him developing an inflated sense of his own abilities, as well as explaining the reason why he keeps so many decisions and facts to himself, not thinking that others can handle them or would know better than him. And even though he believes in equality for muggle borns and believes he's open minded and accepting, it's believable for him to still have subconscious discrimination against muggles.

A lot of the prejudice in the real world, isn't outright KKK level hatred, but rather people thinking that other groups of people different from themselves in anyway, and believing that they know what's best for these people, always in a patronizing way without trying. You saw it with the liberal Bernie supporters when most of the black voters in the south and some major cities voted for Biden, and there was quite a bit of talk from the white supporters of Bernie that "they" (southern blacks) just didn't know what was best for them and didn't understand that Bernie would "be better for them". I mentioned the white Christian missionaries doing this through colonialism. Many believe by the mid 20th century that was no longer seen as acceptable, but rez schools where Native children were brought to civilize them away from their barbaric families, culture and home into the 1970s. They didn't even try to white wash it, saying it was to provide rural areas with high level centralized education or something transparent like that, they still said Native children needed to be civilized.. Dumbledore was born a century before that, when the race to Africa was at it's height and colonialism had expanded to its zenith. So just based on the culturally accepted and promoted ideology prevalent in Britain from his birth through his formative years, his known adolescent beliefs of utilitarianism and the superiority of all magicals over non magicals and growing up in an environment where the family was segregated from near by Muggles and his father had no problem attacking the muggles that hurt Adriana, are all things that have made a huge impact of his entire thought processes and ideologies. It's hard to shake every last remnant of those insidious early beliefs we were exposed to. Dumbledore truly believes he has changed and become more progressive, and has had some pretty traumatic experiences that shattered his illusions and prompted him to change, which he has. But that doesn't mean he no longer harbors any prejudices at all. It's like white people who were raised in very racist homes and have left and their ideology becomes a total 180 of what they were raised with. Their conscious beliefs have definitely changed, but usually there's still parts of subconscious beliefs that still cling on. Even being susceptible to believe that race doesn't exist and say that you don't see color and our entire society is post racial, usually means subconscious white privilege is alive and well. Or with individuals who are disabled. Someone might be strongly against the "r" word, and makes an effort not to ignore people with disabilities.... (1/2)

**** .... (2/2) But often what happens is people go out of the way to push someone's wheelchair or help as much as they can. Often they don't ask if the disabled individual needs help in the first place and if they do they still treat them differently, talking slow and clearly like with young children, saying they're so inspiring, without realizing they're incredibly patronizing and their prejudice is at work. I'm Deaf/hard of hearing and use hearing aids and am often spoken to like I have a cognitive disability. It was even worse when I was paralyzed for a couple years in my early 20s due to a spinal cord injury (it's a miracle I can walk today) I'd have people grab my wheelchair and push me places I didn't ask to go and don't want to go. People would say I'm so inspiring because if they were in my situation they'd either never leave their bed or they'd just kill themselves, suggesting disabled people's lives aren't worth living, aren't as valuable or worth while as an able bodied person's life. That's the subconscious discrimination that's still at play. To me that's how Dumbledore treats the muggles. As deficient. Like sure they're people and they have worth and we need to protect them. But they don't need to be consulted because of course they'd never understand it and magicals know what's best for them while they don't.

I can see canon Dumbledore doing something to the Dursley's that he believes is beneficial for them without telling them or asking their permission because as muggles, he obviously knows what is best for them. Dumbledore means well, but that doesn't mean that the charms and protections he applies to the Dursley home without their knowledge or consent or without even any other magical working with him, at least to look at his plan and offer any critiques or improvements, won't have any negative side effects. Even without the confundous charm, which isn't in canon, I can imagine high level magic, especially the type that works on the mind (which a protective spell would have to in some capacity to know who is and isn't a threat) would definitely have an impact on someone's overall mental health, especially if they're living under the same roof and exposed every day and night for at least a decade.

Petunia, in canon, clearly has some trauma and other mental health issues that she has in no way addressed in a healthy way. Instead she's made things worse, with her maladaptive attempts at coping skills only worsening her overall mental and physical health and that of her family. Fanon always talks about mind healers. The muggle world definitely has them, but especially in the time period there was even more stigma about mental health than there is today. Being married to Vernon has the unintended side effect of probably making her even more adverse to getting any sort of help than she would have been on her own. What Dumbledore does to make this significantly worse, is a canon example of the arrogance I mentioned above, not seeing things from the perspective of others or factoring in their feelings to modify his plans at all, let alone to ask for help to make his decision and plan of action.

Dumbledore knew Petunia desperately wanted to go to Hogwarts, he responded to the letter she sent requesting to join her sister and was responsible for the unsensitive form letter that was sent back. He was aware after that point that Petunia and Lily grew apart. Even if he being the Headmaster and a host of other internationally important positions, he is too busy and important to keep tabs on the family life of a student, by the time Lily joined the Order, he had to have at least heard or seen or whatever once that they were no longer close, even just an off comment by Lily when she was asked to join or something. For him to drop Harry off in the middle of the night on their doorstep with only a letter to explain himself, at best, was a glaring example of his short sighted arrogance at work. Even knowing Petunia was so deeply upset her sister was magic and went to Hogwarts and she was not that she wrote a letter begging to be able to join her, and was denied in an impersonal curt way, having her magical sister's magical child in her home along side her own non magical child, mirroring her original trauma almost exactly, would most certainly bring that trauma back up.

I'm sure, because of his age, he was a strong believer in that stuff upper lip type restraint of emotions from the end of the Victorian era but again for such a major decision for Harry's life, he should have gotten other input to formulate a plan. Instead he did what he decided on his own and didn't even listen to the blatant outcry by his deputy McGonagall, whose intelligence he had to at least respect in some capacity, more than most certainly.

Regardless of the exact specifics, everything Dumbledore did in relation to Petunia was done in almost the worst way possible in respect to her own mental health. He may not have intended it, and he's not at fault for the origins of her issues, or the decisions she's made that have made things worse, like marrying Vernon, while choosing not to address them in any healthy capacity. That's on her. But everything to do with leaving Harry in her care was handled very poorly. Not because of some sinister mustache twirling master plan of evil, but because of something arguable more ominous because it's real, that being his own character flaws as a human being, something that every one of us has in differing capacities. Dumbledore is responsible for everything that has to do with the way he pawned Harry off on them though. Even in the worst foster care systems, there's a caseworker who is supposed to do mental health assessments and offer some sot of support systems. A single letter and and her nephew on the stoop, which also serves as the way she finds out her only sister, her little sister, was freaking murdered, is insensitive beyond all belief and is a huge trigger for the worse. You don't need some evil plan being carried out to create damage and trauma and hurt to people unnecessarily, it just takes regular imperfect humans interacting with other regular imperfect humans. It's a lot more depressing IMO which has suddenly made me see how there could be an appeal to the cartoon villainy to explain away every negative outcome in life, because with those stories there's always a good guy who triumphs and can fix everything. Real life doesn't have that.

(Sorry I went all out on this. I'm a LCSW so looking into the minds and characterization of people in the HP universe is a guilty pleasure of mine)

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI-ish. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.
