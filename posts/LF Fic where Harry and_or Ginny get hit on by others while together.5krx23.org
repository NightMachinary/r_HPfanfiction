I'm a fan of angsty Harry/Ginny fics and in particular one specific plot line. I'm looking for any fics where there is another character trying to form a wedge between Harry and Ginny. For example, while Ginny is back at school and Harry is in Auror training, another boy tries to steal Ginny away. Could be OC or existing person. This might be too specific, but figured it's worth a shot.

- I don't want any fics where either character actually cheats and I want them to be together by the end.

- I wouldn't mind if the pair break up and Ginny/Harry goes on a date or two with someone else before realizing they belong together but I'd prefer not to read something where either seriously dates someone else.

- There are a lot of fics where people like Romilda Vane flirt with Harry but him and Ginny laugh it off. I'm looking for a bit more drama than that.

Good examples of what I'm talking about are Ghost of You, A Less Than Perfect Love, and Inner Demons. Not saying these are the best fics, but they at least hit that part of what I'm looking for.

Doesn't this really just put a damper on the drama?

*** I don't think so. I mean, ultimately I still need to like these characters which is tough to do when one of them cheats. I think the tension of the possibility provides enough drama to satisfy me. I also feel a bit protective of the characters so don't want to see them do something that in my opinion goes too against character for both.

My take on that plot:

- Ron and Hermione would be facing similar situations.
- Their decision to split up was very political and rational, and basically went against their own emotions.
- Auror office was supposed to be severely depleted, so Harry, Ron, and DA alumni would become its mainstay.\\
- Neville, the Snake Slayer, would be another person highly sought after by witches (and gay wizards).
- Hogwarts students were severely traumatized by Voldemort's reign of terror. Their parents should be utterly pissed that their children were tortured. They would demand changes, big changes in magical Britain, and they would seek revenge. The Carrows and those willing to help them torture their fellow students would most likely be made an example of.
- Hermione was more likely to become Head Girl, although Ginny was more popular and respected among Hogwarts students.
