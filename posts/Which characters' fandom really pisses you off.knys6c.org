** A bit off the wall but Narcissa Malfoy. I've read a lot of fanfics that attempt to redeem her the same as Draco and IMHO, she's worse since she's an adult. Sure, most of her decisions were out of fear (probably) but she's a grown ass woman who made a lot of bad choices.

*** So far I only see her as an opportunist. Narcissa was perfectly happy with her life until Lucious fucked up too much and lost his worth to the Dark Lord. I am pretty sure that the Malfoys wouldn't have changed their ways if Lucious were still one of the top dogs.

People that want to redeem themselves do that by actions, not by asking for forgiveness and protection after they got on the bad side of their former Boss. That's how I see it.

**** I agree but also think it's what she was raised to be. As a Black, she would have grown up with prejudice and expectations befitting a pureblood. I've seen so many fics that take her action in the forest at the end of “proof” that she's attempting to redeem herself or that she's actively positioning herself with the “light”. Really, she just wanted to make sure her son was alive and just saw HP take an Avada to the chest and still be breathing. I think I'd realize I was on the losing side, too.

***** I agree with this-- I actually love reading fics about her and Lucius and other Death Eaters, but only fics where they're NOT 'good guys in bad situations.' Along this line, SO many stories have Narcissa reconciling with Andromeda after the second war, and act like Bellatrix was somehow the thing keeping the two 'good' sisters apart. If Narcissa had wanted a relationship with Andromeda, she would have had one. Bella was sentenced to life in prison. It actually probably would have improved the Malfoy's public image after the first war if Narcissa and Andromeda had publicly reconciled, so I don't buy Lucius keeping them apart either.

I think she's such an interesting character-- I just wish more stories focused on her darker aspects rather than trying to make her seem like a helpless/downtrodden wife and mother with no agency of her own!

That's definitely how I see it. I enjoy reading fics where Snape is in a mentor/parental position and learns to do it well and grows past his pettiness and woe is me attitude, but I like it is because it's different - something that never would have happened in canon, because canon Snape is an abusive, immature bastard whose sole pleasure in life is wielding power over defenseless children and nursing hurt feelings over things that happened 15 years ago, and why oh why did Harry name his damn son after that pos?

It's fine that Harry forgave him, because Harry is canonically the forgiving sort (it can be said that his history of being treated horribly by authority figures plays into that - he's so used to it that it doesn't really register on a conscious level), but why does the one good thing Snape did at the end of his life somehow erase every negative aspect of his character? I can understand why Snape is the way he is; that's what makes him such a great character, because he makes sense, he feels real, but a lot of people use their understanding of his character as justification for his actions.

She is also mostly annoying, knows every secret somehow, and blabbers every secret out as if she is clueless about the meaning of the word 'secret'

Also, every prota likes her without really knowing her. Harry hears about Luna being bullied and he suddenly decides to help her, then he adds her to his 'inner circle' and she suddenly a permanent part of the main cast.

How did you reach that conclusion? On ao3, Harry has more of every tag related to power or intelligence. For example, there are 70 stories with Smart!Hermione while there are 470 with Smart!Harry. Heck, there are even tags that only Harry has, like with the Genius!Harry tag or the OP!Harry tag. I think you have a /very/ different of "just as prevalent" than I do.

**** I said "OOC" "goddess" and "super, edgelord."

Hermione is out of character in the majority of stories she's written in. Hermione is far more talented and creative in fan fiction. She is far more likable and beautiful to in-universe characters than she was in canon. I reached that conclusion by reading beyond the tags.

So if people don't like canon Harry because they read OOC Harry, Hermione fans don't like canon Hermione because they read lots of OOC Hermione.

You said goddess Hermione, not slightly improved Hermione. Almost every character has this happen to them in fanfiction. For example, the twins are depicted as much kinder and smarter in almost every fanfic. Hermione is hardly special in this regard. The difference between her and Harry is that Harry is usually totally unrecognizable, while Hermione still retains a few of her important traits.

Also, is she depicted as more talented and creative in most fanfics? Maybe it's just me, but I usually see her depicted as a regular bullied bookworm who is saved by the great Harry Potter (or any other guy). I will admit that she is usually far more beautiful and likeable though.

A lot of the "Neville would've been a better main character than Ron" or "Neville would've made a better BWL" fans simply enjoy his character growth and would've liked to see more of that. They also greatly dislike that Ron and Harry were lazy idiots who lucked out.

The three big issues here is that Neville was pretty much "Harry-lite," Harry was super important to Neville's development, and pre-OotP Neville was a crybaby whose wand skills were so terrible they could likened to fanon Crabbe and Goyle's.
