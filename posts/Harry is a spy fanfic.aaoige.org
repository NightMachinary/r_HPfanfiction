Okay I don't know why but I rly want to read a fic that has Harry working as a spy for Voldemort. Preferably the fic could take place mainly during fifth year but any time is fine. And for the love of Merlin pls have no Voldemort/Harry or Severus/Harry, I am okay with any other shop just none of that pls. Oh and if the fic can show Harry being light first and then slowly being turned to the dark side that would be great.

  A Harry Potter Oneshot. Follow Harry's journey through the shadows of the war with Lord Voldemort, and watch as he does everything necessary to ensure the survival of his family. Non-BWL Harry! BigBrotherHarry! Rated M to be safe.
