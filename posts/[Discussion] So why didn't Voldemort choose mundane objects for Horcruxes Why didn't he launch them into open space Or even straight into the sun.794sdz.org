The easy explanation is that Voldemort was a control-freak and a vain sentimental idiot. But what if there actually is a magical reason why Voldemort acted the way he did, choosing significant objects as his Horcruxes, and storing them safely away.

As the diary demonstrates, it is possible to use even the most mundane objects as a horcrux. But what if it was actually detrimental to lose track of one's horcruxes? The moment an object becomes transformed into a horcrux, it stops being mundane. It then has a piece of living soul in it, and develops even some rudimentary will of its own. The diary was able to manipulate Ginny and even possess her. The locket, being one of Voldemort's later Horcruxes, seemed to have less power, but was still able to exploit the insecurities of people surrounding it to cause division and despair. If an object can develop a will of its own, it's better to not lose track of it, but rather keep it somewhere safe and under control.

But what would be safer place to keep a horcrux than open space? Well, only magic can destroy a horcrux, that's true. But solar system bodies can have magical properties in the Harry Potter universe, most obviously the moon, causing lycanthropy. Maybe exposing a horcrux to open space conditions is after all not the safest idea?

Of course this is speculative, but it is very possible that within the canon established in the books, Voldemort's way of dealing with Horcruxes was smart and reasonable and not just the result of his vanity.

It might be that they could destroy them with thermite, and it might be that they can't even be destroyed by a blue star. Since they never did experiments in canon there's just no way to be sure.

**** I'm reasonably sure JK did say that a bullet would penetrate most non-physical magical shielding we see in HP, so with that logic, maybe magic works by ‘it seems like sufficient force'.

So, while leaving a Horcrux in a heavily irradiated room or bombard it with radioactive particles or wavelengths might not do much, but a recogniseably devastating effect on it like a Nagasaki-level A bomb feels like it should, so it would.

Throwing it in a normal fire wouldn't work because fire is something we can mostly control nowadays, but maybe a few thousand years ago the magic would have allowed you to toss it into the fireplace, because fire was still this slightly supernatural thing?

My fanon has always been that the caster shapes the effectivacy of the spell, and it might apply when magic collides: whose belief is stronger? The horcrux maker or the attempted breaker

Yeah wouldn't it make sense for a physical object to be able to pierce a non-physical shield? Did she ever say anything on the effect of a bullet on physical shielding?

EDIT: did you mean non physical like protego would be non physical while a literal shield made of metal and then enchanted would be a physical magical shield?

Also remember Voldemort grew during WW2 so he would know plenty about bombs ... Maybe not nuclear ones unless he kept up with muggle news, but that isn't entriely impossible since he had to go back to the orphanage every year.

** Horcruxes are not justs sock-portkeys (and those have a meaning still: they are both travel-related).\\
They are both a part of yourself and a mean to immortality.\\
My head-canon is that, regarding such a potent act as the creation of a horcrux, everything has a meaning: the place and target of the murder, the item used, the place where it is stored, defenses around.

A diary is an item in which one pours his soul (figuratively), and that is not read by other before one's death. A person still remembered a millenia after his death has attained a form of immortality, and their relics are a proof of their existence as well as a conduit for their immortality (locket, cup, ring, tiara); it is said that immortality can only be reached through one's children (Harry); and the snake is a reference to the ouroboros, an eternal cycle.\\
The murder of Myrtle stands for life stolen : the sacrifice of a young life against continuation of another; his paternal family allows him to detach himself from the anchor of family; Hepzibah Smith represent immortality through children obtained (she is descended from Hufflepuff), and as a mirror, Lily and Harry represent the struggle to reach said immortality through children.\\
The cave where L.V. discovered his power over others; the school where he grew into said power; the house of his family, forgotten for his quest of immortality; the house of another family, one with an old name, ever remembered; the bank representing at the same time power and stability, not in his own account but in the one of a family he uses in his quest (leaching the life and power of others); at his side, always, for the rebirth symbol after his own rebirth.

Magic is highly symbolic (see: first year transfiguration); you don't just create a horcrux murdering a passer-by, with a stone, and let it drown in an oceanic trench, there's not enough meaning, no meaning at all. That's why Dumbledore seeks the way he does, through a study of Voldemort's life : he is seaking what means what for L.V., what acts, places, items, people, have an importance for him. That's why it is easier to create a boot-portkey, that's the 3 brothers tales moral for adults (fables always have had several level).

That's may not be canon explanation, but it makes canon much less non-sensical.

*** In addition to what you wrote, the object that would be chosen for a Horcrux may have to be magically powerful. The Ring contained the Resurrection Stone, and probably was powerful in its own right. The Locket and the Cup were Founder's artifacts that although we don't know anything about, very likely had some importance (for the Cup, think chalices and their connection to life or death), the Diadem granted great intelligence, Nagini was definitely a magical snake, or else Voldemort would never have chosen her, for the diary, as brilliant as Tom Riddle was, it is fairly likely that he could have made it into a magical artifact, and Harry Potter was either magically powerful before or because of the prophecy.

**** HP metaphysics implicitly put a pretty high price on human life. Biological immortality through the Philosopher's Stone is just as priceless as all of the gold that the Stone could provide; and if nothing else, human lives are valuable because you have to snuff them out in order to create Horcruxes.

The act of murder is (symbolically and magically) important; it splits your soul because it puts you on the road to devaluing other human lives, and the road to putting your own ends above the lives of other people. That says a lot about the true value of a life, if it's (literally) wholesome to hold human life in esteem, and depraved or (literally) unwholesome to put it down.

I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry --- I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”

First of all, it isn't a mundane diary. It's the personal diary of an incredible wizard. Secondly you need to stop thinking like a muggle.

** I was under the impression that the diary was at least partially an accident, but even so it was probably his most important possession at that time in his life outside his wand. The ring is proof of his wizarding heritage which traces back to Slytherin and in some ways a chance to mock the family that abandoned him, at least in his eyes. The locket, cup, and diadem are all founders objects and it would show immense amount of intelligence and ability to even locate the three of them much less corrupt them with his dark magic. They are also less likely to be destroyed by people who come across them even if they recognize the foul magic that has corrupted them because of their connection to legendary witches and wizards.

** We know that making multiple horcruxes is something only Voldemort figured out how to do. Perhaps him being sentimental about it is actually the reason why he can create so many. In fact, this may be true of all horcruxes in general. If you're going to place a piece of your soul in something, it makes sense that it would have to be something you care about.

In fact, this could be a very crucial weakness to horcruxes in general.

Also, a diary may be physically mundane, but it would have more meaning to Voldemort himself.

** Thing is....it's something WE'D think of, and that Harry and co would think of, but before Voldemort, who really knew about them? I gather it was extremely obscure, and not often done. It was regarded, I suspect, as an ancient evil, a historical thing, not something done today. And who would think of multiple ones? It was unheard of. Herpo only made one. Even if someone did think, hey, he's not dying, I wonder if he has a Horcrux, they'd never think he had seven, let alone two.

Only reason they knew was Slughorn. Dumbledore suspected, because the Diary was killed, but Voldemort still lived, and he suspected Harry. Before Diary, I don't think he knew.

** Well I don't recall it saying the diary wasn't magical before he used it. It wouldn't surprise me if it was magical with some spells on it to protect it from being damaged by water or something most young men or women might be worried about, mind you I am not saying it was made magically or sold to him magically but he may have put spells on it after getting it.

As for launching it into space, he would possibly have been able to with spells but unlikley. Also he would want to know where they where and their status in the event he thought he might need one. It would have been more intelligent to simple take one like the ring and go to a muggle construction site and put it in a area being filled with cement, or better put it in a muggle safe charmed and protected by runes and wards before having it dropped into the ocean near the south pole.

As for the sun, it would destroy it. It also would be at risk of being destroyed with reentry or risk of being destroyed by any number of space debris and the like in space.

** In the fic I'm writing, one of the caveats of creating a Horcrux is that the item needs to have significance to the creator. Hence, Voldemort turning a personal diary, a family heirloom, three artifacts belonging to the founders of the institute he considered a home, and a snake, with which he surrounded himself with the imagery of. (Harry isn't a true Horcrux, but he does sort of fit as being a potential threat.)

** It could be that horcruces must be important to you. If you don't value it, you can't place your soul in it. The diary was quite important to Tom, I'd say. Though that argument sort of falls down with Harry. Maybe he was important to Vold because of their enemy status?

Riddles diary he'd written in when he was at school, and so it already had a connection to his soul. The founders objects all had magical properties of their own and nagini was Voldemort's slave/parseltongue buddy
