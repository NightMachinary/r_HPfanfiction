By new, I mean something published in the past couple of years.

By unusual, I mean something that's a significant departure from canon, not merely a slight reworking of it. The only other one I know of is the "The Arithmancer" and its sequel by White Squirrel.

What are the other stories in the fandom that fulfill these criterion? Thanks!


** My personal favorite (if you don't know it already): linkffn(A long journey home by rakeesh)

**** Yeah, the time-travel idea was great to begin with. Now that I've read the story (so far) it almost feels like fem!Harry was the only way the story makes sense. The feeling that after you read something: "This is the truth, it couldn't have happened any other way", that I often get during good original fiction.

The skepsis was waved away so fast,and there were so many interesting arcs there. So many challenges to overcome, so many interesting characters to meet, such a great story.

****** As a whole it is probably right at the top of my favorites list, with just a couple other contenders. This isn't to say that I love all of it of course, like the Merlin arc, which wore on me a lot in the middle (by the end it was great though), but some parts of it are just ridiculously charming, like the 1964 chapter. On the whole I can't get enough of it and wish there was more.

****** Yeah, and it uses elements of canon great, for example with time-turner-knowledge-loops that behave similar to what we see in PoA.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. Future Snape/Harriet. Sequel "No Journey's End" (Ootp - DH) is now posting.

** linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle)

4 books worth of stories on it, with the next one coming out...sometime.(he finishes a book, then posts them chapter by chapter according to his profile) I wouldn't count on it really, its been 5 years. Still a damn good read.

Takes place in US after Voldemort, has interesting world building, and you'll see small hints of canon stuff (like Weasly Wizardly Weezes gets mention) for the most part it is all OC.

If you like a hardline and militant approach against Death Eaters, you will love his fics.

He is also one of the very rare authors who writes both H/Hr and R/Hr fics.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
