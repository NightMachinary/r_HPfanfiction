Tom Marvolo Riddle had made a mistake, a big one. For years he had delved into the depths of the Dark Arts, wading through the depraved thoughts of the darkest wizards to walk the Earth. In doing so he was able to carefully craft the perfect plan, one that would have the Wizarding World at his mercy and ensure that he would gain immortality through his seven Horcruxes.

So perfect was his scheme that not even Albus Dumbledore - the 'greatest' wizard alive - could stand in his way. Unfortunately, a one-year-old boy managed to in his stead.

Reduced to a mere wraith and with his plans set back until he could one day reclaim the flesh and blood he required to regain his form, he waited in sil--FUCK THAT HURTS! Pain unlike any he had felt before now coursed through the wraith, an ironic agony akin to the /Crucio/ curse his servants were fond of.

Turns out shattering your soul into pieces can have some side-effects, who knew?

Unable to endure this torment but lacking the body required to destroy his Horcruxes and end his suffering, Tom was left relying on the one he now found himself inexplicably linked with.

There were a few problems with using this connection though; it was with the boy that had caused his demise, said boy was protected by blood wards and under the watch of Dumbledore, he was far too young and weak to destroy the Horcruxes, he would likely grow up learning about stranger danger and lastly, Tom had a killer headache.

Tom Riddle, the Dark Lord Voldemort, must try to train and raise Harry so that he can destroy his Horcruxes while dealing with all the problems that occur when an old man tries to talk to a kid.

Gotta love random ideas, lemme know what you think of it and if you pick it up I'd love to get a link to it.
