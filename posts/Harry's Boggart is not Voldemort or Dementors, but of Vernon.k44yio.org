*** I once read this fic that any person who becomes another person's Boggart is immediately arrested for holding, then investigated to the letter and spirit of every law on each and every applicable book. It isn't easy to become someone's Boggart. They literally turn into your deepest, darkest fear(s). Snape was fired (after investigation) for being Neville's, McGonagall investigated for Hermione's, and The Dursleys all arrested and put into magically enhanced non-magical jails and correctional facilities. Dudley became a better person and Vernon and Petunia were killed in prison by other prisoners for being child abusers. (Professionals have standards!) I think. Some of that might be conjecture or my own wish fulfilment.

**** I really love that idea.

> Snape was fired (after investigation) for being Neville's

As an adult looking back, it seems incredible to me that a teacher would be allowed to terrorize children to this degree. If my memory serves, Neville saw his parents tortured into insanity, but his teacher, a man entrusted with his care, was what he feared most. It's ludicrous that he should be allowed to continue teaching, regardless of his loyalty to the headmaster.

***** Ikr. He didn't have to be a teacher to be a double (perhaps triple) agent. He could've been a researcher, a high level tutor, an inventor, any number of things.

***** I do wonder if Neville knew snape was a death eater and if his fear stemmed from the fact that one of the people entrusted with his care, was also part of the organization that tortured his parents.

***** He probably didn't remember his parent's torture. Although... he WAS surrounded with Dementors, we know there was one on the train, and we know that they can bring back memories... It's surprising that his boggart wasn't a Dementor making him relive his parent's torture.

****** According to [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_on_Frank_and_Alice_Longbottom#cite_note-GF30-1][this Harry Potter fandom site]], Frank was kidnapped first, taken to an undisclosed location, and tortured to madness. Alice was later also kidnapped and tortured.

>Frank Longbottom was the first to be captured.[2] He was subjugated and imprisoned at an undisclosed location, before being heavily tortured by all four of the Death Eaters with the Cruciatus Curse... When he was unable to provide them with anything useful, they targeted Alice. She was kidnapped and tortured in the same manner.

I guess I had always just assumed that they were tortured at their house by Death Eaters who had broken in and that Neville was hidden away before they could find him. It is worth noting that the source the Harry Potter fandom site uses is a broken link to Pottermore. I briefly checked Pottermore for more on Frank and Alice but couldn't find anything substantial on their attack.

*** Harry is a fighter by nature, he fights against the things he believes is wrong.

He fights against Snape's mentality, he fights against Malfoy's bullying, he fights against Umbridge's teachings.

The fact that his so called "family" treats him the way they do, and yet he can't really do anything about it because he "has to stay there for his own protection" must eat at him.

I could see it messing with him. Even if we push the abuse a bit more then what it was in canon. As long as it isn't extreme like fanfiction likes to do. I'd love for a story that focuses more on him realizing what the Dursley's did to him was messed up and shouldn't have been allowed, I'd love a story where he has to try and trust, and open up a bit more, instead of just shrugging it off and constantly saying I'm fine.

***** I think it's obvious the fact that Harry doesn't trust adults much, heck the fact that he was willing to go with Sirius, pretty much right after finding out Sirius was innocent, should be a red flag of how messed up he likely views his home life. But he's just so used to it, he doesn't think much on it, or likely tries to ignore it. Which is why he goes to his "I'm fine" mode, to turn off from the messed up stuff that happens to him because of his so called "family"

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
