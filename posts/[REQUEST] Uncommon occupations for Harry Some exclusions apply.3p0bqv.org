Request:Share a fic where Harry has a novel occupation. Incomplete, abandoned and oneshots are fine. The following options are off limits and any instances will be poo-poo'd with extreme prejudice.

- Auror: including but not limited to Master Auror, Auror Master, Auror Academy trainer or Hitwizard.

- Wardbreaker: Wards are non-canon, can be awesome (Bungle in the Jungle) however the occupation is sufficiently mainstream now.

- Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor: this includes him teaching this subject at other schools. Fics with him teaching a unique subject are fine.

- Dark Lord/Thief/Criminal Mastermind

- Unspeakable: these usually focus on situational intrigue/action but rarely on what it is an Unspeakable typically does when not fighting off a political coup or some nether monster. They can't be James Bonding it all the time.

 

Some examples to get things started:

- linkffn(7502511) Sea King. Fishing boat captain

- linkffn(11160991) 0800-Rent-A-Hero. Divination professor


** I like the idea of Healer!Harry. I find it hard to believe that Harry would want to be an auror after the life he lived, but being a healer still allows him to flex his 'saving people thing'.

Could make a great next gen fic about Harry being the school healer. Does anyone know if this exists? I'd love to see Harry bitching about how dangerous quidditch is, and how people keep getting hurt because they're irresponsible.

*** There's this ffn.net list of fics [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-as-a-Healer/107654/]]. I haven't read any of them. I have read /Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma/ where Harry is a Healer, but it's more of a side note in that story

That's a sentiment I've read a fair amount, and it does make sense. It's also possible to make a case for Auror Harry by playing up his desire to protect others.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/Incorruptible-The-Dementor-s-Stigma][Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma]] he's a healer.

I don't think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] quite fits any Auror jobs, but it does have him fighting as his job.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8551180/1/In-the-Mind-of-a-Scientist][In the Mind of a Scientist]] and its' sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9261735/1/Madness-at-the-Gate][Madness at the Gate]] he's a mad scientist/researcher.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7487494/1/The-Chronicles-of-Harry-Holmes][The Chronicles of Harry Holmes]] and its' sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7534803/1/Harry-Holmes-and-the-Web-of-Conspiracy][Harry Holmes and the Web of Conspiracy]] he's a Consulting Detective (Sherlock Holmes basically).

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5554780/1/Poison-Pen][Poison Pen]] he writes for The Quibbler and The Daily Prophet.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10083825/1/Harry-Potter-Pro-Quidditch-Player][Harry Potter - Pro-Quidditch Player]] he's obviously a Quidditch player.

I can probably find more, but I can't off the top of my head remember any names at the moment.

**** From what I remember, it wasn't obnoxious and it wasn't crammed down your throat, if that helps change your mind. It's also an old fic, not the oldest, mind, and I don't know the fanfiction trends of 2009/2010, so it could have been either before or during the =OMGLORDEVERYTHING= era.

***** I'd read it before, and re-reading it now was a bit harder. You are correct in that it does help to remember that it's older. It just makes me wish it could be redone, refined, etc. Also, I think the writers are older (like 40+), so they might not be as plugged into things like [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]], DLP, etc where tropes are discussed/dissuaded pretty strongly

**** I'm not sure if the Quidditch fic will be what you're looking for, then. If I remember right, it's just a oneshot interview.

I have just found a couple more, though.

Harry is the Muggle Prime Minister in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7037283/1/The-Other-Minister][The Other Minister]].

He does play Quidditch in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118263/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Heir-of-Morgaine-le-Faye][Harry Potter and the Heir of Morgaine le Faye]] (and it goes into detail) but I don't know how well the rest of the plot holds up to most peoples' standards. It's more of a nostalgia read for me.

TheEndless7 generally writes him as a quidditch star. Does getting inducted into SHIELD count as an auror job? A few x-over fics have him lurking around as a barista, florist, mechanic or whatever hipster job is trending before he joins the Avengers. Ignore the ffnbot deleted rec, it was very bad.

Straight up crack in what his job is, but it takes a absurd premise seriously. of course, given his job, you could make the case that it's incorrect, but only if you really hate beuracracy, or the ministry. He isn't the usual hermione cliche of the minister, either.
