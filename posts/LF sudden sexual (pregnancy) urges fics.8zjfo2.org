So i want any fics where characters (after the war prefered) have sudden sexual urges and get the help of their Partner to ease them. Whether these urges are caused by the hormonical chaos during pregnancy or a spontaneous Quickie doesnt matter, also if the activities are performed in Private or in Public occasions (even Family Celebrations)


** You mean stuff like... eating pickles with Nutella? Drinking the water from a glass of wieners? That type of urges? Because I remember my vegan sister eating raw minced meat with strawberry-ice-cream-sauce, claiming "The baby wants what it wants". Is that your kink?

*** My friend told me his wife asked for a block of cheese dunked in soy sauce once during her pregnancy.

**** Look, mate, your request wasn't exactly the clearest.

You really used big words and tried to dance around the dirty stuff. "I wanna read people getting suddenly horny, and then fucking. That's it. Don't care if it's in public or private. Sudden horniness. Then fuck. Me. Want. Smut." Gets the same point across a lot faster.

"sudden sexual (pregnancy) urges" doesn't clearly describe what you want very well. It comes off as "sudden sexual (or pregancy-based) urges". Which is where people are getting the 'block of cheese dunked in soy sauce' thing. Maybe "sudden sexual urges because of pregnancy" would get your point across better.

Also: /Wow/ hormonical is apparently an actual thing according to the Urban Dictionary. I thought you just wanted hormonal and used the wrong word.

***** in what mean is eating Food a Sexual urge? Its some kind of Fetish, like in Japanese taking Food from Womans Body and eat it. And yes, of course i meant sex. What on the Words "sexual urges" doesnt clarify Sex?

Oh and i know, that Females tend to eat many different things, but if i wanted to have this i had written "I want to read Fics where the Females have an urge to eat multiple different things because of their pregnancy", getting Horny on eating Food isnt what i was looking for.

" It comes off as "sudden sexual (or pregancy-based) urges". Which is where people are getting the 'block of cheese dunked in soy sauce' thing ", WoW O.o that is a really strange interpretation. So, if Females (pregnant or not) want to have Sex...they actually want to eat Food. And if they want to Eat something, then they want Sex.

Its like the typical saying "If a Girls says NO, it means YES"

That is not at all what I just said.

Pregnancy being in parentheses there is just really fucking weird. I can absolutely see how people would read that as "he wants sexual urges, /or/ pregnancy based urges. So "Sudden sexual or pregnancy based urges."

And I have 0 idea how you got that 'if a girl says no it means yes' is a typical saying or is at all reasonable. Nor do I understand how it's relevant.

/All I'm saying/ is that you can't get annoyed with people for making an honest mistake that's at least partially your fault.

That's all I'm going to say here, I'm done replying- I don't wish to get in an argument over this topic.
