** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence]] Haven't read it (its a WIP), but seems to be at least related to what you want.

** Have you tried Perspicacity's one-shot, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/14/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Hermione Interlude]]?

#+begin_quote
  A brief Hermione interlude was written for the Teachers' Lounge "Iron Fic" Challenge competition, a timed event, 1500 words with the prompt: "Is this real, or has it all been inside my head?"

Another, longer story is Watermage's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4183715/1/Awaken-Sleeper][Awaken Sleeper]]; 186k words, WIP (updated Nov. 2013). This one has magic though.

#+begin_quote
  For years Harrison Potter has been in a mental institution living dreams of magic, wizards, and dark lords. Eventually the dreamer has to awaken. His reality has to be accepted as fantasy. Although some things stay the same... Dresden Files xover.
