** First and foremost I'm going to rec you this as it is post OT but purely Star Wars. linkffn(5704904) is Darth Marrs at his finest, excellent world building and well outlined plot with a touch of grim-dark. The plot is very creative and it truly does the SW universe justice. I can't recommend it enough

Now onto the HP/SW crossovers. I've got 3 that fit your criteria all by the aforementioned Darth Marrs. I will reiterate that Darth Marrs has great world building and well outlined and well paced plots. However there are bits of darkness in these fics, but not overly so.

linkffn(4521407) is the best of these three, although the MC is not Harry but rather Ben Skywalker (Ben Skywalker being the child of Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade) This story does however take place in the HP universe, featuring Luna rather prominently with a solid characterization that (in my opinion) does her justice.

linkffn(11576387) is Harry being trained by the Jedi Master Kyle Katarn (Extended Universe) and Harry eventually interacts with the New Jedi Order, founded by Luke Skywalker after ROTJ.

linkffn(6859254) is a Harem fic, but is still rather well done. But it is by Darth Marrs and has quite a few iconic OT characters and manages to follow (very loosely) the path of the OT, so you will recognize the plot events although their are lots of little twists.

**** They read very differently. The setting of the Firebird Trilogy is in a dystopia leading to lots of less than pleasant things and a much more bleak outlook. These read much differently. That being said they do have a lot of new things (by virtue of being a crossover) that are pretty well explained; you shouldn't have much of an issue with them.

The 2nd and 3rd are very easy reads to follow; you should have no issue with those. The 4th has a couple of strange things, but the events follow (roughly) those of the OT so you shouldn't get too lost. The first has a lot of creativity which can make it a bit hard to follow as the established notions are not as present as in the others.
