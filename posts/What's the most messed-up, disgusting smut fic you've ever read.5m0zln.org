#+begin_quote
  Harry has ruled the magical world from behind the curtain for many years, but his ultimate goal is finally within sight. On this night, dreams become reality as he does what it takes to ensure that his silent rule never ends. The secret Tom Riddle never found, the source of true immortality. The true worth of a Veela.

  Harry's had enough. Enough of the lies, the manipulations, and the backstabbing. Now, he wanted to live for himself. Taking his Ex-girlfriend as his slave, and geting a very attaractive nine year old wife, Harry begins to form his army against those who would stand against him. An army of loyal slaves to carry out whatever orders he gives.

*** To be fair, you have to keep in mind that you must look at stories from the view of the world they lie within. This is true for ANYTHING that might be considered horrible in the real world, but in a created world for a book or movie, might actually fit the world.

For example, It would not surprise me at all, if death eaters or certain wealthy pure bloods dealt in sex slavery and very likely with underage children. Effectively.. rape or child rape. Now while this is horrible in most sane peoples views, it fits the concepts behind that aspect of the HP universe. Hell its even implied in cannon that taking the dark mark might include such behavior.

Where the line is drawn (in my view) is how detailed or focused upon such situations the story becomes. You can bring up child rape within the context of a perfectly acceptable story, even describing it or the consequences of it to a limited degree. But there is certainly a line that can be crossed where its being described or told in such a way as to be extremely detailed and sexualized.

Harry Potters universe is surprisingly dark and gory if you really look into it. Rape but one of a variety of things one could hate, despise, or be disgusted by, that could easily be worked into fan fiction and fit right into that world without perhaps... going too far.

*** I've unfortunately come across it a couple times (it wasn't tagged, etc) but my mind literally cannot comprehend the idea that someone could write something like that. It's as if my mind knows what I stumbled across, but my brain vehemently refuses it and shuts it out of my memory (for which I am thankful). Those people need to get seriously checked out. I've noticed that whenever there's something like that (in tagged stories) the summaries are full of !! This is bad!!! Don't do it!!! If you do it I hope you get castrated!! But, if you think it's so bad? Why are you writing it?

If anything I think it makes it worse, as some stories glamorize it. If they are aware of the issue enough to "channel" their feelings, they are aware enough to get help. The one time I actually read it only occurred because in my mind I couldn't comprehend someone writing about a CHILD that way. My mind kept insisting they were older, an adult, even though I knew that wasn't the case logically.

**** For some reason this description caught my eye and I read the first few chapters and got hooked on this fic! Of course it was REALLY dark at parts but I thought the plot was actually really well done and original. I also loved the ending (although the "Lily is a genius now" stuff was poorly explained). Anyway, although this fits OPs request technically, it's not really just fucked up PWP - this was a quality fic.
