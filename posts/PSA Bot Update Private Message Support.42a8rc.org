You can now call the bot via private messages! Just message the bot with your request!

This should be useful for those subs that don't have the bot. Request a couple fics, copy the beautifully formatted Markdown source, and post wherever you want.

It's also just a cool, nifty little feature I've been wanting to implement for some time.

To prevent abuse, though, I'll be limiting how many fics users can request. Don't worry, though, the counter will reset every day.

Have fun!


** AWESOME! This will be a hell of a lot easier than picking a random thread to drop a linkffn() in.

Also the markdown/source button is only on [[http://redditenhancementsuite.com/][RES]] which everyone should have anyway.

what's up with the link formatting though? doesn't doing it that way add a ton of extraneous characters?

**** Without the link formatting, managing Markdown formatting in code becomes nightmarish. The current method of formatting allows a greater degree of modularity and makes the code infinitely more readable.

***** I figured that's what it would be. I can imagine with all the special characters that making sure they come out as text instead of code is pain.

****** Yeah. If there's too many characters in a reply, the bot will split the message into multiple replies, so it all works out in the end.

**** No, you're just part bot. Cyborg, they call 'em. But thanks for doin' that, I wasn't entirely sure what the update actually did.
