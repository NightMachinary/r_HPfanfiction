Hey, so I've been looking for fics outside of ffnet and ao3 and found out there's some HP on wattpad. That said, I absolutely despise pretty much everything about that site, so any ideas if there's something actually worth reading?

Anything good on /Ao3/? I absolutely despise pretty much everything about that site.

** It's superior to FFN and AO3 in terms of writing and posting a fic, but the actual fics on there make AO3's slash bearable in comparison. Most, if not all of them are essentially fem-pandering fics that talk about how much of a prodigy Hermione is. And that, despite her lack of talent in potions during HPB, and general weakness in Duelling and Defense, she is the most talented of the trio.

**** No, you're quite right. Hermione was among the top of the class in potions, only bested by Harry because he followed superior instructions.

**** No you're not. I dislike Hermione a great deal for her personality and the way some people maker her out to be some kind of Godess but she is talented without a doubt. In potions she's the second best (6^{th} year) in the class, maybe tied with Malfoy but second. Slughorn is ready to hand over the liquid luck to her before he sees Harry's potion. With regards to the defense. I know she lost to the Boggart in third year and didn't complete the DADA practical at the end of the year. She also went down reasonably early in the Department of Mysteries. Neville, Harry and I think Luna were the last ones standing. I can't remember off the top of my head if she got an O or an EE on her OWLs for Defense but its wrong to say that she's weak as much as I dislike her.

***** Couldn't upvote this harder. She strikes me as the type of person at school who studies their way to perfection (helped along with some natural ability), but isn't 'instinctively brilliant'.

Her only EE came in DADA.

**** I believe it went like, she was only creating mediocre potions, and even sometimes failing. Thus getting jealous of Harry's burst of talent. I never understood why he didn't even attempt to retain the information in the book, he had apparently read through it multiple times.

**** It is a lack of talent to be so stuborn that you do not need help. Harry proposed to Hermione to follow the instructions but Hermione decided that she knew better. Actually it's more Hermione's too big ego as a lack of talent.

***** One one side you could argue that some scribbles in a book is not the safest thing to abide by. Given that a simple Boil Healing Salve can become a extremely volatile concoction that can melt pewter just because some ingredient was added the wrong way, Harrys casual use of the Prince's notes was downright asking for disaster. It was just dumb luck that the Prince turned out to become a Potion Master and was a prodigy.

On the other side, it is no surprise that Hermione hold books and their content in highest regard. Being trumped by scribbles on the side of a book - a desecration in and of itself - probably caused some logic in her brain to just have a meltdown.

***** I wouldn't exactly trust changes to potions, since potions can explode and other nasty things. Sure the ones he tried worked, but who knows if one of them won't work?\\
Of course I don't think that was Hermione's argument, but lack of using some source does not mean a lack of talent, it means a lack of using certain resources.
