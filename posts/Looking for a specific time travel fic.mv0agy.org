:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking to reread a particular fanfic that I can't seem to find anywhere. The premise was that for some reason I can't remember, Voldemort was not defeated and an adult Harry has to return from a broken future to the past and destroy all the horcruxes in a short time frame (that I think got even shorter due to a setback in the beginning?). I remember an epic fight with a monster (was it a sandworm?) when recovering the ring horcrux.

Unfortunately that's all I can remember, but I hope this sounds familiar to someone.

  Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours.
