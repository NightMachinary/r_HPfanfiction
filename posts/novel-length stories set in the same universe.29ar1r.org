Forever ago after rereading HP I started on a few ok stories set in US wizarding schools, but other than Alexandra Quick, couldn't really find anything that wowed me. I figured you guys might know of some if anyone did.

Length is a major bonus, I would love any series with several books worth of content, but am also ok with decently sized standalones.

School Quodpot teams not a requirement, but a major plus.


** Is the Alexandra Quick series any good? This is a serious question.

*** Though it's set in the same universe, it's certainly a different read. It didn't quite scratch the same itch as Hogwarts fiction did for me, especially since the author explores quite a few aspects of wizarding culture and the universe that are untouched in the original series. At least the first two books are probably worth reading, though to be honest I started to get bored of the stories after then.

*** You can read the comments from the last time it was posted, but overall it is quite good.

*** Yeah, I mean at least good enough that I'm up to current on the books and check the author's blog biweekly for updates.

There's politics, US-specific cultures and creatures, a Native American system of magic not completely invalidated by canon, and the rare reference to things that happened "in Britain in the 90's."

Regular complaints from other people though seem to be the way Alex handles certain situations and continues to push at every boundary and rule placed before her, they don't think it shows enough character growth. I have a hard time agreeing or disagreeing though because I feel like, if I were privy to a lot of the unfairness and corruption that goes on in the series, I'd probably be too mad to react rationally as well. Plus she's not much worse than Harry in that regard, just more proactive. I always feel like Harry just sort of /took/ adventures that were thrown at him, not really like he was participating in them. If Harry acted on any thoughts ever, he'd probably be a bit like Alex.

*** I think that it's quite fantastic, personally. It was almost like reading HP for the first time over again IMO (though not as good)- not the best fanfic I've ever read, which would probably be HPMOR, but it's up there.

Little bird's universe is amazing. It starts the day after canon finishes and is currently up to Albus's sixth year. A couple of stories are still WIPs.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/3435601/]]

This is a fantastic story revolving around Albus Potter. Currently in book 5 and regurally updated. (There was a couple of months that they petered off, but the author is back to every week now)

****** None off the top of my head. It's hard to find good multi books stories in this universe.
