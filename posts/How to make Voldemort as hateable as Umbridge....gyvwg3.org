I just saw this video, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFHUJ-afS9o][/I Created a Scene to Make Voldemort as Hate-able as Umbridge. It Worked/]], which was made last year. I have to say I think I might actually want to see a fanfic like this.


** That was a really great video, genius really. Voldemort is far too impersonal.
