** For me it's the realization that what I'm reading is a canon re-hash fic adhering religiously to every plot point from the books, no matter how minor, and isn't a parody.

** Well, I would say that some people read them because they're an instant turn on

*** That being said, there's tons of gen stories that are very good or have minor romantic subplots. If you're going for OP!Harry, then those may be a bit harder to find.

** You're getting downvoted for calling authors out. I do understand your point though. When I want a good wankfic, I go for the PWP/smutty stuff. When I want an actual, enjoyable fic? Not so much. That's why I go for action/adventure instead of romance.
