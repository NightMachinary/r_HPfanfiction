This is a strange request, but I'm looking for fics where Harry Potter, as the Master of Death, gets romantically involved with Death itself, preferably FemDeath.

I know this is a strange af pairing to ask for. Please try :)


** I really liked linkffn(Fair Lady by kideaxl) It is marked as a crossover with Sandman and I don't quite remember if Harry was MoD but it the romance was very nice and you don't need to know Sandman. I really enjoyed it.

  A strange child has become interested in an even stranger lady. She comes and goes as she pleases, but his fondness for her always stays the same. He may be scrawny, but he would get her attention.

*** God this one should come with warning signs. It got snape-whitewashing, and Harry is bi, and death is a he. This is not a fem-death story.

**** The fact that it's not a female!Death story is fairly obvious just from looking at the tags on the fic.

***** Tags doesnt say anything about death beeing male. Story is tagged as m/m but that could just be the wolfstar pairing. Nothing else indicates maledeath, snape apologist, or the wierd early story hints that gives the vibe that Harry wants to turn voldemort into tom riddle, because tom was charismatic? That said the story is very well written, and if i was into slash im sure i would love the story. Just too much fluff-slash for my tastes

****** Sorry, it was my mistake. I had missed the "Fem" before "Death". I still apologize.
