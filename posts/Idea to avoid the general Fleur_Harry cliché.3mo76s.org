Now, I've always been a Harry/Fleur fan, and as unlikely as the pairing is, if done right, it works really well. Thats the problem though; getting it right. Most stories in this pairing are atrocious, or pure smut, which although smut can be fun, it has a tendency to distract from the story. Now, even the ones that get it right, seem to follow a certain path. Almost all Harry/Fleur pairings begin in 4th year, and generally have a sort of love/hate relationship goin' on, due to the TWT going on. This is rather overused, and as much as I love the pairing, you have to do really well with this timeframe to avoid the norm and make something really good. So I thought, perhaps have them meet up again after GoF, in whatever situation you please, which opens up a decent amount of possibilities. And I know that Fleur gets with Bill at some point before Harry's sixth year, but I feel like this can be solved, and preferably without any Weasley bashing, as I like the Weasleys, including Bill. So, what do y'all think, would it avoid clichés and hopefully bring out some good Harry/Fleur?


** As long as you avoid common trope stuff like Veela bonds, making Harry 3 years older and randomly making the pairing into a three way with Hermione or Daphne Greengrass, you should be fine. I prefer to just stick with the basics, as jumping through too many hoops can make a story convoluted.

The summer after 4th year is an interesting spot since that's when Harry's name starts getting smeared by the Ministry. I think with how the end of year 4 played out, Fleur would easily believe in Harry over the English Ministry. A lot can be extrapolated from that.

*** Never liked Veela bonds much either, and any pairing between the two that I'd read probably won't have any. And unless someone does it really well, I dislike altering Harry's age, as its normally only done to have pairings make sense. This is another reason too have this pairing after 4th year. You see, there isn't too much of an age gap betweent Harry/Fleur, but more of a maturity gap, as 14 is a rather immature age, even if Harry is more mature then most, it just doesn't quite make sense. But if the pairing happens a year later, Harry is considerably more mature by this point, and it makes more sense.

** Harry/Fluer is really hard to write since she is a beauty icon that thinks of Harry as a little boy. Not saying it can't but done, but in terms of semi plausible pairings, this is one of the hardest to write.

In addition to that, all we get to go off of for Fluer is that she says mean shit about England, hates the food, and is a proverbial pampered princess that has a decent amount of magical talent. For playing such a large role in the fourth book, we don't really get a decent sense of her until the later books, and by then it's too late for a Harry/Fleur

*** To tell you the truth, I don't her being extraordinarily beautiful or her initial opinion of Harry are that hard to get around. The first is only a problem because most fics seem to have this strange idea that characters x and y need to meet in chapter 1 and be planning their wedding by chapter 3. There's no reason her being way out of his league physically has to make it impossible for them to be friends and for that to develop into something further. The second is never any problem at all. Unless a story has exactly zero character development, there's no reason Fleur's opinions can't change with time and interaction with Harry.

Long story short, I don't actually think Harry/Fleur is an impossible, or even difficult in theory, but that most authors are far too lazy/short sighted to go through the necessary character development to bring them together in a realistic relationship.

**** Sort of what I said just more thought out. It's really hard to write, just not impossible. I takes 10-20 chapters for this type of starting relationship to develop, which is why it seems rushed in so many fics. Most authors can't wait that long to get to the "good" part of a relationship.

***** I also don't want a sudden, "Yo, I love you" "Oh, so do I, 'Arry" "Great, lets elope" type of relationship. However, the relationship beginning would be different than most Harry/Fleur, since unlike in 4th year, where they're rivals, here they're friends, due to the whole Gabrielle thing, and the tournament being over. I still want it to be slow though, a progression from friend to best friend to love interest that feels real and well done.

** Not my ship, but I think the most plausible time for them to get together is as Fleur is getting close to the Weasleys but before she and Bill are married.

Once that happens, she and Harry start to have a life in common besides the TWT---they know the same people, have to deal with the same Wizarding Britain politicking, etc. And as she gets deeper into a world in which Harry is extremely important, she's less likely to see him as a child.

** The problem is that 4th year is really the only logical time for them to get acquainted. Before that they're in different schools, afterwards Fleur has already graduated. The story has to either be massively AU, or involve a post-Hogwarts hookup in order to avoid the cliche. Sometimes cliches exist for a reason.

*** I think its rather plausible, actually, since Fleur has a lot more freedom after she finishes school, and she does get a job at gringotts not long after. So its quite possible that they can meet up after 4th year.

** I know that a lot of writers try to start this ship in 4th year because of the TWT, but I always wanted to read one starting at the beginning of DH.\\
It shouldn't be too hard to say things just didn't work out with Bill and Fleur when they tried dating and she went back to France. Then when the Trio are force to go to ground they somehow get chased out of the UK and into France.\\
Given that he'd only know the 1 person in that country, he would seek her out for shelter while they regroup and things develop from there. Age would be less of an issue at 16-19 too, so that's a plus.

Or something post-Voldemort. I don't think there is anything for them hooking up after Voldemort has been killed yet. I'd read that.

** I just don't like fourth year fics at all, especially when there is a pairing. And unfortunately, as you mentioned, nearly all Harry/Fleur fics are set in fourth year. I understand why, of course. But I just feel like it'd be more interesting if they were to meet later in life since Harry at 14 still doesn't seem very mature to me.

Also, I hate everything and anything to do with Veela bonds/powers/allures. Especially when Harry is miraculously immune to any one of the above. It just completely kills the story, in my opinion.

*** Aye, I hear yah. Like said to someone else, there isn't as much of an age gap between 14-17, but more of a maturity gap. I'm usually not the biggest fan of fics where Fleur can throw Veela fireballs and shit, since she's only quarter Veela, though I might be able to tolerate it if the rest of the story is good. As for the allure, oh god no. My head canon is derived from a rather popular post on this subreddit saying that Fleurs "allure" is actually sound based, which is why people clog their own ears to avoid the effects of this ability. This, in combination with her beauty, is what actually effects people. As for Harry being "immune", no, not really. We know from the books that Harry isn't as affected as, say, Ron or Roger Davies, but I believe that if she sings in that way she does with the dragon, it should still effect Harry.

** There is a story called "Letters" it starts before fourth year, over the summer the students of Hogwarts write to a foreign pen pal for a summer assignment. Guess who starts exchanging letters with the chosen one? They aren't supposed to sign the letters or something, so Fleur thinks he's way older then he actually is. It gives them a good starting point because they don't know they were exchanging letters at first. It also has a big focus on quidditch, and some inter-house friendships. Edit: Fixed story title.
