Obviously it would still have to be very different, but I think it would be cool to see how similar it could be if Hogwarts were just a regular high school


** Ya and Harry's parents really do die in a car crash. And maybe the Voldemort type character is just some evil corporate dude that cut their breaks so they would not sell company secrets that he was breaking the law in a major way like tainting local water supply or something. So Mr burns basically. But one that murders. And Harry has to be hidden. Dursleys are bad enough anyway. It could be doable.

*** Voldemort can be corporate dude but he has to be a serial killer corporate dude. Who also has an unhealthy obsession life-extension technology

**** Why not have Voldemort as an assassin, with Dumbledore and the Hogwarts staff having dirt on him, preventing him from attacking Harry until that's dealt with?

****** It works perfectly as well, since, if we really want to go this route, you could have Fudge as a corrupt judge and Umbridge as the business woman. Keeps things lined up pretty well, and Lucius can at least be the lawyer for Umbridge's company

******* I feel like they should be more powerful. Fudge is the prime minister and Lucius is a very wealthy politician

******** I actually don't think so. Unless we want to have a police commissioner or the equivalent to that rank in the UK. In which case, Lucius or Fudge being that and corrupt could mean that other Death Eaters would be in different branches of government

** Maybe a version with Tom Riddle and his cronies as mafia figures and the Potters had to go into witness protection for whatever reason.

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is basically that. But this AU also has superpowers:

- The Weasleys are the Wellesleys. This Ron's grandpa is the Duke of Wellington, Arthur is the Marquis of Duoro, and Molly is a Princess of Prussia, most likely inspired by [[https://royalwatcherblog.com/2020/04/28/princess-antonia-duchess-of-wellington/][Princess Antonia of Prussia]] from our world.
- As a result, the Purebloods in this fic are British/European nobilities. Tom Riddle is the Lord Gaunt and bent on destroying the British democracy. He's also a genius mad scientist who has invented many cool technologies.
- Hogwarts is a spy school for the British elites and commoners with special talents. The kids undergo extreme training right from day one and are all very dangerous.
- Dumbledore is a former top spymaster and utterly manipulative and ruthless. However, he and his Order face overwhelming odds as Riddle has widespread support within the Ministry and among the aristocracy.
- James Potter was the 007 at the time of his death. Riddle targeted him not because of some prophecy, but because he obtained key intel about Riddle. Dumbledore tried to groom Harry into becoming the next 007.
- This fic is complete, goes through all 7 years, and loosely mirrors canon events. But the last year is very very different, and this Trio has compiled an astronomical body count.

*** Just checked it out. It's not written very well from the beginning at least.
