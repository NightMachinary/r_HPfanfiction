I was reading a fic yesterday, "what"s her name from Hufflepuff" and I misread something. I read 'Dance against the dark arts' instead of what it should be and it made me wonder what that would be like.

Voldemort and Harry facing each other for a dance off. Examinations in interprative dancing?

Capoeira style battle dancing with Magic (I think I read that allready).

I was also wondering what that would mean for the other courses. Danceformation. Danceology. Dancevination.

Just a silly idea


** There's a fic that is... surprisingly like this... Everyone is a muggle and doing ballet... Sadly it's abandoned.

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.

** "Harry, you can't confront Voldemort now! Not without the proper groove!" Hermione cried desperately tugging at his arm.

Through a heavy curtain of fog, Harry could see Voldemort waiting for their duel surrounded by his Death Eater crew. Voldemort held his battle ribbon in his gnarled bony hands. The long red strip of cloth looked like blood.

When Harry caught Voldemort's eye, the evil Danceror pirouetted threateningly and cracked the ribbon in the air like a whip. Green lightning struck the air.

"He's got dark rhythmic gymnastics on his side..." Ron shifted the boom box on his shoulder and something hardened in his eyes. "But I think you can do it. Believe in the music, mate. Believe in the music."

Harry nodded solely. He would never have the proper groove. Some part deep inside of him had always knew that. He'd just have to work with what he had. He always knew it was leading to this. This was his destiny.

Harry turned his flat cap backwards and steeled himself for battle. "Ron... drop the beat."

THE BEAT WAS DROPPED.
