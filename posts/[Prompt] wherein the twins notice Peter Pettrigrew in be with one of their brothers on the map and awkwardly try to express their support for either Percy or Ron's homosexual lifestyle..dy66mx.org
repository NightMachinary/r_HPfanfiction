** They checked again the night before, curiosity and disbelief running across their faces as they stared at the parchment.

"Fred? Do you think we should tell him?"

"Yeah. He's talking with us less and less, always snapping at people---"

"---and only studying. You're right. This isn't good for him."

"So... what do we tell him?" George asks, tentatively.

"That we support him, of course!"

"But it's---"

"Yes, George, I did not judge you either when you had that crush on professor---"

"Oh would you /please/ stop going on about that? It's been /two years/!"

"Sorry."

"So we just tell him?"

"Of course we do, we're his family."

That settled that. They both look at the wall of their dormitory, wondering how they've ended up being the responsible ones. Well, at least Fred is wondering that. George is currently imagining himself in a very /heated/ situation with one of his professors. Damn did she have a nice ass.

The parchment spread in front of them shows a rectangle that resembled a room, with two pairs of feet inked next to each other, under which were written two names. Peter Pettigrew. Percy Weasley.

​

Damn, this was going to be awkward. At least mum didn't know, that'd make a right mess of things.

"Um, Percy, listen. We need to tell you something," one of the twins starts with a hesitant tone.

"Yes? What is it, George?" Percy replies, looking up from the book he's reading.

"Well, um," George continues, unsure of how to approach the topic.

"I think we should get some privacy," Fred says with a grin. "I'm not sure you want to do this in here."

"You wouldn't want everyone to know, right?" George continues as Percy looks from George to Fred and back to George.

"I hope this is not another one of your silly pranks." Percy looks uncertain.

"It's not, Weasley honour!" the both chorus. It was still weird to see them do that. And Percy /lived/ with them!

"Okay, lead the way," he nods slightly. They did look serious. But then again, one could never be certain where the /Weasley twins/ were concerned.

​

"So what is this thing you didn't want to discuss in the common room?"

"Look, Percy, we really don't want to sound judgemental, or unsupportive, or anything," Fred starts after a brief silence, George nodding along, "we are here if you need someone to talk to. We promise we won't tell mum before you do---"

"What in Merlin's name are you two talking about?" Percy asks. No, this /did/ feel like a prank, and not an entirely pleasant one.

Fred takes a breath, looks at George, who gestures for him to continue, obviously also lost for words.

"Well, we just want to say that we know of, /you know/," Fred tries again, trying to sound gentle yet suggestive and failing miserably at both.

"No, I do not know. Look, I need to do my essays, if this is your idea of a joke, it is not funny," Percy scowls as he starts for the door of the unused classroom.

"Wait," Fred says, "we really don't mind. Right, George?"

"Yeah," George agrees, "we're cool about it."

Percy knew it. It was a prank. Why did he let himself be talked into this? He was about to open the door when Fred grabs his hand, his eyes a bit wide. "You're not angry with us, right?"

/What?/

"Fred, George. I really do not know what you two are talking about."

"Percy, there is nothing wrong with preferring to polish broomsticks," George decides to take a leap of faith.

Percy looks utterly lost. "But I don't like Quidditch, it's in the air and dangerous and---"

Fred looks at George. George looks at Fred.

Fred nods at George, who nods back. This was going to take all their Gryffindor courage.

"Percy, there is nothing wrong with having sex with another man, we really don't judge you for---"

"WHAT!"

** I think there is a story of this and it begins during their first year and notice Pettigrew with Percy. I think it is the prologue to a story with Sirius and Harry.

**** Honestly I could see that happening. 14-15 year old Percy and a dude sleeping in the same bed? Okay, fine let Percy keep his secrets. We won't tell. 11-year-old Ron sleeping in the bed with the SAME dude? Alarm bells.
