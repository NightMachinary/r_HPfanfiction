linkffn(Wicked Hermione by Romantic Silence) I really like this fic but it appears to be abandoned. Can someone take it up and continue it?


** Unfortunately, I dont think you'll have any luck finding someone. Most authors have their own style, and rarely are they capable of finishing another's work without distinct differences. Also, there's always the worry that an author will come back, see you took up their story, and have it removed and possibly ban you (depending on the site).

*** Sigh. I figured it's something like that :( so many great fic ideas out there that are abandoned. I don't even mind different styles, or even a rewrite since it's often the idea behind the fic that I'm interested in reading.

*** There's nothing to stop someone from basing a fanfic on a fanfic, as long as the original author gets credited. It would be pretty hypocritical for a fanfic author to complain about someone basing fanfic on their work.

Of course, there's also nothing stopping the original author from taking down their incomplete story, and someone else making a copy of it and posting it would be plagiarism.

*** That's illegal. Fanfic has to be free.

**** Not illegal as such, no. It's complicated and depends on your jurisdiction, but while, say, offering downloads of a fanfic for money would almost certainly cross the line in every jurisdiction, paying someone to write fanfic (which is then posed for anyone to read) may well be OK. I know of a number of fanfic writers who have Pateron accounts, for example, though they could just be too small-time to draw legal attention.
