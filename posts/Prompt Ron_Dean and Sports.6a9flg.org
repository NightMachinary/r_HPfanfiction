So I've had this idea of a Ron and Dean friendship or romance which either begins because of their love for "bad" sports teams the Chudley Cannons and West Ham United. It seems to me that their are a lot of parallels between West Ham and the Chudley Cannons and both Dean and Ron are big fans. I was also kind of inspired by a Ginny/Draco story where Draco forgets he is a wizard and is a West Ham fan and Ginny goes to Dean for help. I'm not much of a writer so I figured I would post this here to see if anyone would take the idea and run with it. I really like Ron and Dean as characters and I just want to read more stories featuring one or both of them in a positive way. If you know of any stories that are like this please link them!

Thanks!
