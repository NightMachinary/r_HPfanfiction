I'm looking for any story where the protagonist, prefererably Harry has some kind of involvement with the Fae or other Eldritch creatures.

​

By the eldritch, it can be something undefined, the things that go bump in the night or the Old Ones. How that plays out is irrelevant as long as it's a major theme in the story.

​

In regards to the Fae, I'm looking for any Harry Potter fanfiction that references but preferably include the fae. The winter queen especially, Maeve and Aurora too. Generally anything including the fae as a separate supernatural entity. I think this big in Dresden, but I'm not familiar with that world.

I'm aware of Circular Reasoning, Partially Kissed Hero

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

** Have you done a subsearch for Lovecraftian/Eldritch stuff people have recc'ed in the past? Even in my 8 months of being here, there's been a lot of requests for Lovecraftian Stuff. Pretty much everything I could mention has been mentioned there already and there are a lot of big lists in those threads, so I don't know if I'd just be reposting stuff you've found before.

The only new Lovecraftian one I know is Touched by the Arcane by lisbeth00 (Link below). It's Harry in Bloodborne, basically. If you're not familiar, Bloodborne is a Dark-Souls like video game that takes place in Yharnam, a labyrinthine Gothic City-of-Horrors with a church of Blood Healing that fucked up big time.

In terms of Fae, I know of two interesting ones. The first is Faery Heroes - Harry, Hermione, and Luna are together and go back in time/to an alternate universe at the behest of the Queen of the Fae. It's vaguely cracked, a decent proportion of bashing, and a fun, rompy, thievery read with some moments of insight and no 'adult time travellers try to fit in with children' weirdness.

linkffn(8233288)

The second is The Traveller. It's the third part of a series where Voldemort won then got pretty much deposed while the Purebloods run things and Harry went hermit. The Traveller is a really interesting Dark Fables vibe that I really enjoyed.

  Sequel to 'To Play the Devil'. Harry and Tom left our world behind and found themselves in a world filled with the night-time fears of mankind. The washerwomen guard the fords; reapers walk the noon-day fields, and the Gentry are riding. Worst of all, Death himself has taken an interest in them, and he has a plan. Enter a land of fairies, enchantment and fear.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
