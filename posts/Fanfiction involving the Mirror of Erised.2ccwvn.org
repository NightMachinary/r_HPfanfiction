As the title indicates, please post fan fiction where the Mirror plays a key role. Thanks in advance.


** Here's a bit of an interesting one, a favorite of mine:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks]] By: Paimpont

#+begin_quote
  Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else remembers her. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student.

Definitely one of the best stories in the fandom.

For something completely different, but still related to Erised (somewhat), try this one:

#+begin_quote
  Left bitter and angry when his female self leaves him, Harry decides he will do anything for revenge. Nobody will stand in his way. Because desperation and anger can turn even the most noblest of hearts into darkness... HarryFemHarry COMPLETE

Crazy story with Harry/FemHarry pairing, lots of fun stuff.

** [[http://www.greyblue.net/MidnightBlue/chapter.php?storyid=2&chapterid=1][The Mirror of Maybe]] is a pretty good abandoned HP/SS fic (some smut) from back in 2002.

Basically, Harry gets sucked into the mirror, and lives out a possible future as computed by the mirror, before being spit out an hour later, with a ~15 years of memories into his teenage body.

More or less a peggy sue, but with a slightly different premise. Better than it sounds.
