** During his Undesirable No 1 status? Sure. But before that it's a no go. Remember, everyone believed Sirius to be Death Eater and the Ministry use it as an excuse to surround their /own children/ with dozens of literal soul-suckers to protect their precious Harry Potter, without Wizengamot howling for blood. The only Death Eater who can cast Patronus was Snape, and it's very likely none of the Slytherin (unrepresented in DA, both the OG and expanded incarnation) are capable. Potter and dark sympathizer were on the polar opposite of public popularity.

When Voldemort have recently risen, the Ministry did their best to smear Potter's image all year long, but that highlight the fact that they need to do it in the first place, instead of just one third page article "Auror office dismiss unsubstantiated rumors about You Know Who resurrection".

Lucius were a joke, he can't even keep his school governor seat, and for all Draco's claim of how influential were his father, he always stay behind Fudge, and got life sentence in Azkaban after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. That screams a rich boy people only tolerated for his wallet.

But, yeah, in fanfics you can even have him leading Wizarding Britain and forced the Light family and even Dumbledore into exile, like in linkffn(11773877)

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** There is a legal mechanism, called a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder][Bill of Attainder]], a law in which some specific person is declared to be guilty of a crime and ordered punished. It is specifically prohibited in the US Constitution but not technically prohibited in many others.

And, there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7284194/19/The-Terrible-Ideas-Bin][an excellent one-shot by The Mad Mad Reviewer]] in which Dumbledore explains that that's why Sirius can't be freed easily.

A related idea is a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/kbo413/writs_of_outlawry_or_why_fudge_could_have_stabbed/][Writ of Outlawry, that I just posted about]], which is close to what you are describing: if Harry were declared outlaw, it would be lawful to do anything, up to, and including, murder, to him.

I don't know of any fics in which Harry is a subject of a Bill of Attainder or a Writ of Owtlawry, though.

*** *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill%20of%20attainder][Bill of attainder]]*

A bill of attainder (also known as an act of attainder or writ of attainder or bill of penalties) is an act of a legislature declaring a person, or a group of persons, guilty of some crime, and punishing them, often without a trial. As with attainder resulting from the normal judicial process, the effect of such a bill is to nullify the targeted person's civil rights, most notably the right to own property (and thus pass it on to heirs), the right to a title of nobility, and, in at least the original usage, the right to life itself. Bills of attainder passed in Parliament by Henry VIII on 29 January 1542 resulted in the executions of a number of notable historical figures. The use of these bills by Parliament eventually fell into disfavour due to the obvious potential for abuse and the violation of several legal principles, most importantly the right to due process, the precept that a law should address a particular form of behaviour rather than a specific individual or group, and the separation of powers.
