What is your favorite fan-fiction SS/HG story? (link?)

I read hundreds of these stories and I have to say I admire the whole community for doing this.

My favorite and the first I ever read many years ago (and read repeatedly afterwards) is The Fire and the Rose and its sequel: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/676157/1/The-Fire-and-the-Rose]]


** Full disclosure, I'm not the biggest fan of SSHG. Most of the time, if they're a pairing in a fic I'm reading, it's because something about the fic's premise interested me. Still, I think I have a few.

Suppressed linkao3(10841232) is a fun one where they're forced to be work partners in the Department of Mysteries.

Unforgiven Pride linkao3(7046629) is an ongoing slow burn that updates pretty often and is as much about politics, Ministry corruption, and PTSD as it is about romance, although the romance is becoming more of a focus as the fic goes on.

#+begin_quote
  Post-war politics is just as deadly as ever, when you are called Severus Snape and you are accused of war crimes... But when past students who should hate you prove to be your staunchest allies, you might just decide that life is worth living. Many canon characters. Adult themes. Slow build. EWE. Continuation of Unforgiven Love but can be read independently.I'm not JKR, I don't own anything about Harry Potter, and I don't make any money.

** I basically only read SS/HG when Hermione has been out of school for a while and is in her mid twenties or so. Here's a couple that fit that bill:

A Rare Bird: linkffn(3434345)

Cleaning Cauldrons: linkffn(6169069)

Of Myth and Magic: linkao3(2758970)

Advanced Contemporary Potions Making: linkao3(304284)

Also...req'd often but worth mentioning bc it's the story that got me hooked on this pairing is Unfinished Business by Ramos: linkffn(2230284)

** You know, as hard as I try, I cannot see the appeal of that pairing. Please explain how the thought of a romantic involvement with Snape can trigger something besides your puke reflex because I am genuinely interested what people see in the racially motivated war criminal with bad personal hygiene that makes him appealing? Help me to understand it because the only thing I see going for him is being played by Alan Rickman.

*** I'll try to explain from my perspective, I am not sure if others feel it the same way.

First of all I was always attracted to older charismatic men. As an example my celebrity idols consist/ed of Johnny Depp, Hugh Laurie, Alan Rickman, Benedict Cumberbatch etc. All of these men are very charismatic and much older than me, I'm 22. You can see that none of them (well maybe except Johnny) are particularly attractive from the beauty point of view, but I always loved the "aura" around them . Even my boyfriend is 10 years older than me so that would be the first thing. I was never really attracted to guys my own age.

Second, I liked Snape character even before I knew he was on the good side, again his charisma, intelligence and the mystery about him intrigued me. I want to know more about him and his story, I want to know whats underneath. The personal hygiene - I always imagine (and it is mentioned in many of these fanfics) that his hair aren't greasy because of hygiene but because he spends all his time in the humid potions classroom or laboratory where he brews. War criminal - not really, he was just "at the wrong place in a wrong time", he made a mistake and now he carries on an agenda for the greater good, he isn't a villain, he is an anti-hero. He is the "bad boy" per say. His life was hard and loveless and I guess that's what makes us swoon the most....we as women want to comfort men, and give love to those who need it. And Severus Snape needs it.

To why HG/SS, from what I wrote it's pretty obvious, younger woman/older man of the same thirst for knowledge and learning, very intelligent people and who else would be a better match for SS from the Harry Potter universe in these aspects?

Let me know what do you think!

**** He voluntarily joined the magical Waffen SS (Death Eaters) and they were pretty open about the whole genocide thing. He did this after begging his former friend for forgiveness because he called her a mudblood. You don't say these words at random unless you are actually using them in some context (and considering Snape's friends at that time, the context becomes pretty obvious). Their style of combat breaks the Geneva convention (attacking civilians, children, not always wearing distinctive uniforms) making every single Death Eater a war criminal by default.

Then we have the other things, which make me wonder if we have read the same books. Because there was not a single incident where Snape was charismatic. He constantly bullied children without reason and made fun of an abused boy due to his own teenage rivalry with a man buried for a decade. Add to that the fact that Snape deliberately tried to get Sirius killed at least twice and enjoyed mind raping Harry in what he called Occlumency lessons (he never gave any instructions or tried to explain the subject) and I fail to find many people less desirable than him.

***** Well this would be for a longer discussion. I see it a little differently. I am not saying what he did was not bad, not at all, but we have to consider that he was left by his only true friend because of one mistake, calling her a mudblood (which he obviously didn't even mean seriously) in a moment of weakness when he was tortured by her friends. He apologized endlessly and she never forgave him (it shows she didn't even know him and didn't care about him hard enough, if she would have, she would have taken him back). So he lost his only friend, his parents were dead, he finishes school and has nowhere to go, he is vulnerable and disappointed by life... only place he kind of fits in is withing the death eater ranks so he joins them. He finds out very quickly that it is not the right way to go, but unfortunately it is too late, he cannot just leave, so he seeks forgiveness from Dumbledore and basically gives him his life so Dumbledore can do whatever he wants with him. AD has a plan and SS knows Voldemort will come back, it makes sense (also as introverted and private he is) that he doesn't let anyone in and tries to repel people as much as possible. He is bad to everyone because he doesn't want people to get closer to him, he doesn't want to show weakness. Yes he could've been nicer to Harry but to be honest I never found the things he's done to him that bad, they were just unfair, as unfair as was bullying from James and Sirius when he was at school. As far as I know Sirius wanted to kill Snape by luring him to Lupin while transformed. I kind of understand that they will not be friends... His life tragedy is built on the fact that he could never really show his true colors and he could never show the good in him. It came up only after his death. You have to admit that if SS would not do his job, Harry Potter wouldn't survive even the first year of Hogwarts (Quirell). He wasn't nice to him, but he protected him all his life (an offspring of the woman he loved with a man he hated the most). If he wouldn't do it, Harry or anyone else would never be able to defeat Voldemort. His life was incredibly difficult, being under two masters at once, not having the right to do what he wants, just following orders until his death...

Just a quick note: from my perspective Harry never really did anything so big, without luck and help of his friends and professors he would be nothing. The real hero of the whole story is Snape, although anti-hero, without him Voldemort would never be defeated. He was the key to everything.

****** Snape joined around seventeen and wanted out at 20 just because Voldemort was targeting a single person. Not because he realised that the whole racial genocide was wrong, but because of a woman. That's three years in a gang of murderers. He could have left at any moment, he had a muggle father so using a plane to Auckland is within the realm of the possible.

And Snape had other friends, those who Lily found creepy because they were doing sick shit and Snape tagged along. Snape had top marks in Potions, he could have found a job somewhere that did not require murder and rape.

And the Quirrel thing does not really count since there were other teachers present and at least McGonagall and Flitwick should know the first year levitation charm, which would have caught Harry with ease.

******* Well I guess we can agree to disagree. From all information I have from pottermore and the books I see him this way. You see him another way and that's fine. I just think there is more to him and the way Rowling talks about him, makes me feel like he was the secret hero of the story.

*** Well then why did you comment? And a lot of them are not with a girl under the age of consent(it is 16 in England), usually just over it and a lot of them are based either in time travel(so they are the same age) or she has long graduated.
