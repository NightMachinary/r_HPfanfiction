Been reading a lot of great stories lately, but for some reason I am now in the mood for the most op Harry story anyone can find. I've read a lot of the popular ones from Core Threads to (shudder) StargateSG1Fan1, so anything more obscure would be appreciated. Also if possible looking for either complete or at least past fourth year.

P.s. Also I know a lot ask for this, but I ask you to please humor my temporary insanity, and I should be back to reading the best of the best soon.

P.p.s. What I meant by the earlier paragraph is that i've read a lot of the more popular OP Harry's, but those were just two examples of a good popular OP Harry story(Core Threads) to just the most cliche of OP Harry Potter stories(StargateSG1Fan1) while not bad I wouldn't put it on my top 100 list.

This is the censored version of StargateSG1Fan1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1395727/stargatesg1fan1]]

And what I believe is a OP Harry story done pretty damn well. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads]]

Also one of my favourites. I consider this story just plain fun. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby]]


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10681251/1/Lightning-Dragon-s-Roar][Lightning Dragon's Roar]] is probably the dumbest fic I've ever enjoyed reading. His fight with the horcrux is literally a pokemon battle. Like both of them have 6 pokemon and they fight using them.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11975368/1/The-Stormreaver][The Stormreaver]] is pretty fun so far if you know a little bit about WoW (I know next to nothing). Harry gets teleported back to the HP universe for second year after 7 years as a Warlock's apprentice or something. It hasn't been a total stomp so far but all the direct conflict so far has been a slaughter.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For the Love of Magic]] is alright. I kinda gave up on it after it got all smutty though. Had some interesting ideas in it though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12188248/1/Dead-Man-Walking][Dead Man Walking]] I'm a sucker for dimension travel Alternate Harrys so I don't know how good this is objectively. I enjoyed it though. It's a Harry from another dimension where Voldemort took about a month to get resurrected after he got blasted in the face traveling to a universe where parents and 3 siblings or something. He's also got some sort of Pseudo-Cable thing going on.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse]] bazillion year old master of death Harry gets summoned to canon Harry's universe to kill Voldemort and pretty much just dicks around.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12410115/1/Harry-the-Blood-Demon][Harry the Blood Demon]] is alright. He's some sort of demon that steals people shadows or something. Author also has a fun Blob/Changeling Harry fic and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12610360/1/We-Harry-Potter][one where Harry turns into a 5 headed dragon with a different Harry in every head]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2400483/1/Anarkia][Anarkia]] has him as some sort of super dupe potions genius or something who went to a special school for special people. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][Second Chance at Life]] has Harry fleeing Britain to go to a super school for super people and werewolves, alien elves, demons, vampires ect. Great fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1429871/1/The-Fourth-Power][The Fourth Power]] This fic is worth a read just because of how fucking funny it is.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7436608/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Life-Changing-Head-Injury][Harry Potter and the Life Changing Head Injury]] Greatest. Dumbledore. Ever.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353683/1/The-Girl-Who-Loved][The Girl Who Loved]] This one is the Second. Greatest. Dumbledore. Ever. Just get through the first chapter and you'll see what I mean.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11035459/1/Oblivion][Oblivion]] Harry is some god-demon-thing from the Elder Scrolls series incarnated into a human body.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959046/1/The-Lesser-Sadness][The Lesser Sadness]] Harry makes a bargain with some devil things or whatever and gets powerful. /Really/ wish this one would update.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6655313/1/Something-Like-Your-Family][Something Like Your Family]] Bashy stompy fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/1/The-Snow-Queen][The Snow Queen]] Crossover with Hunger Games. Fem Harry is raised over there and gets summoned for the tournament. The second task is awesome.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4019608/1/Agent-Double-O-Hex][Agent Double O Hex]] Harry is adopted by James Bond and fights his arch rivals and things.

  Mrs Weasley looked doubtfully at Tonks, who was still out of it. Then she looked at Fudge, who was rotund and pudgy and probably not very trustworthy around young girls (or anyone at all for that matter, because he was a politician). "I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD -" she began.

  "Nonsense," Dumbledore interrupted cheerfully, casting a silent Imperius Curse on her as he said the word. "Your family needs you."

  "YOU'RE RIGHT, ALBUS. IT'S FOR THE GREATER GOOD." Mrs Weasley grabbed some Floo powder, threw it in the nearest fireplace, yelled 'DIAGON ALLEY!', dove in, and was gone. At last.

  At long last.

  "Albus," said Fudge, in a rare moment of insight, "wasn't 'For the Greater Good' Gellert Grindelwald's..." He turned around and walked away, having been hit by a silent Imperius, Obliviate, and a hex that would make his toenails slowly turn into zucchinis.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  There is a lot more to magic than simply waving a wand and saying a spell, something Harry Potter knows all too well. After all, when a mere mouth full of someone else's blood can drastically alter your life, learning magic's secrets is a must. (Amoral!Monstrous!Ravenclaw!Harry. No bashing, no romance.)
