:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic I read a while ago where Harry is a widower or something, and he starts going to this cafe or diner, and it's written from the perspective of a lady who works there at first, and she notices that he only orders black coffee I think, and eventually he warms up to her, and he brings his kids there sometimes, and in the end Harry and the OC end up together. Does anyone know it?


** Grow Young with Me - linkffn(11111990)

Probably the best Harry Potter romance fanfic. I love the characterization.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

**** Slow update (once or twice a year for the last 2 years?) but awesome story. The author keeps the reader updated on her Tumblr though. Look for the same name as on FFN
