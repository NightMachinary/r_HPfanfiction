** Yes. Better question is why would he bother doing that? If he wants to stay hidden, he would conceal his identity more thoroughly than that (and your forgetting about the scar too, which would not be long concealed). On the other hand...he is an eleven-year old boy with the sense of invincibility that most teens and pre-teens have to have kicked out of them by life, so I doubt he would think that far.

As for the wizards? Of course they would notice, and question, and probably believe it too whether he denies it or not. The Hogwarts letter is going to go to a Harry Potter, and McGonogall is going to call out his name either way in the Great Hall.

** I have limited knowledge of this type of story, but I'm pretty sure the solution is Polyjuice most of the time.

*** Some rando kid constantly nipping from his flask would probably get some raised eyebrows and extra scrutiny.

**** "I'm diabetic," said Ricardo Fault, the Muggleborn Gryffindor boy who definitely wasn't the prophesied savior of the wizarding world. "This is my medicine."

"That makes sense," agreed Neville Longbottom.

"You don't drink insulin out of a flask," said Hermione, exasperated. "I keep telling you all - Polyjuice Potion has a very distinct scent, and that flask smells exactly like how the book describes it."

The stares of the other Gryffindors were intensifying every moment in the pregnant silence that followed.

"I'm... Polyjuicing myself... into someone that /isn't/ diabetic," said Ricardo, haltingly.

The crowd of students digested that.

"That also makes sense," agreed Neville, as Hermione put her face into her robes and let loose a muffled scream.

**** People in the real world are also not very smart. There's been a lot of studies (and celebrity experiences) where people don't recognize other people they know or who are famous just because of minor differences like not wearing glasses or different styled hair.

** I think the only thing that got him recognized was his scar or that he looked exactly like James. So, no.
