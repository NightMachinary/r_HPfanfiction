I was hoping someone could tell me a couple decent animagus fics.

I do like longer stories and if there is a pairing I would like it to be Harry/Hermione or Harry/Luna.

Also good fics in general involving those pairings would be wonderful.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]]: Following the events of the Goblet of Fire, Harry spends the summer with the Grangers, his relationship with Hermione deepens, and he and Hermione become animagi.

*** I really liked how the animagi process was handled in Vox Corporis, it's been my head cannon since I read it.

**** I agree when I read other fics now the process always seems rushed or steps are skipped.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2919503/1/Luna-s-Hubby][Luna's Hubby]] by Meteoric Shipyards has Harry becoming an animagus and is one of the better Harry/Luna stories out there. 196k words, complete.

  7 year old Luna wants a husband, and she wants one now. With the unintended help of her befuddled father, she kidnaps Harry Potter. Idea and 1st chapter by Roscharch's Blot

Jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] and sequel have an interesting take on the animagus transformation. They're nominally Harry/Luna (though not really--Harry manages to sleep with most everyone but Luna). Two novel-length stories, complete.

  Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

The animagus transformation plays a pretty big role in Miranda Flairgold's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]] and sequels. Gen, two complete novels, a third is abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war.

The "Who can give Harry the strongest animagus form?" battle has been won by Perspicacity with his longish one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/13/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Strange Aeons]]. Harry's form is [[/spoiler][Cthulhu]].

*** Hmm I've read most of second chance of life but got sorta disappointed because I thought there was only the one book, may pick it up again.

Thank you

*** I loved a second chance at life, and I was so sad when it was abandoned. Any idea why?

**** I think the author may have just lost interest, or else, like The Santi or Perspicacity, had real life issues come up that got in the way of her fanfiction writing.

If I recall correctly, she was a geologist who would write on down times when doing field work, then would upload several chapters in a short time once she again had internet access. It may be that a career change made this fanfiction-friendly lifestyle untenable.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero]] I think this story is slightly overrated but if you havn't read it and like H/HR give it a shot
