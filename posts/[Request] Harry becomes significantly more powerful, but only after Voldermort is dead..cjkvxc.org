  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

** If you don't mind Drarry, the Charming series linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/690093/chapters/1267881]]) has some pretty neat magic in it from a powerful Harry. You can start with the one-shot that inspired the series, which is the 4th in the series, or you can just start with the first part of the prequel, which is the one I linked to.

It's a common trope for OP harry or Indy!Harry, but usually takes place during his school years. I though something like this set post Hogwarts would be interesting.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...
