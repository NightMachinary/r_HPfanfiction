J.K. Rowling revealed in a recent interview that at one point in the writing process for the final book, /Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows/, Dolores Umbridge was going to become Minister for Magic. During Voldemort's reign at the Minister, the Dark Lord appoints Pius Thickness as his puppet Minister for Magic. However, Rowling original considered the hated Umbridge in mind for Voldemort's minister. Where Umbridge would willingly work with the Death Eaters and reign in many of Voldemort's anti-miggleborn laws.

Note: Once again, this isn't real, I just do these for fun.
