So wat im looking for is basically a harry that is practically his Dad. He pranks, jokes, and backs it up with a good knowledge of magic. Obviously there would be character growth for their to be a story so he could change throughout i guess. Other things: Dont particularly care if Voldemort is there, i want the focus of the story to be harry enjoying himself. Romance: i think it would add to the story if it was an aspect but not that fussed. Things id like to see but not deal breaking more weasley twins, and more Neville.

Cheers

*** I guess so. Edit: except every indy!harry story i have read does also include and emphasise on Voldemort and the fight against him, i don't really want something like that.

I think your rec ticks that box rather thoroughly.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** There was one I read a while ago where Harry's parents were still alive and he had younger brothers and sisters. It was Harry/Hermione and basically followed the same romantic storyline as Lily/James with Harry being all arrogant and chasing after Hermione while she got annoyed by him. Eventually they got together.

I can't remember the title unfortunately but if anyone knows what story I'm talking about, hopefully they can link it? Sorry this probably didn't help at all lol. I'll try looking for it though

Edit: found it linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7038175/1/Like-Father-Like-Son]])
