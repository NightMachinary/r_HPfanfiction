It had been hosted on a site called ultimatehpfanfiction.com (which, frustratingly, didn't have a "download to epub" function, and it didn't work with ficsave.xyz).

The ultimatehpfanfiction site appears to be down.

Does anyone have a copy of the story you could send me or a link that would send me in the right direction?

** Ach, [[https://web.archive.org/web/20160406035351/http://ultimatehpfanfiction.com/ginny/dho][close]] but the link from there breaks...

There's an old contact address [[https://web.archive.org/web/20161026042044/http://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/faq][here]], maybe you can try asking them?
