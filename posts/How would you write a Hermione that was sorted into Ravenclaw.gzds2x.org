** As a bitter loner.

Or a villain.

Here me out.

In Ravenclaw she'll be no more noticed than any other smart but not exceptional Ravenclaw (Carmichael got 9 Os as well) and if we're keeping in line with her canon characterization, she's not making any friends until Krum 4th year.

So you start out with a lonely 11/12 year old with a vindictive streak watching other smart people make friends. You have this as a romance or friendship redemption story starting in 4th year with Krum. Or you can just make her a worthy villain, which seems pretty easy to do from here.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

*** I don't buy it.

Carmichael could have been lying, and if he were telling the truth, he only got them thanks to the potion. Or, he could be the top student in his year---which is the one before Hermione's.

However, we see a lot of direct and indirect evidence that Hermione is easily the best student in her year. We see that magic comes very easily to her---she learns new spells practically at will, before she even starts Hogwarts. Her grades are good enough to get a Time Turner in Year 3 despite being Potioned or Petrified for much of her second year. Every time new magic is introduced in class, she is the first to master it (that Harry sees). Ravenclaws are impressed by her Protean Charm in OotP. Lucius Malfoy is annoyed that Draco's grades were surpassed by Hermione in particular. And, that's without getting into how much time she "wastes" on reading for fun, her annual crusade for justice, or the annual Harry crisis.

Nor do we see any real evidence that Ravenclaws are that much better as students on average. They pride themselves on their wit, but inventors tend to come from Gryffindor and Slytherin. Ravenclaw is a house of paper-pushers and model train obsessives as much as it is a house of scholars.

But, the biggest problem with this premise is that while early Hermione's attitude was anathema to the prevailing Gryffindor culture, it would fit well into the very Ravenclaw culture that bullied Luna, for better or for worse.

So, much as I like a good DangerousLoner!Hermione or WorthyVillain!Hermione, I think she'd actually be pretty happy in Ravenclaw, and she might even emerge as the leader of a gaggle of Ravenclaw girls in her year. I just hope that she has enough of that Gryffindor righteousness left to keep from joining in Luna's bullying.

**** - No amount of "extra brain power" is going to improve spell casting abilities.

- Percy got 12 top marks with or without a time turner

- one Ravenclaw is impressed and then proceeds to ask her why she wasn't a Ravenclaw

You can't possibly know which canon characters are Ravenclaws with this description.

I never said Ravenclaws were better students on average. I said she wouldn't stand out amongst those that were.

Learning for attention isn't a problem in Gryffindor. Being top or near top of your class isn't frowned upon. If that were the case James, Lily, Sirius, McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Bill would have had a hard time of it.

What is an anathema is being a bossy know-it-all and hypocritical stickler for rules, which /is/ what 11 yr old Hermione starts out as and that's not suddenly going to change because of a sorting. Rules stop applying to others because of Harry and Ron, who only became her friends because of circumstance. The events of canon aren't going to play out with her in Ravenclaw.

Also, 4th year Cho is the leader of a gaggle of (giggling) girls and one of the most popular Ravenclaws. Her personality couldn't be more different from Hermione's.

***** In canon, general intelligence (i.e., "book smarts" or capacity for book smarts) is very highly correlated with magical ability. Together with personality, it explains almost all variation we see in magical ability. There are practically no wizards who are unintelligent but powerful or intelligent but weak; and the exceptions tend to have very strong personality factors (e.g., Lockhart, Neville, Harry to some extent).

Percy probably had a time-turner, for logistical reasons if nothing else, but unlike Hermione, he actually used it as intended and didn't spend months researching a completely foreign legal system from books alone. In any case, I think that people underestimate just how impressive a wizard Percy was because of the role he has in canon from Harry's point of view. It's also another data point in favour of the claim that Ravenclaws aren't actually better students than Gryffindors, whether or average or at the top.

The comments from Ravenclaws in OotP are one of the few direct comparisons we get, and it's indicative of what Ravenclaws take pride in and value (which is what Sorting is based on, anyway).

I never said that "learning for attention" (whatever that means) or being at the top of the class is frowned upon in Gryffindor. Obsessing over grades and House Points probably is, however, and I would expect it to be far more accepted in Ravenclaw. Cho was a star athlete, so of course she would be popular; but, if the wiki is to be believed, her friends largely abandoned her after Cedric's death.

And, sure, I agree that Hermione's personality would evolve differently from canon. However, I don't buy the surprisingly prevalent idea that Harry and Ron are the only friends Hermione could ever possibly make.

Again, I never said Ravenclaws were better on average and one(1) made a comment to Hermione. Terry Boot to be exact.

Correct, I said that because that's what Hermione does. She doesn't learn for sake of doing it. She does it because it's how she gets attention. And considering the reaction to Harry, Hermione, and Neville losing 150 pts, Gryffindors obsess over house points, too.

I've already mentioned Krum, but also if she could make more friends why doesn't she? Why are all her friends beyond Krum dependent on circumstance?

Ron is able to gravitate to Dean and Seamus in 4th year.

Harry for all his ups and downs in popularity and a-social behavior is able to get along with people beyond just being the boy-who-lived. They get along with their roommates. Harry is despised and angry 5th yr and still makes friends in Neville, Luna, and Ginny.

When Hermione isn't speaking to Harry and Ron she is alone and the only people who try to speak to her are Harry, until she snaps at him, and Hagrid.

At the top, Ravenclaws aren't that impressive either, whether it's Slytherins winning the House cup, Gryffindors racking up OWLs and sought-after positions, or a Hufflepuff being picked for the Triwizard.

I am not saying they are necessarily worse than other years, but I just don't think there is any evidence that Hermione wouldn't stand out among them.

That's a very uncharitable view of Hermione's motivations, and one I haven't seen before---at least not as her primary motivation. Do you have any actual evidence for it? E.g., when she prioritised showing off knowledge over social justice or curiosity?

150 points is a lot of points to lose in one night, and they were refusing to tell anyone why.

#+end_quote

Everybody's friends are dependent on circumstances, starting with Harry and Ron sharing a compartment.

Now, Hermione /thought/ she had befriended Harry and Ron from Hogwarts express and maintained this misconception up until Halloween. As evidence of this, consider that you don't "punish" people who aren't already your friends with silent treatment. It's also why Ron's words got to her so much. After that, she didn't look for any additional ones---but nor did Harry or Ron.

In her third year, she didn't have time to make friends, between the course load and the legal defence of Buckbeak.

#+end_quote

By the way, all the people she assembled for lobby Harry to teach the DA---she had to have had at least a cordial and trusting relationship with them.

Hermione's no social butterfly, but she isn't as hopeless as you seem to portray her.

** Happier, with more friends, but also more status-conscious and less eager to rock the boat.

The very early-canon traits that made her a pariah in Gryffindor would make her popular in Ravenclaw.

A lot of people try to shoehorn a Ravenclaw!Hermione into Luna's role, but they are very different people---very much opposites, in fact. Luna is flighty and imaginative. Early-canon Hermione is grounded and knowledgeable. Luna gets bullied because she is weird. Hermione would be admired and envied because she always knows the correct answer and can cite chapter and verse to prove it.

I can see a hypothetical scenario in which some "[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch][Alpha Bitch]]" type who envies her intelligence manages to organise the rest of her year against her, but that's an unstable state of affairs, open to being disrupted by the carrot of Hermione as a study partner and the stick of Hermione being vindictive and good at it. Given Hermione's Ravenclaw "virtues" and force of personality, she's more likely to end up in the role herself.

And so, my headcanon is that Hermione would spend her first few weeks at Hogwarts being Hermione, then be surprised when her roommate asks her advice on some trivial fashion or grooming decision, even though Hermione has never displayed any knowledge of it. It turns out that it's the Ravenclaw way of showing deference and admiration.

But, at the same time, while she will probably retain enough righteousness to refrain from bullying Luna---though she probably won't take steps to protect her from being shunned---she would probably be a bit more reluctant to rock the boat around the House-Elves, unless she manages to convince her friends to join her crusade in earnest.
