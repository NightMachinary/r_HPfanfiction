Can be the MC, their sidekicks, their love interest. Just someone central to the story.

There's a Twitter thread going on where people share their favorite “characters know they're about to die” scene in cinematic history and it made me want to read a fic about it too. Those scenes are so poignant.

Only complete or regularly updating fics please. I'm cool with slash or any ship or gen fics, just no bashing.

  There was a more sinister reason for Hero's short temper in fifth year than adolescence and excess stress. When she has a seizure while gardening outside no. 4 Privet Drive, in full view of the neighbors, the Dursleys have no choice but to take her to a doctor. The devastating news will affect all that is to come.

** Linkffn(2818538) is a pre-DH fic where the author correctly predicted that Harry is a horcrux but he learns this fairly early on in his mission so he knows that with every horcrux he finds he is one step closer to death so those scenes can be fairly emotional. However there is a strong emphasis on Harry/Ginny as Harry knows he'll die so he wants to spend as much time as possible with her.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

  There are some things ungoverned by fate. If Sirius Black had gone the path of every Black before him, if he had been in Slytherin, he would have been a very different boy. It would have been a very different war.
