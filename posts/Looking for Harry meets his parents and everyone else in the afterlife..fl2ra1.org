Recently I've been really into fanfictions where Harry finally meets his parents for good. I would like to read a fanfiction where Harry meets them because he's dead (not half-dead like when he spoke to Dumbledore) and he can speak to Sirius, Remus, Lily, James, Fred, etc. in the afterlife (preferably dies close to the end of the series and not years out or somewhere along the series itself).

That is just preferred, but I'll gratefully accept anything else, too!
