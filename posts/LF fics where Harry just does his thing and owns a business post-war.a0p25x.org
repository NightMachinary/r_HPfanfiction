Stuff like linkffn(Steve and the Barkeep), I'll take anything, though I'd prefer no slash.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8410168/1/][*/Steve And The Barkeep/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1543518/Runaway-Deviant][/Runaway Deviant/]]

#+begin_quote
  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry Potter put paid to Voldemort at Hogwarts; now it's nineteen years later and, as the diesels hammer on, a bushy-haired girl is still searching for The-Boy-Who-Walked-Away... Oneshot, Deadliest Catch crossover.

** In linkffn(Heroes Assemble!) Harry owns a pub/cafe sorta thing. Unfortunately, it isn't the focus of the story and its importance lessens as the bigger MCU events start kicking off. A lot of loving detail was put into it, though - the description is vibrant.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.

  Harry Potter knows that money can give you power and influence. He has learned that from a young age on, seeing how his relatives get away with many things. And others having way much more than you do can be a problem. Thus he starts his path to cause a small revolution in its own right. No matter if Dumbledore doesn't like it. Two-shot.
