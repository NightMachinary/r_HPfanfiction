the only one that really expands on the Patronus charm is Sorcerer of Silver Light By: Aeondragon

linkffn(7863265)

and it has been abandoned for 3 years


** Honestly, your not going to find many. All of them tend to be "Oh my god Harry has such a big core he has a solid patronus"

Or the same thing, replacing "Solid Patronus" with...

-Golden Patronus

-Dementor Killing Patronus

Or, last but not least,

-Multiple Patronus(Patroni?)

  She marched towards the door, and as she did so she raised her wand. From the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes. The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the spiral staircase with silvery lights, as Professor McGonagall, Harry and Luna hurried back down.

  AU after Order of the Phoenix. Post Hogwarts. The Order of the Phoenix is sill fighting Voldemort and his Death-Eaters. In a desperate attempt to fight off dozens of Dementors, Hermione creates a new powerful Patronus. Rated T for language and later chapters. A RL/HG story.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

  When his uncle kicks him out after his third year, Harry spends the summer learning more about magic. When he discovers the uniqueness of his Patronus, he takes it to its ultimate expression. Pairing undecided at the moment, but no slash.

** It's not a major part of the story, but in the one I'm writing a character does use a patronus at the beginning.

It's called The Wizard and the Girl, check it out if you'd like! [[http://goo.gl/QPiiyd]]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] introduces an entire group of spells that behave like the patronus charm (you need to feel a certain emotion to use them) and they're fairly integral to the plot.

[[http://hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] takes a unique view on Harry's patronus and what patronuses even are.
