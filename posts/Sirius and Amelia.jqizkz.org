Is Sirius and Amelia being together canon or is it a Fandom thing. I like them being together. But what are your opinions?


** Fanon.

In my opinion, post-Azkaban Sirius will be forever single. I always saw him as one one of those characters whom I can't see with anybody. I've always felt he would shy away from relationships.

*** Counterpoint, I'd say that having someone else there for him would be beneficial to his healing process. That being said, he'd certainly have trust/abandonment issues and he would not want anyone even remotely linked to the Ministry.

**** Yeah, I was rather thinking of the many issues that would probably push Sirius away from any relationship. I don't think Sirius was interested in anything but Harry after he escaped Azkaban.

** Definitely fanon.

I don't mind the pairing but Sirius is one of those characters who I'm generally cool with whatever pairing he's in

** Completely fandom. Amelia Bones is never seen in the canon (only mentioned as murdered). Susan is most likely not living with her (although, I like it so much, that if I wrote my own story, I would just move her with Amelia anyway).

** It's fanon. I think I'd tolerate it more if anyone remembered Amelia Bones had gray hair and acknowledged what might be a significant age difference. Could she be a premature gray? Sure, but there's also a big chance she's in her 60s.

** I have a hard time with Sirius. I‘ve enjoyed stories that had him with female canon characters, male canon characters, and OCs. I can see him as asexual; I can see him having casual sex. But nothing has ever felt 100% right to the extent that it's become my personal headcanon.

The one thing I can't accept is the playboy/reckless trope. I don't think he'd take sex and/or romance lightly even if he didn‘t equate them. He‘s intense about responsibility within platonic relationships (“you should have died for us as we would have died for you”). He came of age in a time when trusting the wrong person meant death. He was scarred by his family of origin. I can't see all of that adding up to sex with everything that moves--- he's careful about who he trusts, prefers a tight inner circle of loved ones, and he would never ever risk having a child grow up in a miserable situation like he did.

So, yeah. Amelia? Sure. But not as an OTP.

*** To be fair, he /does/ basically set up his werewolf friend to murder Snape, so I can see him being very reckless in relationships. He is also described as very attractive even when Harry thinks he was a traitor who murdered his parents, so with his recklessness and his extreme attractiveness combined, I can easily see him being a playboy.

**** He was fifteen or sixteen... at that age it's possible we don't always think about the consequences. Also most normal people have sex for the first time at sixteen or seventeen, maybe fifteen if they're the more sexually comfortable type. So at most, Sirius would have had two years of playboying around (which I'm not sure how hard or easy is in a boarding school since I never went to one... and being at a regular high school, I always had to wait until my parents were gone to bring my girlfriend over, which was not that often). After Hogwarts, he had a target on his back for being an Order member and I tend to agree with [[/u/FicAccount]].

***** Yes, but that age is also the age a lot of people start relationships, so if he's reckless enough to set up one of his best friends to be a murderer, he can be a playboy. Sirius would have three years of playboying if he started in his fifth year. I don't think he thinks through the consequences of his actions (going after Peter and the Shrieking Shack incident are examples), so his impulsiveness, good looks, and popularity could lead to him being a playboy

** Fanon. Though don't agree with the pairing. I think a Sirius who dodges Azkaban would be more likely to have a fling with a muggle (even a kid out of marriage) by the time of book1 than a stable relationship. I do see him settling down, but not before 35

** No romantic relationship is mentioned in the books with regards to Sirius. And if you're talking about Amelia Bones... ewww. The lady has acquired enough work experience that she became the head of DMLE and sits in the Wizengamot which means that she's old enough that she has gray hair (canon information) so I would think she is in her late 50s or 60s at least. Sirius dies at 35.
