So I really like harry/daphne fics so I decided to see if there was any new ones when I stumble upon this baby linkffn(11824508) which I had previously read and new it was finished so I was confused as to why it only had one chapter. Long story short the summary is the same, its basically word for word. The only difference is a different author. (Clearly stolen, theres nothing about a change in acc or similar)

Anything we can do about this stuff?

edit: Shoutout to [[/u/rpeh]] for linking the original which I forgot to do


** Wow, Unatoned is certainly a ballsy story to try and rip off. Normally, I think it would be best to attempt to contact the "author" first and see if he has permission to repost some of the deleted stories but I know for a fact that SeriousScribble's is still up on Fanfiction and I doubt he gave that guy permission to use it. At the bottom of the chapter page is a tab for *Actions*. Then hit *Report abuse*

*** If he were legitimately reposting, he wouldn't have copied the author's notes verbatim without even an alert that it's a repost. Textbook abuse.

** I didn't know Leicester's midfield had such an interest in HP fanfiction. Reckon you should stick to football Riyad mate.

In any case report him and move on. It looks pretty much an open and shut case of plagiarism

*** I know it's not the case here but to be completely fair you can just copy and paste your story's content from Word or Notepad Nothing says you have to type it in FFN's editor.

**** I can't imagine using ffn's editor. the only time I ever used it was to correct a spelling error once. I use openoffice and edit, spellcheck and format before I post something. Posting someone else's work as your own is just plain stupid. If you want attention, write your own work.make it interesting.
