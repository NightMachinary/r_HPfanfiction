Good evening all! I am looking for some recommendations, but I have some conditions about the kind of fics I want to read;

1. It must be believable and age appropriate
2. No smut
3. Not wildly AU
4. Preferably not involving the central trio (defintely no Harry/Draco!)

Has anyone read anything good they would like to recommend? Thank you in advance!

  Harry makes three rules to survive fourth year: 1) watch the new DADA professor like a hawk, 2) suspect all animals of being animagi, and 3) avoid Cedric Diggory at all costs. Shame Diggory didn't get the memo. For a tumblr prompt by johnlocked-starkid: maybe a Harry/Cedric thing where the Triwizard Cup isn't a portkey and Voldemort doesn't happen, and instead they just win together and are happy and celebrate together. (bonus points for shy confessions of a crush from one or the other)

** Since you requested non-Drarry I am guessing you are also not into Harry/Tom Riddle nor Harry/Snape. So I've picked out a few other pairings.

Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint story. Post-war.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14291154]])

This one is also a short Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint fic, but it's a soulmate au story. If you liked it anyway there is a Dean/Seamus fic in the same series which i rec. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334]])

This one is a Wolfstar story. It is a bit smutty. So you might not like it, but the relationships are so well written. I highly recommend it. There are a few works in the series I will link you the first. Basically what happens when Sirius gets spat out by the veil after Remus is already married to Tonks. Linkao3(Howl by shiftylinguini)

  turning up to his ex-boyfriends wedding without a partner on his arm is something oliver wood refuses to do. which wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't painfully single when the invitation to percy weasley's wedding dropped on his kitchen table one monday morning. with three months to find a love to take as his plus one, oliver seeks out the first person he can find who will agree to fake-date him for an evening. it's just pure coincidence that the person ends up being hawaiian shirt wearing, bar-tending marcus flint.

  Oliver Wood wakes up in the Hospital Wing a week after his first Quidditch game ever with a head injury and his soulmate's thoughts wound around his left wrist. Frankly, he's more concerned about missing the Quidditch game.

  “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.
