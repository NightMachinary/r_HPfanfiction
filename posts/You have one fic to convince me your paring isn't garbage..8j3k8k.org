Edit: slash is fine, literally any pairing.


** The Shoebox Project is by far the best Marauders Era fic I've ever read. It's illustrated, it's poignant, it's hilarious, and devastating. Young, earnest Peter Pettigrew breaks your heart. It was written before the series was even over by people who went on to become published authors. Features Lupin/Sirius and James/Lily and how they are came to be. I honestly love it.

Also because he's only 16, thinking with his dick and not the that's actually in the relationship. Admittedly they aren't great excuses but it's more than Fleur has.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart.

** *Harry/Fleur* Boy is it hard to find anything decent in this pairing, but I can't help myself. Perhaps the only author who I think has found Fleur's voice is /Newcomb/.

Linkffn(What You Leave Behind) is incomplete and only eleven chapters, but in that short run it's characterisation hits all the notes presented in canon. In this story, we see all the quirks that canonical Fleur has, presented to us in different settings.

Fleur can be snobby and aloof, competitive to the point of rudeness, ambitious, thrill-seeking, clever and self-aware. Most authors shave off a lot of Fleur's hard edges and are left with something much reduced. Newcomb celebrates them and makes you, the reader, love them as well.

Harry in this story, despite a different upbringing, still feels like the Harry we know from the book.

linkffn(King of Magic) for like... all the pairings(Aside from HP/Ginny because obviously she's trying to get him a love potion). Report back if you manage to make it past chapter 2.

Also I absolutely love linkffn(13056274) and linkffn(12834801)! You write really well :).

e: some of Demosthenes' fics are a bit too angsty for my taste, but her characterization of Hermione is sublime IMO. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7415][Interlude]] and [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/2933][Love from, Hermione]] are both very cute, [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/2963][Into A Darkened Room]] is terrible to read (in terms of angst) for the first few chapters but has a great second half.

** Well, damn. No one else is willing to risk ridicule to rec Snape/Harry? I was hoping some other misbegotten soul would step up to the plate so I wouldn't have to.

The thing about reccing Snape/Harry is that it's a much-hated and understandably disturbing ship, so you need to know what the reader wants from it - and what their boundaries are. In a contest, I'm personally going to tilt toward dysfunctional rather than romantic. But when most people say "pairing," they assume romance. So I'll give you a choice.

Messed up, manipulative, obsessive, and amoral Snarry. Also, fair warning: underage. IIRC, Harry turns 16 in the course of the fic. Also pre-HBP, so Snape isn't entirely canon (no Lily, no dead Dumbledore, and he's far more independent than he ultimately turned out to be). Great dialogue, uncomfortable intensity. Stockholm syndrome at its finest.

If you want to see whether or not the writer can persuade you to believe in their romantic potential, I'll point you toward a different fic:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032][Rapture]] by mia_ugly

And here's an alternative that finds some sort of middle ground and seems to be the preferred fic of a lot of readers I know, some of whom came to appreciate Snape/Harry because of it:

** You can't link it anymore cause it was taken off FFN, but Vox Corporis by MissAnnThropic for Harmony. Every fanfic I've read since completing this story has been the stick I've measured it to, and none have managed to unseat it as my favorite. It covers right from the end of the TriWizard Tournament through til the end of the war, though that comes earlier than the series. Much of the story, about half, takes place the summer after GoF at the Granger's. And there's no bashing, which I know throws a lot of people off the H/HR ship. The very beginning may turn some people away, but believe me even if that part isn't quite your taste the story is worth getting through it. I really can't say enough how high my opinion of this story is. You want a true romance novel? This is it.

**** I went back and checked, and I actually overstated the summer part of he story; 16 of 70 chapters is the summer after GoF. It concentrates heavily on Harry recovering from the end of GoF, and the two beginning the process to become animagi. Essentially the story is one based entirely on the characters and relationship between Harry and Hermione, and the summer builds the base for it moving forward.

** Hermione/Teenage Tom Riddle.

Happened to read linkffn(Tied for Last), which is what got me into the pairing to begin with. It has incredible characterization, world-building, expansion of lore, and interaction between the canon characters that I find quite realistic and authentic. It's also, by far, one of the best fanfictions I've ever read.

Just as a warning, it's a very long fanfiction (almost 250k words total), with /very/ slow burn. It took me at least a few days to read through the entire story the first time.

***** It's been a while since I read /Ultima Ratio/, but like [[/u/firstsip]] was saying, it's hard to find genuinely good fics nowadays for the Tomione pairing. A lot of the tropes used commonly by a lot of Tomione writers are pretty dark and squicky (i.e. sexual coercion, torture, Hermione getting tricked or manipulated into getting pregnant, etc.).

I found out this is because some of the original Tomione writers (the ones with lesser-quality fics, IMHO) banded together in a clique, and are notorious for bullying any Tomione writers that aren't in their group, or who dare to criticize or critique them, or their stories, in any way. This includes criticism of their use (and popularization) of the more squicky tropes in the pairing, mentioned above.

I actually tried to write a Tomione fanfiction once myself, only to have members of this "group" send me anonymous hate online, as well as stalk and troll my Reddit account with sockpuppet accounts. The hate and troll message(s) were also quite long, and directed at trying to insult and belittle me by telling me to "just quit creative writing altogether", or just about wasting my time by sending me weirdly-written walls of text.

  Tied For Last still is a textbook case of a highly abusive relationship
#+end_quote

Can I ask why you think this? I saw the author put an author's note / content warning at the start of the story that said as much, but no one has ever really explained why they think it's an "abusive relationship". I'm am abuse survivor myself, and I did think Tom acted way out-of-line a few times, but nothing outside of the bounds I would find believable and true to how Rowling originally wrote character in COS and HBP.

The only thing that I can really think that's remotely abusive about Tom and Hermione's relationship in /Tied for Last/ is that Tom tries to torture Hermione in one chapter, and uses manipulative tactics in his plans involving her. Likewise, Tom doesn't get away scot-free for his morally reprehensible decisions; in fact, the opposite. Indeed, he pays increasingly heavy prices (and faces snowballing negative consequences) for his more awful actions, something which is sorely lacking in other Tomione fanfictions.

Likewise, unlike in many, /many/ other Tomione fanfictions, in /Tied for Last/, Hermione actually does things to call Tom out and stand up to him, and make him face said consequences for his poor(er) choices. I also saw Hermione doing this, even when she faced some truly terrible treatment from Tom in the beginning, as crucial for her ultimately earning Tom's respect, and getting him to change his outlook, attitude, and the way he sees (and does) things.

Having read other Tomione fanfictions that are /way/ worse in terms of abuse and manipulation (i.e. /Nightmare/, among others), /Tied for Last/ is not nearly as bad to read. I'm not saying anyone has to like it - in fact, Tom /is/ an asshole a lot in it, which I feel was true to his character in the books - but I find it much easier, and realistic, to read than most other stories written for the pairing.

A non-magic Tomione AU by the same author, Speechwriter, may be more enjoyable as a read for you, as it was written after the author reviewed and reflected upon criticism of /Tied for Last/: linkffn(Have a Nice Day!).

****** (It's been a long time since I've read TFL, so I'm entirely going off old memories) First and foremost, Tom purposefully and deliberately isolated Hermione from her peers (her Gryffindor friends, and even the two Ravenclaws running the Hospital Wing). This is the most common tactic of an abusive partner. This not only prevents her from being able to get help, it prevents her from being able to see that she should get help.

Second, we can't brush aside that he tortured her. Regardless of blow back or Hermione's choice to forgive him, that is not something that is okay in a healthy romantic relationship. (Though, tbf, I can only specifically remember the part where he specifically brewed a potion that would make her do what he wanted so he could mind rape her to find her secrets. Again, not quite part of a healthy relationship.)

I don't doubt that other fan fictions are worse than TFL in how Tom acts (that's going to happen a lot when the ship is enemies to lovers) but I happened to be talking about TFL specifically, rather than Tomione as a whole. And, again, I don't hate TFL. It's well written, especially given the age of the author, but it just squicks me too much for me to like, or even read again.

******* I'm re-reading TFL right now, and it seems like you took a lot of the content more closely to heart than the author intended.

In the case of Tom trying to isolate Hermione from her Gryffindor friends, without trying to post any spoilers, that tactic doesn't even work part of the time. It's also clearly in-character with teenage Tom's personality from the books, particularly COS, where Tom literally isolated Ginny from all of her friends and family.

Most of TFL also goes through the process of Tom learning hard lessons that this tactic doesn't always get him what he wants, which I talked about a bit in my reply.

That being said...

#+begin_quote
  Regardless of blow back or Hermione's choice to forgive him, that is not something that is okay in a healthy romantic relationship
#+end_quote

They aren't even in a relationship at the point where Tom tortures Hermione.

They're still enemies, as per Hermione's view (thus, why the torture even happens to begin with), and Tom figures out, relatively quickly, that he's made a huge miscalculation (again, without revealing too many spoilers) by deciding to torture Hermione. Again, I feel that both of the character's reactions for the scene match their book characters, as originally devised by Rowling.

I mean...it's canon that Tom Riddle basically set a basilisk on Hermione, possibly intending to kill her (or just kidnap her), in COS. However, Hermione (nearly) outsmarted him in bringing a mirror to look around corners. She also convinced a prefect, Penelope Clearwater, to accompany her, with her intent to prove what she'd found.

As Tom doesn't have a basilisk in this story, and it's explained how (and why) he can't just obtain Veritaserum or brew it, torture seems to be his go-to method. It's implied to be his last resort, albeit after the fact, but it's also in line with his original character in the books (i.e. he tortures people for information, or for punishment).

Simply put, both Hermione and Tom have unhealthy behaviors and coping mechanisms, especially in the beginning of the story. The whole point of the story is them learning to change these aspects of themselves, primarily through their mutual interactions.

Also, it's quite clear, based on the nature of the people involved in the pairing, that Tomione isn't - and never /would/ likely be - a purely "healthy" relationship. Therefore, saying something like, "but that's not what happens in a healthy romantic relationship", in regards to Tomione, feels like a moot point to me.

But, then again, based on what J.K. Rowling has had to say on Hermione's personality, I don't think that /any/ relationship that Hermione has would be purely "healthy"...not even the canon example of Ron/Hermione. For example, Rowling herself admitted that Hermione has quite a few tendencies and flaws that would require the need for "relationship counseling", even in her canon marriage to Ron.

(And we already know just how messed up Tom's issues are, so that goes without saying.)

Therefore, I think it's kind of unfair to think, or to expect, that these two charaters (Tom and Hermione), when paired romantically, would have the same kind of "perfect, healthy relationship™", the same kind that a /lot/ of Tumblr seems to obsess over, is unrealistic.

I also feel that a lot of the "you should strive to have a perfect, pure, healthy relationship™", that, again, a lot of Tumblr tends to repeat...well, that's just setting up /any/ pairing for failure, because it doesn't allow for the characters to have flaws. There's this idea there that, if the characters have any sort of issues that are remotely "problematic" (even if they're realistic and in-character), then that relationship is automatically deemed "abusive".

But the fact of the matter is...people /aren't/ perfect. We're flawed, imperfect beings, who make bad choices and mistakes. Showing that reflects reality itself, as opposed to some idealized, sugar-coated fantasy, or unrealistic idea and expectations of "what love /should/ be".

The whole point of relationships isn't for people to remain static, but to learn, and grow, from each other as people, including "tough love" and through bad choices, which I feel that TFL shows really well in Tom and Hermione's actions and interactions towards each other.

A great article that also goes into this is [[https://verilymag.com/2017/12/healthy-relationships-arent-perfect-imperfection-perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good]["Want a Perfect Relationship? Try Actually Accepting Some Imperfections. When it comes to love, perfect is very much the enemy of the great."]].

*** One of my favorite Drarry fics is Eclipse by Mijan Linkffn(1360492) It's great as a defense for the pairing because the characterization of both Harry and Draco is very well done, and pretty loyal to canon, they just find themselves in a situation where they slowly reach an understanding, and then grow to care about each other. It's also wonderfully written. Great writing style, and a good plot with lots of suspense, sweet moments, and good pacing. Honestly probably one of my favorite fics ever.

** These are all Ginny pairings.

*Edit*: lol, I'm reading that one paring per person requirement /now/. But I doubt many people would have hit these ships if I hadn't. And I had a bunch of Dumbledore pairings too! Oh well.

Ginny/Draco -- There are better stories for ship than this, but for a beginner I would recommend [[https://we3sisters.livejournal.com/59171.html][Out of the Depths]] by Peki. A short gen-ish work that shows the muddled place both characters occupy after the war, forming a tentative bond that may or may not amount to more.

Ginny/Neville - linkao3(565572). This one's a bit of a no-brainer, but the combination of a tetchy, incredulous Ginny with an attitude and just-coming-into-his-own Neville is a treat that can't be missed.

Ginny/Riddle -- There are far more dysfunctional takes on this relationship that probably won't be for everyone, and there's a couple of happy (almost fluffy) relationships that I have no idea where the fuck they even dropped from, but Left Hook - linkao3(4904485) hits a balance that I think would appeal to the most number of people. Featuring Time Travel and a vengeful Ginny.

Ginny/Ron - [[https://l3petitemort.livejournal.com/60814.html][Undressing Ginny Weasley]]. The quality of Weasleycest in the fandom is rather (unsurprisingly) disappointing, as most of them are little more than PWPs. But I love how this story appeals to childhood nostalgia, juxtapositioning their easy mutual familiarity with taboo desire.

Ginny/Tonks -- linkao3(533684). Absolutely gorgeous descriptions.

Ginny/Hermione -- linkao3(6433270). I hesitated at this, because it isn't a /great/ story, having grammar issues and a poor Ron characterisation and weird tone changes (that's what you get for making a serious story out of a fake dating AU). But I do think this story has the best and most in-character Hermione-Ginny bonding I've read, and the author is great at writing heavy, painful emotion that makes the drama work.

Ginny/Harry/Draco -- linkao3(365938). Fairly PWP, but a PWP that hits the character beats and emotional beats really well.

**** A lot of stories with this ship are fluffy or rom-com-ish. The few dysfunctional ones are glorification of abusive relationships. Really hard to find anything to my tastes. But here's a bunch I remember enjoying --

[[https://dgficexchange.livejournal.com/99388.html][The Good people]] is the best one. If I had to nominate a single fic for best prose across all of fanfiction - this one would be it. Its unconventional outsider PoV and narrative structure add to its charm, and it is emotionally devastating.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12640734/1/As-It-Should-Be][As It Should Be]] -- Excellent Ginny narrative voice, featuring both Ginny and Draco dealing with their post-war demons in their own ways.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12640717/1/Decode-This][Decode This]] -- Ginny and Draco are both curse breakers obsessed with one upping each other. I don't recommend many light hearted stories for this pairing (they almost always take too many liberties with characterisation), but this is one story I don't mind suspending disbelief for.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2658875][Evolution]] is a gen-ish character study of DH Draco.

[[https://hp-literotica.livejournal.com/70528.html][Both go down (today I'll be your Virginia)]] -- Voldemort wins AU written pre-DH. Short but harrowing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12668676/1/Waiting-for-the-Sun][Waiting For the Sun]] - 8th year AU, probably the most in-character DG I've read. Others have better prose or hit harder emotionally or have better plots, but this one might be the most convincing of the lot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7930712/1/The-One-You-Never-Knew][The One You Never Knew]] -- I remember this story having an excellent extended action scene and character growth on Ginny's part.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/19457][The Affair]] -- As the title suggests, Ginny having an affair with Draco. I would recommend this because Ginny's emotions and reactions ring true to me -- being stuck in a loveless marriage, the mingled liberation and guilt that comes of having an affair. But I also thought Draco's characterisation to be rather fanon-y, so YMMV.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11128944/1/the-albatross-did-follow][The Albatross Did Follow]] - Action/adventure with a repeating time travel loop.

  Just another Pureblood!Hermione story. A hidden adoption revealed, a brother found, a new world to figure out: "What are you hoping for?" he asked as they stood ready to do the spell. "I don't know," Hermione admitted. "You?" His knuckles were white on his wand. "A sister," he said, his voice very low, "I'm hoping for a sister." Winner 2015 Energize WIP Awards. COMPLETE.

I don't remember the exact time frame, but I believe it was several years. For several years Harry couldn't move of from the girl, who left him and then was living her life as she wanted.

It's mental. In such cases it's recommended to visit a therapist.

Personally I think the author was just lazy to build a proper relationship between two emotionally strong and independent partners.

Or she thought that a real Man must accept any shit from the Woman he is in love (quite a popular point among female authors and some male).

Eden, by Obsessmuch, Lucius/Hermione. It's definitely the best in that genre - angst, drama, super sad stuff. Well written, incredibly long and addicting, but so so dark and sad. There are lots of happier Lucius/Hermione, one in particular that I loved but couldn't find the last time I searched for it, I'm going to make a post here to find it I think. I'll edit if it's found.

And many stories use them as a crutch for Harry to discover he is suddenly gay and dating men is okay.

Snape is at least equally to blame here. He suspected that Lupin was a werewolf and yet knowingly went there. It was Snape's decision.

Was it a dick move on Sirius part? Sure. But he is not the only one who fucked up there. Even Dumbledore can be faulted for the laughable security measures.

******* Is there anything in canon that actually says he suspected he was a /werewolf?/ IIRC it's never clear on that, and all that's implied is that he knew that they were up to something.

Beyond that, even if it was among his suspicions, there's still the probability that it was kinda unthinkable that they'd give a werewolf access to anyplace accessible from the grounds while he was transformed. Which is absolutely something Dumbledore can be faulted for, yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that Sirius engineered the encounter in the first place.

Well, for one thing, it includes Lupin. You know, the guy who ran from his pregnant wife and never cared about Harry, to the point where he shamed Harry with his parents' sacrifice while not telling anyone about the fact that Sirius was an Animagus or knew about the secret passages. He did not visit Harry once (unless you count the time where he ran from his wife), nor did he write (and Harry explicitly laments that in HBP). Nothing at all. Oh, and he also nearly mauled Harry, Ron and Hermione because he forgot his potion. He literally had one job and even failed that.

Lupin is far from evil, but still one of the worst persons in the entire series. I mean, what are his redeeming qualities, not sucking as a Defence teacher?

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/][A Cadmean Victory by Darkness Enthroned]]

A fantastic depiction of Harry/Fleur in which Harry is not an idiot and Fleur is not just magic with boobs. Both Characters are written as mature individuals and are generally very believable as people considering their life experiences. Very slow to get to the pairing but still extremely good in the meantime. Very long and quite dark at times but still excellent. It has a very realistic depiction of harry as someone who has survived systemic neglect in childhood and is determined to actually live instead of just sacrificing himself all the time. It has an excellent portrayal of Fleur as someone who dealt with social problems by simply outshining and besting the people who hurt her. It is extremely well written and has a well constructed ending which is hinted to throughout the fic. It has that inexplicable feeling not having any idea how it would end until it ends and then you realize it couldn't have ended any other way. The pairing is extremely integral to the plot and is generally very well done.

This fic singlehandedly made Harry/Fleur my OTP because of how it was done.

*** That story is so bad. Instead of making Harry an idiot, the author gives the other Hogwarts students a negative IQ. The side plot with Katie was so outstandingly horrible, it's almost as stupid as the canon Horcrux hunt.

***** Sadly it is. On my first read I loved the story but coming back a second time I did a complete 180. Such a shame as it is one of the few Harry/Fleur stories that tries to do something different rather than relying on either 1. SuperHarry saving Fleur and Gabby at the World Cup and her falling for him, or 2. Harry saving Fleur and Gabby during the second task and invoking a life-debt.

It was an idea that had potential but completely fell apart and the flaws become much more apparent on subsequent reads.

** I'm already spoiling it more than I'd like, but linkao3(Of A Linear Circle) shows adult!Harry and Snape both with their potential much less stifled than in canon. I love this series so much.

In case the bot doesn't work, here's a link to the series -- but the first fic can be read by itself IMO: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028]]

I mean, I don't expect you to like the pairing, probably, but I think the writing can be considered professional-quality, and since you'll be reading all of them~

** Linkffn(The Alkahest)

Not my absolute favorite dramione fic ever, but it's a damn good one with fluff, humor and a decent amount of angst. Also, Hot for Teacher by MotherofBulls is amazing as well. Anyone who doesn't like dramione should at least check those out.
