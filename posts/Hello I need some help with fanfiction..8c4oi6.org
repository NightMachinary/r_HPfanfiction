I need someone to help me with a name of an Animagi. She's a she, her Animagi is a black wolf with hazel eyes, she loves to read and paint, has many hidden talents, and name is Lucy. Its for a Marauders era fanfiction in Wattpad.


** Smudge

Important thing about names and nicknames; most of the time, other people name you. The Marauders didn't come up with those names to make them seem cool, mysterious, or powerful. They were taunting each other. Only superheroes and villains get to name themselves (if the press doesn't do it for them), and the cheesiness of that arrangement shows in what they tend to come up with.

Dr. Doom; Lord Voldemort; Madonna.

*** Smudge is a great nickname for an artist-y type of person and now I feel bad that I can't fit it in any of my stories.
