  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

  Ever wonder what Hogwarts was like before Dumbledore? Before Dippet? It's 1680 and Uric the Oddball Beaufolle is starting at Hogwarts. New teachers. New students. New problems. Just how much trouble can an eleven year old get into? Plenty. Complete
