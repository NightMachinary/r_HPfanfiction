Is there a story that replayed or interpreted the Story/Scenario of Die Hard (with Bruce Willis), but with Harry Potter and in Hogwarts?

As a bonus: not Alan Rickm... not Hans Gruber, but Severus Snape as Bad guy?


** So, its the Ministry Christmas Party, when the Death Eaters attack and hold the place hostage. The only one to escape and hide in the elevator shaft is Harry, whose wand was lost in the commotion. He has to use all his cunning and skill to counter the Death Eaters, and somehow drop Voldemort from the thirtieth floor.
