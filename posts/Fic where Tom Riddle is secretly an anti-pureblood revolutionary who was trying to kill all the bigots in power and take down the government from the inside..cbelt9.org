  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Many have criticized Albus Dumbledore for not taking adequate steps to undermine Tom Riddle's plays for power, rein in Severus Snape's behavior toward Gryffindors, and see to Harry Potter's welfare... but what if that was the point?

**** Tom and several muggleborns used the basilisk (which, in this AU is bred to petrify with its stare, among other things) to arrange false flag anti-muggleborn attacks in Hogwarts to get the student body to have sympathy for muggleborns.

After several successes, Myrtle got petrified, hit her head and died. In his grief, Tom used occlumency to burn out his capability to feel sadness and remorse putting him in the mindset to create his horcruxes.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** HPMOR spoiler: The Voldemort persona was meant to be a foil to allow his main alter ego (David Munroe) to rise to the top of the government in opposition to the 'Dark Lord' terrorizing the country. Pureblood/muggleborn politics really didn't enter into it, so HPMOR doesn't fit this request at all.

**** I'm not sure where your last quote is coming from, but I certainly didn't say it. My problem with HPMoR recommendations doesn't necessarily come from a dislike of the story, but from how often its being recommended is inappropriate.

It's a large fic with many different chapters and many different tangents. It covers quite a few cliches and tropes ironically in certain chapters, never to be seen again. Quite a few requests, because of this, can technically be filled by HPMoR even though that person would sometimes have to wade through some 100+ chapters to find it mentioned a single time.

Even THIS request, to which we're responding, the whole David Monroe plot being revealed to be Tom Riddle doesn't happen until pretty much the very end. Obviously it's a reveal that retrospectively affects the entire plot, but it's not consciously a factor in your first read through.

TL;DR: I'm not gatekeeping. A popular fic doesn't necessarily translate to recommendations. HPMoR, however, can FIT a lot of requests, if only barely and not in the SPIRIT of the request.

  Nope. Nowhere in the OP is it stated that whole plot of the fic revolves around Tom Riddle's attempt to take down the government, that could easily just be a side bit. Plenty of people make queries where it turns out the bits they remembered were side bits.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's a fair point.

#+begin_quote
  hardly any of them were based on something mentioned once in passing.
#+end_quote

Honestly, maybe it's just been too long since I've read HPMoR, but I can't remember very many plot points that are continuous enough to last beyond a few chapters.

SPOILERS:

There's, like, Bellatrix being broken out of prison which is pretty important. Time turners are a constant theme... Bullies, maybe. The redemption of Draco Malfoy and his friendship with Hermione.

I suppose there are a lot of ways to phrase those, but other than that... it feels like most of the chapters are almost self-contained logical fallacies or parts of the scientific method that the author wanted to discuss for a minute.

#+end_quote

That's actually an excellent example of a request that HPMOR /wouldn't/ fit. HPMOR is not a 'for want of a nail' fic; it has many, many underlying differences from canon, not just one change.

From what I've seen on this sub, people tend to view the fic more favorably when it actually fits the OP's request. Disregarding the minutia of the OP's requirements does no one any favors.
