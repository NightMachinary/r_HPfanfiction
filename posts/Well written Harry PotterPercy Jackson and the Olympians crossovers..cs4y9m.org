Any rating. Preferably on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. No slash unless it's in the background. No smut either.

** This author has 3 series in-progress that are HP/PJO crossovers. All are fem!Harry, only one is slash, though I don't remember which one (it's been a while since I read them, sorry).

**** It's fem!Harry/OFC. I don't remember the title, but that story was the one with the Harry character as a daughter of Hades. (The author's 3 series each have the Harry character as a different daughter of the Big 3.)

  He was only twelve, going on thirteen. And shouldn't Madame Pomfrey been able to detect this and stop it while he'd been in the hospital wing? Because seriously? This? This thing right here? It had to have been something to do with the Basilisk having bitten him. A whole new spin on the Snake!Harry Genre with some Ancestor! thrown in.

  Response to DZ2's 'Harry, the Twice-Blessed Half-blood' challenge. Fem!Harry. Herakles Potter knew she was odd. Exactly how odd turned out to be far odder than she originally thought.
