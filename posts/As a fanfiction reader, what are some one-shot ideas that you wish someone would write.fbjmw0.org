As a fanfiction reader, I love reading one-shots about characters bonding (especially Harry and Sirius lol, I think I have read every single fanfiction on fanfiction.net about their godfather/godson relationship). What are fanfiction ideas that you are always looking for, but never find, because they most likely haven't been written yet? You can be as vague or specific as you want to!


** A fic where Grindelwald escapes and allies with Voldemort and now Harry /and/ Dumbledore have to fight them.

Together. Because I just want to finally see a /good/ Mentor/Student relationship between Harry and Dumbledore.

And if I see anyone call him Dumbles once more...

***** Oh man I'd love to see a well done Avatar crossover. One of my absolute favorite shows.

Here's a bit of a rundown / outline of something I'd love to read based on the above chain of ideas:

- Voldemort + Grindelwald successfully take over the Wizengamot. This probably happens in Harry's 5th or 6th year.

- Politically, they can not kill Dumbledore. It would rally the entire wizarding world and the ICW against them. It would be suicide. They have Death Eaters, not an army.

- They can fake a trial and throw him in Azkaban, however. It would take the ICW weeks / months to complete an investigation and figure out it was fake.

- There's an argument about whether a prison, even one as secure as Azkaban can hold someone such as Dumbledore. He has a Phoenix as a familiar, after all.

- Dumbledore agrees to the punishment and willingly goes to serve his time, but he has a plan. Grindelwald brings most of the evidence of Dumbledore's past into the trial, and manipulates other members to vote with him.

- Dumbledore figures out the plot. He manipulates Harry into dueling him. Engineers a way to turn his pupil against him by spilling his original plan: "I kept you suffering under the thumb of the Dursleys, Harry. It was all me. I've engineered your entire childhood, to keep you just on the verge, that razor's edge between happiness and misery. I made you see that magic was extraordinary and Muggles mundane. I needed you to love this world more than yourself, you see. I foresaw that you would have to die, willingly, in order to defeat Voldemort. I have done all this, and I was wrong."

- So they fight and Harry "wins" the Elder Wand. Dumbledore gets locked away, disgraced, and thought a manipulative betrayer by The Boy Who Lived.

- Harry thinks he has to tackle everything on his own. The Elder Wand makes things a bit easier, though. Before he's imprisoned, Dumbledore sends his notes on Horcruxes to Harry via Hermione in a coded message, so that it is not obvious that Dumbledore is the sender. Hermione thinks it's from the Order, not Dumbledore specifically.

- Azkaban changes the old wizard. A master of wandless magic, Dumbledore has no problem conjuring a Patronus in his cell, but the drain wears on him. After only days, the cell walls are covered in runic script, made by his own magic. After weeks, Dumbledore's appearance changes. After months, he's barely recognizable as the congenial strange old wizard, but appears as a wiry warrior with an aura of blinding light, the Phoenix emblem magically emblazoned on his chest like a fiery tattoo.

- Voldemort and Grindelwand have their political differences. In their victory, Tom wants to rule supreme and his sadistic treatment of wizard-kind sickens Grindelwand. At the apex of their strained relationship, Dumbledore breaks out of prison, rejoins Harry Potter, and the reunited Order of the Phoenix descends upon the Wizengamot to perform a coup.

- Fawks joins them, and like a blazing army of light, the Order takes back their country.

** Harry and possibly others get Isekaid in another universe and DONT roflstomp everything. I want to see them struggle, perhaps being even weaker than most of the new world inhabitants and need to be cunning and carefull. I'd love to read one in Warcraft universe, but all of them have a godmod Harry and meet every important character of Azeroth; but it would be so much more interesting to see them faced with magic resistance, or just the brutal difference of raw power with most spellcasters of this world who have quite mastered the art of killing things.

*** In addition to this, I'd like to see other magic systems explored beyond just "oh mine is better". For example, Harry in Lord of the Rings, but he doesn't use his wand for everything. Maybe it's broken or lost, and he has to relearn magic the hard way, by speaking and studying the subtle magics of the dwarves, the elves, the halflings and humans. Make him tempted by the magic that reminds him of home the most, the dark sorcery of sauron, but ultimately resist it. And in the end, reveal that it was all designed as a test, a journey of discovery and learning, and he is granted a staff, or made an Istari himself or whatever.

2. Charlie Weasley and his friends getting Rons letter about Norbert and how they fly to Scotland to pick up that Dragon

3. Bill Weasley at work as a curse breaker basically Grave robbing (Maybe Tomb Raider style)

4. Sherlock x HP crossover. Percy Weasley works for the Ministry in all Muggle related things. He meets Mycroft Holmes.

5. A fic about Sirius' aunt who wanted to legalize Muggle hunting. (I want this super elegant/proper, rich, entitled pureblood witch with a rather rare Hobby. And I want her to be all casuall about it. Basically a female Hannibal Lecter)

** I want a one where a regular student gossips about Harry and troll, Harry vs quirellmort, being heir of slitherin, a possible H/Hr/Rw, or how Malfoy and Harry has UST, Fred and George are totally BL. Gossip about Harry and Cedric (the questionable talk about prefects bathroom), and literally all random incorrect gossips from year one to five being heard by one of the golden trio.

Kinda like that one shot where Remus overheard people gossip that his monthly illness was actually him being a girl and he's doing both James and sirius at the same time that's why they hide he's actually a girl. While another says if Remus wants to 'identify' as a boy and is comfortable with it, it's his choice, that does not mean he's banging his friends.

** Harry doing something about the situation with Snape, instead of just putting up with the unfair treatment. As to what he could do... basically, start to channel his Slytherin side, and work with the people and other resources he has to slowly change Snape's opinion of him. (I realise it's not Harry who's in the wrong here, but Snape seems incapable of reassessing Harry on his own). Specifically, Harry needs to make a plan to win Snape over by proving he's not a bully or arrogant etc., but he'd have to come to terms with the fact that it would be a long, hard effort.
