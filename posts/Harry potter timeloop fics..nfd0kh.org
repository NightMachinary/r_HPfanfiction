  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

**** It's an old one, and I think it was unfinished, but it's the first one that comes to mind when someone mentions time loop and Harry Potter to me. My second choice was already named above (Temporal Beacon), it's just that Ron's loops in Groundhog Day are much shorter since she's reliving one day instead of resetting back to the same starting point at various intervals like in the Beacon.

  ‘Have you tried everything?' Hermione asked insistently.‘Yes! Every time I get to the cup and Cedric doesn't take it with me I go immediately back to my bed in the morning. But all the times he is with me, he dies and after I fall asleep I return too.'‘I guess it is obvious then, isn't it?' Both Harry and Hermione turned to stare at Ron, who looked at them defensively and shrugged ‘You have to go with Diggory and make sure he survives.'Harry/Cedric - Groundhog day AU

  Harry gets another chance - and another and another. At some point, they stop feeling like chances at all.
