** Here. The Leaky d20 is a screencap comic on DeviantArt that re-imagines the HP series as a D&D campaign.

Harry, Ron and Hermione are the PCs, whose players have different approaches to the game, with Ron being all about the in-game strategies, Hermione being a power-hungry min-maxing Munchkin and Harry being the "Real Roleplayer" who's mainly concerned with wringing as much angst out of every scene as he can.

Also, Snape's a vampire, McGonagall is a wereat, Neville's the latest in a long line of vampire hunters, Quidditch is called "mage basketball" and Hagrid is a half-dwarf.
