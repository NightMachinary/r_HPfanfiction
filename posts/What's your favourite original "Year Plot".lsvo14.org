I would like to read a fanfic with a unique plot that follows the Harry Potter formula. It can't be a rehash of the canon books, but it may be different perspective/spin so long as it is surprising and fully its own. It can be set in 8th year, Marauders or Second Gen.

The formula contains.

A mystery, a suspect teacher, relevant classwork, events before the Hogwarts Express, students investigating, a point of crisis at the end of the year, exploring Hogwarts and magic.

I'm happy with anything except teacher/student.


** The closest one I know is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/][The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks]] by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2289300/][Paimpont]]. It has most of the formula you described except the events of pre-Hogwarts Express and the year-end crisis.

*** Strange Disappearence is certainly the most "Basically A HP Book" without being a HP book.

  Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else remembers her. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student.

** The Pureblood Pretense. The new plots are INSANE and the wordbuilding is so so so good. the formula definitely still applies, and there's a big focus on academics

** I know it's been recced till the cows come home but All the Young Dudes does the whole 'Students at Hogwarts' thing brilliantly. We see the marauders in class and just doing homework, along with pranks and teachers and detentions and magic and all the little drama in between.

Theres a big mystery with the werewolves thing and Remus which I won't go into. Many points of crisises.

It follows all 7 years plus war since its marauders but when I read it, it was like just reading the Harry Potter books again it was lovely.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

** I've got a bunch of next gen fics that might fit this: The 7-book arc of Albus Potter and the Global Revelation, starting here: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8417562/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Global-Revelation]] Haven't read it in a while but I remember it being great and fitting your request.

Same with the series that starts with Teddy Lupin and the Forest Guard: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11251021/1/Teddy-Lupin-and-the-Forest-Guard]]

Another next gen, one of my old favorites: Ignite by Slide. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6470272/chapters/14810293]] I don't like the sequels much (and they are post-Hogwarts) but this one I definitely recommend.
