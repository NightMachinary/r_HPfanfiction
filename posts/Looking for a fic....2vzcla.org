- Harry ran away shortly before going to Hogwarts. I think he ran away from the hotel that the Dursleys fled to while evading the letters.

- While trying to survive on the streets, he discovers his magic. I think he accidentally kills some rapist, but that might be from a different fic.

- Eventually, he becomes a high-class prostitute, and he makes connections with several criminals. Occasionally, he helps with heists, etc.

- When he goes to Hogwarts, he's super bad-ass. I don't think he was sorted, but he might of been.

- He hooks up with Krum, but the fic is not romance-centered. He wins the Triwizard Tournament.

- He uses his network of pimps to manipulate the Wizarding World and undermine Voldy.

- ??? I don't remember if this fic was finished.

It is not [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6587471/1/Love-In-the-Dark][Love in the Dark]].
