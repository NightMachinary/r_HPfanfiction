I must specify, i don't meant fics where Snape realizes he's the bad guy though I wouldn't mind that being an ultimate result, I don't mean Severitus. I mean that I want to see fics where Snape's behavious is discovered and he gets suitably punished for it and most importantly, is punished so severely he's either scared off of doing it again or his punishment actively disables him from continuing it.


** Similarly, fics where when Harry starts the DA, he finds out that there's been an underground Potions study group for years that is the only reason /anyone/ gets their potions OWLs and NEWTs

*Edit:* To make sure nobody else has the same experience as the OP, this fic is not about Snape's introspection or growing as a character, but rather about Hermione and Sirius brutally murdering people who have wronged Harry, including Snape.

**** OK, on rereading your request, I now realise that although the fic fulfils its letter, it doesn't fulfil its spirit. I am sorry about that. I'll edit the post for posterity.

  AU OotP. What if Hermione had taken a more proactive stance against Harry's treatment by Snape and Umbridge? How far is too far to go to protect someone you love? Complete.

** And this story where Snape is gets what he deserves... in hell. 40K words, but all of them are focused on Snape, so maybe you'll like it? If you do read it, tell me your opinion on the story.

  Summary: The end was only the beginning for Severus Snape. After that, there is a clarity to be found and one can see things as they really are, not how one imagined them to be. This story picks up during the Deathly Hallows at the scene where Snape has just been bitten by Nagini and has been left for dead by Voldemort. This will be more of a character study of Snape.
