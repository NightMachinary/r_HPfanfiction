So after another comment on here, it got me interested in Spy Percy stories. Note when I say Spy, I don't mean for him to join the Death Eaters and Voldemort, but spying on the Ministry, maybe he tells Dumbledore about stuff, maybe he doesn't.

Would be neat if the Weasley's end up finding it out after Percy came back, but that's optional.

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash


** The Scarlet Pimpernel by A Marguerite was one where if I remember correctly, Percy smuggled muggleborns out of the ministry or alerted them before they got taken by the ministry, something like that, during the year that Voldemort ruled.

However, I can't seem to find it anywhere, it looks like it's been taken offline. Anyone have a copy?

--------------

Edit: Also in linkffn(Percy Take the Wheel) it looks like it is heading that way as Percy makes contact with Lucius Malfoy acting as though he needs a mentor.

Side note, ff2ebook is an incredibly large backup, really good for situations like this.

**** Weee, thanks! I've been sitting on the PDF from [[http://redhen-publications.com/pimpernel.html][here]] for ages and avoiding it because my ereader and PDFs don't play nice. It's a rather pretty pdf though?

** I know of one that's more Harry-centric aboutnhim being a spy for MI6 but they do recruit Percy and he's a decent part of the story bc he's spying in the ministry, but its not quite what you're asking

** linkffn(12373273) came originally as a byproduct of linkffn(11916243), but it is in my opinion much better than that. It is not completely finished yet, but the main story arc is certainly done.
