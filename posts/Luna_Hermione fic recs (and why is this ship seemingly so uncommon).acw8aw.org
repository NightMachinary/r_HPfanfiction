Hello, first ever post so i want to keep it fairly simple and to the point. I recently got very into the idea of Luna and Hermione after reading this fic called 'Pink & Blue' on AO3 (fic is really long and still on going pretty cute fluffy stuff not much plot though it is building one currently and with a pinch of smut LINK:[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15842229/chapters/36893670]])

Anyway i started looking for more long 100k or more style Luna/Hermione and could only really find the fairly famous 'crazy little things' fic (which while great it doesnt even meet 100k) I'm I looking in the wrong places or is this ship really that strange and uncommon?

I'm wondering if anyone could recommend more long Luna/Hermione and maybe discuss why there isn't more of it? or why you do or do not like the ship? For me i like the whole opposites attarcts cliche Hermione being all books and logic very grounded, a tad uptight, sometimes poor temepered and firey, also slightly unimaginative.

where as Luna is more whimsical dotty and open to anything being possible, while being fairly calm and reserved though she does show flashes of anger when Hermione is rude about the quibbler which is very cute and I love that haha.

I like this dyanmic and i think they would really be a sweet couple and work well togther. Luna would drive Hermione mad sometimes but also keep her on her toes and maybe make her lighten up a bit more and Hermione could maybe also ground Luna a little and interject some sense into her and make her a bit more open to being critcal about things her father belives or writes in the quibbler ahaha.

Also I often see Ron/Hermione fans say they love that ship for the opposites attarct thing as well, though i personally find Ron Hermione to be too similar to work lol both a tad too prideful, argumentative and sulky when they don't get their way lol its why i think they are in fact a bad example of this cliche (but im getting side tracked now and will stop haha).

anyway thoughts on any of this Luna/Hermione stuff or fic recs for the ship would be great thanks. :)


** I'll give my 2 cents on why its probably not popular or wouldn't work, because if you're sticking to canon characteristics, those two are complete opposites, and not in a way oh you two balance each other out kind of way, I'm sure Luna could put up with Hermione but Hermione could not put up with luna.

As are Hermione and Ron, but that didn't stop Rowling. They have Harry and fighting Voldemort in common, so that makes a marriage, apparently. So other than both being Gryffindor, any argument for Ron/Hermione also works for Hermione/Luna.

**** its funny how i can't deal with Ron/Hermione but can make leaps to make Luna/Hermione work lol i think because i can see Luna being able to keep a cooler head and be patient when hermione is being slightly rude or bossy and maybe win her over if they fought and stuff, where as i can only ever see Ron and Hermione clashing and neither one being willing to give any ground in an argument due to both having rather fiery tempers? lol maybe It, I dunno... anyway thanks for both your thoughts so far :)

**** I personally can't stand [[/r/hr][r/hr]], I think we can all agree we fell in love with the characters and the magic and not the half-assed relationships or the plot hole riddled story. I personally just can't see how you could write a good, believable hr/l story

Harry and Ron do not find Hermione in 91, she survives with accidental magic (similar to Neville). Hermione becomes isolated and disillusioned with the magical world. Enter Luna the next year, who is mercilessly bullied. Hermione, more sympathetic due to similar circumstances, takes her under her wing and the two become close because they both are outcasts. Turn that into romance once Luna is 14/15 (so OotP or HBP).

As for the rest of the books, well, sucks to be Ginny. 16-year-old Riddle would be no immediate threat or can be killed by Dumbledore/Lily's protection. You could have Crookshanks capture Pettigrew or argue that without Hermione being involved in the group, the circumstances which lead to Sirius capture would not have happened. You could include a later friendship with Harry if you want.

Tl;dr: AU, but doable.

*** I mean you tried, but it just comes down to the fact that Luna just doesn't hit any of their catnip buttons when paired with Hermione.

There's little nibbles when she's paired with Harry or Ginny, but other than that, she just don't do nothing for them. She don't get the creative juices flowing.

Draco Malfoy on the other hand....

Only proves my point with the way he hits all their catnip buttons. Or at least, how the fandom percieves him because of fanon.

** Other than Crazy Little Things, the only Hermione/Luna fics I've read are [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/kirby/DS01.html][Divinest Sense]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5636901/1/][Luna's Girlfriend]]. Both are super short oneshots though, so definitely not what you're looking for in terms of length. I'll have to check out Pink and Blue, I've always wanted to read more of this paring, so thanks!

I think Hermione and Luna are different enough that a good writer can have fun creating circumstances where they end up falling for each other. Opposites attract is a cliche that I like to read as well, and I also think that they are more alike in ways that might suprise even them. They both are very knowledgeable and enjoy learning. Perhaps Luna's knowledge is more whimsical, but they're both passionate about the things they choose to learn and care about. They're also fiercely loyal to the people they call friends. And both of them can relate to being teased/bullied. They're strong, and are able to keep their head under pressure (Luna's patronus during the battle, Hermione when Bellatrix was torturing her). I think they're alike enough to make it work, and different enough to make their relationship interesting.

*** I do enjoy one shots too so thanks for the recommends :) though i do crave 100k beasts more haha also very ineresting take i do think with Luna being a ravenclaw she must have some fondness for knowledge and learning as you say...prehaps far different kinds of subjects than Hermione lol but i can see them bonding over things like that. Also the bullying aspect plays into how they sort of get together in pink and blue Hermione is outraged when she hears how people have stolen Luna's shoes and things go from there with her being very protective over her its all very fluffy but i loved it so far.

** I think "Crazy Little Things" is the go-to Luna/Hermione story. It is also not uncommon to have a Harry/Hermione/Luna relationship and, at least in the better execution of those, there is usually a pretty good dynamic between Hermione and Luna.

linkffn(3973687)

As for the opposites attract thing, I think that Luna and Hermione are too opposite to really work out (at least before the war). You usually have Hermione/Fleur or the rarer Hermione/Tonks to fill that niche, or Hermione/Bellatrix for the crack pairing version.

Fleur usually goes more into a "accept your own beauty/hate-to-love" direction with a pinch of creature mating stuff mixed in while Tonks stories usually lean more towards "pushing Hermione a little outside of her comfort zone//corrupting/ her/self-acceptance towards your personality".

*** Yes when i searched around i see everyone knows about crazy little things (for good reason as its really great) I kinda perefer stuff set at hogwarts. Though i see why people have a problem connecting Luna/Hermione during that time and post-war is easier to do. Though the pink & blue fic i mention does it fairly well set during HBP when Hermione is feeling a tad lonely while Ron runs off with lavandar and Luna kinda just stumbles into her life then. I feel thats always a good window of time to bring Hermione together with certain characters. also i have to confess to also liking Hermione/Bellatrix since you mention them even though its so very wrong ( i guess i just want Hermione to have a crazy girlfreind who is nothing like her... must be my kink lol) anyway thanks for your thoughts :)

**** Personally, I see the appeal of Bellamione. It's a ship with a lot of potential if you turn Bellatrix into "crazy but well meaning", a loose gun on Harry's side. And any Bellatrix redemption is a lot less problematic because unlike Malfoy or Snape, she paid dearly for her crimes.

My issue comes from the fact that every non time-travel story with that ship loves to pile on the problematic aspects instead of avoiding them like you see in Harry/Bellatrix. I asked around in the Bellamione tumblr community and they absolutely love the issues which result from the torture scene.

All I want is a Bellamione story where Bella turns after her Azkaban breakout and joins team Harry, where she becomes crucial by the virtue of massacring Death Eaters. All while having a thing with Hermione. But given the lack of such a story, I might as well write my own one, like when I got fed up by the lack of Hermione/Tonks and wrote a short story as a result.

** I find that Luna is possibly the hardest character to do well in fanfics if she is a main focus. She does well as a sidecharacter or a quirky background character, but most authors struggle if she's the focus of the story.

I have a hard time seeing her with Hermione since they are complete opposites. With good Ron/Hermione (also often an opposites attract thing) we often see Ron grounding Hermione with his down to earth approach. I think that dynamic works very well for them. But with Luna/Hermione it requires a lot more leaps from canon.

*** think that might be the reason now i think of it why there is so little luna Hermione or fics where Luna is the main character or 2nd most important character people find it hard to write Luna in a way that isn't completely nargles nargles cute nonsense and stuggle for balance maybe? even though they are an odd pairing i still find stuff like Bellamione(which i also enjoy) to be even more of a stretch than hermione/luna but some how has far more and longer 100k plus fics about them... but maybe bella is easier to write for people i guess? anyway thanks for your thoughts

**** I do think Bella is easier to write. Mainly because Bellamione requires the writer to explain how both overcome their difficulties. Working through that is already an excellent basis for a fic, there is tension between them that needs to be resolved for a romantic relationship. It does require a certain suspense of believe by the reader in a lot of fics (except for AU), but beyond that it's not necessarily hard to write.

I think Luna as a character and specifically the Luna Hermione relationship is far more tricky although more believable from a canon perspective. I have a lot of respect for authors who write a good Luna in a main role

***** Probably another reason Bellamione is more popular is that the way the films potray Bellatrix and with how the amazing helena bonham carter decided to play the role she sometimes looks at Hermione in kind of...i dunno... hungry way? lol as if shes thinking "hmm yummy...but no shes a mudblood must not feel desire"!! and is like mad at herself for thinking Hermione is attaractive? maybe thats just my overactive imagination haha... more likely its just since she had one on one screen time with Hermione people got the sense of some chemistry there unlike Luna who is never alone with Hermione on screen or in the book?...so maybe the ship never clicks into peoples minds the way Bellamione did when people saw the malfoy manor stuff

*** I agree about her being hard to write. She's one of my favorite character's, but I don't think I could ever take on her from a writing perspective. Plus, she's already perfect in the books, so I don't see much reason to read Luna fanfic.

**** Think i enjoy reading Luna romance fics as that was (probably wisely) not part of her story while at Hogwarts and we only hear about her lovelife after school from what jk rowling tweets right? I don't really like or want to read about Luna's character being altered persay just more about what she would be like to date. i don't mind people tweeking Hermione a bit to make her more gentle and less dismissive of Luna's belifes to make that kinda thing slightly plausible. Though i still like them to clash and fight sometimes though not have huge busts up at Ron/hermione level if you know what i mean haha. as i find couples having little tiffs and getting on each otehrs back sometimes like that to be cute and 100% lovey-dovey, no conflict stuff is hard to keep me interested
