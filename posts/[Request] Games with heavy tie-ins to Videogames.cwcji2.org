I've been playing some Skyrim recently, and I can't recommend Phenderix Magic World enough. But it got me thinking.

Harry Potter and the Game is one I remember, and there are a few others, but I'm not necessarily looking for Gamer! Harry fics (although any recs are appreciated).

I'm looking for fics that have the world, but steal elements from video games. Dragons attacking wizarding villages, spells, everything!

Discussion is welcome, but please keep it civil.


** Do you mean fanfics based off video games?

*** More like the settings of medieval video games.

** I dunno if it's exactly what you're looking for, but Magic Online is a pretty decent fic on FFN.
