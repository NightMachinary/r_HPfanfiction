Dark but no-evil Harry, Harry is a little precious dark shit bastard (Yeah! I know his parents were married!), The Next Dark Lord Potty, Dark political Harry, Harry is a little bit crazy, MoD Harry, Murderer Harry or Gray Harry who don't care use dark arts, etc, etc,etc.

Tom(Voldi no snake-face) x Harry, Draco x Harry, Daphne x Harry, Blaise x Harry, threesomes, No pairings at all, blablabla (NO Snarry, just... Aghhhh!!! Please).

Time-travel, Mentor Voldemort/Arcturus/Lucius(insert Dark witch or wizard), raise by Death/Vampires/Fate, bless by the gods, Salazar Slytherin reincarnation. And whatever random topic that lead Harry to be Dark/Gray (Remember, dark is not evil! Harry may be a pastry maker in the midst of famine who gives away his products for all I care). I just want to read a good Dark/Gray Harry story.

Oh! And if you know some Hufflepuff/Slytherin/Ravenclaw Harry stories I would love read those. But a Golden Gryffindor Dark/Gray Harry it's okay for me!


** Harry gradually turns more and more grey after getting sorted into Slytherin in linkffn(On the Way to Greatness).

I really enjoyed linkao3(1358209) even though it's incomplete. linkao3(1113588) and linkao3(1117301) have fantastic dark/grey Harrys too.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** For Lack of a Bezoar by BolshevikMuppet99 on ffn (I'm using the ffn app and you can't copy the link sorry).

Shorter 35k words, explores what might have happened if Ron had died. Meant as a sort of prequel to the next work, but can definitely be read on its own. Harry and Hermione kill a lot of people and have to struggle with the effects of dark magic.

Echoes in the Fog by the same author.

canon Harry and bezoar Harry and their friends are accidentally sent into a world where Voldemort has won and has Harry on his side. So it's basically grey Harry and canon Harry vs evil Harry. This fic is a bit over the top (Voldemort rules the world) and sometimes the torture seems like it's there for shock value (a la game of thrones) but the premise is interesting and it seems to fit what you've asked for.

  Our choices define us. When Harry and his closest friends are transported to an alternate dimension, thirty years after the war's end, and forced to face the results of what would have been if only they had chosen differently, he will discover just how true this is.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
