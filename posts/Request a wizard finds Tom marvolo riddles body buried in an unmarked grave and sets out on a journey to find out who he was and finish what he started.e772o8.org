Like it says after the final battle Voldemort was buried in an unmarked grave in a forest deep in the English country side and a young wizard digs it up. Finding a book he reads about the man who would become Voldemort and a plot is struck finish what he started and become the most powerful dark wizard ever so the man sets out to recruit allies and begin his acquisition and study of all manner of dark magic


** I wrote the following scene, hope you like it:

"You said Voldemort's grave was disturbed again? Did someone mutilate his corpse this time?" asked Harry Potter, Head Auror, incredulously.

"On your first question, it was identified by our surveillance charm around the burial site. My team later observed a young wizard treating the site in a reverential manner." replied Seamus.

Harry sighed, and continued "So another Dark Lord wannabe, did you perform the usual procedure?"

"Yes, we stunned him, and interrogated him with Veritaserum. He intended to become the most powerful dark wizard ever and finish what Voldemort had started. Because of his very malicious intentions, but lack of a criminal record, we performed a thorough investigation into his background and connections. We then obliviated him and let him go. "

"Very good, is he one of the usual suspects?" asked Harry.

"No, he's foreigner, a Hungarian Pureblood to be specific. His name is Victor Sanko. Director Hermione will not be pleased." said Seamus and chuckled.

Harry chuckled a little too and complimented on Seamus' work, before turning serious again "Keep him under close observation. This idiot might try to do something crazy such as making a Horcrux. We can't let him murder or torture anyone. Let me talk to Hermione first to see what options she has, before we carry out our next steps. Dismissed. "

Several minutes later, Hermione greeted him brightly "Hello Harry, what brings you suddenly to me today? You look serious."

"Another moron found and worshipped Voldemort's grave today. Seamus found out he wanted to continue what Voldemort had started."

"Damn. He's like the third one we caught this year, isn't he?"

Harry nodded, and said "but the most malicious one. I'd like to hear your opinion."

Hermione contemplated for a few minutes, before asking "Does he already have a following or like minded minions?"

"I didn't ask Seamus for details, but Seamus mentioned investigating about his connections. So I assume we already know something. "

"Good, if he does not have a following, we just run the usual sting operation and catch him in the planning process. That would net him at least 20 years in Azkaban. But if he already has minions, then we want to catch them all. Here, on our turf. Hungary is not a cooperative country. And that will take some more effort. "

"We need to offer serious baits then."

"Yes, I'm authorizing hundred thousand Galleons and a few dark artifacts for your effort. Find someone in your team who's from an Old Pureblood family, who can act, who's not an original DA member, and whom you can trust."

"Thanks, Hermione. By the way, our guy's name is Sanko, /Victor/ Sanko."

"Ha-ha-ha!" glared Hermione at Harry.
