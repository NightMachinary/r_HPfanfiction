Obscure as in things either barely mentioned or quasi-canon fields mentioned only in the films or accompanying material.

E.g. Catoptromancy (scrying for objects distant in space using a magic mirror and a special room), Aurology (tracing the aura of Dark magic to identify or locate the caster; somewhat canon), Alchemy, etc.

I was writing a bit where Seers have a general ability to see into the future a few minutes in addition to spontaneous prophesying and got the urge to read stories that focus a decent amount on less common magics.

Preferably no stories where the skill would obviously be abused by the antagonist but isn't because reasons.


** The more "conventional" magics in the fandom:

Divination: linkffn(*0800-Rent-A-Hero; Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy;* Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; Victoria Potter)

Mind Magics: linkffn(The Mind Arts; Stronger than Hope; A Cadmean Victory; Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

Necromancy: linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw; Too Young To Die; Blindness)

Spell Creation: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived; Ectomancer; Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge; What You Leave Behind)

Arithmancy: linkffn(The Arithmancer; Lady Archimedes)

Protective Enchantments/Wards: linkffn(The Mind Arts; Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived; A Black Comedy; The One He Feared; The Prisoner's Cipher)

Ancient Runes: linkao3(C'est La Vie), linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

Alchemy: mostly Dumbledore in linkffn(Patron; The Dark Lord Never Died) uses them cleverly

The more esoteric fics in the fandom:

Ectomancer linkffn(Ectomancer): Harry deals heavily with the spiritual world or as he calls it "The Other Side"

Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): a lot of magical info here, including the Black Arts (summoning demons) and ancient magic which requires longer chants but produces greater results

The Phoenix and the Serpent linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent): Harry is trained by several people as the fic progresses, including by one of the best OC's I can name. Bonus eye magic is actually done well here.

The Dark Lord's Equal linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal): interesting concepts on duelling and what is referred to as entanglement by Harry (combining several spells into one spell).

By The Divining Light and Conlaodh's Song linkffn(By The Divining Light; Conlaodh's Song): deals with Old Magic and goes into fair detail.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

****** First, regarding Dahlia. I won't spoil too much, so here is Dumbledore's explanation from chapter 1:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore leaned with his elbows on the desk. "Let me tell you a story."

  Though he did not need to, Harry leaned closer as well. Dumbledore spent a moment gathering his thoughts. When he spoke again, his voice had grown soft an his eyes looking at somewhere far away.

  "Many centuries ago," he said, "before the Four had even dreamed of founding Hogwarts and the Celts still roamed this land, there lived a great witch named Da Her knowledge of magic was both wide and deep, but so was her thirst for power. Thus she was corrupted, and walked the way of Nightgaunt, Halvan and Grind into the Dark Arts. She held council with vampires and other fell beings, and disappeared from the people's sight. When she returned, she had become somethin She became known as the Cimmerian Sorceress. Her power was staggering, incomparable. Many challenged her and died horribly, for like Voldemort, she too ha conquered death. Within a year it seemed the land would fall into her grasp.

  "But there was one who rose to challenge her and succeeded. This man was her own kin, her cousin Volarius. Volarius was wise and gifted with farsight. Since h not hope to kill Dahlia, he decided he had to imprison her. After much research, he discovered how to do it.

  "From meteorite ore he crafted a gemstone. He charmed it with sap from a Sylvan tree to make it unbreakable. He crafted its facets with fire, and polished its s with ice. When he had finished, the gem was a pale, clear crystal, the size of a human heart.

  "But he needed other things to complete his Crystal Cage. To control it, he had to infuse it with something that belonged to him. And to capture the Cimmerian Sorceress, he also had to infuse it with something that belonged to her. But though he schemed and plotted, he could not near enough to steal something from So he used the next best thing, the one thing that he shared with her---his own blood.

  "He cut his wrist and fused his blood with the Crystal, turning it into a crimson gem. Then he confronted Dahlia and the two fought a terrible battle at Stoneheng When he used the Crystal, it pulsed with power and drew Dahlia into itself. The Cimmerian Sorceress was no more, trapped forever in Volarius's cage."

  Dumbledore paused for a moment. Harry, who had been hanging on to his every word, asked, "Then what happened, Professor?"

  "Well," the Headmaster went on, "the people then did not know how Volarius defeated Dahlia, only that the Cimmerian Sorceress was gone and that there was p the land. Volarius could have been king, but instead he retired to a quiet life. He took his Crystal Cage and kept it in his secret vault. There was no danger of Dahlia escaping from it, but he kept it safe nonetheless till the day he died. Then his family took over its guardianship. From then on, the Crystal was passed on from generation to generation, but its secret was known only to a precious few.
#+end_quote

Anyway, the fic is pretty good, especially considering it was begun pre-OOTP. In essence, the story is something like The Odyssey, where the hero is sent on a journey, then struggles to return despite all the odds being stacked against him.

As for the romance. Its H/G, but Harry is basically never at Hogwarts and most of the fic revolves around both of them coming to terms with their own personal baggage. Its probably one of the better fics with the pairing actually, and an incredibly unique situation with 'Jamie' later in the story.
