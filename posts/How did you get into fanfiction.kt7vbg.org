I started watching Harry Potter fan theories on youtube and ended up getting youtube fanfiction in my recommended. I had soon watched all the fanfiction that is on youtube (I do not recommend, grammar is horrific, plot is poor and spelling is atrocious). There was this one fanfic that had a pretty good plot surprisingly enough but it was unfinished. So I decided if I could find it on google. I soon discovered that there were loads of well written fanfics that I could read and three years later I am still here.

So whats your story?


** Way back in the day (early 2000s) I was using Yahoo search to look up more about Harry Potter and stumbled on fanfiction.net. I was in heaven - all of these Harry Potter stories that I could read for free! It didn't take me long to try my own hand at writing (a story angsting everyone I could think of in the most unrealistic ways possible, now deleted from the internet, thank goodness). I took some time off from fic in college, but then started writing and reading fic again in 2010. I mainly did Stargate, followed by Criminal Minds, and then Teen Wolf. Then I got sick and took a seven year break while I dealt with my life. I started reading and writing again in 2017, but didn't post anything again until 2020, when I got back into the Harry Potter fandom which is where I started all those years ago.

** I used to read original works on wattpad. Then i read ONE (1) fanfic about 1Direction and i was hooked. Then i lost my taste for it and branched out to my favorite movies like HP, Marvel, and then books and anime.

HP is what made me make an FFN account while marvel is the reason I have an Ao3.

LoL. I'm not ashamed to admit that i enjoyed wattpad very much.

** Freshman year of high school, my girlfriends were all OBSESSED with the Draco Dormiens trilogy as it was being written. They got me into it and I was hooked. Happy to say my taste has improved since then haha.

** I stumbled upon a blog with an analysis of Madoka Magica, can't even remember how. There I saw an article about HPMOR. I don't think I read either of them.

I have to confess... I don't actually care about Harry Potter all that much. I liked the books when I was a kid and the movies are ok, I guess. I just like reading fanfiction for some reason and HP has a very large fandom. Even if a small percentage of fanfiction is quality, that's a lot of good works for something HP size. Spent quite a bit of time reading NGE fanfiction too. "Shinji and Warhammer40k" and "Nobody Dies" are the HPMOR of NGE, just with more lasers.

** Felt completely lost after finishing the series in 4th grade, and also wanted to see more romance in it, so I went online to see if JKR had released any secret add-ons that included Harry/Ginny details and found [[https://siye.co.uk][siye.co.uk]] (H/G fanfic website). Read that obsessively before switching to [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] towards the end of 5th grade, and read through a particularly good wbwl story with a Draco/Harry friendship that made me considering Drarry, and have been reading Drarry now for almost 10 years. I started waaaay too early and was exposed to waaaay too much (didn't really learn to check ratings until it was too late), but I don't know who I'd be without it!

** I was 12 years old and was watching a gravity falls clip on youtube and was reading the comment section and somebody at the very bottom of the comments was self promoting thier fanfiction so I clicked it and read it and got into reading all this cool fanfiction.

I then relized that their was fanfiction for other fandoms including one of the biggest fandoms in the world: Harry potter. Now I had just finished reading the series so I read everything I could find. Looking back some of them were really badly written but i didn't care.

When I was in 7th grade I thought I could try my own hand and made it on wattpad (I mostly read on ffn but I didn't have word document and I didn't know abut ao3) I wanted to self promote my fanfiction, and I had just found reddit so I looked for a subreddit for fanfiction and found this lovely place. Everyone here tried to tell me that It was terrible but I didn't take it well. I deleted it the very next year.

I've been reading fanfiction for about 5 years now and have been on the subreddit for 3 1/2, and I havn't left since.

** I'm a kpop fan and my habit of reading fanfictions started thereüòÇ a lot of fanfiction writers don't really care about the quality of their story. Bad grammar and so many plotholes that if they were galleons I'd be richer than the malfoys. Especially the ones on YouTube, where they're all videos so obviously they put text and then some pictures to describe the background. But since the ones you watch are in the wizarding world, basically all backgrounds needed are provided by the movies but some really dumb creators will really say "y/n doesn't know who's outside her door" and then the picture is of a door, with WINDOWS NEXT TO IT LIKE fjfjdksksk BOI make it make sense

** In the long gap between the publishing of the fifth and sixth books, I had already reread books 1-5 innumerable times and was looking for more. I stumbled on Mugglenet, found their fanfiction section, and kept following trails from there.

I read lots of stuff on The Petulant Poetess and the various Sycophant Hex communities, and I followed links from Know It Alls to read on LiveJournal and other places. Much was terribly written; some was pretty disturbing; however, plenty of it was fine, and a few gems were good or even great, so I kept reading (if not always with the fervor I had in the early discovery days.)

I hadn't actually read much on FF or AO3 until just a few years ago but now read from those sites almost exclusively, mostly because there are easy ways to save/download fics for offline reading.

** Back in 2012, I was a huge one direction fan and on tumblr I stumbled across a girl writing a harry styles fanfic to practise for her english gcse(?) I didnt know fanfiction existed so it was the best day of my life when I realized I could read stories about a fandom I already liked, because I loved reading. I got obsessed with one direction fanfiction and didn't branch out for a while.

A few months later I was back in my Harry Potter phase (I was an HP fan for longer) and I thought to myself ‚Äúhey, I wonder if there's anything like fanfiction for Harry Potter?? Probably not because we already have books...‚Äù like I actually felt stupid thinking I could find anything as I googled ‚Äúharry potter fanfiction‚Äù. Imagine my face when I realized just HOW MUCH there was out there...

I got sucked immediately. I didnt know what to read and I found it so bizarre that anyone would ship Draco/Hermione so I clicked on a fanfic and it was so cute, dramione became my otp. And then I found FFN and the rest is history!

** Somewhere between 2008-2010 I was watching Merlin, like most people and was using Den of Geek to look at theorems ok what was going to happen in the next episode. One of the comments linked a fanfiction and I feel into a hole of mostly Merlin.

I left that and for 10 years lived a fanfiction free life.

Until the pandemic hit... And I was left alone... And I got back into Harry Potter and was ranting to a friend about Remus Lupin. And my friend said "Sure people probably write fanfiction about this?"

And low and behold. Here I return. A decade older but still as obsessed as ever üëå

** It was mostly by accident for me. I started following [[/r/HarryandGinny][r/HarryandGinny]] without realising that the subreddit was mostly about fanfiction. Well, on one post, a fic was recommanded and I thought /'Sure, why not.'/ and started reading. At first I was quite uncomfortable (mostly because I was still in the mind that fanfiction was cringe (yes, I know, it's stupid, I know that now)) but after a few chapters it became fun to read and that's when it spiraled out of control and now I read fanfiction every fucking day lmao.

For those curious, my first ever fanfic was /Harry Loves Ginny and Ginny Loves Harry/ by Epeefencer. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7055185/1/Harry-Loves-Ginny-and-Ginny-Loves-Harry]]) which is a compilation of one-shots where Harry and Ginny start dating earlier than in canon.

  This story will be a series of unrelated chapters. All will be based on different moments in the JKR books where Harry and Ginny could have gotten together before they did in the Canon Story. Though the first is in the CoS they will be posted at random.

** I used to spend a lot of time on TV tropes. Eventually noticed that some shows have fanfic recommendation pages. Took a while to find one with an interesting enough summary for me to actually try one. It was for some anime that I'm not sure I even finished, but I remember that I was not very impressed by it. Can't even remember the name. I think it was about a school with a lot of monsters? I went to the TV tropes to decide if I should continue watching it.

The fanfic recc page had some kind of grittier, darker rewrite of the anime and I got curious enough to try it out. It blew me away. I've liked it so much better than the original that I never considered actually finishing the show (I can't actually vouch for the quality of the fic though, its been a while, and I it didn't take a lot to impress me back then).

From there I would just read fanfics if I was losing interest in a show but still liked the characters world it introduced. I've liked Naruto when I was younger, but lost interest in show towards its end due to some questionable writing decisions, so I began reading fanfics. Eventually read enough Naruto fanfic that it was difficult to find fics that were both decently written and interesting, but discovered that Harry Potter was the biggest fanfiction fandom.

I'm not actually a very big Harry Potter fan. I couldn't get into the books and while I like the movies just fine I doubt I'd read HP fanfics if the fandom wasn't so big. While I'm not the biggest fan of canon, there are enough works out there to keep me interested, and their overall quality seems to be better than Naruto fanfics.

I was 11.

I was confused, cause I didn't know wtf fanfiction even was, and I was all, ‚ÄúWhat the hell? What is this? Why don't I remember this?‚Äù

** There is an Icelandic site that has a bunch of different communities. You could say it was reddit, before reddit became a thing.

Anyway, I stumbled onto the site, found the HP community, and discovered fanfiction. These stories were written by Icelanders, some in our native language, and some in English. From there, I found harrypotterfanfiction.net. Eventually, I discovered ffn.net. This was in 2003.

I feel ancient now...

** I started reading fics while waiting for Book 5 to arrive, mainly on Sugarquill. I also tried to write my own fics around that time, but never published them. One was about a Harry who disappears after the final battle with Voldemort only to be rediscovered by an OC after he saves her from something. OC finds out that Harry had not killed Voldemort but merely 'trapped' the Dark Lord into himself. This prompted the decision to distance himself from his friends and the rest of the world. Another was a Snape x OC which had the OC being the adopted daughter of the Flamels and Snape being friends with her and Lily. Beyond those details, I can't remember what the plot was about anymore.

After that time, I didn't read HP fanfics because my focus shifted to Naruto. I did read a few fanfics again after Book 7 was released and once more tried to write my own story.

However, the time that I really got hooked on reading HP fanfics was in 2012, while going through a tough time in my life. I found 'solace' in going through everything in Rorschach Blot's Top of the Mark C2 on FFN. I was addicted to fanfics at that point coz I would just read, read and read until I didn't know what time I fell asleep and when I woke up, I would see that I had reached a chapter but couldn't remember how I got there. Things got better later on but I now know that whenever I start reading HP fanfics indiscriminately, I'm probably in an emotional crisis.
