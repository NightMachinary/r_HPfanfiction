Are there any fics with Percy Weasley as the focus? Any self inserts or Time travel fics? He seems like a great character for a redo / redemption story, as his age and positions (first at Hogwarts and then at the Ministry) would allow him to make many changes.

** linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities) is a strange case with regards to Percy. He was a secondary character in the background in that story, but he was so much better than the rest of the story, that the author rewrote whole story as linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities) from his point of view, and it is really good.
