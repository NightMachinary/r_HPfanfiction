I love Gringotts in fannon. I love harry finding out about his old life and what has been past down to him and his journey to re-claim what was lost to him by evil!dumbles. I was looking for a fun cutesy Harry/Daphne story and ran across this vampire!harry story today. The story is "Twisted Fate" by moonbeamwolf - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4763732]]

However what I found here takes the cake for all the overpowered storylines that I have read in the last year. So bravo! to you mr. moonbeamwolf.

*** "Mr Potter, why are you going to a bank for an ancestry test? You don't trust the healers at St. Mungo's to store your galleons either, do you?"

"Err, no. But I thought..."

"You thought there was more than just one treasure-filled vault waiting for you? And you wizards have the nerve to call us goblins greedy."

"But Dumbledore has been manipulating me for my entire life and I just found out!"

"No wizard is above Gringotts rules. Mr Potter, rest assured that even if Professor Dumbledore had any malicious intent towards you, your gold would be perfectly safe here. Not even the ministry has the authority to seize belongings stored at Gringotts. They tried with the Lestrange vault, but the Peace Treaty of 1655 guarantees the independence of Gringotts. Both the Ministry and Dumbledore know better than to risk another rebellion."

Angry and disappointed, Harry marched up to the ministry to claim his seat on the Wizengamot.

"Mr Potter," Amelia Bones greeted him.

"I want to claim my family's seat on the Wizengamot."

"There are no family seats on the Wizengamot. That muggle absurdity called the House of Lords is entirely unknown to magical politics. It is true that your great-grandfather Henry held a seat, but he was succeeded by Griselda Marchbanks after his death.

And what's that Lord Potter title you're talking about? There are no wizard lords except the self-proclaimed dark one. The Malfoys were part of muggle nobility once, but even that title did not extend to the magical world.

I know that muggle-raised children are often unfamiliar with our political system. The ministry has educational booklets on the subject available for free, suitable for children aged 10 and older. Do you want some?"

"I am perfectly able to see through this manipulative system on my own!"

Amelia raised her wand and pointed it at Harry. She muttered an incantation.

"Oh no," Harry thought. "What have I done."

Now everyone would believe Fudge's claims that he was mad, and not without good reason.

"Mr Potter, it seems you were under the influence of a very strong confundus charm, so I won't hold anything you said against you. My niece told me you were smart, and I trust her judgement, so I was quite frankly baffled by your behaviour."

"Thank you. I'd better go back to Gringotts and apologize to the goblins," Harry said.

** Nothing over the top like that, but I had a Harry who was resurrected in the graveyard when he hijacked the ritual (which used Cedric's blood), and found out when he went to Gringotts that he had accidentally been blood adopted into House Diggory. And Cedric's dad was confused as hell.
