#+TITLE: You know what’s sad? The fact that most of us won’t be alive to see Harry Potter enter the public domain. Picture all the stories set in the Wizarding World that would get published! Ah well, there is always fanfiction.

*** It's allowed once it's in the public domain. That's why there are so many versions of Sherlock Holmes floating around. Most of the original books entered the public domain. Not all are in the public domain yet, but most of them are. One day, like 100-150 years down the line, HP will also be in the public domain.

**** To clarify: my objection isn't that copyright laws will cease to apply to the Harry Potter books, but that they still apply at all.

(I was riffing off the old chestnut that “property is theft.”)
