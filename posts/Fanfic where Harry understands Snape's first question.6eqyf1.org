I read a fanfic (I believe on AO3 but perhaps on fanfiction.net) in which Harry understands and thanks Snape for his apology/message hidden in the questions asked during the first potions class.

This wasn't the main plot point of the fanfic, but I recall that particular scene and I would like to find this story again. (It wasn't Garden of Intrigue.)

EDIT: Supplied by [[/u/heavy__rain]], it was "Oh God Not Again!". A good fanfic all around, highly recommend.


** Was it linkffn(Accidental Animagus) ? There is an apology using the language of flowers that Harry responds to.

*** Not this one, but it looks good anyway (though it is quite long, isn't it?). I'll check it out, thanks. :)

*** General cherrypicking from [[https://www.pottermore.com/features/lily-potter-petunia-and-the-language-of-flowers][this]].

/‘What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?'/

Asphodel is a type of lily and means ‘remembered beyond the tomb' or ‘my regrets follow you to the grave' while wormwood is often associated with regret or bitterness.

/What is the difference is between monkshood and wolfsbane/

Monkshood is associated with ‘chivalry' while wolfsbane can mean ‘misanthropy' or a dislike of others.

/Petunia Dursley/

It is a flower that can, in the language of flowers, mean ‘resentment and anger'.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
