Love the tropes and ships you love to read. We're all here to enjoy ourselves (one would hope) so the best we can do is to encourage each other to find the stories that make us feel fuzzy inside.

We have to remember, however, that there are different strokes for different folks.

Yesterday, the DLP Troll struck again, and several of us fell for its bait as we descended into the age-old argument of "is slash inherently bad, and is/was DLP bad for vetting it".

It goes without saying that you should read whatever tickles your fancy. If it doesn't, not wanting to read slash doesn't make you any more homophobic than "X"-ing out of a Black!Hermione fic would make you racist.

Yeah. I went there.

And I had to, because many of us only tend to be rational, fair and even-tempered when it suits us, i.e. when what we like to read is being "attacked". The downvoting brigade on the other side proves that time and time again.

So I guess my central question is this: if you have such a problem with people not liking what you read (whether it's slash, het, harem, M-preg, cross-generation, incest, etc.), well... Why? /Especially/ when you acknowledge that a specific fic that you're reading is pure wish-fulfilment and (probably) poorly written.


** Put simply, there's a difference between not wanting to read something, and saying that such a thing is bad/unacceptable.

You don't want to read slash? Fine

You think /no one/ should read slash and people shouldn't write it, downvote threads where people ask for slash, and generally act like anything slash related is bad? Not fine.

That's not to say that you can't believe that 95% of slash is shit, because it's true, but as long as you admit that 95% of het is shit as well, because 95% of *all fanfic* is shit. That's the downside of amateur writers.

I don't expect everyone to like the same things I like, and I'm not going to like all the things that other people do, but as long as we don't trash talk other people and leave everyone to their respective corners, we should all get along fine.

*** I agree with you wholeheartedly, which was sort of the point of the post/rant.

I don't actually mind slash. Hell, I've read /non-magic/ AU slash and enjoyed it. I'm pretty sure most DLP-ers would read a well-written, younger Dumbledore-centric fic with everything that one would entail.

But I'm not attracted to men, and given that I'm also really picky with my fic choices, slash is out of the window when it comes to searching for new reads. End of. We've got twenty-four hours in a day, so I'm not going to waste it on something that might squick me out. (i.e., Sub!Harry, unannounced M-Preg, non-con, etc.)

Someone wrote something to the same effect yesterday, and it was downvoted just because. It wasn't spiteful, but it was honest. No one should be shamed for that.

Almost all fanfic is bad, yes. So, like dating, it's probably best to be picky and wait for the closest approximation to Ms/Mr. Right in an author.

I'm kind of your opposite. I intentionally seek out fics with characters holding opposing viewpoints or having had very different life experiences compared to mine. The way I see it, I already spend 99% of my time in my head so I may as well read about someone else's.

** Okay, so why, for a specific point in fics that I seriously dislike, and will actively downvote (though usually after having a glance over the fic to ensure that it's as bad as I think it is), is M-preg, though pregnancy generally can also get the blue down arrow.

Why?

Well, simply, because there are an extremely limited number of fics that actually use pregnancy in a manner that actually develops the plot or fits into a piece of fiction. I will admit to having found a couple of fics with pregnancy in that were worth reading, but I have never found an M-preg fic that was (and, if someone can point me towards a good example of an M-preg fic, you'll have my thanks). Pregnancy in the vast majority of fics, exists simply for a character to be pregnant. It isn't about developing the character of the mother (or carrier? in M-preg? is that the word? Do you still use expectant mother for a male? I've seen it vary for fic to fic.) and allowing them to overcome the inherent difficulties to continue to be an awesome protagonist. It isn't used to bring in children characters that contribute to the story further. It is generally distasteful to use as a plot point in combat or adventure fic (despite authors' best efforts). In almost every case, it isn't used. It just is.

In a vast majority of circumstances, adopting a child would circumvent a long period of down time in which one of the main characters is generally far weaker than otherwise, it would allow for the development of a character that isn't just generic-bawling-infant, and it allows for a new character with background. One of the greatest things about meeting characters once they've developed a bit is the character's past and motivations. When you start a character literally from the beginning, a lot of mystery and diversification is impossible.

And then, with regards to pregnancy itself, especially in the HP universe, forces a period of downtime and weakening of a character when all other characters are getting on with their lives. It would be rare for the balance of power to be kept when a character is pregnant. Also, in a lot of fics, pregnant characters are made 'useless' as opposed to inconvenienced for an entirely too large a proportion of the pregnancy. In M-preg fics, this has a tendency to be /even/ worse, essentially removing all sense of strength from a character, regardless of previous characterization. What's worse is that there's no good reason for this separation in behaviour between female and male pregnancies in fiction. People don't even appear to attempt to rationalize why a female pregnant character will be vaguely incompetent, while a male one will be utterly useless. At least pregnant Hermione/Ginny/Whoever will get the opportunity to cast a few spells and at least try to help in fics. The M-preg character will be left essentially weaponless, and instead of using the pregnancy to establish conflict with outside forces the fic will devolve into a whinefest, with the suspension of all conflict.

I realize, at this point I'm just ranting, so apologies.

And so it is, that I find the majority of M-preg (and pregnancy) fics lacking in a coherent reason for a lot of the choices made. Would an adopted character have better character development? Would having no 12 month period of downtime allow for better flow? Would time skipping over the pregnancy allow for better flow? Perhaps skipping to the children being late toddlers? Is the pregnancy a source of conflict, that other similar problems (disease? ritual gone wrong? injury? curse?) can't replace? Do the characters have a good reason to commit to a child? Does it make any kind of sense, really?

While pregnancy is an issue that almost every one of us will experience from one perspective or another, and child rearing similar, does it contribute to a story? Is the pregnancy a valuable and interesting plot point?

In most cases, the answer is no. Thus why I will join the downvote brigade for those fics.

Some fics that I feel have dealt with pregnancy and/or children well:

The Lioness Prophecies (ask around for a pdf if you want to read it) Pregnancy is a major plot point (if I'm remembering the correct fic), and Hermione manages to develop her character and abilities while pregnant, leading to her being an integral part of Voldemort's defeat in the end. SSHG.

linkffn(Holly Evans and the Spiral Path) (Newt is probably my favourite OC of any fic)

And, maybe it's just because my head is stuck in rant-a-thon mode, but I can't think of any more, though I know I've read several more.

If you've managed to get to the end of this wall of text complaining about the use and misuse of pregnancy in fiction, congratulations. Any discussion on the subject, any recommendations that run counter to my arguments, maybe even examples that show what I was talking about, all are welcome.

*** Thanks for replying. It's fair to say that you've given this a lot of thought, so I don't doubt that you've read enough stories to have formed your personal tastes.

That being said, what would it take for a "Holly Evans"- level fic to thaw your initial aversion? Recommendations from other readers? The summary? I mean, the tag-line could be /fire/ with no grammatical errors, but has that "M-Preg" sticker tacked on at the end. What does it take to overlook that?

**** So, a combination of high favourite count, personal recommendations, the first chapter being well written sometimes, and the authors starting notes all affect the chance of me reading such a fic. And how bored I am, I guess.

An example of where this fails, is for instance the fic Rise of the Drackens (just as an example of the top of my head). This fic is on the first page of Ao3's Harry Potter - J.K. Rowling tag, when sorted by kudos, and, is frankly one of the worst M-preg fics I've ever read. Even amongst creature fics it's bad. There were also a couple of people who pointed me towards it. I read something like 700k words of it before getting so frustrated that I dropped it, and never read any of the derivative creature fics, despite me being quite willing to read bad fiction if it's a creature fic.

This is why I generally skim the first chapter before dismissing out of hand. If it admits to M-preg and the summary is bad, on the other hand, that likely means that I won't even bother with the initial skim.

So, really, I take each in a case by case basis, but find the vast, vast majority fall short.

At one point I'd read all the fics that interested me in the first 30 pages of Ao3's HP sorted by kudos (I was really really bored for a few months), so I know I've read a lot of M-preg, just none of it was very memorable, excepting the really really bad ones.

Out of curiosity, are there any you would recommend?

I don't think ihateseatbelts meant to whine about perceived slights about DLP. I mean, you can tell from his posts just in this thread.

About not disagreeing with LJW599, it's telling regarding what? Am I required to disavow them? They said that slash generally sucks, which I agree with. I also agree that most fanfiction of any genre sucks. And I like to think that DLP strives to "take the best", though to what extent that's true I couldn't say with absolute confidence. Like you said, "/bothered/ to disagree". Why should I bother? They're inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.

******* Your first point: I think ihateseatbelts was speaking for himself and his impression of the situation, not as a DLP spokesperson. Then again, I can understand it if he was being defensive about DLP, I myself am prone to that, just as you are being defensive about this sub. If you take this LJW599 person as representative of DLP, I can take the person who made the "DLP is homophobic" thread to be representative of the sub, which would be stupid because I consider myself a part of the community here, even though I'm still a new guy. So, I don't see how ihateseatbelts was being hypocritical.

Second point: so what? Again, are DLPrs required to disavow every clown that signs up? LJW599 talked out of his ass. Your expectation that other DLPrs should have said"he's not with us" is silly.

Third point: where did I say I considered my preferences to be objectively good? I don't have to prove it because I said nothing of the sort. DLP's tastes tend to align with my own and, as a community, we try to seek out good fanfiction. I can tell you that there are fics in our Library that were very well reviewed years ago, that I'm convinced would get slammed today. Does DLP tend to be arrogant? Sure, I'd say so. But when someone outright calls us homophobes because most of us don't like slash, I take issue with that.

***** Thanks, Scott - this is all I was getting at. It wasn't supposed to be a moany post as such (maybe a /teesny/ bit ranty), but the pace at which the dialogue unfolded in the earlier thread intrigued me.

That guy has posted a few odd threads in a very short period of time, but we were content to regard it as genuine to fuel debate.

But this sort of trope allegiance seems to appear in all sorts of quarrels: Wizards vs Muggles; time travel; "reading the books"; cross-generational pairings, etc.

I didn't mean to sound preachy, but you can't help but reason how funny it is that we're willing to override our judgement for the sake of an argument. That's what happened here: there was a troll, and we should have ignored it, but devotion to this particular recurring debate proved too strong.

I just thought it would be cool to talk about it to foster understanding on all sides of the fandom (what with us being fairly diverse in tastes) but I apologise for being inconsiderate and coming across as an... um, apologist (okay, just one non-pun. But I really am sorry.)

As for not disagreeing with said user, that should be a given. But yes - DLP take pride in hosting well-written fics. That's pretty cool. Being an arse about it and using it to cloak your prejudices behind half-hearted critique is definitely not, and this is precisely the sort of reaction I was referring to in the OP.

The reception that non-slash readers received was more interesting to me though, because it was compounded with the DLP debate (which has been going back and forth from here to there, so both Macsen and Scott were right, here). The bigger issue has appealed to me ever since I've stepped out from lurking in the fandom, and as this sub is replete with curious people, so I don't think I'm alone, there.
