I don't understand why people don't write alchemy stories more especially if they want a OP harry

The philosopher stone is at least already established as a way to become powerful & imortal & is a way more interesting instead of introducing these 3 items in THE LAST BOOK OF THE SERIES!!

Alchemy is pretty much an open book for what we could introduce in terms of new magic!

If we operate under the Canon assumption that power equals study & determination ala Dumbledore and voldemort then Nicolas flemell & his wife should be the 2 most powerful spell caster since merlin period they've been alive for 666 years! Nicolas created the pinnacle of alchemy something that alchemists both muggle & wizard were trying to achieve since the days of ancient china. He should not have feared voldemort getting the stone at all especially in his wraith form.

Rant over sorry had to vent

Any stories you guys can recommend


** The problem is that in canon alchemy is just a footnote. There is basically anything to do it, so the author has to basically go from scratch and come up with his own rules and stuff, unless he uses the idea from another source.

Also, I am not entirely sure about your theory that "age = power". There are plenty of old people in the world of harry potter, they aren't all super powerful.

Hell, the NEWT lady is older than Dumbledore, doesn't mean she can kick voldemort's ass. And Voldemort is half as hold as Dumbledore and almost as strong. Maybe more.

*** I agree! Flamel could be just a person smart enough to discover/learn about the stone rather than a magically powerful person. (In my headcanon I kind of think of Flamel like a scientist who've discovered something new rather than someone who invented something to escape death. ) I do think they'd know a thing or two about anti-dark lord stuff after living for years though...

**** And even if he did make the stone through pure skill and intelligence, it means he is a great alchemist/crafter, doesn't necessarily mean he is a good fighter or has raw power.

Plus, knowledge is often specialized. Even more so who are particularly exceptional at their craft, which means they focus more on it.

He could not give a shit about dark arts, transmutation and that kind of shit and just focus on researching alchemy and things related to it.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** Significant Digits is all about Harry using the Stone to heal people, and defending against dark wizards (and two school mischief makers) trying to steal it.

It's a sequel to HPMoR though so.....
