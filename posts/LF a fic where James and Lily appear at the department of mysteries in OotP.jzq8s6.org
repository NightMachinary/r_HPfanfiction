:END:
I can remember a few key points. James and Lily never actually died, they took Harry's twin and hid away for many years. Turns out the Longbottoms did the same with Neville's twin. They all appear after DoM and shock the world. Harry's obviously pissed off.

Really can't remember what it was called..

#+begin_quote
  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived. And then, things get complicated. Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.
