** Looking for a fanfiction with a slytherin hero? Want a dark, but not evil protagonist? Do you want ambition without cruelty? Snappy dialogue? The best gilderoy lockhart you've ever seen?

This is your fic.

** Anyone want to honestly and objectively sell me on it? I keep seeing it pop up but something about the title, summary, and perhaps concept put me off. I think it might be the fear of a Hermione being cunning, ambitious, ruthless, and totally the best.

I just get the vibe that rather being plain and largely unconcerned with appearance (and slightly self conscious about her large teeth) she grooms herself better and is automatically pretty. That not only does she not rub people the wrong way with a bossy voice and annoying know it all habits, but uses quick wit to verbally diminish others and boost herself. That rather than be relatively pants at Defence (to her own performance in other classes) she now can totally beat Harry/everyone in their year.

I want her to still have flaws along with her strengths such as her intelligence, skill, work ethic, tenacity, and so on. At the very least so that she is not pushed so far where she has the charisma, good looks, and once-in-a-century brilliance of Voldemort and Dumbledore.

Alternatively any folks who don't like it, whether indifferent or active dislike, want to chime in?

*** The nearest comparison I can make is harry potter and the boy who lived. She is not prettier. She is certainly not better liked. Her grades in defense may be better than Harry's, but her practical skills aren't on the same level. She has flaws and internal struggles, but they aren't (for the most part) schoolwork related. I don't want to spoil it for you-this is really, truly honestly one if my two favorite fics, and certainly my favorite "rehash of cannon years at Hogwarts" fic.

"Objectively selling" is an oxymoron. Everyone wants different things from their fic. I will, however, try to allay your concerns.

#+end_quote

That's actually all canon, except for "totally the best", which depends on what you include in your "totally". :P

But seriously...

#+begin_quote
  I just get the vibe that rather being plain and largely unconcerned with appearance (and slightly self conscious about her large teeth) she grooms herself better and is automatically pretty.
#+end_quote

That most certainly doesn't happen. The last chapter actually has an amusing scene with the exact opposite theme.

#+begin_quote
  That not only does she not rub people the wrong way with a bossy voice and annoying know it all habits, but uses quick wit to verbally diminish others and boost herself.
#+end_quote

Not sure what you mean by quick wit, but those flaws you list are still there --- but she is placed in a social context where some of these are actually beneficial at least some of the time.

#+begin_quote
  That rather than be relatively pants at Defence (to her own performance in other classes) she now can totally beat Harry/everyone in their year.
#+end_quote

She does study ahead on Defense and spends time practicing, yes. As for who is better at it, it's complicated and would be a bit of a spoiler. However, I will say that if you are mortally offended by the idea of Hermione might ever, ever beat Harry in a duel, you probably shouldn't read this fic.

The fic doesn't fix her flaws, don't worry. Quite the opposite, in a lot of ways.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** Is this a thing now, posting when fics have been updated? I'm not opposed to it, and it's kinda nice to see what's new/in progress, but it just seems kinda... /excessive/ to me. Maybe like a sidebar thing, with a scrolling news ticker for recently updated fics? I dunno.

I think its just the Promo!Tag combined with the MostRecentChapter!link rubbing me the wrong way.

*** Yeah, I feel you. Certainly not something we want tona of. and if it were another fic I wouldn't be quite so excited (innocent, etc. Updates every week pretty reliably-doesnt make me quite so exuberant). But I've seen similar posts before and I figured this was the, uh, cleanest way to do it. If you (or the subreddit in general) has a suggestion for this type of situation going forward, I'd love to have that discussion.
