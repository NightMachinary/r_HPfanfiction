:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I know that Harry is together with an OC who is muggle but then they go back in time, in which both Harry and the OC are magical. I don't remember much else besides that Harry also goes to a special wood to acquire a wand or stave, but is indebted to the Queen of that area who is quite powerful and can sedduce anyone; but in return for the wand Harry has to give up his 1st born son as a consort to her. He has a child with the OC. I also remember that the last chapter has the Queen punished by Harry's son for doing something. Do you know this Fan fiction?


** Okay, I've read this one. I think I followed it, so let me look through my history.

The Queen is actually the queen of the dark fairies. Harry's original staff that she gave him gets destroyed so he has to go back to her for another, which annoys her that he didn't take care of her original gift.

  Harry Potter defeated the Dark Lord Voldemort, what was his payment? He got kicked out of the Wizarding world! They tried to bind his magic and it backfired, so what has Harry been doing the past 15 years since his escape from that world, and what happens when he gets a chance to take another trip around the bend? Time Travel Story, some bashing. Independant!Harry. OOC.

*** Yes, that's the one I was thinking of. Don't know if it's the one the OP wanted. :)

**** I hope so, because I'm not sure if I want to live in a world where two people wrote stories with that plot.
