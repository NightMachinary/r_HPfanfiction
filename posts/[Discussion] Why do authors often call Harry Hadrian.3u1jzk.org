Harry isn't even a nickname for Hadrian, it just make it sound illogical


** It's the name of some roman emperor, it's mostly just to make him sound impressive and "lordly".

*** Which is weird since "Prince Henry of Wales" is called "Prince Harry". I would say that's a quite strong argument to consider Harry "lordly" enough.

** One of my least favourite cliches is when Harry isn't his real name. Or in dimension/time travel fics, where he changes his name and just becomes this new OC.

Hadrian seems specifically popular for Lord Potter stories, because Harry is /too much a commoners name/. I remember reading a HPxLotR fic where the author basically said something like "I hate the name Harry so I'm changing it".

*** Especially ironic when you consider that it's Hadrian that's the comoner's name, at least around Medieval times. In addition to that, the current British Royal Family is perfectly fine with Prince Henry being called Prince Harry.

** I can't actually read a story that uses "Hadrian". Someone, people have gotten it into their heads that when they're writing a "political" or "pureblood society" story, that they need to mark off a bunch of checkboxes to do it, and having Harry's name be something ridiculous is enough to get the point across? It's usually accompanied by a hyphenated name, because apparently you can't be an upstanding member of society without one. It's all paint-by-numbers bullshit that doesn't actually matter at all.

**** Everyone has that /one/ fic that they turn a blind eye to, in which they consider it to be the one that disproves the point. The problem is, that I can view things objectively, I have read (rather, tried to, and ended up skimming it) that story, and it's just not good at all. This isn't the first time someone has brought that story up as an example, and I just roll my eyes every time.

******* Don't want to be an arse, but it really would be better for you to just stop trying to defend yourself as far as that issue goes.

I mean, I do get your point, but it's also clear that you do have a bias; how much that bias influences your ability to judge this particular story objectively matters not, for what matters is the fact that people will dismiss your claims of being able to do so due to the bias regardless of whether they are right or you.

On that note, I haven't read that story so I can't say whether I consider you to be right or wrong here. But I will say this: for me what matters is whether the name change, any name change, makes sense or not. So if there is a reason, an actual sensible reason, for the name change that is presented in the story, then I can accept Harry being named Henry, Hadrian, Jean-Jaques, or even Zulu the First. Of course, if there's no reason for the name being changed then it'll just make me roll my eyes or groan, but oh well.

********* The latter. And it doesn't matter if it's truly here, what matters is what people see. And they see you as biased.

Though to be honest, your speech about all the stories with the name change being bad did present you as biased. So you aren't completely faultless as far as people seeing you as biased goes, even if you did not intend for it to be read that way.

*********** True that. But then again, that's normal for humans; we are all Pavlovian dogs, so to say. So that people form biases is not exactly surprising.

On that note, “pup” is kind of wrong since Sirius had a hard time seeing Harry as Harry rather than James, so any pet names of that sort are really unlikely (and a bad pun); though personally I've yet to stop reading a story because of that alone, anything that I do stop reading has a plethora of other problems in the text.
