Anyone in the know - will these ever being completed? I had seen in the past he had abandoned them (the HP ones) for so he could start writing Star Wars to "practice his writing" so he could work on a book he wants to publish traditionally. Why start a new fandom and multiple, unfinished, stories to practice, when he seemed to be practicing in his Harry Potter stories? I like Star Wars, but his just aren't at the level Found in the Ashes, or even Laughing All the Way to London seemed to be. It seems like he just gave up on writing them, and used an excuse to start on Star Wars.

I know he's Dyslexic because that's all he seems to characterize himself by, but his FIVE Star Wars stories are ALREADY going down the route of all his Harry Potter ones. He starts one, then another, and another, without regard to actually completing anything, or even trying to fix spelling mistakes - which he leaves up to Grammarly.

I loved those stories back when he actually seemed to care. Anyone know at all?

And as ranty as this comes across, it's not meant to bash or whatever. I'm just disappointed yet another author has just given up, I guess. He's not being paid for his fan fics, but literally any communication would've been nice.


** I have no idea. I know that I liked the HP stories of his that I have read. Have you tried to reach out/pm him and ask if he might eventually finish HP stories he started?

I know that the one story I was reading Laughing All the Way to London was updated in December.

The other story I was following The Beauty Beneath was last updated in July 2019.

The story Easier Than Falling Asleep is marked as a WIP but it's last chapter is a 19 Years Later epilogue so it's complete just not marked as such.

*** I had messaged when he first announced he was writing Star Wars, and never got a response, so I just assume he was asked a bunch and got fed up replying /:

Guess it's my fault for following non-complete works </3
