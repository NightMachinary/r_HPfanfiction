I don't want him to be a good guy. Never like those stories that make him good and Dumbledore and the Order suddenly evil.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash etc. Doesn't have to focus on pairings

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New/Would rather it be completed but if not that's fine

Would rather not have character bashing. Now things being brought up from canon I wouldn't necessarily find bashing, but Dumbledore blocking Harry's magic/Using Harry for his fame/fortune. Weasley's using Harry for his fame/fortune, Ginny giving Harry a Love Potion, Ron giving Hermione a love potion, etc woud be considered bashing.


** The Voldemort in [[http://www.hpmor.com][HPMoR]] is interesting.

** Prince of the Dark Kingdom has Voldemort win the first war and take over Britain. Much more competent and politically-inclined.

Very long. Quite AU but also realistic considering the consequences that came with Voldemort's victory

** In HP and the Elemental's Power, Voldemort is a very intriguing character, who is canon Voldie but 500 times more pro active
