  In the year since the Battle of Hogwarts the victory hasn't felt very victorious. Hermione was killed just months after the battle and they're still trying to recover. Harry is working with George and Ron has become an auror. What happens when you mix Ron, Harry, George and a bag of time sand. AU (Hermione/Ron) "Accidental Snippets" is a dumping ground for extras on this story.
