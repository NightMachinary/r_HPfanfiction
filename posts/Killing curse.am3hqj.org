Much like Pokemon, I propose that the killing curse is super effective against humans, but some creatures have resistance to it. The books say that 10 wizards are needed for a dragon and something like 100 for a nundu. If the killing curse was really all that powerful it would just be one wizard. Discuss.

Also, how does the AK effect undead?


** By definition the Killing Curse does diddly-squat on undead creatures --- be they ghosts/spirits or reanimated corpses like Inferi and Zombies.

As for whether some magical creatures have a resistance to it, I'd propose that it's simply a matter of magical resistance rather than specifically a resistance to the Killing Curse, but generally, sure.

**** Funny as I've always found that idea, it's probably not the case in the /Harry Potter/ universe, or Dumbledore wouldn't have resorted to something as volatile as a big fire-rope spell against the Inferi in the cave.

***** Vulnerability against Fire is also pretty common in undead. Also, I'd guess it's easier to use masses of flames than to heal many at once.

*** Ok, makes sense, but the AK is considered unblockable

**** And yet we see it being blocked by

- objects (OOtP duel, Dumbledore)
- Harry's protection (DH)
- Magical creatures (Fawkes)

What says that a killing-curse doesn't remove a good chunk of non-living tissue from a nundu? It "kills" the hair, but not the animal - like an isolation layer.

It doesn't die to the killing curse, because it doesn't get hit by it.

**** So? It's /magically/ unblockable, but that's besides the point.

** There is something of an escape route from this issue, which is Moody's statement in GoF:

#+begin_quote
  Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it -- you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nose-bleed.
#+end_quote

So it's not the case that every Killing Curse is an unblockable instant-kill. It's only Killing Curses with the requisite level of power behind the spell that actually make the target dead.

It just takes a single item of additional speculation to resolve the potential dilemma of magical creatures: propose that different targets each have a different "requisite level of power" to achieve an instant-kill. Humans would be relatively low down on the scale, such that a decent number of wizards are able to cast the spell. Dragons etc. would require more power to kill. But someone with the requisite power can still one-shot a dragon.

As for where to set that level of power, I'd suggest that Voldemort and Dumbledore definitely meet it, and maybe a few other wizards like Snape.
