Im looking for a 4th Year Fiction, where Harry doesnt Forgive Ron so easy and Fast after the First Trial, but instead holding a Grudge or anger against him. He will befriend with the Redhead untill the end of the Tournament/Year, but not so fast as in the Canon.


** What is it, exactly, that Ron did? I thought it was just that he refused to speak to Harry because he was jealous of the latter getting into the Tournament.

Let's see, he didn't wear any Potter Stinks badge (that was the Slytherins), he didn't laugh at Harry in Herbology (that was Ernie and Justin), he didn't participate in hiding the dragons (because he didn't know about them)...he did defend Hermione when Malfoy hexed her with giant teeth...

Nope, seems to me he was just not talking to Harry. What about a story where Harry forgives Ron but goes on the warpath against everyone else? The students for wearing those dumb badges, the teachers (except Hagrid and fake-Moody) for not warning him about the nature of the tasks (he's only, what, 14?), Rita Skeeter for defaming him...?

**** I agree - hell, he didn't even tell him about the fucking dragons: HAGRID HAD TO (without Hagrid Harry would most likely be a dragon's new chew-toy (as in: DEAD!)), so yeah:

Ron really did SOMETHING :(

Hell, even if you discount this: The very fact that his first and best mate didn't believe him is telling IMHO (I'd probably never forgive the jealous as fuck redhead and I know how it is to be jealous, I used to have a friend who had parents who were clearly richer than mine and who shoveled money his way, but: They were almost never there and they weren't the especially emotionally warm sort (hell, I sometimes think they only had kids because that's something you do and that's expected of you...they sometimes treated their kids like a rich guy would a trophy wife...they loved having "perfect" kids and loved showing of their grades (my friend used this to get even more money and freedoms - "I'll hand in my next test at school empty if you don't allow me to do this/don't give me that!")...as a kind I'd have exchanged my loving parents (dad and stepmother) for that money, but now I think I am better off in the end!)

*** I simply think Ron felt betrayed by Harry, since Harry didn't help him getting in as well. Add hormones into the mix and the fact that Harry also refused to speak to Ron.

It should also be noted that Ron didn't seem the slightest bit jealous about the Firebolt, and he did put himself between Harry and his supposedly mass-murdering godfather, despite hardly being able to stand upright.

That Harry wants all the Glory for himself, but after now 3 Years he should known better, that Harry isnt the "I-want-to-be-famous"...."I am the Boy who lived, so kneel before me"- Type. His Problem by "Stay in his Brothers Shadows" doesnt justify his turn back from Harry, because thats his Family "Psychic" Issue and not what Harry caused. Hermione is one of the Few who believe Harry, but Ron seems to not even believe her, that he isnt responsible for his new Fame.

I hate how so many authors write Ron up to be basically Malfoy because of one or two things.

******* Oh, dear. I didnt intend to open a Big discussion about Rons Flaws and Harrys flawlessness. Yes, i do agree that Harry is also annoying sometimes. And its not that little "argues" Among friends. Yes, Ron faced his personal Fears with the Spiders, yes he beat the Chessgame...but these things are "Physical". When it comes to things you cant touch, like Fame, then it goes down. What i mean is that Ron stick together with Harry and encounter physical Obstacles....but it seems that he doesnt Trust his best Friend enough to immediately believe without a Doubt (unlike Hermione and few others), that Harry didnt put his name in the Damn Goblet, but automaticly Thinks, that Harry wants more Fame. That isnt really some Sign of Trust and exactly this is what i am looking for. Ron is about to excuse for his Behaviour, but Harry in all his "Kind Forgiveness" doesnt need to hear it. This is what Bugs me and i would want to read if there are Fics, he doesnt forgive him that easily. I am no Ron Basher (why should i? I only wrote that i didnt want Harry to forgive so fast and that he can befriend with Ron to the end of the Year) and why does my Request Bugs you so terrible? There are Fics with the most impossible constellations and Contents out there. I made a Request and not an offer for others to teach me how Rons character is.

Another Example is Rons Behaviour against Hermione on the Yule Ball. If any Person should be offended for Betrayel, its Harry, but Ron seems to pretend this "excuse" to rant against Hermione. Harry on the other Hand doesnt defend Hermione enough, but keeps Quiet for the "Sake" of their new build Friendship, Jesus. Leave one Friend bleeding so the other can feel like the King. If Harry had another Fight against Ron in that Scene, then Harry had (again) all the right to argue. But he is mute and so he sink in my sympathy

Aside from how he unconsciously projects his problems on those around him, Ron doesn't like having other people bear his burdens. Some people may see that negatively, but it's showcasing the fact that Ron feels his own problems aren't as important as other people's and he should put them on the back burner or bottle them up until the problem at hand (Harry's problem) is dealt with.

He tried the "soft way" to draw Inromation out of his Friend. In PoA Harry immediately told Ron and Hermione about Sirius is after him and the Marauders Map...all things for "up-to-no-good" and now, that he again did something "no good", Ron doesnt believe him.

He never mentions feeling sexually attracted to any females, even Fleur Decalcour who is apparently a Demi-Goddess of Beauty (not to mention this being the year where Harry is supposed to get into the main stretch of puberty). He never states any explicit imagery when it comes to someone's appearance changing over time, as far as we know, Hermione is still 11 and only got her buck teeth removed.

This isn't even mentioning how unlikely it is for him to not show any outward interest in learning magic or exploring the powerful feats of magic that he sees happen in front of his eyes. There are no reactionary human beings, even someone like Neville when seeing what Dumbledore did in the Department, and then the Prophecy to boot would have attempted to train himself to the best of his abilities.

While I enjoy the world as a whole that Rowling has built, her characters are nowhere near as amazing or have as much depth. It's why if I were to rate the book out of five or ten, I would most definitely give it a 3/5 or a 6/10, it builds a good world, but not good characters.

I would argue the opposite. Harry Potter has some fantastically deep and complex characters (Dumbledore, Snape, Ron, Slughorn, Tom Riddle, Merope Gaunt, Sirius Black etc.) but does have a very vague, unexplored world.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Harry does take an active role in his own life. Harry almost never does anything because someone told him to. No one told him to rescue Ginny or 'save' Gabrielle Delacour (almost the entire book series is Harry doing things that others tell him /not/ to do). He does both those actions entirely on his own because they're a fundamental part of who he is, his 'saving people thing'.

#+begin_quote
  He never mentions feeling sexually attracted to any females
#+end_quote

I'm not entirely sure what you mean here, since Harry is definitely attracted to Ginny and Cho. It might not be explicit sexual attraction, the books are for younger audiences, but Harry is still attracted to them. As for Fleur, Harry just isn't attracted to her, neither is Cedric.

From Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry is clearly attracted to Cho):

#+begin_quote
  Harry couldn't help noticing, nervous as he was, that she [Cho] was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight jolt in the region of his stomach that he didn't think had anything to do with nerves.
#+end_quote

Harry is surprisingly descriptive (for obvious reasons) of people's looks and he does describe height changes and anything drastic that occurs. It's certainly not indicative of a 'lack of character'.

Your main criticism is that Harry doesn't show that much interest in learning magic and the world as a whole, that doesn't mean Harry has no character. Harry shows a respectable amount of fascination with magic (particular in the earliest book when it's all new) and is critical of aspects of the Wizarding World (corruption). Harry does not begin a training regime after Order of the Phoenix to become all powerful and I really don't think anyone should have expected him to, it's just not within his nature. Arguing that Neville and anyone else would have trained is not I would say an argument for lack of character, but rather an argument for plot contrivance.

Harry is loyal, brave and self-less, but also hot-tempered and impulsive. He's definitely not without character, you could argue his character is boring (personally I don't think it is), but really don't think it's fair to say he has no character at all. One of my main criticisms of fanfiction is that many people don't like Harry's character and change it drastically to very unrealistic extremes, to fit what they wanted from Harry. Harry's a very realistic character and not at all perfect.

No, it isn't. You just responded to several other points.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Harry had apparently read some of his coursework, before immediately stopping any effort he made, relying solely on Hermione. What did he do in Primary School when he had no friends? He must have studied on his own, yet he doesn't fall into the same pattern? Odd, it's almost as if I can't make out his personality at all. I don't know what he finds attractive, I don't know what he prefers magically, I don't know what he thinks about the fact that he isn't preparing for a full-scale wizarding war despite being in the middle of it since his fourth year. The reason we aren't given a look into his mind, is because Rowling doesn't want to betray her narrative, she built a character that would have gone entirely against her worldview, so in the end he ended up a puppet of the government he hated in the first place, all because of 'reform'.

#+begin_quote
  Harry does not begin a training regime
#+end_quote

Why would he need that? We're shown that he has an interest in Duelling, as made clear by his skill and interest in DADA, why not explore that? Why not have him go into a Duelling League, solving your lack of combat experience problem, and lack of SpellCasting Versatility. I'm surprised that he showed no interest in Transfiguration, a subject that his father was supposed to be good at, because he seems to follow his example in every way but that.

#+begin_quote
  Arguing that Neville and anyone else would have trained is not I would say an argument for lack of character, but rather an argument for plot contrivance.

Not what I was arguing, once again, you strawman. I argued that a one-dimensional character like Neville, would still attempt to increase his proficiency, and maybe move up to being three-dimensional, in the face of these challenges. Yet, we have a perfectly good three-dimensional character, that doesn't do this, he instead waits for luck and chance. Even if you view this as a children's book, what kind of lesson is that? "Hufflepuff, the house of hard work, also the house of duffers and leftovers", "Your main character doesn't work hard to beat the bad guy, he instead relies on being lucky, and more skilled friends".

#+end_quote

I suppose I might be judging the characters by a different metric of depth. To me, characters that are deep have character traits, flaws and clear motivations. Dumbledore, Snape and Tom Riddle (sympathetic backstory makes up for lack of 'good' qualities) all fit this metric (as do other characters). Dumbledore has character traits (eccentric, cunning, secretive, ambitious, kind, brave, forgiving), flaws (ambition, fallibility):

#+begin_quote
  'I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation'
#+end_quote

(misreads the situation)

#+begin_quote
  'An explanation of an old man's mistakes. For I see now that what I have done, and not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age. Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it is to be young...and I seem to have forgotten, lately...'
#+end_quote

and has clear motivations (or reasoning behind actions):

He is secretive because of his upbringing:

#+begin_quote
  'I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and lies, that's how we grew up, and Albus...he was a natural...'
#+end_quote

He doesn't trust Harry with the Hallows because of his own experience with temptation:

#+begin_quote
  'I am afraid counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that you hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons.
#+end_quote

He has a pragmatic 'greater good' philosophy (explaining some of his more questionable actions):

#+begin_quote
  'I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years...My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive'
#+end_quote

And he avoids power because of fear in his own ambition:

#+begin_quote
  'I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister for Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore is also, of course, motivated by his love of others.

Dumbledore's motivations and character traits (to me) are very realistic and brought about through experience.

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore is supposed to be a genius, yet he isn't drawn as a genius, I have yet to see him actually do anything ingenious.
#+end_quote

I would argue that Dumbledore does show his intelligence. He has deep perceptive abilities of people's character (such as Ron, Peter Pettigrew and Voldemort) and shows extraordinary knowledge of magic. His plans are fallible but do show ingenuity (consider his plan for the Elder Wand or giving the Deluminator to Ron).

#+begin_quote
  Yes, he took an active role in saving people. I never said he didn't take active roles, he most certainly did, to strawman my argument is preposterous. But he doesn't take an active role in his own life, sorry to say.
#+end_quote

My interpretation of your argument was that Harry doesn't make his own decisions ('He only does what others tell him to do') and doesn't attempt to influence his life course (or fate). The first of these I addressed: Harry makes a lot of his own decisions (rescuing Gabrielle was his decision).

The second of these is a lot more complex (I intended to think on this more).

Harry doesn't attempt to /avoid/ his fate but this is inherently motivated by his character (he trusts Dumbledore implicitly and is empathetic towards others).

Nevertheless, Harry is still critical of the path Dumbledore has set for him:

#+begin_quote
  'Look what he asked from me, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! And again! And again! And don't expect me to explain everything, just trust me blindly, trust that I know what I'm doing, trust me even though I don't trust you! Never the whole truth! Never!
#+end_quote

Harry questions the decisions he makes (showing that he does take an active role):

#+begin_quote
  He felt he was still groping in the dark; he had chosen the path but kept looking back, wondering whether he had misread the signs, whether he should not have taken the other way.
#+end_quote

and it is /his/ decision ultimately to continue along Dumbledore's path.

#+begin_quote
  And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out, that he would keep going to the end, even though it was /his/ end, because he had troubled to get to know him, hadn't he? Dumbledore knew, as Voldemort knew that Harry would not let anyone else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it.
#+end_quote

Harry does take an active role in his life, but the actual extent to which he is active, is hampered by his implicit trust in Dumbledore and others (also his empathy). This is actually a character trait of Harry, he trusts in others' abilities above his own. He's heavily critical of his own abilities.

#+begin_quote
  HA! That's the attraction? "She's extremely pretty", wow, he most definitely likes that girl, using an extremely subjective term like pretty. Can he describe what was so pretty about her? Why he preferred her over say, someone like Lavender Brown or Hermione? Nope? Okay then. I feel like "she's extremely pretty" only serves to prove my point further.
#+end_quote

Although, Harry doesn't state exactly the attractive qualities that Ginny and Cho both have (in the sense he doesn't say 'I like Ginny's hair), the audience is easily able to infer what he finds attractive (Ginny and Cho share physical similarities). As [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/647l9s/harrys_hair_fetish/][this reddit post]] the other day notes. [[http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=gringotts&st=hglovered][This essay]] covers Harry's attraction to Ginny really well also. So the audience is able to infer Harry's attractions even if it isn't explicitly stated.

#+begin_quote
  Not what I was arguing, once again, you strawman. I argued that a one-dimensional character like Neville, would still attempt to increase his proficiency, and maybe move up to being three-dimensional, in the face of these challenges. Yet, we have a perfectly good three-dimensional character, that doesn't do this, he instead waits for luck and chance.
#+end_quote

The way I interpreted you argument was that anyone (regardless of character or personality) in Harry's position would attempt to increase proficiency, independent of Dumbledore. If such an occurrence were regardless of personality traits, then it was only for plot convenience that Harry did not do so, rather than because he is lacking in personality.

But yes-Harry doesn't work particularly hard and does leave a lot of things up to chance, this doesn't mean he has 'no personality', I would argue that it's indicative of his personality that he's prepared to trust that Dumbledore has prepared him adequately for the challenges ahead. I also don't think it's fair to assume that Neville (and others) would do differently to Harry. Harry doesn't do nothing, he might not prepare independently, but he does learn everything Dumbledore teaches him about Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Even if you view this as a children's book, what kind of lesson is that? "Hufflepuff, the house of hard work, also the house of duffers and leftovers", "Your main character doesn't work hard to beat the bad guy, he instead relies on being lucky, and more skilled friends
#+end_quote

JK Rowling exploring other values to the extent that she did /consequently/ undervalued the importance of hard work at times. The text does at least show the positives of hard work (Hermione is rewarded for her studying) and Hufflepuff is shown mostly in a positive light . So I would say the audience doesn't gain either an overly positive or overly negative perspective of the value of hardwork. Potentially, there should have been more emphasis on its importance (it is an admirable trait).

In summary, I intended to say that it's unfair to state Harry has no personality (or limited personality) and that other characters were lacking in substance as well. Harry does have personality (even being too passionate at times in the book) and so do other characters. That is not to say that Harry isn't at times subject to the plot (Harry Potter is inherently plot driven), but he does maintain core personality traits and is a fairly complex character.

Sorry if anything I've written is unclear or if I've misinterpreted/misrepresented your arguments (that was not my intent).

********** Once again, backstory doesn't equate to a depth of character, in fact, Dumbledore's did the opposite for me. He was supposed to be seventeen-eighteen at the time of his mother's death, yet somehow Albus retained that ideology one hundred years later? I think not.

Severus liked Lily Evans and had a pretty bad household growing up, and he was bullied (albeit not without throwing a couple curses of his own unprovoked as well, if Remus, Rowling, and Sirius were anything to go by). That is fairly generic, nor does it add anything that we don't already know about the Potions Master.

Tom Riddle wanted Pure and Absolute Power so he wouldn't die, but his goals afterwards were pretty unclear. Not much of a genius then, is he?

Having a backstory just proves where a character has been, it doesn't mean that they have any depth, it just means that the pool has widened.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is rewarded for her studying
#+end_quote

Hermione also has the ability to naturally master a spell on the first time, despite Purebloods coming in with as much Magical Theory knowledge as her, if not more. Sure, she may open a couple books, but what more to her is there?

#+begin_quote
  Harry does have personality (even being too passionate at times in the book)
#+end_quote

Once again, equating emotion to have personality. Every human can be passionate about something, Harry's passions were not unique, nor were they explain thoroughly.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** Yeah, unfortunetly, it doesnt fit what i want. In the named FF even the Gryffindors are against Harry O.o Which is pretty unbelievable in my Eyes. The Argument that Gryffindors should stick together isnt that important, because this counts for any Houses Students. And that the Famous Harry gains even more Fame by being their Champion shouldnt bother them either, since he is in Gryffindor. But i only skipped through some chapters to see what style it contains.
