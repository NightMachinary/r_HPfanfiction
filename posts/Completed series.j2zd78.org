I'm looking for rewrites that have been complete. I see a lot of authors have started a retelling of the story but with a twist but I cannot for the life of me find any complete ones!

Not super fussed what the twist is, different house, different upbringing, introduction of a soul bond, not really fussed, just looking for a different take!

Cheers!


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who lived"]] - muggle AU where Hogwarts is Harworts, a school for James Bond-style spies (with Bond-style technology). Literally an alternate universe - they have indirect contacts to the canon universe in another story of the series. Complete and covers all 7 books.

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Runestone Path) covers the entire series, but it's one volume.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating ancient runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG.

** Well, the Sacrifices Arc, which starts with linkffn(Saving Connor) certainly comes to mind.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

** If you are looking for darker stories, then you can't go wrong with the downward spiral series starting with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming). Starts with a Grey!Harry who is raised in an orphanage and due to the circumstances he faces at Hogwarts, becomes much more dark over time. Awesome series, and will certainly keep you entertained. PS: It spans all 7 books!!!
