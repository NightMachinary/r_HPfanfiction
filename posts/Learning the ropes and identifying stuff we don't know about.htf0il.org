So, I've noticed a lot of questions about how stuff works around here (the prior confusion over rule 8, recent questions about rule 9, questions about tips for searching for fanfic, questions about function and finding of betas, etc), requests for writing/fandom knowledge resources for writers, and the ever-persistent problem of too-many Reminder bot links in threads, and it got me thinking. What are the mechanics and meta-stuff about being active in fandom that we newbs who haven't been here since the Old Days don't know about?

To give examples of the kind of thing I'm getting at: there's a HPFanfic sub discord, the Reminder bot provides a button on it that you can use to get reminders too (so you only really need one of each 'remind me in X days'), there are three bot-recommender programs (Links below), and there are websites for HP Fic beyond just FFNet and Ao3 like Questionable Questing, SIYE, and the Dark Lord Potter forums. Also, there's a tonne of information in the subreddit wiki that I've noticed people asking questions about over the scant few months I've been here.

So, what things do you notice that people here don't know about? What would you like more people to know about or do vis a vis the mechanics of fandom? And do you have any ideas on making that stuff more visible and obvious to newcomers?
