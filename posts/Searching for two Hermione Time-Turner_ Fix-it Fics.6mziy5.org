There are one (or two not sure) fanfics that I cannot for the life of me remember the name of. Unfortunately, I don't remember a lot about the main plot but I remember a few sinpits I am hoping someone would be able to recognize. I recall that Hermione was working on a spell to kind of suspend water in a ball until a spell or word was said to release it. She infuses this water holding spell into a ring(or jewelry receptacle) and gives it to Regulus so he can use it when he goes to The Cave to get rid of the locket horcrux.

Another snipit that I remember is (again) Hermione going back in time (for one reason or another ) and finding all the horcruxs, giving them to Mad-eye Moody to hide in the Ministry. She ends up not trusting Dumbledore with the Gaunt Ring and warns Mad-Eye to keep an /eye/ (haha) on it. Dumbeldore ends up stealing it and Mad-Eye catches him in the act.

Unfortunately, I do not remember much more of the fics, but I am hoping that someone will recognize these snipits and help put my mind to ease.


** Do you remember if the first fic is RBHG? If it is, it will make finding it a lot easier.

*** I don't think it was. I this it might have been a SS/HG or SB/HG.

**** I would try posting on the SSHG LJ page. They are pretty good at finding fics. Just mention that you're not sure what pairing it is, but that it's possibly SSHG.
