** I'd say the second one as the yellow detracts too much attention from the green and red which are, I'm guessing, more important. It would be neat if you found a way to finish the glasses shape too so it's more Harry-Potteresque.

*** The red and green eyes is sort of a symbolism for the horcrux in harry. And thanks for the feedback.

**** Yes, I got that so you got your idea through perfectly. And it would be neat for your story cover, original and immediately recognizable :)

** Blue/Yellow looks too minions. Black white looks good. I'd suggest adding a nice pattern to reference the death eater's mask in the white.

edit: oh, or adding some tape to the glasses to help bring out that the white is partially Harry's spectacles.

** The black and white is a bit more aesthetically appealing (the colors all work so well together), but both look great!
