It just has to be a cool power (whatever you think a cool power is) and has to be at least 80K-100K words. Thanks :)

**** It devolved into one of those crack fics tbh. I enjoyed the concept but it ended up simply snowballing into absurdness, with Harry being the typical pervert with a harem.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
