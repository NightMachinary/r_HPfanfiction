A year ago, I found out about the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/530818]["Wizards in Space" series by Esama]]. It's great fun seeing teenagers trying fumbling around with alien tech and sowing the seeds of a world building that never came. The series does end with a feeling that you just took the first steps of a stair only to find the mason never finished the stairway. That is why I have decided to write an unofficial sequel myself.

While Esama didn't want to deal with the main plot of the series, I intend to dive right into it while mixing in some DA space shenanigans. After that, we'll be going full space adventures as we approach the SG1 time period. I will focus a lot more on the characters and their growth through the fic so the pacing will also be quite different.

As I write this, I have pretty much planned out the entire fic and I can tell you that this is going to be a long ride.

Now I wish you a good reading and I hope you enjoy it.

** Great story, love that it's getting continued. My only suggestion is to put some sort of break in between scenes, took me awhile to realize you jumped over everything after the talk with Dumbledore until he got back on the ship.

Also... something I thought would be cool if the original fic continued - have Harry bring Sirius onto the ship. He clearly hates Grimmauld Place, so this would be a good way to get him out of there. And, from an outside the story perspective, with Sirius living after 5th year you would need to think of a way to integrate him into the rest of the HP plot. By bringing him onto the ship, you're basically bypassing that problem entirely.

Are you writing/posting this as it goes, one chapter at a time? Or do you have some already written and have a plan for a posting schedule?

*** Thanks for reading. I'm glad you enjoyed it.

Don't worry about the scene breaks, I'm working on fixing them. They work fine on ao3, but ffnet seems to be a bit more capricious.

I'm writing them as they come and I plan to release them one chapter at a time. I haven't settled on a posting schedule yet as my work situation is pretty much in limbo right now and could change at a moment's notice. I'll be going for a chapter every one or two week until that changes.

** One of the things that really sets the tone of esama's DSS stories is that the spaceship is /so much more important/ than Umbridge, Voldemort, etc. They're /there/, but Umbridge gets dealt with almost as an aside, the Department of Mysteries fight never happens, and the Ministry getting taken over by purebloods is just background for Clarissa Edgecombe to get hired at Enterprise.

*** I agree, but while that works great for a short fic that only deal with the initial discovery of the ship, it's untenable on the long-term. The kids would not abandon their families in the middle of a war to go out on a joyride throughout the galaxy. Even a part of what they do is directed toward helping out where they can like the creation of the protecting clothing.

It was also esama's wish to ignore all of this to focus on the world building. And while I respect this choice, I want to do something else. It might not be in the same vein as the original fic and it might not please everyone, but this is what I'm going with and I'll hold on to it.

That's not to say that the ship will be in the background of the war. I have no interest of just writing a war rehash fic. But some loose ends must be dealt with before exploring the full potential of the idea.

*** Glad you liked the begining. I'm still working on it, though it has been a busy few months and I didn't have as much time as I would have liked to work on it. (Found a job and had to move for it amongst other things)It did give me a lot of time to think and rework some later parts of the story though.Next update should hopefully come in the next few days.

*** Hey there. Thanks for reading. I'm glad you enjoyed it.

For your question, no, Voldemort is not in the open. The battle at the Ministry never happened and Voldie never revealed himself to the world. That also means that Fudge is still in power and the vast majority of the British wizarding world believe everything he says about Harry and Dumbledore.
