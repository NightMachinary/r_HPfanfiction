** By far my favorite Harry/Fleur I've read was A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned and it features a rather prodigious, Harry starting 4th year. It's also rather long and complete, both of which I consider major plusses.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** Knowledge is Power - been a while since I read it, but remember loving it.

What would a Slitherin Harry Do? - not really overpowered, but definately clever

Deprived - Normally I hate "Wrong Twin" stories, but this one is great.

The Sorting Hat's Stand - Harry is definitely powerful

Allune Immune Harry - Short, but cute.

The Lie I've Lived - Kind of controversial, if I remember correctly

Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time

Harry Potter and the Heartlands of Time - sequel to previous

His Angel

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Metamorphmagus).

While it doesn't feature the overpowered Harry at a younger age, it still kind of has that dynamic bc he's represented as a rookie in the Auror corps, and he partners with Tonks, who is older.

Pretty well written fic that, like For the Love of Magic, contains a lot of smut (though exclusively Harry/Tonks). I read it in a weekend, was fairly entertaining. Very similar feel to Harry Potter and the Summer of Change on FFN, but not as trope-y and definitely better written.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way!

**** The author is a grammatically strong writer. I'm not a huge fan. My issue with this story and most of that author's stories is the stories tend to go like this:

"I know this <Event X> is going to happen."

"This <Event X> is going to happen."

"I'm planning on this <Event X> happening."

"I am making arrangements for when this<Event X> happens."

"This <Event X> is going to happen and I've prepared for it."

"Is everyone aware that this <Event X> is going to happen?"

"HEY LOOK EVERYONE EVENT X HAPPENED. AREN'T YOU SHOCKED?"
