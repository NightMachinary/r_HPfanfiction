** All students on the house Quidditch teams should be using the same or equivalent brooms. The fact that Harry is allowed first a Nimbus Two Thousand and then a Firebolt, both of which are /professional level brooms/, is absurd. Sports should be a level playing field, where only skill and hard training give you an edge. Literally none of the houses can even compete with him until Malfoy's dad buys the Slytherin team top of the line brooms. It's no wonder why Harry set all kinds of records for catching the Snitch; the school equipment is all outdated.

*** While I agree with what you said, I don't think the other players would be using the ancient school brooms. they probably own their own brooms that are at least of decent quality, though still not on the level of what Harry has.

As a side note, using the absolute fastest broom on the market might be good for a seeker, but other positions might be better suited for brooms that optimize other qualities such as maneuverability (chasers) or stability (beaters).

** This is specifically about academics, the classroom, and standard school stuff. Addressing safety concerns is a given.

More teaching staff. As is, a core subject instructor at Hogwarts is in class roughly 40% more hours than their students. Not doing the math, but seven core subjects plus electives, doubles or singles classes across four houses. This means either instructors need Time-Turners or students have huge gaps in their schedules. Two instructors for each core subject goes a long way to addressing this problem. Adding in writing and maths for at least the first two years would help, too.

Annual checkups with the school nurse.

With standardized cirricula, the school itself could purchase textbooks, which helps poorer students. This would also somewhat insulate against the high turnover rate for the Defense position.

Standardized punishments.

The point system seems mostly useless. It's group punishment for individual misdeeds. The effects of the punishment aren't seen until the end of the year; in September, probably nobody cares about the House Cup.

You're expected to use a quill. That's a skill that most Muggle-raised don't have. There should be something to address that -- it could be incorporated into a writing class.

There seems to be no guidance about choosing your electives, even though that will have a large impact on career choices. A career fair a few weeks before the end of term in second year, followed by one-on-one guidance, would be awesome.

In other words, all instructors are expected to teach writing in addition to their subject. And /they/ haven't received any formal training. Part of the point of a class is standardization -- as is, the proper format of an essay for Snape might be radically different from the proper format of an essay for Flitwick.

This isn't about converting Hogwarts into a Muggle school; it's about what is best for the kids.

How much freedom did you have in selecting classes? In my school, I could choose a foreign language to learn, and that's it. Zero impact on career options.

In contrast, students can choose about a quarter of their courses when they're thirteen, and they choose all their courses when they're fifteen. Depending on the exact use of runes and arithmancy, you might find your career choices highly affected by which electives you chose and which courses you took to NEWT level. Care of Magical Creatures will certainly have an impact.

When you're thirteen, you don't think ahead like that. When you're fifteen, you probably won't think about career options unless you are prompted.

True. However, I assumed that writing was considered to be acquired before starting Hogwarts. As well as basic Maths (and in their society almost nobody really needs more than basic Maths).

I would agree with this, but to my experience (and that of others), I don't think I ever seen one of those advisors having the interrests of the kids at heart. They had their idea of what a kid had to do according to their grades, and sometimes really messed up things for some. I think in a lot of case, just give a book or let the parents sort that out witk their kid would've done less damage (depending on the parents, of course).

Hogwarts seems like Hands on education, you learn skills as well as knowledge (since knowledge is skill). I guess you just pick what you need on the way, for anything that's no magic.

** To fit with the canon of the wizarding world as established, you couldn't give too much support or prominence to Muggle Studies or introduce a logic/science course. Wizards mainly disdain these things. Muggle Studies could remain an elective as it is.

Literature would presumably fall into History. Music/Art could be extracurricular classes. For Health, I would propose a basic Healing class - it does seem a bit surreal that there isn't one, given that the ability to heal wounds would be a useful skill for all wizards and witches to have, if they all have the latent ability.

Get a new teacher for History of Magic and make it more prominent and important. New teacher for Potions; possibly keep Snape as an advanced instructor who occasionally takes a class of younger students; that allows him to keep his nasty reputation and enmity with Harry, without being a constant presence of nastiness in his life. Snape could then be contrasted with the good teacher, and the promise of more Snape in the future could put students off continuing with Potions.

I would probably bring Arithmancy and Runes down to being compulsory classes, perhaps starting in second year on. To balance that, I'd move Astronomy up to being an elective, since no character in the books ever seems to get any use whatsoever out of it. Divination I would keep as-is. Trelawney is unorthodox, but how she's seen by students isn't helped by people like McGonagall and Dumbledore who have a very particular worldview undermining and ridiculing her at every turn.

I'd also draw more parallels between Herbology, Potions, and the new Healing class. It always struck me as unlikely in canon that somebody with such an understanding of plants and herbs as Neville could be so completely inept at Potions that likely dealt with the same ingredients or composite parts. Some of it would be down to Snape, of course, but you'd think Neville would at least get the theory.

As for Defense - well, I would have someone actually investigate why teachers only last a year, if it's been a pattern for 20 or so years by this point. If that counteracts the 'wizards don't have logic' argument, have Hermione point it out in first year - she's read about it in Hogwarts: A History, after all.

As an additional note, if you are going down the route of an 'Inquisitor' type character, have them question why Filch - a Squib - is hired for the /one/ role in the castle that a wizard would be definitely better suited for. Filch is a cleaner and security guard, both things that he has to do without magic. Tasks that a wizard could accomplish in minutes would take Filch much longer. Is it any wonder he's always so grouchy?

*** Divination gets shit on a lot in cannon. However, there are types of magic that could be considered divination that don't just have to do with predicting the future. It's my opinion that the class is just taught extremely poorly. What we see in the book is just two-bit fortune-telling minus any of the actual tricks of the trade. Instead, the class ought to be teaching things such as scrying/farsight, detection spells, interpreting prophecy, legillimency/occlumency, vision-questing, extra-sensory perception (how to sense magic, etc), astral projection, how to use and make divination-related magical tools (beyond 'stare harder and open you inner eye!'), and some way to identify and instruct actual seers. All of these things could be considered divination in the sense that divination is about 'attempting to foretell future events or discover hidden knowledge by magical means'.

My take on Filch: Filch's responsibilities are coordinating and overseeing detentions, managing the lost-and-found (unclaimed items go into RoR storage at the end of the year) and confiscated items, and coordinating the house elves' maintenance duties with student detention crews. He's not really serious about the use of torture as a means of discipline; he just likes messing with troublemakers' heads.

Basic arithmetic is an essential skill for many positions. If you can't multiply, how are you going to order potions supplies for making a large batch of potions? If you can't add, how are you going to ring up a customer's order?

Perhaps that's supposed to be covered before Hogwarts -- which leaves a question of what sort of pre-Hogwarts education there is in the wizarding world.

It's not a cultural thing; it's a reflection of the reality we live in. And magic doesn't change it /that/ much.

** How I would fix Hogwarts? I would strive to create an environment that would encourage students to study magic and learn Life Skills beyond just the classroom.

To that end, I would install hundreds of bloodthirsty stone gargoyles in the halls that would come alive at night and hunt students violating the curfew. I would charm the Great Hall to eat people who fall asleep there after festive banquets. I would hire a castle vampire to roam the halls and prey on unobservant students. I think that's a good start.

** My personal list of reforms:

- More electives. It would be nice to bring in a few teachers to offer classes on a specialized topic like wandlore or healing. It would be great if Hogwarts also had an independent study option as well. There really should be foreign language electives too.
- I question the relevance of Astronomy, but I don't think we know enough about the subject to discount it entirely. I also question the wisdom of making kids as young as eleven stay up past 1am in the middle of the week.
- Combine Herbology and Potions into one class. Honestly, most students don't need five or seven years of education on growing plants. They just need to know how to use them. If they want to learn more about Herbology, they can pursue it as an elective.
- Replace Herbology with a muggle studies track. First year students from magical households would spend a year learning about the basics of muggle culture (i.e., clearing up misconceptions and how to blend in when in muggle areas), while muggleborn first years would spend that time getting an introduction to the wizarding world. Students would be allowed to "test out" of either subject, because some students might have a good understanding of both or have grown up in the muggle world despite wizarding parentage. After about first year, all students would spend a few years learning muggle subjects like Applied Maths, writing skills, etc. After fourth year, that class would end. Students could chose to take classes on muggle culture and get an N.E.W.T. in Muggle Studies, or just chose another class.
- Seventh years would also get a one time lesson about how to survive/blend in the muggle world, to prepare them for interacting with muggles, blending in muggle areas, and/or renting an apartment or buying a house from a muggle.
- Sack Binns and totally overhaul History of Magic curriculum. A few years of ancient magical history, a year of muggle history with a lot of geography, then three years of modern history both magical and muggle. After O.W.L.s, the class would focus on Magical law and governments and international relations.
- Higher standards for teachers. Hogwarts is the biggest and most important magical school in the country, so it really should be the first stop for anyone interested in education or anyone particularly knowledgeable in one specific subject. It's completely capable of attracting top talent, with a reasonable salary and perks. If possible, I think they should get a second teacher for each of the core subjects or hire a teacher who can teach, say, 1-2 year Charms and 1-2 year Transfiguration. The teachers at Hogwarts must have an insanely high workload.
- More inter-house activities and clubs. It would be great if there was some sort of common space for students to relax together if they're not in the same house. Maybe a nice big room with couches, tables, games, etc. More electives would also mean more house-mixing. I don't know what the official policy on sitting at other house tables is. It seems like it's allowed, but not done particularly often. In my opinion, the students should be encouraged to mix during lunch and breakfast, and then eat dinner with their own house.
- Expand the Quidditch team to include more students. It doesn't make sense to only take seven people. They should have teams of fourteenish, so that when a starting player leaves school or injures himself mid-year, there's someone trained and ready to take his place. Also, it means more students get the opportunity to be on the team in the first place. You could also have a few more players and have a kind of junior championship. That way, Hogwarts gets twice as many games and more people can play Quidditch.

** First thing is split the core subjects between two teachers, one for 1-3 and the other for 4-7. The fact that McGonagall is able to teach at least twelve classes per week, manage Gryffindor House, and be the Deputy Headmistress is nuts. Splitting core subjects in half gives you six classes for each. I assume that the electives are just one class per year.

Competent professors for history, potions, and defense are obviously needed. I don't necessarily know that Burbage is a bad teacher, but her subject is just out of date. She has to take into account what's going to be covered on the OWLs and NEWTs and teach that information. Though she died so I guess it's a moot point. I've also thought that Divination should be offered only to those who have the ability, but Trelawney can stay on as an Oracle-in-Residence because I feel sorry for her. Also she threw was dropping crystal balls on people during the Battle of Hogwarts and that deserves some props. For creatures, Hagrid shouldn't be teaching because he doesn't have an OWL in any subject. Hire a teacher for Care, and make Hagrid the Groundskeeper and instructional assistant.

Add in new/better electives. I'm not concerned about subjects that are taught in your typical muggle school. I'm saying let's add an introduction class for muggleborns that covers etiquette, using quills, different forms of transportation, and other basics to the Wizarding world. Let's have NEWT level classes on broomology, enchanting, healing, dueling, international relations, ghoul studies, magical races, ancient studies, Latin (I bet that helps with spell creation), law, alchemy, and magical arts (dance, music, portraits, etc.), and other electives that cover things like estate management, business and finance, an introduction to the Ministry of Magic. There are tons of possibilities.

I'd also look long and hard at making the Head of House position independent of the teachers. Harry's year is supposedly exceptionally small with only forty students. If Hogwarts really has a thousand students like is suggested, that's 250 kids to keep tabs on. That's a full time job in and of itself. They would have to monitor detentions, give career advice and other counseling, oversee prefects and quidditch captains, monitor the academic status of students in the house, handle intra-House discipline, and any number of other tasks.

I think it would actually be kind of interesting to see somebody go through a whole list of things that are needed to upgrade Hogwarts in a methodical, realistic way, and make a story out of it.

There should be higher education institutions to prepare people but that seems to be taken on by the department who hires them. So it's weird. Some of those would be great basic intros because all wizards should know them BUT they might not have time for them while at Hogwarts.

I might be wrong but Hermione needed a time turner just to take the, maybe, five extra electives her third year, right? And most were pretty standard as far as future job possibilities - except Muggle Studies and Divination. She dropped those and had a normal year for fourth year. So they can only add maybe three extra classes without needing magical help. That's not a lot of options.

** First of all, Hogwarts doesn't need to be fixed... /in the canon universe/. In canon, Hogwarts fulfilled its role in the crazy, fantastical society that JKR created. Just because it doesn't match our perception of how society /should/ work doesn't mean it's wrong.

But for the sake of the question, let's assume Hogwarts exists within /our/ version of common sense. This would pose a /ton/ of problems.

The first problem with Hogwarts is the same as the problems with other schools. The community needs to be fixed first. In our universe, magical society would perish unless it upgraded to the modern era. There's two options:

1. advance magical society past muggle society and become highly segregated, sorta like "caretakers"
2. integrate with muggle society.

In canon, magicals half-heartedly attempt to do both at once and aren't effective at either. Their impact on muggle society is at best a nuisance, and they typically refuse to interact with muggles for any length of time.

So option 1 is typically the route taken in "competent-Ministry" AU fics. In these fics the Ministry is highly effective at hiding magical society and they are very separate from muggles.

Option 2 is a bit more interesting and this is where the answer to OP's question comes in. Here's how I would revamp Hogwarts:

Dissolve magical society. Entirely.

Keeping wizards and witches separate is the cause of pureblood prejudice, which in turn could fuel world-conquering Dark Wizards. The nuclear solution is to delete pureblood society. Hogwarts becomes an *integration* school. Magical children learn to live in muggle society and benefit global society from within. Everyone learns dozens of languages, cultures, and a vast amount of history. Magic stays hidden and is used to accelerate the education of wizards and witches, who become the brightest of humanity. Graduates become world leaders and great minds. Technology and magic are combined to advance science even faster than our current rate.

But all this only works in /our/ world. In canon, these ideas are stupid because magical society, apart from a few Dark Wizards, is successful and prosperous---JKR gives no indication that society needs change as indicated by DH's epilogue. Everything just goes back to normal.

Hogwarts works because JKR says so. Hermione says most wizards don't have an ounce of logic and yet magical Britain is still a functioning society. Saying otherwise is highly AU (and not a bad idea).

*** Where to begin...

"The community needs to be fixed first. In our universe, magical society would perish unless it upgraded to the modern era."

A community doesn't need to be fixed. That's the communist road and we know where it leads. The rules and government, however, can be fixed or changed. Secondely, I really don't know why you imply that wizarding society is retarded. it's not the case, it simply works differently. Because of magic. Who needs a freezer when you can just cast a preservation charm on your food?

"In canon, magicals half-heartedly attempt to do both at once and aren't effective at either. Their impact on muggle society is at best a nuisance, and they typically refuse to interact with muggles for any length of time."

In canon, wizards try to stay hidden from the general population and not to interract with it and that's it. They don't try to lead it or integrate it anymore than what is necessary to keep the secret. Wich is doable when you got magic.

"Keeping wizards and witches separate is the cause of pureblood prejudice, which in turn could fuel world-conquering Dark Wizards."

Integrating to the muggle world would lead to a wizard dominated world where muggles can't take any position of power. And where wizards would be hated by the most part of the general population.

The pureblood prejudice is most certainly a complex problem with a lot of causes, not all of them being illegitimate. Simply stating that pureblood biggots hate muggles because they don't know them is an oversimplification that wouldn't allow one to assess the real causes of the stuff.

A lot of the pureblood biggots are also power sluts. What do you think would happen if they where to take a leading position in the muggle world? Someone like Lucius Malfoy or Dolores Umbridge or even Cornelius Fudge?

"Dissolve magical society. Entirely."

I think I would go the other way around. Try to find a way to turn muggles into wizards in discreetly distribute it in the muggle society. But aither way, its not the politics you carry that's so important than the way you carry them and the support you need and have to carry them.

"Hogwarts becomes an integration school. Magical children learn to live in muggle society and benefit global society from within. Everyone learns dozens of languages, cultures, and a vast amount of history. Magic stays hidden and is used to accelerate the education of wizards and witches, who become the brightest of humanity."

Those kinds of elitist programs usually dont end so well. Don't you think it would serve the pureblood biggots if nearly all magical are better educated than any muggle by a large margin?

"Technology and magic are combined to advance science even faster than our current rate." Why? I can see the point in integrating science to the magical world, and it's certainly already done, but why would someone that has magic need any technology. Is there anything there that can't be achieved with magic?

"Hermione says most wizards don't have an ounce of logic and yet magical Britain is still a functioning society."

Hermione's not god. Hermione can be wrong. You can't take the word of a teenager, however bright she may be, as the word of god. Especially when talking about society problems. The young always think the old is dumb.

And good logic isn't that common in the muggle world either.

********* Communism does a lot more than placing ownership of the means of production in the hands of the workers.

But What i'm talking about is not specific to communism, it goes for fascism as well, and nazism, and even sociolism.

Those are all ideologies that have a rigid society model and are trying to change their populations by various means to fit in said model.

Things like politised education, working and reeduction camps, purges...

The goal is to remove the elements that doesn't fit from the population.

Those are the extreme, of course, but the root problem is trying to "fix" the community. Because the only effective way to fix the community is tyranny.

Most Muggleborns spend the formative years of their live learning about magic, rather than maths or science. And of the ones that don't abandon the magical world completely after they graduate, they're probably too interested in getting ministry jobs to change the system rather than the education.

****** I think people also have a vastly inflated idea of how many people are in the wizarding world, and of how many muggleborns there are. If we take some numbers from Hogwarts (just talking about some rough estimates from canon here) then muggleborns are less than 5% of the wizarding population. We know for sure of about three in Potter's year, Potter's year is also probably smaller than most because of his generation being born during a war. But we do know that Hogwarts has about 500 students at the VERY upper end of the scale, probably more like 300 on average. Let's just assume that, just to be generous, 20% of parents send their kids to Beauxbatons or Durmstrang. That allows for 360-600 students across seven years of schooling from Magical Britain. That's less than a tenth of a percent of the British non-magical school population.

That allows for maybe twenty thousand British Magicals, at the outside, and roughly 600 to 800 of those at any given time would be Muggleborns, less than a fifth of those (roughly 100 - 140) would be effective teachers, less than a tenth of those who would be effective teachers would be interested in teaching. So roughly 15 Muggleborns in any given period of wizarding history would be applicable candidates for the post of ANY teaching position at Hogwarts, never mind the specific field of Muggle Studies. Then consider that (and this is conjecture) a little under half of all Muggleborns probably leave the magical world entirely or live as muggles with little to no interaction with the magical world after leaving Hogwarts. A fair proportion of them probably also leave to go overseas.

Tldr: There's basically a very tiny proportion of the population that could ever be a muggle studies teacher AND a muggleborn

Also, its a fair extrapolation that of the student's whose blood status we don't know, a similar percentage are muggleborn or halfbloods, suggesting that the percentage of muggleborns are higher than just the students we know about/the 5%.

I suppose you'd argue that the higher number of muggleborn students would still be as low as 5% because you assume some students from wizarding families will study abroad.

More needs to be done to integrate muggleborns in their society. So mugglestudies for purebloods and half-bloods while wizard studies for muggleborns.

Some teachers need to be replaced. More staff needs to be added.

** Double the amount of teachers. Probably even more than that, but doubling would go a long way towards fixing the majority of issues.

Make the head of house an actual separate job, and not allow teachers to do it. In high school we had councilors that did nothing but be the person you go to for any problem academic or social. Heads of house seemingly fill the same role, except have entirely too much work to ever actually do it.

Some sort of introduction to being a wizard class. The equivalent of muggle studies, except for muggleborns and a required class for first years.

Not sure if this would actually do anything, but I think being resorted every year would go a long ways towards fixing a lot of the house bias. With a proper amount of teachers/adults keeping an eye on things this might not be an issue to begin with though.

Potentially have more clubs. Its hard to say if hogwarts only has like 3-4 clubs or if Harry is just so ignorant of everything going on around him that he never hears about more. More is never a bad thing though, and with more teachers getting supervision shouldn't be a problem.

I'd also move potions out of the dungeons. No ventilation just can't be a safe thing for anyone, much less growing kids who seemingly melt cauldrons on the regular.

Replace Filch. That man has no business being around kids. He legitimately wants to hang them up by chains for punishment. Just no.

I'd also have some sort of detention hall. No reason for each teacher to have to deal with trouble makers individually, just send them all to one place and have someone in charge of punishments.

** I'd start by replacing teachers I think aren't any good (either at their subject or they lack the qualities for the job of teaching or for their other responsibilities):

- Snape (putting instructions on the board and then watching students fail - and not even prohibiting sabotage - is not teaching and neither is punishing people for breathing and protecting bullies (Malfoy and the other Slytherins!))

- Trewlaney (FRAUD! She might make the occasional prophecy but otherwise she's USELESS!)

- McGonagal (yes, I dare - why? She doesn't believe her students when they come to her in need (the protection of the stone for example) and she doesn't even stand up for them ("keep your head down") and she doesn't give the students tips about electives (Harry would not have chosen Trewlaney's class if he knew it was total BS!) etc....she can stay on as deputy headmistress (with a stipulation that she does not take over as headmistress if the current headmaster were to die etc.) and take 6th and 7th years in transfiguration, but she wouldn't be head of Gryffindor anymore)

- Filius Flitwick (he'd lose head of Ravenclaw because of Luna and the bullies he either couldn't control or didn't want to control, he can stay on as a teacher because he's good at that!)

- Hagrid (danger to the students - I mean yeah he knows his stuff, but he forgets that not everybody is a half-giant and can wrestle werewolfs with one arm if need be -.-)

- The History Ghost: Binns (exorcism! Be gone you pest!)

- Sprout (again because of bullying - she can't stop her supposed fair house from bullying Harry in GoF! She can keep on teaching, but she'll lose head of Hufflepuff!)

After that I'd hire more staff (at least two teachers per subject and maybe even three in the core subjects to allow the teachers to take on apprentices from the students and do research in their subjects (part of the money of anything discovered goes to the school, but the person who did the research gets the majority of the money and the recognition for his/her work)) and look into establishing more courses (or reviving old ones - if there were any, I mean Hogwarts has a lot of unused classrooms so it's likely that several courses were discontinued! I mean we don't know if enchanting was ever taught, but that might be an interesting class to add, same for warding and ward-breaking (curse-breaking) etc.).

I'd discontinue DADA (yes! Why? - So that the curse won't affect my MAMD (Mundane and Magical Defense) class that teaches everythind DADA does, but also some dark arts (why? Durmstrang isn't evil and they teach them!) and even some weapon handling (for a wizard a muggle is quite dangerous if armed, at the same level as many lesser magical pests, so recognizing muggle weapons is important IMHO) from fencing to some limited practice with guns!)

I'd offer muggle courses (maths, literature, languages etc. even at a level to get a muggle education at the same time as you do your wizard one...wouldn't lock the muggleborn into the magical world, that's kind of unfair!), but also a class on wizard-traditions and politics! (muggleborns would have to attend, same for halfbloods who fail at testing out of it, but in return the purebloods would have to attend muggle-studies (I'd upgrade that constantly, so no teaching about Victorian-England!))

Also: NO MORE QUILLS! (Use a fucking fountain-pen it's not the 1800's anymore!)

No more point-system, no more Hogsmeade-Weekends (I'd let the students visit the village whenever they want, as long as they are back at the castle before a certain time (say 8 o'clock for first to fourth years and 9 o'clock for fifth to sixth years and seventh years can stay longer (till 10 or as long as they want if they are 17!)) with that privilege being taken away if they don't do their homework etc. (I see no reason to isolate the students...hell, I might abolish the boarding school for non-muggleborn students (floo and portkeys work just fine after all)...it would be too taxing on the statute of secrecy to have muggleborns teleport to school every day!)

I'd upgrade the castle (fix stuff like doors leading somewhere else at different days etc. - that serves no purpose at best and is dangerous at worst!), offer muggle sports (stuff like a tennis-court and a soccer-stadium), upgrade the astronomy tower (how about a true observatory or a planetarium?), swimming classes (and an indoor pool), experiment with installing modern lighting (electricity) etc. (if the wizard wireless works by immitating a radio, why not make a TV that works on magic?)

Get rid of most of the portraits (as headmaster I am not a peeping Tom, so I don't need them to keep an eye on the students!)...not by destroying them, but by moving them to rooms especially for portraits

I'd install some sort of announcement system etc. etc. :)
