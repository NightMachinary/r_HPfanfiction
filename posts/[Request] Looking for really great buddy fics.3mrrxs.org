  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Cannon to Epilogue, then not so much...

** Check out [[http://hp-friendship.livejournal.com/][hp-friendship]] on LiveJournal -- it has a really good selection of great friendship-centric stories. I wrote for it a couple years ago, a Neville and Ginny friendship story, and I had a blast! Strong friendships really are overlooked a lot, so I was glad this community existed.
