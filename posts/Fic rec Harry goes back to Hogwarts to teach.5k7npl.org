I just read a thing on tumblr about Harry not becoming an auror and rather going to be the longest serving DADA teacher ever. Got me thinking that any "Harry becomes a Hogwarts professor" fic could be quite fun. Hit me with your recommendations please! I'm ok with slash but actually prefer stories with the canon couples (except for my soft spot for Hermione/Draco) - or really, I'm happy with no/little romance but interesting plot! :)

Happy holidays!

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.

** “he will have the power the dark lord knows not” (linkfo3(5579962)) features this, though it is not exactly explored.

“The Untitled Cheekquel Project” (linkffn(2477165)) and “You Did What!” (linkffn(2630300)), respectively the sequel and the sequel's sequel to “Where in the World is Harry Potter?” (linkffn(2354771)) have that as a somewhat noteworthy feature.

Also “Seventh Horcrux” (linkffn(10677106)), though it's not the main focus either.

  It was Mrs. Figg who suspected first. She noticed many things, sitting on her side of her fence with her cats chasing butterflies and nuzzling her ankles, Mundungus and the other watchers dropping by for tea now and then. Mrs. Figg noticed that Petunia was a nosy bit of work with insecurities hanging from her every harsh angle. She noticed when Dudley learned the word MINE-- the whole neighborhood noticed that one. She noticed that Vernon glared at owls.She noticed that when Petunia gave Harry a truly horrendous haircut one year, it grew back in at a normal rate. Harry was uneven and weird-looking for ages, hiding under beanies when he could. When Mrs. Figg had Harry over for carefully miserable afternoons of babysitting, she noticed nothing moved that shouldn't. He didn't accidentally make flowers out of fallen leaves, or levitate anything during tantrums, or turn toys funny colors. Mrs. Figg called up her mother, interrupting the wizarding bridge game she was winning against the nursing home staff, and asked her how she had known, decades back, that her youngest daughter was a squib.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
