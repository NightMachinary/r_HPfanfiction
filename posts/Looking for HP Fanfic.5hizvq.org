I'm looking for a fic where joins the SAS in order to get the training to take out Voldemort. Hermiones parents are in hiding and she has to figure out clues to find them. Hermione's dad is retired SAS and Hermione asks him if he can help her get in contact with Harry. Hermiones dad goes to see a guy named tim who is an old friend from his days in the SAS. Harry is married to Tims daughter and tim delivers a letter to Harry from Hermoine. At the end of the fic, Draco Malfoy kidnaps harry's wife and child and Harry kills him for it, the fic was around 5 chapters long. Please help me find this, I'd really like to read it agalin
