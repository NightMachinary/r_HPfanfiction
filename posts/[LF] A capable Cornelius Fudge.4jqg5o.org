I'm looking for fics where Fudge is a capable MoM, following Goblet of Fire, for example. Preferably no slash. Thank you :)

  The Lone Traveler arrives on the even of Fudge's election. Instead of pelting Dumbledore for advice, the new Minister listens to a new viewpoint. Much is changed.

Not Fudge-centric, but Sirius Black takes up the mantle of Lord Black and pranks the Minister into doing his job. Long, HHr, a bit cringy but the politics are well-done in this fic. Lots of Wizengamot goodness.

Excerpt:

*"What next?" Sirius asked himself. "Oh, right, we hired a solicitor, Brian Cutter, who's very good at what he does. He investigated my arrest, found there wasn't a trial and approached Fudge on behalf of Lord Black about investigating whether or not Sirius Black was innocent."

"The Minister knows that Lord Black will be very powerful politically when he takes up his position in the Wizengamot, more powerful and wealthy than the Minister's current advisors." Remus jumped in. "So he agreed to the investigation, and ultimately your guardianship, not wanting to annoy a new potential ally."

Harry looked at them both with a grin. "So you essentially pranked the Minister into doing his job?"

"Yes." Remus and Sirius replied in unison unashamedly.*

** Doesn't this defeat the point of the character as a bumbling peacetime minister?

Or do you mean capable of scheming to stay in power?

*** Whose point? JKR's? Or the writer of the fic? Why can't Fudge be capable in stories? If Dumbledore can be downright evil, why can't Fudge be a decent, smart MoM?

**** I'd say both, unless you're delving into an entirely AU Fudge. The main constraint on a capable Fudge is your stipulation of a Fudge after GoF: he's already been shown as incompetent and a typical political sycophant in PoA. Unlike Dumbledore, whose persona and motivations are elusive until the end of DH (and even open to interpretation past that), Fudge is much more one-dimensional, given his formulation as a character.

I'm not saying Fudge can't be capable in some regards. He's obviously good at political maneuvering. But there's clear limitations to developing him as a competent leader, if you want to adhere to any of his canon characteristics.

***** I've seen fics with Snarry MPreg, fics where magic doesn't exist and HP is set in the Muggle world, fics where HP is actually a Jedi with years of training and more, yet you think Competent!Fudge is too impossibly out of character to even consider??!!

******* I suppose it defends on where you draw the line. Harry growing up on Tatooine is what I would consider AU. Fudge being competent isn't even close to AU in my opinion.
