:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic I read a while back where Harry time travels to his younger body after dying in the forest in 1998 to the day of the third task after which he takes down Voldemort and his horcruxes in a day or so and not sure who to trust he starts with flitwick

Any help is appreciated


** There's the unforgiving minute, in which Harry attempts to kill Voldemort within 12 hours on the day of the third task.

** There's a short story called Return and Resurrection in a collection of shorts called A Fable of Firsts by FurySerenity that has much of what you are looking for. I believe it was the short that inspired the author's longer story called A Time for Harmony and Vengeance

  A FABLE OF FIRSTSSummary: A Collection of the first chapters of intended stories I have written over the years that have never kicked off into multiple chapters. Mostly Harry/Hermione or Harry/Harem. Many stories have Severe Character Bashing, including Dumbledore, Weasleys, and others, as well as cliches, such as Betrothals, Time Travel, Betrayals, Helpful Goblins, and so on.Disclaimer: J.K Rowling owns the characters and the world of Harry Potter. I do not. I just like to play in her sandbox. No copyright infringementintended.Author's Note: I have several of these "First Chapters" that never grew into bigger stories. I've been debating posting these for a while now.
