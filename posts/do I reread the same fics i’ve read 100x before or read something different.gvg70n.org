** I just took a brek between two very long oldies I love for some new shorter fics.

**** One is rewriting destiny on ao3.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13232688/chapters/30268506]]

And Scotland Evander rewritten in time series. I'm kinda on a time travel kick at the moment.

Sorry I have no idea how to link with the bot. They are both similar with Draco going back with a second chance and pairing with Hermione. Both are well written.

***** Thank you for replying, I've been looking for new fics to read (rather that keep re-reading!) and prefer longer ones to one-shots or shorter ones as I can get immersed in the story better. I'll check them out!

****** If you want I can go over my bookmarked this weekend and see if there is anything you might like? Is there anything you dont like and I can try to weed those out? Or is there anything specific you want? Ill also experiment and see if I can like the bot

******* That'd be really good, thank you! I'm not a massive fan of slash, nor overpower ancient and noble Harry, but if it's well written I'm prepared to give anything a read. I appreciate your time!

** I've mostly been re-reading lately. The fluffy, romance stuff that's on the syrupy side because... Well. The world is pretty terrible right now and I could use more predictable and idyllic fluff.

Although if anyone has stuff they think would fit the bill I'll take it.

** Here's what I do.

Look for something new, be mostly disappointed, entertain the idea of writing your own fic, remember that you can't write to save your life and there is enough shit out there, go search for fics in a fandom you haven't looked at in while.

** My favorite ship has like 5-10 longer fics I can appreciate, and like 5 that I truly like. Whenever I feel fic-starved, I pick one of them at random to re-read. If a long enough time has passed, I can get close enough to the first time experience.

Paradoxally I actually tend to read my favorite fics overall less because if I let more time pass, I can enjoy them even more when I do get back to them.

** super fucking relatable. If rather reread a fic that I like than have to wade through an ocean of trash to maybe find a hidden gem

** I always try to find new fics, but reread some old favourites once every couple months.

Current rereads I've been enjoying are Harry Potter and the Problem About Potions (AO3) and How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Lord V (ff.net)

** I ended up reading crossovers, being introduced to new fandoms, and started reading stories from those fandoms.
