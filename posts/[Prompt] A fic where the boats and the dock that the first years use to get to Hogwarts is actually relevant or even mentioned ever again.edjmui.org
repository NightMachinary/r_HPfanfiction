I was rereading the philosopher's stone (of which i haven't owned a copy in years, it's great by the way you should read it again) and was reminded that this dock existed, but it was never mentioned ever again. Even during the battle of Hogwarts, where the opportunity to use it as a point of entry for the death eaters arises, it's never brought up. I think it could be a fun little thing to write a fic about; maybe Hogwarts has sailing lessons, or a main character finds that it's a nice quiet place to study or relax and befriends a mermaid. The world is your oyster (haha a kind of pun)


** I've read a fic or two where the Seventh Years ride the boats on their way out. Can't remember the name of them though.

*** This is also "word of god". In an interview JK said.

"Oh yeah, definitely. No, I think the boats would've been the most poetic and beautiful way to get-- for them to leave. And symbolic in that they-- Harry wouldn't have seen the thestrals again, you know what I mean? It would've been a return to innocence, really. And passage over water is so symbolic, you know, in the history of magic, so, yeah. That would've been great..."

In answer to a couple of questions about possible traditions for the final year and graduation of Hogwarts students.

I must say that I when I hear about JK making pronouncements about her own works I find it interesting but I'm not inclined to take them as scripture. So I think it's interesting and very poetic, but I don't think everything she says is immediately canon. For instance in the same interview she states that Hermione was the only one to graduate and I that Harry would have gone back for his NEWT year. I would like to think Ron would have gone back too, but I can be persuaded otherwise.

*** I love that idea. The boats are a staple of everyone's time at Hogwarts, hat gives them more meaning.

** I believe The Arithmancer series has a side tunnel down there leading to the castle's ward stones, but I may be thinking of a different fic.

Personally, I love the idea of older students greeting the firsties as they get off the boats, giving out drying and warming charms, especially if it's raining. Like, you're welcoming these kids into your home, be hospitable.

** I think I read a fic that had the boats as a way to key the new students in the wards...

** At some point I read one where at the point where Hagrid says to duck their heads is where the Trace is applied

** In an easy-to-miss reference, the first years also take the boats BACK to the train at the end of Harry's first year.

I've seen in several fics that taking the boat across the water is where the Trace is applied. This is sometimes outright said to be the reason that Hermione wasn't expelled by Mafalda Hopkirk before she even started school. ("I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me.") Not that it makes sense for a spell to be applied like that, but having the Trace magically dissipate as soon as you've turned 17 doesn't make a lick of sense either, and that's canon.
