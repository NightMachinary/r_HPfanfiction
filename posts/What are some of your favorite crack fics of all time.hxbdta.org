** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3542099/1/How-I-Learned-To-Stop-Worrying-And-Love-Lord-V][how I learned to stop worrying and love Lord Voldemort]]

I LOVE this fic. It sounds like complete crack but it's actually pretty well thought out and solemn at times. Nuclear war, voldemort is a huge radiophobe so he had spent the 50s casting a gigantic stasis charm to be triggered if nuclear war ever broke out. It did, Harry wakes up one day and everyone in Hogwarts is frozen. Voldemort comes bashing in and is like whoops come along you might as well help me.

He is neurotic and psychotic and bizaare but... It makes sense. From first person Harry POV. I think this is one of my favourite parts:

{ "Did you have to kill Dumbledore?" I bawled, suddenly losing all patience. "He could have helped us out of this! I could have passed messages between you or something! He was about the only one powerful enough to still be here, and you killed him!"

He sneered at me in fury, but the expected shouting match failed to materialise. Instead, the anger changed to a cold, malevolent glitter. "I killed Amelia Bones, too," he said dispassionately. "She wrote a groundbreaking tractate on the space-time continuum, which you probably don't know, and she would have been an immeasurable help with the stasis spell. Only I killed her. There were times when -- " and he broke off and suddenly scratched his claws down his face, leaving livid red parallel rake-marks. Then he sat and stared at the wall. }

And some other honorable mentions:

{ When I'd been drinking and choking for a good minute, he muttered that it would have to do and let go of the back of my neck. I was in mild shock. I was starting to get what he meant when he said he was radiophobic. "Right," I said. "OK." }

{ "It's a Firebolt," I said indignantly. "It's the fastest fucking broom in the world. The Irish use them!"

"Really?" he said incredulously, then sneered, "Flashboy." }

{ "Aren't you scared, you bloody idiot?" he said incredulously. "You're not scared about the end of the world?"

I examined my emotions. "No," I said truthfully. "Or, you know. Not pathologically." Not like you, I thought privately, but I didn't say it out loud for fear of setting him off again.

"Depression," he said. "I hate people with depression. No emotions. No fear." }

I don't typically care for crackfics but I did enjoy Amalgum when I read it. One of the first fanfics Ive ever read.

warning: there's a small subplot where Harry/lockhart gets 12 year old Harry to happen upon 12 year old Hermione naked in an attempt to get the two together. It comes off as rather creepy.

** The old classics: linkffn(Seventh Horcrux; A Black Comedy) Another one I really liked was linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor) it's a smutty comedy that's really well written and hilarious. Linkao3(Full Circle) is the only Harry/Tom Riddle fic I've read because the absurdity of the story makes the pairing work, and not be disgusting. It's pretty funny, but hasb't been updated since 2019. The others are all complete.
