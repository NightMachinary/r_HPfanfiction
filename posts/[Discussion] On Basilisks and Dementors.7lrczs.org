What would a Basilisk's Gaze do to a Dementor, in your opinion? Would the Dementor be petrified like a ghost, or be killed, or remain unaffected? (By the same token, the same questions also go for a Boggart or a Poltergeist.)

****** They sense happiness, that's really it. It's not a vision. It's a sixth sense of sorts. You need eyeballs to get petrified or killed by a basilisk, and they don't have it.

** Mm...I did write a very silly mini-fic ages ago ("Pasta of Death"), which had a Basilisk!Harry accidentally looking at a Dementor. The accompanying sound effect was 'fwoomph'.

But yeah, if dementors can't actually see, in an optical sense...hmm...I guess a basilisk's gaze wouldn't be effective against dementors. That said though, it's curious how ghosts can be petrified, seeing as they can see, and perceive, but don't actually have eyes as an organ, just the ectoplasmic representation of such.

...Actually, you know what else is strange? The basilisk's gaze destroyed Colin's film of it. How could it do that, without destroying anything else that it lays gaze upon (except for killing anything that meets its gaze back)? Could it be that the actual image of the basilisk's eyes is cursed (cursing images/words/etc isn't unprecedented, see the Taboo and Unplottability), such that it shatters anything it's depicted upon (human sight, camera image, etc)? But then why would the basilisk not die to its own reflection, or shatter every mirror that shows the image of its eyes as it passes?

*** If I recall correctly, the molten-film thing was an addition of the movie; it looked good on-screen but didn't mesh too well with the way the Gaze seems to work in the books, and I wouldn't put too much stock on it when trying to determine the true mechanics.

Here's another question. Can /Portraits/ be Petrified? They clearly see, albeit through a magical process that is probably the same one as how ghosts do it.

**** Actually, the insides of the camera being melted does appear in the books...ooh, I just realised, it's not necessarily the basilisk that did it! Possessed-Ginny could have been there, and might have used a spell to melt the insides of the camera so that it couldn't been used as evidence!

The question of how either the portraits didn't see anything, or why they weren't questioned, is good, though. Hmm...can you obliviate portraits?

*** I believe that the cause has to do with the pickiness of the idea of perception. Anything that meets the basilisk's eyes risks death. A camera on its own does not 'meet' the basilisk. Only when it is used by a person.

** I would say that the dementor would be unaffected, a poltergeist would be petrified (head Canon: poltergeist is a pissed off ghost), and a dementor would be unaffected as it won't transform cause the basilisk has no soul/magic.

#+end_quote

I'm afraid this goes rather beyond a normal 'headcanon', and into blatant /contradiction/ of canon. It's implied in the first book that the ghosts don't consider Peeves one of their own in any capacity ("he's not even properly a ghost!"), and Rowling confirmed her intention was that Poltergeists are spirits of chaos who naturally spawn in places of magic and mischief, not the remains of someone who once lived.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

What does the fact that it won't transform have to do with anything? Moreover: the Basilisk's Gaze is pretty ostentatiously a magical ability, so yes, Basilisk have magic; and I see no reason why a Basilisk wouldn't have a soul --- but either way, why would the former be necessary for a Boggart to transform? We know for a fact that Boggarts can and do transform in front of Muggles, after all.

**** Re: poltergeist

Oops. Forgot about that bit. Eh

Re: boggart

I view them being as a formless blob until something comes by, then they see what the thing is most terrified of and turn into it. Soul comes in cause that's what the boggart looks at. (Which now that I write it out sounds kinda op or cheap depending on your view).

The magic bit was remnants of a though that got scrapped.

** Dementors are blind, so the gaze of the Basilisk wouldn't affect them.

As for a poltergeist, it's anyone's guess, but Petrification seems plausible.

** Dementors aren't strictly speaking alive (I think they're classified as 'amortal') so they won't be killed by the Gaze. I also like whoever pointed out below that they don't have eyes, so they can't see the Gaze anyway. The Basilisk will probably feel sad, though. (can snakes cry? Magical properties of Basilisk tears, anyone?)

I know that poltergeists are not ghosts, but I suspect that Peeves would be affected similarly to Sir Nick. If not, I suspect he would be temporarily destroyed before reforming, since Peeves seems to have come into being from the castle and its students.

As for a boggart... my headcanon is that a boggart is small fry compared to a Big Bad Basilisk(tm) and so would run and hide, making itself as small as possible.

Fair enough (heh, I do wonder what the Basilisk's greatest fear would look like, though), but what if you /did/ lock the Boggart and Basilisk in a room with no place for either to go and hide? What then?
