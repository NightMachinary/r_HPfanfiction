Feel free to explain why you can't enjoy the stories in anyway.


** This might be beating a dead horse by now but, A Black Comedy and Wastelands of Time are two that have never grabbed me.

I'd actually be intrigued to see how they were received immediately after release as they're two that I've always perceived as maybe /gaining/ a huge following rather than locking one down right away.

As to why they're not my thing, I guess I'm not generally a fan of adult-in-a-kid's-body stories - at least ones that go in to romance or hint at it - it gets into squicky territory for me easily. About the only one I've read and enjoyed is Hermione time travel fic Six Pomegranate Seeds which I was recommended on here recently. & additionally, while otherwise well-written... both of those fics time to time come across like the author has never envisaged a woman in their lives as a human person, which throws me straight out of the -verse the story's taking place in. Things that could maybe be fixed by a beta!

** HPMoR and Harry Crow - I'm sure I don't need to explain them.

Easier than falling asleep by JacobApples - chapter 1 has a lot copy-pasted from books 4 and 7, and it just highlights how much better the canon writing is. In addition to that, with all horcruxes destroyed in chapter 1, I don't understand how there's going to be an interesting story with what's left.

Magicks of the arcane by Eilyfe - it felt like wish fulfilment, which doesn't at all interest me.

Divided and Entwined by Starfox5 - this is different because I actually loved the story at first, and couldn't put it down for 20-30 chapters, but it just started feeling like a slog and I ended up giving up at about chapter 35. It's well written and interesting, but I think the story would have been more effective if it were slightly shorter. I know Starfox is active on this subreddit, so if you read this, I have nothing against your writing, I just couldn't finish this one.

*** HPMoR is a big one for me too. I loved it at first, and it was actually what first drew me into reading fanfiction, but the tone and nature of the story gradually changed to the point where I felt like I'd been bait-and-switched: It starts out a humorous exploration of magic from a scientific mindset, then increasingly tosses that aside, swapping humor out for darkness and the exploration of magic for politics and intrigue.

To some degree, I almost wish the author had abandoned it a few chapters in rather than add such a disappointing turn.

*** I had the same doubts with 'Easier than falling asleep' but the lack of horcruxes/story is what drew me in. I was just really curious about what was going to happen. The Harry in this fic is very different from a lot of the other ones I read and Sirius and his relationship with Harry is also somewhat unique. I think this is one you read for the character dynamics. There is an interesting plot line with Voldemort outside the horcruxes but that comes later.

There are also some beautiful lines in here. I definitely need to go back and see if something else inspired them, but there are times I have to stop and sit on a line.

**** Stuff like this:

*Hermione wank*

#+begin_quote
  "Granger!" he bellowed as soon as he was through the passageway. "Gryffindors are supposed to stick together! What the hell do you mean by calling me a 'braying ass' in front of the whole class? And in Snivellus's class at that!"

  "Oh, I'm sorry, Potter," she said sweetly. "I'm only a humble Muggleborn still in awe of the wonders of the magical world. And when I see a braying ass magically disguised as a Hogwarts student, I CAN'T HELP POINTING IT OUT!"

  "Why you little...! What were you so upset about anyway?! It's just house points! Nobody here cares about that except Little Miss Know-It-All!"

  Hermione's eyes flashed dangerously, and she whipped out her wand. Startled, Jim fumbled for his own, but Hermione simply turned and walked to the stairs leading up to the dorms. There, she pointed her wand up each staircase and, to everyone's astonishment, shot off a series of loud popping fireworks before yelling "ALL PREFECTS TO THE COMMON ROOM FOR AN EMERGENCY MEETING!"
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  Three hours and ten minutes later...

  Harry stared slack-jawed at Hermione as Neville finished his tale. No wonder Jim had seemed so subdued as he left the Headmaster's office. "I hope you won't think it forward of me, Hermione, but will you marry me?"

  "Back off, Potter," said Neville with mock gruffness. "I saw her first."
#+end_quote

Aside from that sort of cringe-worthy grandstanding (which is just as bad when Harry does it), there is a general "division of labour" wherein Hermione is the "magic one" and Harry is the "law, politics and leadership one".

I'm interested in reading about a magically talented Harry who can do things for himself, not one whose expertise is essentially outsourcing.

*Muggle wank*

#+begin_quote
  Any potions other than the ones for literacy and numeracy had to be purchased privately and at significant cost. There were lots of options for language potions, but only a few for natural sciences. The most popular one, designed for people who wanted to pursue studies in alchemy, gave the drinker a complete understanding of the field of Muggle chemistry ... as it was understood in 1893. The physics potion was so out of date that it was actually counterproductive, leading the unwary drinker to think that fires were caused by burning phlogiston and that vacuums were actually full of ether.
#+end_quote

For the avoidance of doubt, this falls into Muggle wank because:

1. It states that Muggle scientific knowledge (rather than magical knowledge) is useful/necessary for success in a magical field of study.

2. It implies that Muggles have a better understanding of an area of magic than wizards do.

Where the area of magic in question is alchemy.

#+end_quote

That's actually the only reason I wouldn't describe this fic as a Hermione-wank: It's a pervasive problem of poor characterization and badly written dialogue throughout the first 27 chapters (which is as far as I managed to read before giving up). That same one-sided grandstanding pops up in any scene where the author tried to make one character look cool in comparison to another, and the author does it with plenty of other characters besides just Hermione and Harry.

On the topic of the potions: that's one of the primary elements of world-building in the fic that struck me as completely absurd. It just doesn't jive with the cultural setting of the wizarding world that they would use potions to program all of their kids with knowledge Matrix-style.

***** Man, you must really, /really/, hate the The Arithmancer series.

Of all the things to dislike about PoS, I would never have picked those. Admittedly, the opening 10 or so chapters are the weakest. It's only better from there, 2nd year especially picks up.

The Hermione bit I understand, it always felt out of place, compared to the character she becomes.

However, If I squint, I still can't see the Muggle Wank. It has been a while since I read that passage, so I may be wrong. All it is, is a potion that grants the taker knowledge. It only requires modernising. That is, from 1893 content. to 1991? That doesn't feel like Muggle Wank to me.

If you were going to pick a scene that fit your criteria. I would have chosen Andromeda, and her mental health issues

****** I like the Arithmancer because it's not /muggle/ wank, it's /maths/ wank. The person who wrote it and its sequels knew what they were talking about, and it shows. Even though I personally didn't understand many of the esotheric mathematical concepts like fractals (at least not in a mathematical sense, I do know what a fractal is) and such, I still loved it because I could google it and the concept would make sense for what it's used for in the story.

The second part of this is how it's used in the story - Hermione doesn't use a laptop and a cellphone and shout about how great muggle tech is, she uses some aspects of mathematics which were discovered by muggles (but not unknown to wizards) to do something interesting.

******* That is essentially what is happening in PoS. Not even close to the same level of in depth use, but, similar concepts. Lily dose something interesting with Transfiguration and Chemistry. Still it's funny, you can't read PoS for Hermione wank. I can't read the Arithmancer for the same reason.

Opposite sides of the fence. But I guess that's the point of this thread.

** Covered Spoilers are minor, Explained in the first few chapters, typical bashing tropes or self explanatory!!! But are covered in case its on someones TBR.

Three to a backstep. I even read 50 out of the 55 chapters but when they got to the point of fixing the ministry after defeating Voldemort I just dropped it. I disliked how Daphne told them about her rape. ESPECIALLY just right after it happened. I liked that she told them, just not how it was done. I was sexually molested (though not to the point of rape and then getting f*cking murdered) and wouldn't let anyone touch me for days afterward. And though every experience is different it seemed a bit unrealistic (and yes I recognize that its fiction) I know the author tried and handled it really well most of the way it was just the beginning that ticked me off. The Soulbonds were alright but I wasnt a fan of the stages and how they were developed and the bashing was repetitive. The angels showing up at random intervals kinda felt like mediocre character development, poor plotting, and a way to further the plot without having to deal with the fallout from the parents (speaking of! How the parents were suddenly ok with it after they showed up was not my favorite. them getting to trust harry should have been a big thig but they handed over their daughters like useless paper. Sirius being a lord and all political was actually kinda good (i mean he /is/ a Black) and i loved amelia bones and augusta longbottom for the most part. What killed it was the boring day to day school that felt repetitive and way too detailed. It mostly served to create more bashing and fill up a word count. Snape was okay-ly done in this but luna was well handled. The fact that even after the staff was flushed from potions and still sided with ol' Dumbles the majority of the time irked me (looking at you Minnie) and that McGonnagal didnt tell harry about the potions even after he inadvertently helped her discover such, made me want to pull my hair out. Harry being good at some things that he had no explanation for being good at killed me. I did enjoy the Hermione/Daphne aspects of the story and probably would have enjoyed the entire thing more If harry had been left out or replaced with neville. Though I did know the pairing going in and have read some good fic with said pairing, the characters were very OOC at times and them having sex was mentioned so much to the point feeling like wish fulfillment and making me frustrated (said sex is not graphic but it seemed to be mentioned a lot for a story not focused primarily on said aspect. the characters dont seem like they would do it so often (in canon or this fic) but they were altered in a weird way so it would fit.) There are many more issues and good points and while I enjoyed a lot of aspects of this story, I remains one of my least favorites and will likely never be finished by me. (even if its only 5 chapters to complete it)
