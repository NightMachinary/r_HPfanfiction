Are there any fics at all where elements from the Cosmere, Mistborn, Stormlight, Elantris and Warbreaker, etc, have been featured in Harry Potter?

** Seems like you'd have to rework the whole HP magic system to fit with the Cosmere magic system.

Make Merlin or some other wizard the shardbearer of "Magic", and have him get Shattered by Ruin thousands of years in the past.

Then you need to justify why spells are all in slightly-off Latin.

That wouldn't be all that hard, would it? Make that the language Merlin spoke, or it's what they /expect/ to trigger magic so it does. Maybe just retcon spells being in Latin and make up your own nonsense if you must. That might bother people, though.

It wouldn't be Ruin, though, unless.. hey, maybe.. *Mistborn spoilers:* Sazed remade Scadrial into what we know as Earth, and then created magic? Then maybe some plot about how he needs help containing Ruin and Preservation, because they're getting imbalanced due to.. Voldemort effectively causing ruin?
