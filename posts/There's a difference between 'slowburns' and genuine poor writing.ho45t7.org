I feel like a lot of Harry Potter fanfiction authors need to find the line between realistically drawn out relationships and a romance story with no other plot points taking a hundred long-ass chapters to get past the enemies phase, with no real substance per chapter.

Is this just me being impatient, or have others found this problem, too?


** It's cheap drama for the sake of plot and it's not just a romance problem. They don't have the skills to create genuine, character driven conflict that's in line with characterization.

These authors well know that if your story is based entirely around UST, your readers will lose interest once that tension is resolved.

***** Obviously you can change characterisation, but honestly, shipping Hermione or Harry with the terrorists who wanted to exterminate them would require some serious mental gymnastics and the only way I could envision would be to defect and join the other side in a significantly more useful role than canon Snape. Think someone like Bellatrix unleashing herself upon her former compatriots, fighting again and again at the side of the future romance before they even trust each other.

That's an arc I can't see working for Malfoy because, well he's simply not good enough with his wand.

You could make Malfoy significantly stronger, but if he's the MC it's the same kind of stupid wish fulfilment behind OP Harry and if he's background, then that's just blatantly shoehorning something in because the author wants it to happen and can't be bothered to properly set things up.

****** It's funny that you bring up Harry and Hermione, since I think they would be two of the easier characters to twist into Death Eater followers. Or, well, Harry would be. Hermione would require a lot more due to some of her core values, but I'll get into that in a minute. Harry is pretty simple. His main interaction with Muggles is with the Dursleys, who despise him and treat him like shit. It would be quite easy to change his character to actively hate them, and to place other Muggles in the same category. His upbringing can cause him to sympathize with the purebloods who look down on Muggles, who want to keep the wizarding world separate from them, and even the ones who want to take over/dominate the Muggle world. It might not extend to hating Muggleborns, since he would likely see them as similar to himself, but I think it would be easy for him to be indoctrinated I to these beliefs when he could have such a strong bias against Muggles already.

As for Hermione, this would require a bit more work. Keep in mind that Voldemort was a half-blood who seemingly kept that hidden from most (if not all) of his followers. While he uses the pure blood agenda to his advantage, I don't think he personally has an issue with Muggleborns- he seems to actually appreciate anyone with magical blood but despises Muggles. He's also willing to spare Lily for Snape, something I don't think he would do if he truly wanted to exterminate all Muggleborns, but that's just speculation. He also does actively oppress Muggleborns when he takes over the Ministry, but again it's speculation as to whether or not he truly cares or if it's just a part of his agenda. He is a half-blood who is more powerful and the leader of a bunch of pure-bloods, after all.

In any case, even with his canon characterization it wouldn't be hard to manipulate his character into one who cares more about magical ability than blood status, and is simply using the pure-blood agenda to his advantage. For Hermione to go to his side, you could have her parents finding out about her being a witch drive a prejudice against Muggles into her similar to Harry's. Perhaps they're very religious and consider her evil and possessed, or they're just severely uncomfortable with the idea. In either case, you could have them treat her poorly, perhaps disowning her or abusing her depending on how far you want to take it, leaving her disgusted with her parents. You could even have her hide her blood status and lie about her parents, if she were ashamed of/hated them and wanted to distance herself from her family. Doing so would allow her to be more readily accepting by the Death Eaters. You could also expand on what I mentioned about Voldemort's character and make it so the Death Eaters are less about blood status and more about wizards vs Muggles.

As for Death Eaters switching sides, I think there are plenty of ways to make that work. For one thing, Voldemort actively tortures them. That could be enough motivation for someone to get fed up and switch sides right there, although admittedly that's not nearly enough motivation for a redemption arc. In any case there are a plethora of ways to make any particular Death Eater defect, and with varying degrees of redemption (from still being pretty evil and just not wanting to follow Voldemort to changing who they are as a person and fully redeeming themself). I'm not going to get into a lot of detail since this comment is already really long and you just need a decent imagination and be good at writing to make a compelling and logical Death Eater redemption story.

#+end_quote

Then make him better? I'm not talking about OP!Malfoy either. Really you're comparing a school boy to adult Death Eaters who have been murdering people for decades. He isn't even a proper Death Eater until 6th year. You can make him just as useful and competent as anyone in the DA without making him overpowered, and have him be useful in whatever adventures you come up with for the group of characters you're writing. His redemption would be a lot easier than a fully realized Death Eater since he's quite young and indoctrinated when we first meet him. Teenage years are all about discovering yourself and your own values, as well as questioning what your parents taught you as a kid, and becoming your own person. You don't have to write him as a one man army taking on a bunch of Death Eaters to make him a compelling and complex character.

I know I didn't talk much about relationships here, but the main point of discussion was how to get people onto different sides in the story, which would be the gateway to any relationships that develope later. I fully believe that, as long as you make well-written characters who are consistent with good motivations and have a decent plot that's logically consistent you can make a decent story with any of these scenarios. You may have to stray from canon, but that's what fanfiction is all about.

******* I once read a Sorting Hat oneshot where it went back in time and sorted Lily into Slytherin in order to give Dumbledore a token muggleborn to reimagine Slytherins and show them better treatment. It backfires -- Dumbledore treats her with Riddle-level suspicion, and Voldemort changes his agenda to focus more on preservation of magical culture and Lily becomes a Death Eater (by virtue of being mistreated by the other 3 houses and the staff due to her House Sorting).

I could definitely see something akin to that to lure Hermione to the dark side. I'm less confident that you could turn Harry into working for Voldemort -- due to the fact that he killed Harry's parents.

** Totally agree. Fanfic can be like that sometimes because there's no word count limits like when publishing an actual novel. There's no editor saying, “bro, get to the fucking point. You can condense these 100,000 words into two chapters of 20,000 words and it would make no difference to the story.”

It's not necessary for the author to walk the reader through every single day in the characters relationship. Set up their relationship and hit the high and low points. A slow burn works well when it's a sub plot. It's inherently something with little action and not a lot of big changes but small incremental movements towards an end goal. So it's great for filler or intermission chapters in a larger more compelling plot. Not as great as the main plot because it just feels like the author has shoe horned in some action or drama to fill out the slow burn romance rather than the other way around.

A few thousand words describing the characters entire plan or thought process in an internal monologue followed up by another few thousand words where they then describe that exact same plan to a group of people. Next chapter is them refining their plan with another 5,000 word internal monologue, followed up by a few thousand more words where they second guess it all and have to rehash it again to make sure they are doing the right thing.

Internal monologues can be a great tool to show a character struggling with a decision or as a way to set up a situation, but some people need to edit their work more.

***** What I'll frequently tell someone who's rambling too much is “save it for your notes.” Basically, depending on the point of view of the story, you shouldn't have a 100% bird's eye view of something. That is the author's job. What a good author does is to reveal snippets of the notes they have, and make their reader pay attention. Much like in dating, nobody wants a pushover. They want something that's going to challenge their brain to keep up.

This isn't to say that you need to be a weirdo who is all mysterious and shit. More so that you have to trust your reader to be able to figure out context clues. I don't need a rhapsodic treatise on how gorgeous a particular room is. Frankly, I usually don't care. Same goes for someone's appearance, especially in fan fic, where we already have an outline of what the characters look like. I need a few salient points, and the rest I'm happy if you hand wave.

It's like this trope that my friend told me about in movies. If you see someone early in a movie coughing, they're going to be critically ill or dead by the end. Basically if you mention something, it needs to have a purpose.

****** I'm terrible with it. It's the main reason why I didn't publish anything more than a few prompt response here and there in years.

It seems that I forgot a few major things :

- Readers are not idiots, they can understand things with just context clues.

I seemingly can't simply write : "Harry insisted on Lilies as the wedding flowers". No, I have to write : "Harry insisted on Lilies as wedding flowers. It was important to him as it represented his late mother". Like. What Harry Potter fans would need me to tell them why Harry wanted Lilies as wedding flowers?

- Readers don't need the full and detailed backstory. It's better given in snippet here and there, and reconstructed by reader later.

- It's useless to try to avoid plot holes by explaning every little things.

- Not everything have to be given a detailled cause and reason. Things can just be.

Let's say I want to write a fun little snipped of McGonagall taking care of Harry for a few hours.

I won't simply write : "McGonagall was babysitting 9 months old Harry that night". Which I know is enough informations and no one but me wonder why McGonagall is babysitting baby Harry that one time.

But it seems that I can't let it go.

I have to write that Lily and James had a decide to have a night for themselves, because they discovered that having a baby is putting a drain on their couple (and I will give examples and details on how their couple suffered), so they decided to have a night to reconnect (and here I would described their plan).

Then, I'd try to answer the question why it is McGonagall and not one of the Marauders which I think readers would expect. I could just write that they were all busy that night. It is explanation enough.

But no. I don't do that. I will tell you why they all aren't available that night. And since I already imagine people asking "then why James and Lilly didn't make their plan for another night), I'll decide that something unexpected came up last minute for them. (So, that night being a full moon won't work).

So, I'll write that Peter's mom was sick, so he had to care for her (and I will detailed the sickness, that it is a long one. One that have good days and bad days, that day being a bad day. How it seems that because of It Peter was more reserved, a bit more stressed and thus aggressives, and that they don't see him often and they miss him).

Then I'll write Remus had left on a suddenn mission with the werevolves.. (And I will go in details about said mission, what the emergency is, and Remus roles with the werevolves in general, and inside whatever community he is dealing at the moment in particular. And maybe, I would write about the politics of said community, and its society).

And Sirius? Well I already used the mission with Remus so it has to be something else. Ah, let's say he was having a fight with his current girlfriend and he needed to fix it. aNd then I'll write what the fight was about , who the girlfriend is (here insert full backstory), and how they have met.

I'd be 10000 words in? if not more, and McGonagall hadn't even appear at Godric's Hollow, yet for her night of fun babysitting.

I usually end up writing 10 stories inside of ones. And, in the end, I don't even remember which is the one I truly wanted to tell.

***** I like /brief/ internal thoughts. When a person is having a conversation, especially a short one, they're going to have secret thoughts. These work especially well when the characters are being fake polite to each other. Those are lots of fun to read.

A 7 paragraph diversion in the middle of a conversation would involve one or both people getting a glazed over look while all this crap is going on. Private musings can be nice, /if/ it amounts to something. What frequently ends up happening is that the internal stuff becomes repetitive (we've seen this same identical line of thinking several times already), redundant (now the couple are going to verbalise their long internal diatribe), or boring (oh my god, get on with it, we've been sat here for half a chapter).

*** Totally, and the reverse is equally true: I recently started (and quickly dropped) an AU in which the first chapter shows the MC's backstory before cutting to present day (his third year), having him apparate from Hogsmeade to some tomb he wants to pilfer, pilfering said tomb largely without effort, apparating back to Hogsmeade, establishing over the course of a single conversation his only friendship and the facts that the Chamber of Secrets is open and there are dementors at Hogwarts, then he has a private lesson with one of the professors, then he fights Diary!Tom, /then/ he fights a demon. /All in the first chapter,/ which was about 4k words, iirc.

Honestly, it turns "setup and payoff" into "thing happens with an embedded explanation as to what thing is, how it works, and why it's important."

**** Agreed, though I've read very, *very* few fics that I'd say could do with being longer. :D

I do remember one fic that somehow managed to pace both too fast and too slow, though. One of the first fics I ever read, and it spent ages on description but bugger all time on actions. So, you'd end up with a five-plus line paragraph describing every physical thing about a character, then three words of verb at the end. Basically every part of the story was like:

#+begin_quote
  'Bob, with his blue eyes and his hooked nose and his long arms and his big hands [and you know what they say about guys with big hands - they can play bigger pianos!] and his beanpole legs and his blue jeans and his crisp shirt and his pretty jacket got up and went to work.

  He worked in a tall building, somewhere downtown, it was very, very tall and very, very broad, and it had many windows that were very shiny and it looked like it was made of clean mirrors and shiny metal and it was very conveniently located near a number of excellent coffeeshops and he thought it was a very good place to work. And then it blew up.'

*** I mean, honestly, that would be true if the authors themselves edited their stories.

But with the serialized nature of fanfiction, they don't. You publish your story, you're done.

In fanfiction, you generally see what's considered the first draft in normal writing, and in traditional publishing, your story isn't published until it went through 2-3 almost rewrites from there, and at least the first one you often do essentially by yourself.

And while for many fanfics the lack of editing makes them way too long, this does often change the nature of the text in a positive way: the reader doesn't suspect a new horror every single page, because the story has been streamlined to death.

That is a bit the case with traditional fiction, where you have to justify every single word to your editor over multiple drafts, and it makes for a very smooth story. Fanfic feels different, and in a way I enjoy that, too.

But to repeat myself: some stories go waaay overboard with this.

** I think some people might just have different expectations of a story. I personally enjoy these sort of fulff pieces where nothing much of note happens for the most part, but of course if you are going into a story expecting a tighter plot you might get tired of it.

I think it might depend on how the author presents the story in the tags and summery. If you promise a more plot driven or compact story and then ramble on for chapters on end, that's a sign you may need an editor. But if you just say it's slowburn or ideally even note that it's extreme slowburn or a fluff piece/slice of life/plot-less/etc. type of deal with less direction and drive then no progress for chapters would be fine.

Writing style and characterisation probably have something to do with it too. If the style is good, engaging, pleasnt or such similar to you, reading the "filler" will seem like less of a chore, even if you don't really like that type of content/that part of the story. Same goes for the characterisation.

** I completely agree, 'slow burn' requires the author to be skill full enough to keep you engaged with subplots while building up to a resolution. So, for example, a character with subtle signs of a crush who gets on with the story while the romance develops or the characters develop their crush.

I enjoy well written slow burn fics - it's one of my favourite things, but it's got to have an actual story otherwise it's just a bloated drag. I would say the same for fluff fics too - good fluff still tells a story. Even when you have a story that's mostly character development, or internal inspection there still needs to be a journey that happens.

** Slow burn really needs to have the journey be just as meaningful as the payoff. A romance can take time, but there needs to be visible, incremental progress, and it can't be hindered by constant setbacks. Especially in a medium like fanfiction where things are in serial updates and not books, where the possibility of ever being complete is pretty low, there is very little reason to stick around for a story that makes no attempt to be enjoyable in its journey.

*** Linkao3(The Never-Ending Road by Laventadorn) and Linkao3(Birds of a Feather by Babylonsheep)

The Never-Ending Road is ostensibly fem!Harry/Snape but it started in Second Year and has taken 600,000 words to get to Fifth Year, where Harriet is /just starting/ to develop a crush on Snape, and Snape is, well, creeped out that this is happening.

Birds of a Feather is between Tom Riddle and a Hermione Granger who always lived in the 1930s (no time travel, just moving characters around). It's around 400,000 words and has /also/ just recently gotten to the beginnings of the romance.

It helps that both of these stories have multiple POVs (TNER's Hogwarts staff meeting scenes are a delight) and that they're both determined to establish non-romantic relationships beforehand.

** I've found my biggest issue with slow burn is that the instant you tell the reader that your story is slow burn it highlights every single time the author has done something for no other reason than to keep the pairing apart.

Not for plot reasons, just because they want to draw things out.

As far as I'm concerned, Slowburn only works when you aren't told its slowburn and there are options that make it unclear who will get together with who.

Edit: and of course the worst mistake of all, when to author gives you the internal monologue of both characters. The moment it's clear both characters like each other they should be getting together soon after. With exceptions where the personality of the character allows, like if one or the other is extremely shy. Because the moment the reader knows for sure that both characters like each other it stops being a "will-they/wont-they" and becomes a "they will, now how fucking long are you going to force me to wait for some satisfaction"
