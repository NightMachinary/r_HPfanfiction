:END:
I've been looking for this fanfic for a long time because I wanted to reread it, BUT I CANNOT FIND IT ANYWHERE!

It is a story that Harry joins Voldemort after Sirius' death in the fifth year, deceives the Order by pretending to be with them, fights with Voldemort in the House of Screams to fulfill the prophecy, becomes Minister of Magic and revives Voldemort ... me I don't think she :(


** Would it happen to be this one? While Harry pretends to joing LV first, he becomes loyal after. He kills LV to complete the prophecy, becomes minister of magic and revives LV.
