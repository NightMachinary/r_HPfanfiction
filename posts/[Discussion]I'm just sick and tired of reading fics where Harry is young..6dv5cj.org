Does anyone else feel this way? I've been reading fanfiction since I was a teen, and I don't think it took more than a couple years before I felt like I had trouble identifying with and becoming engaged in the life of a 11 year old.

Now, in my mid-late 20s I have very little patience for fics that feature Harry in the 12 or younger age range. It's not that it cannot be done well or that it hasn't been done well, it's just that for the most part, the problems of your average child aren't terribly exciting to an adult.

On the flip side, when you put an 11 year old into a life or death situation, there inevitably needs to be something miraculous that aids them beyond their skills and abilities.

These fics also trend towards canon rehashes more often then not, often with a quirky premise thinly spread over the plot like a new flavor of jam over the same boring burnt toast. I'm looking at you Slytherin!Harry fics and time-travel fics (Not mutually exclusive).

The absolute worst of all is when somebody decides to write a fic where the Harry has not even reached Hogwarts age. At this point, it takes an outstanding fic and author for me to read even one chapter with Harry being 7 or 8 years old, much less an entire story arc.

I should say that I understand this is a preference, and just because I've outgrown reading about Harry's childhood years doesn't mean there aren't plenty of great fics in this category.

I think that's being generous. We get plenty of new blood as young people read the HP series for the first time or watch the movies, esp. with Fantastic Beasts giving the series more attention. Maybe I'm just being cynical.

I think it's fair to say that the average quality of the top 10% of fics is substantially higher than it was 15 years ago.

***** So far- and this goes back to when I first started reading fanfiction in my teens- I've found that the best way to cut out the vast majority of shit writing is to filter out any story shorter than 100k words. It's a shame, because there's a couple of solid stories I've read at a lower word count, but it's worth it.

****** I usually find my stories by google search or this reddit, though when I do manually search in FF.net, I usually filter out by most follows/reviews/favorites and a length of at least 60,000 words. Though I do sometimes forgive shit writing if the plot of the story is good.

Every once in a while I'll sift through a bunch of bad stories in search of some good ones. Has worked out quite well for me on occasion, and sometimes not.

** I don't mind reading a story that covers the younger years. What I do mind is when 11 year old Harry acts like a 20 year old. I understand the theory that wizards mature quicker than muggles so fine. But I think some authors can get impatient wanting harry to grow up. Thus we see this super mature Harry that is honestly not relatable to 11 year olds because of maturity and 20 something year olds because of age.

And I'm not bothered by Harry being mature due to life circumstances...but an 11 year old who has been abused and never once shown a clear role model for maturity is all of a sudden politicking at school or acting 'wise beyond his years' doesn't jive.

** I'm mostly in agreement with you. There are a few stories that are different and well-written enough that the early years are interesting. Linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) is one that springs to mind, but most just change one or two things then go through the canon events.

Starfox5 did a clever thing in linkffn(Patron) where the story starts in fifth year and uses flashbacks to fill in the back story. So yes, we get a troll attacking Hermione but not all the other boring crap from first year.

It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

These will cause changes right from the start, and they must be known to the readers. So they have a choice of a multitude of flashbacks, if they choose to skip ahead, or simply biting the bullet and writing it out from the start.

I did write an adult Harry story once, and I got to like him a bit better. But it's not very popular and I do wonder if my general disinterest in him as a character comes through. I hope not, obviously.

A) he had the invisibility cloak away for "study" when he really should've left it with Lilly who might actually need it.

B) he knew Peter petigrew was the secret keeper because he cast the Fidelius, yet didn't do shit to help Sirius.

C) why did he leave the longbottoms totally defenseless? He knew the prophecy could also apply to them.

D) he didn't get a child struck by a killing curse any medical attention before leaving him on a freezing porch overnight.

E) his decision to not only leave Harry with the dursleys, but with a complete lack of oversight is impressively bad.

F) he assigned hagrid to introduce him to the wizarding world, when clearly any teacher, even including snape would have been better.

G) He set a trap for a dark lord in a school full of children.

But if he had acted more competently, like in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467), he would have crushed Canon Voldemort like a bug. So to write Dumbledore more competently and keep the plot exciting, you need to raise Voldemort's competence as well, or make the Ministry a lot more sympathetic to him.

B) What makes you think he cast the Fidelius? The book doesn't say that at all. If it requires a third person besides the secret-keeper and the ones to be hidden, it's likely Sirius did it. Dumbledore did not know about the switch, the object was to keep it from everyone.\\
C) It's likely the Longbottoms were under the same protection. But the attack on them happened a few days AFTER Voldemort attacked baby Harry and "died". So they came out of hiding. Everyone thought the threat was over.\\
D) agree\\
E) also agree\\
F) Eh, he seems to have thought that Harry would already know all about the wizarding world from Petunia, so just needed someone to take him shopping. He didn't expect Hagrid to actually have to explain stuff. And as a bodyguard, Hagrid is a decent choice. He's tough and good in a fight, as is shown in book five.\\
G) agree, but the wizarding world is vastly different than ours culturally, almost more like a warrior society. They don't seem to mind putting kids in a lot of danger. A magical educations seems to be incredibly dangerous anyway.

** Personally i would say im pretty much your opposite.

Aside from crossovers if Harry is outside the 6-24 range i generally lose interest in the story full out. With my pure HP stories im more interested in the "canon rehash" stories because i like reading butterfly effect style stories where Harry either grows up differently or gains a specific skill and seeing how that change affects his hogwarts life.

When i do read crossovers there can be an important distinction to be made. If the story is set in a blended universe then i usually prefer reading a Harry going through hogwarts with whatever appropriate changes applied. If the fic is set in another series' universe then i dont mind Harry being a few years out of hogwarts just so that he can more easily fit into the authors plot.

Now there is a type of story which i have never read and really have no interest in reading. Marauder era and Potter children fics, i have zero interest in these genres and usually avoid them at all costs. I read fanfiction to read about Harry in his prime, not his family.

** I rather disagree. I rarely like fics where Harry is older. Mostly because it seems the only way authors know to write a 16-or-older Harry is to make him /angry/ and /impulsive/ to the point that I simply can't root for him at all. But there's also the fact that younger Harrys:

- generally have less personality, which you could see as a bad thing but I think helps with the identification process;

- are found in alternate versions of Books 1, 2, 3 and 4, which is fortunate because they're my favourite books;

- usually discover Hogwarts at the start of the story, allowing for more changes to the canon plotline. If you take a Harry who's already been through the five first books, you close yourself many possibilities both in plot and in worldbuilding.
