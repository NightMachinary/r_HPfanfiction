** Top comment at -10 points? ::grabs popcorn::

Seriously though this would be a cool concept to see explored in a fic. Maybe Harry's life turned out super shitty so Ron went back to make life easier for him... but I can't see family-loving Ron leaving Harry to the dursleys. Unless it was legit necessary for his safety, I guess. Maybe DumbleRon tried one "life" giving harry to Remus to raise and he was killed horribly at age 3 due to the lack of blood protection. Then it would make sense!

I was surprised too. Apparently there is a new theory that Ron somehow manage to time travel back and Dumbledodre is actually Ron who traveled back in time. I google it today and there were blogs where some fans wrote stuff advocating this theory.

Ron wanted everything Dumbledore had. Glory, power, money, control!

People even mentioned things like:

- Dumbledore had scar on left (? I don't know where this came from), and apparently that's something Ron got when Sirius dragged Ron.

- Dumbledore once said he had red hairs in youth.

- Some think that Ron wore Purple robs in Grimmauld 12 house. Dumbeldore was fond of purple dresses.

- Dumbledore gave Ron that light thing.

Personally I don't believe this theory. But I question both of their sanity (and honesty) enough to put them in same group. I don't think time travel was involved.

****** That's not remotely surprising, we're the biggest fanfiction subreddit on Reddit, we outclass [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]] by ~2,500 users, and we only do that because [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]] is primarily for authors.

I bet you'd be surprised to learn these are the top five /fandom/ subreddits (to my knowledge):

1. [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] - ~13,000 members
2. [[/r/FalloutEquestria][r/FalloutEquestria]] - ~2,500 members (This is a fandom based on a MLP/Fallout story, they are... dedicated)
3. [[/r/wormfanfic][r/wormfanfic]] - ~ 2,200 members
4. [[/r/Sherlock_Fanfiction][r/Sherlock_Fanfiction]] - ~ 1,700 members
5. [[/r/narutofanfiction][r/narutofanfiction]] - ~1,700 members

Also while on the topic, [[/r/pokerotica][r/pokerotica]] is larger than [[/r/pokemonfanfiction][r/pokemonfanfiction]] by just over 250 users.

2. [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]] - ~11,900 members

7. [[/r/Sherlock_Fanfiction][r/Sherlock_Fanfiction]] - ~ 1,800 members

For the record [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]] cheated by directly advertizing his sub in story updates. If a popular author did the same thing across all their stories they'd have 10k subs too.

Edit 2: Someone bothered me about a controversial opinion from over a year ago 😞, so I ended up reviewing my history and updated this.

For the record, [[/r/pokerotica]] has increased it's lead on [[/r/pokemonfanfiction]]
