** The Squib program is really cool and definitely something Hermione would approve of! Is there something special about Phoenix that made her able to survive the veil? That's probably something I would want answered if I was reading. As far as names go, her first name is really unique so I would go for a more basic surname like Waters (simple but awesome, like Sirius Black).

As far as a prophecy to defeat a dark witch, it sounds too similar to Harry Potter's story. Is there a spin you could put on it?

It looks like a really amazing plot. I would love to read it when you start writing!

*** It was Hermione's idea! She wanted a more inclusive Wizarding World.

About the Veil, I won't give spoilers, but look down at Phoenix's hands.

The prophecy falls on its side when Arya is killed and Natalie/Natalia discovers the truth about Arnica Lestrange, spoiler alert.

Speaking of Sirius, he, Tonks, and Remus do appear by book 4!
