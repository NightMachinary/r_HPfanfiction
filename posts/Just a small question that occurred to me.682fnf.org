If Dumbledore had given Tom the job would he have gone on to be what we know or would he have been the bets DADA teacher ever?


** Forgive me if I'm wrong, but at this time he had already killed and made several horcruxes. I'd wager his intentions were more nefarious than being the best professor he could.

** He would have used his position to manipulate young malleable minds into joining his cause and adopting his depraved way of thinking.

Dumbledore did the right thing in turning him down, he probably should have planned an ambush during the meeting and killed him then and there.

Right. Because extrajudicial murder is a-okay as long as it's our side.

**** Though that was a bit of humour, I do think Dumbledore should have done something about him if he truly knew what Voldemort had been doing since graduation.At the time of the interview Voldemort was a budding sociopathic pseudo-immortal mass murdering terrorist, I think exceptions could be made.

** I don't think there are any good/not abandoned fics where he's the DADA teacher, but I read other fics where he's a teacher elsewhere (also in non magic AU) and it's mostly what [[/u/MarauderMoriarty][u/MarauderMoriarty]] said, he's trying to influence students to join him, or he tries to make them rely on him so that when they get into a position of power they'll still listen to his advice. He's still a great teacher (or at least, is super powerful so everybody wants to learn from him), super charismatic, and also very hard on his students. I wish there was more teacher!Voldemort/TR, I really like the few I read.

** I think he would've been alright straight out of Hogwarts when he asked Dippet the first time, but when he went to Dumbledore he had little to no intention of teaching anyone. When he wanted to teach Im sure he was interested in recruiting young Slytherin boys for his army.

Like all of my fics are based on the idea of him getting the job the first time lol.

** The Tom Riddle from the main series was already broken as far as morals go at that particular point, so he would have ended up similar if not the same. It doesn't mean he couldn't end up being the best Defence Against Dark Arts teacher during the time when he'd actually be teaching, however long that would be, but yeah, it is highly doubtful that it would have in any way changed his path. As such, Albus's decision to deny him was a right one, though the consequences of this decision might suggest otherwise but those are entirely on Tom.

That being said, the Tom Riddle from the main series is also a person whose sanity is highly questionable at best, so if you did a rewrite you could end up with a Tom Riddle who was less broken to pieces and as such could end up going in a different direction.

** I think everyone's made the great point that he was already far gone by that point. I actually think he would be a great teacher. Barty Crouch JR was a great teacher despite...ya know. So I think he'd be a great teacher in the sense that he imparts valuable information to children in an engaging way, but I also think he would be manipulating the best students into becoming Death Eaters, which is abusive and grounds for being a Very Bad Teacher.
