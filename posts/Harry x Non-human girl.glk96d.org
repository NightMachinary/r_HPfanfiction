Hey guys, pls send me your best fics with Harry paired with any non human creature.\\
Idc if is a Vampire, Werewolf, Mermaid, Siren, Atrophomorphic creatures, angels, demons, Elfs(A normal fantasy Elf like Arwen or Galadriel, don't send me some weird shit with house elves you degenerates) or things like this, i want something that focus os the non human aspect of the character.\\
It does't have to be focused on tha pairing, but Harry in the end MUST be with a non human character.\\
Don't send me anything Veela related, just if you guys think it's somewhat different from all of those Harry and Fleur fanfic.\\
The crature can be anything, but i have some restrictions on the fanfic.

No FemHarry\\
No Slash\\
No Harem\\
No Harry/Hr or Harry/Ginny\\
Must be completed or at least a little long.

I have already read: Eclipse of the Sky, Valeriana Natassa, Daughter of darkness, Hell Eyes (My favorite fic of all time), The song of the trees and that's it i think.


** Theres some by dirtyubcle on ao3. Veela, demons wood nymphs mermaids etc

  What i remember from Under the Lake, is that Harry uses Gillyweed to go back to the lake and visit a Mermaid that he met during the first task.\\
  I the whole thing near to the end is a underwater smut between the two.\\
  And because im a frickin weirdo, i loved it !

** Well this is not quite what you want but it's a fun read. Hermione is turned into a human mermaid hybrid after the 2nd task in the hopes she will take over the rule of the merpeople in the story Whispers in the Lake by AlexandraO

*** No idea why anyone would recommend megamatt at all. Fucking boring plots and boring sex scenes. I honestly have no idea why that guy writes so many words of the same crap.

**** God, this.

All his shit is the same over and over and over, with different reskins depending on the characters used/settings used.

Half the time I think his fics are just author-insert, self-wank material.
