**** I think that the context that the duel was issued in was used to great effect to demonstrate how young and naive the two characters were. I can imagine both children being taught the rituals of their respective pureblood lines and both of them being warned not to use it until they were older.

But in the heat of battle (which was a mock battle for school credit) the rush gets to both of them and they call upon ancient and serious magic, that has likely been the deciding factor in many great events of the past... to win a game.

What is more childish?

I would like to add that I mean only this one scene in a vacuum. Although entertaining, the characterisation in HPMOR is weird to say the least.

*** I personally struggle to write children, no matter the subject or basing of the child. This is mostly due to the fact that my own childhood was less than pleasant and that I never really got to go outside and play like everyone else. A lot of children that I write tend to come off as adults or teenagers because I honestly have no idea what a child should be doing. From the ages of seven to eleven I was wishing myself to another place and aside from that, I didn't do much.

Every writer has flaws and faults in their writing, most of my own work (whether published or unpublished) attests to that because of the countless mistakes in the work I've done. A decent writer will be able hide the flaws they have and pull attention from them. One bad characterization doesn't really break a character.

I went off topic like six times trying to write this, so it may be all over the place... sigh. Lmao.

As for OP, try and Slytherin focused stories, they tend to follow the same protocol of all eleven year olds have mastered their emotions and are political prodigies.

*** Well, half of that is that eleven year olds are often annoying little shits that no one actually wants to read about. I find myself having more and more respect for fanfic authors who skip straight to somewhere around book 4-5, and reveal earlier changes to canon indirectly if necessary.

linkffn(Angry Harry and the Seven) - This one has some surprisingly neat ideas. And all of the cliches. Also being hit in the head makes you a master occlumens.

linkffn(Marauder's Plan) - Current epilogue is sort of slog to read through, but the main work is full of glorious bullshit. Like Harry being most powerful magical fetus of his generation or scar tissue on magical core.

  Choices. Intent. These things matter, their consequences extend beyond the scope of his magic. These things bring about a change within Hadrian Potter, a third year Slytherin. When vague choices are given, when intent is less than clear, what sort of consequences can that bring about? Which choice and what intent will change him the most? And in turn change those close to him.
