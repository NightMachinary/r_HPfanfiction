Okay, so quite a few things I'd be happy to read if anyone can suggest them.

1. Male Harry x Natasha Romanov
2. Female Harry x Natasha Romanov
3. Female Harry = Natasha Romanov (dont really care how this is justified with the conflicting timelines)
4. Male or Female Harry is the child of Natasha Romanov (adopted or not, dont care)

What I dont want to see

1. Male Natasha
2. Harems. I'm fine with 2-3 women in the fic, but Harems are a no go
3. Non Magical Harry. Just... no.

Thanks you to anyone who can suggest me something I've not already read ðŸ˜‰

Edit: Also, while a merged Marvel/HP universe setting is preferred, either on their own is acceptable


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19286188/chapters/45869500?view_adult=true][Natasha Romanov and the Secrets of Death]] is a pretty good one, where a Post-Endgame Natasha raises Harry.

** linkffn(The Snake and the Spider by Rain Seaker). Only a start, though. Adult Harry runs across a young Natasha in a Russian black market.

linkffn(The Widow and the Wizard by ShunKickShunKers). Young Harry accidentally kills Vernon. Natasha takes him away.

linkffn(My Name is Yasha Romanov by ShunKickShunKers). Sirius leaves baby Harry with Natasha.

linkffn(The Spider's Web by Merrick Mayfair). The only completed story in this group. Not a relationship story, though, which is what it sounds like you're looking for.

linkffn(How Could One Will Cause So Much Chaos? by darkoraclegirl). Just falls into your 3-woman limit. Sirius fakes his death, and his will sends Harry to Las Vegas, where he marries Tonks, the Black Widow, and a female Wolverine clone. I thought it had an iffy start, and I lost interest after a while.

I had two others that involved Lily being an undercover Natasha, but they've both been removed from ffnet.

  Harry has been through a lot yet there are some perks to being as gifted as he is. So he's not going to just sit back and let the world shit on him. He's going to best the absolute best. First few chapters are hard to read. Get past those and I promise it gets better. Also, I know the beginning sounds very cliche. It's explained later so try to stick with it. M for bad stuff

On the one hand, taking one of the (mostly) normal humans who can hold her own against beings who are practically gods and turning her into a supernatural powerhouse seems like a betrayal of her character.
