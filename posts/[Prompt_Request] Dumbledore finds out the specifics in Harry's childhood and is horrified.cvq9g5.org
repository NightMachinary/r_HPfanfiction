** "They let you outside!?" Dumbledore asked, horrified.\\
"My dear boy, I'm so sorry to have let them put you in such terrible danger. I'll speak to your family and ensure they know that the only place you are protected by your mother's sacrifice is within their home."

*** I think he didn't really want to know.

Certainly he would have preferred that Harry remained "safe" with his relatives. So he avoided visiting and/or checking on him. In a way I think Dumbledore preferred a certain "misdemeanor" of neglecting to check up on Harry rather than a possible "felony" of exposing a child to abusers.

A plea-bargain of conscience, if you will.

**** Of course he knew about the cupboard under the stairs. Harry had his first letter from Hogwarts addressed as such.

Mr H Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey

And after he moved into Dudley's second bedroom he received letters as thus.

******* The adress is on the envelope and the signature on the letter inside, right? So McGonagall made a copy of the standard admission letter, filled in Harry's name, signed it, put it in an envelope, let the magical adressing quill do the job of writing the adress and put it on the stack of outgoing letters. She probably didn't see the adress before moving on to the next letter.

  "The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world." Some would say that Hogwarts is the wrong place for Umino Iruka, and he's about to find out. With new students, he hopes to light the Will of Fire in this new world while new dangers lurk in the darkness. No overpowered ninjas running roughshod over the Potterverse in this fic!

Crossover with My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, with spoilers through season 4 of that show. Dudley's treatment of Harry is amplified, and eventually a particularly nasty beating sends Harry running into the forest and through a portal to Equestria; Harry stays there with Twilight Sparkle until his Hogwarts letter arrives, and he chooses to attend Hogwarts alongside the Cutie Mark Crusaders while Twilight and company try to arrange first contact with the British government. Dumbledore is quite disturbed to realize that not only did he miscalibrate the charms informing him of Harry's wellbeing, his wards to prevent Death Eaters from kidnapping Harry ended up accidentally preventing anyone from reporting the Dursleys to try and save Harry from them.
