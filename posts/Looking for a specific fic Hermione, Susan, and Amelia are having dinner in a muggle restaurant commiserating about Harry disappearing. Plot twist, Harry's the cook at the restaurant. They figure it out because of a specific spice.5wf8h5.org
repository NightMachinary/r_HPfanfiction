I'm also looking for any fic which features Harry enjoying cooking as a prominent character trait. There was one wherein he became like a wine connoisseur, things like that.

I guess fics showcasing life on a personal level. Other major genres/tropes (romance, Exploration of Magic, The Universe, and Everything, massive combat, etc) are non-specific - anything goes.


** Not exactly the requested fic but a similar premise. linkfnn(6471922)

I wonder how many other fics have a similar outing of Harry.

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?

** I vaguely remember this one but not the title. Pretty sure he was using elf wine and/or magical herbs. The reason he fled was not wanting to be involved in any more conflict?

The fics start to blur together but I am looking for it now too.
