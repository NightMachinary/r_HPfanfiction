fics similar linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9453669/2/Harry-Potter-and-the-Two-Flowers]]) and linkffn(His Angel)

basically any where harry is either being trained or is training himself. i dont want him to be OP enough to oneshot tom and dumbledore but he should be stronger than an average adult

I quite enjoyed this one, but it's femharry so it may or may not be your thing. She does get pretty damn powerful, and at one point beats Dumbledore (with effort) but the things she has to fight (including Voldemort) are also pretty OP so YMMV.

  I took a flying leap through the Veil of Death. Gonna' be honest, not the smartest thing I've ever done. OOC, fem!Harry, dark!Harry. Elemental and Black Magics. Femslash. Rated M for language, violence, and mature topics.
