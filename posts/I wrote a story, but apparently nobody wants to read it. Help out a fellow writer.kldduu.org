** It's not bad, definitely not for a first attempt at writing.

But it also doesnt suck me in. Sentences are generally very long, with asides, semicolons and other stuff. I'm not saying you cant ever use long sentences but if you switch between shorter and longer sentences it becomes easier to read.

When looking at the sentence length, I noticed some sentences like "Voldemort said, telling his wand evilly". I am not sure if this is how it is done usually in English but it looks weird.

Also begging for views, follows and favorites turns me off of yt videos. It does the same here. If I want to read more I'll follow without you begging for it, of I don't, no amount of begging will change that.

One sentence to the trend of "I'm still learning and would love reviews to tell me how you think I'm doing" would be enough. As for favorites, its not a popularity contest. Favorites are compliments, but they are rarely handed out.
