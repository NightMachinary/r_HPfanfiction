*** What if that spell turns the target 'yellow,' as in makes him a coward? It has no effect on Peter because, you know, can't Summon something that's already in your hand.

** Fiendfyre (or however you spell it) I don't think there's a counter, can cause unbelievable damage, and would serve as as excellent distraction to sneak Avada Kedavra in behind it.

** Avada Kedavra would be my signature spell in almost all fights. Besides that, Sectusempra and Fiendyfire. If I am a Parselmouth, I'd transfigure pieces of the enemy's clothing into snakes and order them to bite. Also, most of my battle repertoire would be Transfiguration and Conjuration based, with a dash of Charms.

I'd also spam Apparition across the battlefield.

** Anti-apparition jinx. Can't have my opponent escaping. After that, my trademark beam of gamma rays I created by modifying Lumos, changing it to a concentrated beam and increasing the frequency. It's invisible and goes straight through most materials and hits my target, the guy behind my target and the geiger counter three miles behind that.
