"I made a rose bush grow in my uncles arms. He was choking me for not finishing the garden." The second sentence delivered with a hand wave, tone flippant. The spoon was still gently stirring his cup of tea as both hands drummed a beat into the kitchen table, "The wounds healed up and he can still use his arms. They're just covered in marks from where they had to pull out the roots."

He smirked,

"Also, I set Aunt Petunia's head ablaze after she cut my hair. She was fine obviously, bald for a while but no damage to her head or scalp." He stopped the spoon with his hand. As soon as his forefinger and thumb pinched closed around the silver the liquid within the teacup went still. Not a ripple present, even as the spoon was dragged from within it and placed on the saucer, "Granted. I didn't want to hurt her. Just embarrass her."

He frowned now, "Though. I do feel bad." He shrugged through his pout, "My hair grew back as soon as I wanted it to. So it was a massive overreaction in hindsight..."

The childs boundless enthusiasm only returned after his long sip (and a few nibbles of his scone),

"Need to know anything else? If you do, let me know." He blinked, a thought bursting to life of on his face, "Are there magical SAT'S? I didn't do SUPER well on mine, but I'm sure I'll do better in a test of magic. I do it all the time after all!"

He giggled, spinning into a tale of how he'd accidentally appeared on the roof of his school after being chased by bullies. Chuckling away as he transitioned into another about how he'd changed the colour of a teachers wig.

"Oh, I can do all these incredible things NOW! But to realise I'm uneducated and I can learn so much more? INCREDIBLE!" Glee. Pure, unreserved and utterly manic glee; the light in his bottle-green eyes as if two green stars had been plucked out of the sky and jammed into his skull. Toothy grin and an almost innocent air of wonder and genuine curiosity.

That boy seemingly unaware of the terror present in the adult across the table...

《▪︎》

In which a Professor goes to meet young Harry Potter and has an encounter eerily similar to Professor Dumbledore's all those years ago...


** that would be an awesome read. as long as it does not end up with him being paired with tom/voldemort like so many other stories like this.

** This is quite creepy! I wonder how Dumbledore would react to a second Riddle...

Only mild pick is that SAT's aren't a thing in the U.K.

**** The Key Stage 1/2/3 exams? I think some schools refer to them as SATs actually, you're right - but technically and officially they are Key Stage National Curriculum exams, and it's just that the Standards and Testing Agency runs them. Most teachers I know refer to them correctly as Key Stage exams.

**** They're called [[https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum][key stage national tests]]. As I said in my other comment, they're not actually called SATs.

****** Nobody I know calls them SATs, so I think this is very regional! Hence my comment.

However, worth noting key stage 1 tests (ie 6-7 year olds) only rolled out in 1991, and key stage 2 tests (ie 10-11 year old) came in afterwards, only fully rolled out in 1995. So it's also anachronistic for Harry to have sat them.

******* I don't get why you're bringing these up. Harry started Hogwarts in 1991, so he sat the SATs, NOT the Key Stages.

******** National assessments were introduced in 1991 for 6 year olds, and later for 10 year olds. Harry would have sat no standardised assessments.
