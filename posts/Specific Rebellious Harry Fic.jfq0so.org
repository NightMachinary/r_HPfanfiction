:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a specific fic where Harry is rebelling and all I can remember is a scene in the Headmaster's office where Sirius and Hermione's parents are invited by Dumbledore to talk about their behavior at school. After the conversation Sirius brushes it off with Harry basically wagging his finger at Harry to not do it again. And Hermione's parents disassemble Dumbledore turning it around against him and a detail about her parents are they consider themselves hippies with the only thing their serious about is teeth. With Hermione telling Harry that her obsessive rule following is a understandable reaction to growing up with them.

Any help is appreciated


** I have read this fic, I believe, but don't think I can find it in any reasonable amount of time, but here's a bit more detail from the fic I recall. Dumbledore is trying to get rebellious Harry back under his control, and he thinks that telling Sirius and the Grangers that the two are sleeping together will get them to separate the two. But they already know, so the surprise is ruined. Tonks is involved somehow in the flow of information here.

I checked this other story but it was not what you wanted; however, while you look for what you have requested, I bet you would enjoy this: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11101063/1/Hermione-s-Brilliant-Idea]])

*** I can't remember if the details your talking about are right or not but your right that other story is not the one I'm looking for but it is still a good read.

  A fourth year fic. Harry is stuck in something he doesn't want to be in, Dumbledore's a manipulative bastard, Voldemort wants Harry dead, the school hates him...sounds like every year right? Well this year Hermione has a brilliant idea (or more than one) and her idea(s) change Harry's life, her life, and a big black dog's life too. AU and no idea which genre to put this under.
