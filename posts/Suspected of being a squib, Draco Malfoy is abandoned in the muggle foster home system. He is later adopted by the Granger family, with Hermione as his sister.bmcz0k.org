Of course, it turns out that Draco is magical; he was just a late bloomer. How would things change, when Draco Granger goes to Hogwarts? What if the Malfoys don't have any more children, or what if they did?


** I would assume, given the whole pureblood heritage thing, that the Malfoys would immediately have had another heir. Even if they discovered squibness (not a word but I'm using it anyway) super early, and then chucked him out and made a new kid ASAP, said child would be a couple years behind.

I also would not expect him to retain the Malfoy name. Draco, perhaps, but more than likely would become Draco Granger. Whether he would ever learn about his ancestry would be unclear. Certainly the Malfoys wouldn't strive for that, but if he ended up being magical afterall, perhaps they would try to reclaim him simply because he would be the eldest heir.

Really depends how deep you want to get into the canon vs fanon territory on all the pureblood views and Ancient House nonsense.

*** I don't think they would try to reclaim him at first. Admitting he is their son would mean admitting they thought they had a Squib and that they abandonned him, the social backlash may be too important for them to even try. His close relationship with a mudblood would also make him a bloodtraitor. But the situation may change later.\\
Depending of his age when abandonned, Draco may go to a different house or not (considering how Hermione turned up, his childhoos seemed focused on books and study so Ravenclaw, but he may also know that Hermione wanted to go to Gryffindor so ask the hat for it, and finally he may have turned ambitious or cuning because of the previous abandonment and still end up in Slytherin).\\
If the Malfoy learn that their supposed Squib is not only a Slytherin, but strive in it because he has the quality of it and not a spoiled brat like Canon Malfoy (probably Malfoy 2) are, they may at that time try to reclaim it.\\
Also, Harry refused Slytherin because what Ron and Hagrid told him, but mainly because he really didn't like Malfoy and didn't want to go in the same house as him, as for Hermione, if she is as canon she may fear the social isolation and beg for Slytherin just to not loose her brother/ only friend. So depending of the story these 2 may also go to Slytherin (and a Draco trying to protect himself and his sister in Slytherin would be a good situation for him to grow for powerfull and so desirable for Malfoy seniors).

** Draco would be sorted first, alphabetically, so if he goes to Slytherin, Hermione might want to follow her brother. Unless they discussed this beforehand and both asked for Gryffindor.

Or the Grangers took pity on him when they adopted him and gave him a normal name, to go with a normal name like Hermione.

** I can't see it happening. The Malfoys are terrible, prejudiced people, but they're loving parents. If they managed to get their head around their baby boy being sub-human, they might isolate him and eventually set him up with an ally's squib relative. They wouldn't cast their child into the teeming muggle masses, entirely at the mercy of those they don't even consider people.

If that did happen, I guess Draco would internalise some of his feelings about being born to a magical world and being cast out as unworthy by his parents, if only because he can't tell anyone about it (either literally or because they wouldn't believe him). I don't think he'd automatically get much psychiatric help in this era.

I... can't think of any reason Hermione's parents would choose to adopt someone like Draco. He wouldn't be a baby, the only age most parents want to adopt. He is their daughter's age which probably requires constant explanation about not being twins, constantly reminding Draco that he's adopted. It also means they don't have the reassurance of the more stable (and more loved) original child being older and stronger, raising the chance of sibling conflict.

It's not particularly likely that Draco would even meet Hermione. The wealth gap would mean they were unlikely to meet at all unless they happened to live close enough that they went to primary school together. Even then, being different genders and Hermione being much smarter and bossy, I can't see Draco willingly interacting with her.

I guess one or both of the Granger parent might be a squib and the whole thing set up as private fostering? Draco and Hermione woud be very psychologically different from the initial scenario, but the set-up coming into Hogwarts would be similar.

*** When Draco joined the family, he would be sad and angry with the world, his parents and himself. I suspect he'd try to assert the superiority of his parentage of Hermione's, because he is used to being at the top of the pecking order. Hermione would be confused, but unimpressed. I suppose this would lead to Hermione's parents educating him and Hermione on how they see the Wizarding World and its intersection with the muggle world.

Hermione, as an only child, would certainly be resentful of someone sharing the attention, resources and space that was previously hers alone. She wouldn't intuitively get why Draco was upset a lot (and probably snapping or dismissive).

If they were young, they'd probably eventually get used to the status quo and forget it. However, that removes most of the point of having this AU rather than one where Draco Malfoy died as a kid, so I'm going to say they're both around seven.

Hermione has a lot invested in being a good girl, so she would limit her hostility to socially acceptable channels and "mistakes". She would constantly inform him that he was breaking rules, as she considered this hepful behaviour in early canon. This would probably lead to her parents sitting her down and explaining that it was their job to enforce the rules.

... Unless the Granger parents are neglectful and Draco and Hermione just cling to each other for four years? ... I'll stick with them being acceptable parents for now.

The name "Draco" would seem like a recipe for bullying to muggle parents. Also easy for Malfoy enemies to find. So I guess they'd rename him David or something.

Hermione and Draco are both pretty competitive and being the same age means that all their achievements are immediately directly comparable. I suspect they'd compete endlessly over schoolwork and extra-curricula awards, while quietly picking up hobbies the other can't/ won't compare at.

**** While in canon Hermione admires the people who have come out of Gryffindor, I suspect she gets in because she wants to be brave enough to deal with her social isolation and this new world. With a sibling around and her bossiness watered down, the first wouldn't be apparent and the second would depend on the spin her parents put on the Wizarding World. She could easily go in any house.

So could David.

Much of canon Harry Potter's initial take on the Wizarding World is based on the antagonism of Draco Malfoy. Without him, does he even know pureblood ideology exists? Without a Malfoy, Hermione is almost certainly higher class than any of the Slytherins and probably so is Harry.

***** Without Draco seeking to befriend Harry Potter, maybe there would be room for some other observant people to slip in and introduce themselves to him and Ron, setting up friendships in other houses for later.

The toad incident on the train would go down similarly, with David tagging along to find the toad unless he split off in an attempt to find the it first. I expect Hermione, Neville and David would still come back to the Harry and Ron's apartment for the rest of the train ride, as it has space for them and is occupied by age mates they have talked to. Hermione is probably a bit less intense with a brother to divert her attention, so maybe gives a better first impression?

I guess the lake crossing is similar.

Then comes the Sorting. Given the Wizarding World's usual attitude to privacy and muggle conventions, I guess they call out "Draco Malfoy" rather than "David Granger", unleashing a torrent of curiosity from his pureblood classmates.

... I wonder if the Narcissa and Lucius would be informed that David wasn't a squib by this point. I'd expect them to be informed and trying to reconcile. Which means that David's feelings about that would govern his reaction to being seen as Draco.

** Isn't it Draco-is-not-exactly-the-same-as-he-was-in-books foundation of half of Dramione stories (other half being remorseful-Draco-comes-to-Hermione-after-the-war)? I don't read them generally, but linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao) has sounds of it: teenage Draco is thrown from his family, taken under the wings of Snape (even gets his family name), Lucius immediately kills Narcissa and marries Pansy Parkinson to get a new heir asap. And this one particularly doesn't end with neither Dramione or Drarry (it is a fem!Harry story), but the logic is the same, I guess.

***** *Westermarck effect*

The Westermarck effect, or reverse sexual imprinting, is a hypothetical psychological effect through which people who live in close domestic proximity during the first few years of their lives become desensitized to sexual attraction. This phenomenon was first hypothesized by Finnish anthropologist Edvard Westermarck in his book The History of Human Marriage (1891) as one explanation for the incest taboo. Observations interpreted as evidence for the Westermarck effect have since been made in many places and cultures, including in the Israeli kibbutz system, and the Chinese Shim-pua marriage customs, as well as in biologically-related families.

In the case of the Israeli kibbutzim (collective farms), children were reared somewhat communally in peer groups, based on age, not biological relation.
