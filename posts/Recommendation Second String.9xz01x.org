Wanted to post a recommendation on a fan fiction I've fallen in love with. It's an AU time-travel with Harry Potter stuck in the past.

Summary: Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

Eventual Gideon Prewett/Harry Potter. (Not everyone's cup of tea, so just ignore if this gets under your skin in any way)

Eider_Downs (the authors) been very good and consistent about posting updates weekly... it's still ongoing

Give it a shot and let me know if you have any similar fanfics to share!

** I also like this one and have rec'd it a few times recently on here. It's wobbly in the first several chapters and somewhat too angsty early on for my taste, but I think that's over with pretty quickly. The world-building and interesting plotting made me get over those issues (it's also the author's first fic, so there's that).

Plus I really like the relationship between the Dumbledore brothers. It seems at first as if Dumbledore is a manipulative guy, but then the author started showing issues with that in the more recent chapters.

Curious if anyone has anything to rec that's similar to this. The closest I can think of is /Wind Shear/ linkffn(12511998), but that's only because Harry goes back to the 1970s, it's well-written, and the story doesn't exactly have the typical sorts of Marauders'-Era plotlines. Other than that (and it's hardly much of a connection), I can't think of anything.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** I've read both your suggestions and would also recommend. In that spirit, I'm giving a rec of my now for anyone interested.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9969014/1/Seasons-of-change][Seasons of change]]: A kinder Harry makes a difference. Not time travel or anything, Harry just tries to be a kinder person. Avoids bashing.
