1. Ronald Weasley is the Gamer
2. Gregory Goyle is the Gamer
3. The progression and characters of Harry Potter are presented as someone having played an RPG
4. A world where everyone is made meme-ish and stupid, aside from Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Voldemort, and Neville.
5. Everyone loses all spells except one of their choice.


** 5, i feel like it would make the character more creative in there uses of magic, even if it's just the one spell.

** 1. Only, it's told from a more traditional perspective and they're trying to figure out what the fuck is going on and how thug face #2 became their toughest opponent.

** All of the above, and the "spells of choice" are utterly ridiculous

*** Are you saying they're all bad or all good? And is the spells of choice one an exception?

**** I think 1 & 2 should only be used for crack fics. So I'm saying : combine all of these options, and make sure to make each character's "spell of choice" be completely ridiculous (like all Voldemort can do is shoot Rhubarb popsicles at people, all Grindelwald can do is summon fur coats, all Neville can do is wingardium leviosa, and all Dumbledore can do is summon tons of basketball-size muggle hard candies and use Fawks to drop the candy on opponents.) Instant gold crack fic.

***** I can see more comedic potential in actual spells. Maybe it's random, and Voldemort gets Lumos, Ginny gets the Killing Curse, and Ron gets the spider-launching hex.
