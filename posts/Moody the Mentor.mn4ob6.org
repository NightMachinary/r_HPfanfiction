So im reading Innocent by MarauderLover7 for the first time, and the point of view changes every so often. Some of the chapters are from the view point of Tonks as she starts with the Aurors, working under Moody.

Anyways, its got me thinking, does anyone know of some good Moody and Tonks as Auror fics? Im really really enjoying these chapters and want to know what else is out there!

Thanks in advance! üòç
