:END:
I was feeling oddly pensive before, thinking about analog television and the last broadcasts before it switched off in various countries.

So...here's a prompt! Write about the last thing ever transmitted on the WWN's frequency!\\
Is it a formal transition to a new kind of communications magic?\\
An announced change in frequency to avoid muggle detection?\\
An acquisition by the goblins results in it being rebranded as Goblin Radio (or by the centaurs, to make Astral Network)?\\
Is it a warning and instructions on how to evacuate Britain?\\
A wizarding pop music soundtrack that loops until the charms wear out?

** This is Auror Harry Potter. I regret to inform you that both our Ministry of Magic, and the ICW have fallen, with the dark shadow of the global empire rising to take their place.

This message is a warning and a reminder for any surviving wizards. Trust in your magic.

Do not return to Hogwarts, that time has passed, and our future is uncertain.

We will each be challenged; our trust, our faith, our friendships.

But we must persevere, and in time a new hope will emerge. May your magic be with you, always.

sorry

*** Mm, sounds like a traditional set-up for 'Harry goes back in time to defeat Voldemort and X Dark Wizard sooner before things can go wrong'.

** "I'm speaking from the roof of the WWN Building, Hogsmeade Village, Britain. The bells you hear are ringing to warn the people to evacuate the area and try to get behind Hogwarts wards as the Dementors approach. Estimated in last two hours, thousands of witches and wizards have moved out along the roads to the south not believing Hogwarts safe from them after 1993. Brooms stay grounded, Floo Networks are down, Portkeys can't find destinations and Apparition is splinching everyone with a one hundred percent fatality rate.. magic has failed us.. All communication with Diagon Alley closed ten minutes ago. No more defenses. Our armies wiped out... Aurors, Death Eaters, everything wiped out. This may be the last broadcast. We'll stay here to the end... People are holding service below us... in the cathedral."

"Streets are all jammed. Noise in crowds like New Year's Eve in city. Wait a minute... They're now in sight on the other side of the lake. Five -- five hundred.. First one is crossing lake. I can see it from here, gliding above the lake... A bulletin's handed me... Previously undiscovered Dementor Nests all over the world have burst open . One outside Nurmengard, one in Adams, Massachusetts... seem to be timed and spaced..."

"Now the first one reaches the shore. It stands watching, Its cowled head looking over the Village. It waits for the others.. Now they're lifting their grey, rotting hands. This is the end now. Fog has started to drift over... dark fog, drifting over the village. People in the streets see it now. They're running towards Hogwarts... hundreds of them, dropping like a muggle puppet with cut strings. It's acting like a Kiss.. Now the fog's spreading faster, growing darker, like it's getting more powerful.. People trying to run away from it, but it's no use. They're falling like flies. The fog's crossing... one hundred yards away ... it's fifty feet.. it's.."

The sound of a body hitting the ground was the last thing anyone heard from the Wireless. All hope was lost.

(Blatantly stole this from the War of the Worlds radio play, almost word for word. it's an idea I've had in my head ever since I read that Voldemort gave almost free reign to the dementors, way back when ootp came out, and thought it a stupid idea to do so.)

*** Something tells me that dementors won't be felled by microbial infection, though. I wonder if anyone's written a story about a dementor epidemic/pandemic (as in dementors multiplying and swarming everywhere, not a disease that dementors have)? How would the muggles handle it?

** "The worst has come to pass.

Despite the sacrifices of our citizens and the might of our armed forces, Wizarding Britain has been forced to surrender to her enemy.

Thought they may occupy our borders, our streets and our homes.... the enemy will never occupy our SPIRIT.

That is why all wizards and witches are now called upon to ACT.... to preserve the memory of our world clear and bright.... untarnished and uncompromised.

Know that I have already TAKEN ACTION in the company of family and loved ones. Now ALL magicals-every man, woman, and child-are called upon to ACT before the moment passes by.

Let our united resolve echo through history: Even in defeat, we refuse to yield.

Even in defeat we claim [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c66w6fVqOI&t=6s][VICTORY]].
