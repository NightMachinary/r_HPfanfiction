** Clarify something for me; does 'Honks' refer to a Harry/Tonks pairing?

[[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b9/7c/24/b97c242cb742ad140eadadaf18adfb57.jpg][Or does it refer to Tonks with the bill of a duck/goose/whatever?]] ~honk honk~

There really aren't that many Honks fics, and the ones that are either develop into a harem or are just badly written.

Ok this second one is less than 100k words, but it's completed and all around one of the best stories of fandom imo.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

  To avoid the unjust prosecution of his friends in the days following the end of the war, Harry Potter signed a magical contract in blood.

** you could try to look up chelseyb's (or more recently cb-hp-writer) two long fics, but she wiped her ffn account a few months back

One was essentially canon rehash but with tonks along side him, and another was an abandoned 6th year fic. both were 100+ I think
