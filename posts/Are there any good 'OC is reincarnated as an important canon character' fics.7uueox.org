Preferably without pairings and the OC should change the canon significally. The OC can also suddenly wake up in the body of the canon character when they are older and then the other characters notice the change in them.


** Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance is the first that comes to mind. It a about Salazar Slytherin being reincarnated and Hermione, and the gradual restoration of Slytherin house. Would definitely recommend it - so far year 3 just finished, and the author is still working on it (although hasn't been updated for a few months).

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.
