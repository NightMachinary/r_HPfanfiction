A long time ago (I believe somewhere between 2010 and 2012) I read a really good fic. My most vivid memory of the fic is that Harry and Ginny bonded and part of that bonding meant their hands became video phones they could use to talk to each other? And they used it to play quidditch amongst other things? Does anyone else remember this fic or even better the name?

I feel like it might have been downloadable as a PDF as well...

** One where later harry joined hermoine's and Neville's hand the same way? In which voldemort hidden inside the ring and harry and hermoine has to enter the ring? In which snape or death eaters were emotionally cleansed and in order to ensure snape's sanity dead dumbledore asked harry to do legilimeny with snape and snape goes through emotions , feelings ? If that was the fic you are asking about then i had also read it in 2011 think. It was downloadable as pdf . Aor sorry i also forgot the name. Will try to find it if we are thinking about the same fiction?

*** Okay so a comment further up led me to find the fic we're on about, it was called Harry Potter and the Ring of Reduction. It's actually a sequel, and also has a sequel, so now I've got about 1.1 million words to get through, HOORAY!!!

*** Oh my God I'd forgotten about those things until you mentioned it just now xD This is definitely the right one, although I'm worried that we'll never find it. I've been looking but so far to no avail.
