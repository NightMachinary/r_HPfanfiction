** Linkffn(Timely errors) is a fun read. Method of travel means Harry's not permanently stuck in the past.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11418163/1/Time-Flies-Backwards-renewed][Time Flies Backwards (renewed)]] by Necesisstas is a good one. The prologue is about the Black Brothers though, the chapter right afterwards is all about Harry.

linkffn(11418163)

The story is actually the rewritten version of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7684032/1/Time-Flies-Backwards][Time Flies Backwards]] if you want to read that version. It might have less quality in the writing then the renewed version though.

  Harry Potter is a confused young man stuck in a place he shouldn't be. In a time he wasn't born yet. But this is Harry Potter and who is surprised, really? Set after DH. T because of language.

A-4 year Harry accidentally timed traveled to the Marauders era without even knowing it. I am really sad that it has not updated in awhile.
