** I'd have to think harder to find an absolute favorite, but I definitely liked what they did to Umbitch in Faery Heroes.

*** I might be thinking of the same story, but I remember a scene in a lunar harmony time travel fixit where a death eater who escaped justice was found to have captive muggles in his basement dungeon, so after they robbed him blind they transfigured his blood into mud.

** So I actually think canon did an ok job of having the more ambiguous characters reap what they sow.

The Malfoys were horrible people but directly opposed Voldemort at the end. And while you could argue that they got off easy in the end, they definitely suffered while under Voldemort's rule.

Snape may have been a hero, but he was unquestionably a shitty person (being a 13 year olds worst fear as his teacher is not ok). And he died after being caught in too deep. Without a weird dominance battle over the Elder Wand, he probably could've survived the war. But he didn't, and he died finally fulfilling his duty by giving Harry the information he needed to end things once and for all. Is he a tragic character? Yes. Did he deserve to die? Probably not.

Dumbledore gets bashed a lot in fanfiction. While it's not fully deserved, it definitely isn't completely baseless. A lot of things don't add up over the course of the series, and even more leave you scratching your head if you try and analyze them. But, I think Dumbledore tried his best and shouldn't be faulted for that. Was he manipulative? Probably. Could he have done better? Also probably. But he ended up caught in a trap that seemed tailor made to catch him and had to use his own death to further whatever plans he had for winning the war.

Because of this, my favorite comeuppance is the "rant" from linkffn(Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia). This fic is... interesting, it's not great but it's not bad either. The reason I like Harry's rant in it though, is that it checks a lot of the boxes against canon Dumbledore without becoming a bash-fest where manipulative!Dumbles is the square root of all evil. It comes close with some of the stuff about the Dursleys and the nature of the Elder Wand, but doesn't quite cross the line. Anyway, Harry basically just questions and laughs at how silly Dumbledore's plan is. Believing that the Dursleys would properly care for Harry, using untested blood wards, completely trusting in a vague prophecy, relying solely on Harry to find all the horcruxes and then defeat Voldemort, and assuming that all Death Eaters will repent and become nice/productive members of society. It's just an over the top critique on why the canon "plan" is stupid.

  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).
