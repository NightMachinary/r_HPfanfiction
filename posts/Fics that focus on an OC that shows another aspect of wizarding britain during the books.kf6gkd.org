Such as life under voldemort, or criminals in knockturn alley under fudge


** What I would like to see is an OC student in Hogwarts during an ordinary time where the focus is on the magical education itself, not on the adventures they're having in the school.

In canon, we only know some of the spells the students are learning, and the subjects in the school and the grades they get in OWLS and NEWTS but I'm curious to know what the usual graduate of Hogwarts, who didn't have any interruptions in their education would be like.

  The story of a Muggle-born criminal, a Pureblood supremacist, and an ex-Auror on the run during in the Third Wizarding War. Expect a lot of violence and some swearing. Mostly canon compliant.

  Each one has his own perspective, but in passing, they entwine.-- In a world with Voldemort, Harry's fight is only one part of the story: A glimpse into life at the eve of revolution. Set during DH, broadly Canon-compliant. Twoshot.

#+begin_quote
  Bellona de Poitiers begins her time at Hogwarts as an interloper for her French accent, for her Veela's blood, for the absence of her father.Hogwarts is not the haven she expected, though, and she quickly discovers that Slytherin is no true home to any interloper. With fewer friends than enemies, she does her best to keep her head down and muddle through safely.Then, just as she's about to return for third year, her father escapes from prison, and everything goes to hell.
