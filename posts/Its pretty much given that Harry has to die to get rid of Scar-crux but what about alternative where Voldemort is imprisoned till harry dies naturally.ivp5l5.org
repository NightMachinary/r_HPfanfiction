** It is a bit strange though, isn't it? You'd imagine a society that routinely deals with ghosts and other types of specters would surely develop ways to contain them, or bind them into a specific object.

I suppose you could argue that such techniques may fall into Necromancy or Soul Magic, and thus be heavily restricted if not outright illegal, but with the kind of contacts and experience Dumbledore has, I doubt he would have had much difficulty finding such options.

***** Yeah, like Horcruxes should be this mysterious ancient magic that is really obscure. So research should be virtually nonexistent. So if the wraith resulting from the Horcruxes are more powerful or able to corrupt the wards or whatever magic you use to contain the wraith, then it would obviously be much more better to get rid of the spirit now, rather than it breaking out and attacking unsuspecting people later down the line.

*** Nay - the blood protections around the Dursley's faded the moment Harry turned 17/when he no longer considered it home. The blood protection on Harry survived at least till the end of book 7 - it was part of the reason he survived another AK to the face. It's rather unclear whether it remained active after Voldemort's death.

  AU. Harry was born with a power the Dark Lord knows not: the magic to see into shadows, to walk the shadows, and to send the shadows everywhere. This changes his life rather dramatically.

** Harry won't have died naturally, as the prophecy stated: "and either must Die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives...."

As for the second alternative, Harry doesn't need to be alive to support the hocrux in the scar. The other hocruxes (except of Nagini) were all non living. Now before you say that isn't a reasonable explanation as the hocrux in Nagini died when she died, I would like to remind you that Nagini died by being struck by Griffindor's Sword, which was imbibed with Basilisk Venom. For all we know, Nagini might have died instantly, while the Hocrux was alive till the venom spread to each and every part of the body.

*** Eh, lots of people argue that the prophecy is so vague that it's possible that it doesn't has any real power, just the power to influence others by existing. So Harry may not actually be immortal with Voldemort still alive.

But... if the prophecy actually did had that power, it would actually work as an excuse without plot reasons for the extreme luck in Harry's ability to survive in dangerous situations.

**** I think you are right about the prophecy being vague. However you are wrong about Harry not being immortal.

I think the line "Neither can live while the other survives..." has a philosophical meaning. I think it means that although both will be able to co exist together (until one kills the other), they will not be able to live peacefully. Harry had a bad childhood till he came to Hogwarts, after which his life was in danger ever year. Voldemort had to survive 14 years as a wraith, then hide from Wizarding world for a year, then try and kill Voldemort and try to identify what Harry and friends were doing and stop them from destroying his hocruxes in the last year.

***** A major part of people is that they always change. So while I agree that the idea of Harry coexisting with Voldemort is unlikely, it is still possible that they might, however slim that chance may be.

However, please note that I said that 'lots of people' not specifically me. So I stated that it "may" be possible that the prophecy might not have any real power. Cause it was not stated clearly explained in canon, I cannot give a definite answer.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
