I've read Learning To Live Again and I liked it, any recommendations on something similar?


** Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]]? It's also post-Hogwarts and I liked how the author pieced together Harry and Ginny's family life. The story is good too.

** Reign o'er me I think the title is. It was the first soul bond fiction I think. Pretty well done. Very long though. Have no read it in years.

*** If you're looking for H/G Soul Bond fics, [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][Meaning Of One]] is by far the best. I tried Reign O'er Me, but just dropped out after like 10 chapters. The writing was lackluster and the story just felt boring.

*** It's still not done. I think it's updating like one chapter a year or something.

** This Means War is my favourite Harry/Ginny fic, but it's a little silly.\\
And when I say a little, I mean a lot.\\
^{like, a hell of a lot.}

It is really good though. Very well written. It has overtones of super!Harry but it's well used.

** I just read one called Cat and Mouse. It's about what happens when Harry and Ginny meet two years after breaking up. Good story.

** The Hogs Head by MyGinevra was the one that took my fanfic virginity. An 8th year fic with Ginny still in school and Harry starting Auror training.

*** No way this is the first one i read as well. It is very romance focused though.

** I actually just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9537818/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nameless-Man][Harry Potter and the Nameless Man]]. It's a really good AU Auror story. It's completed with 72k words.
