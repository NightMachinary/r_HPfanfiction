I got to thinking earlier, and I wondered if someone had written a fic with a Voldemort/Harry pairing that turns out to be just part of some plan by Dumbledore to kill Voldemort.

Like Harry gets Voldemort to trust him enough to reveal the location of the Horcruxes, Harry gathers them using his status as Voldemort's lover to get Bellatrix to give him the cup, then after a rousing shag Harry takes Voldemort's wand and summons Fiendfyre to destroy everything.

Or there could be one where Voldemort seduces Harry to get Harry to betray and kill his friends, only to then kill Harry himself.

Cause honestly I'm tired of this pairing where they make it seem as though a 60 something year old man missing a large portion of his soul and a moody teenager could ever have a functional romantic relationship.

On an extremely related note. If this is a hint that the whole HP/LV pairing is a clever ruse, I am going to find you and firmly berate you in person.

Also, since you brought it up, I won't feel bad asking you how the next chapter is progressing... How's the next chapter progressing?

**** Harry's half is done. The Diary-Past part is proving to be very difficult to write and I'm having a bit of a block with it that I think the only real solution for is to time skip or the story will wind up taking way longer than I want it to.

It's certainly not a ruse planned by Dumbledore and Harry, like the poster specified. But there's more there than what's going on on the surface. Hence the more limited narration whenever Emily's PoV is shown on screen.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** Could work if you give Harry that Special Ability from the Third-Season of AHS where the girl can kill people by sleeping with them. I could never really see Harry as being willingly gay just to serve a narrative, especially with the man who killed his parents.

*** I've definitely seen a story where Harry purposefully contracts magical aids to pass it along to Voldemort. It was a crack/parody though.

** Not really pairing, since they won't get romantically involved, but if you're okay with parent/child relationship, book 3 of The Dark Prince trilogy has that.

Recommend the first 2 books as well, book one was kinda the reverse, Voldemort using Harry to further his goal, still no romance between them though.
