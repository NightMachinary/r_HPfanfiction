Imagine/Relate one word in a summary that would make you skip a fic or one word in a chapter that would make you instantly nope out. A word so symptomatic of a shitty fic that you just can't even be bothered to read it. Of course, "Core" (magical) is already considered as a mater of fact.

SHEEPLE SHEEPLE SHEEPLE SHEEPLE SHEEPLE SHEEPLE SHEEPLE


** - independent
- manipulative
- "what if"
- "have you ever asked yourself" (or wondered)
- "grey!"
- hpdm
- bashing
- <character> must be a slytherin / show his slytherin side
- "enemies on all sides"

I think these are most I skip.

Edit: "Bad at writing summaries" is also one of them. It means you either can't write simple prose for shit, or you don't actually know what your story is about.

*** "What if" jumps out at me out of this otherwise well-thought-out list. The nature of fanfiction is to ask miscellaneous 'what-if's; sure, it may be clumsy writing of a summary, but unlike the others it doesn't really tell you anything about the fic's /contents/.

**** I just don't remember reading a single good "what if"-fic. Most of them end up having the big flaw that "what if" changes, and the rest stays the same, and even what that wasn't the same it wasn't good.

If you /do/ have a counterexample, I'm willing to change my mind!

***** I'm /writing/ one (although not one with "what if" in the summary). linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor). The "what if" is "what if Hermione was born a Parselmouth too?". The consequence is a story that humility forces me to admit isn't perfect, but one think it /definitely/ does is be as far from a canon rehash as humanly possible past First-Year, wherein only interesting parts are shown anyway. It's a humor/slice-of-life/adventure mix, with no prominent pairings.

(This being as you seem to define "what-if", namely what most of us call single-points-of-departure or Canon Divergence. What I was saying above is that basically any fanfiction can be define in a sentence beginning with "what if" at the end of the day.)

****** I am not talking about single point divergent stories. I am talking about summaries that literally start with "What if".

And I even feel your summary might be stronger if you drop the what-if-y part (and instead spend words on endearing me to your characters and world), but I wouldn't throw your story out yet.

******* Yeah, using "what if" in a summary is very much a case of "knowing when to break the rules", with the rule being "never use What If in a summary."

"What if Hermione is a Parselmouth?" /Why should I care?/

As opposed to

"Hermione is a Parselmouth and it's awesome." /Sweet, let's do this./

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, secrets are uncovered, and loopholes are delightfully abused.

*** "bashing" can be a guilty pleasure, "no bashing", I can understand if the fic is using tropes or premises that are most commonly used in bashing-heavy fics (Harry runs away, H/Hr EWE, etc.)... but "low bashing" is really the weirdest. Makes me think about what would be a "low slash" fic... or better, a "low genderbender" fic... Like a canon-reash but with a Harry who likes to wear skirts or something.

** Mentor!Snape, Severitus, anything similar

Poor grammar in the summary is a great indicator of the content

"pls b nice im only 13" and similar

Clones - if you write a Next-Gen story, /please/ be creative. On that note, here's what we know about the kids:

- Albus has green eyes, a thin face and resembles but is not identical to Harry, so his hair is /not black/ or he has freckles

- Scorpius also only resembles Draco, so change his hair or eye color

- Rose and Lily both have red hair

- Hugo has bushy hair but the color is unknown

- Victoire has blonde hair

- Teddy likes to keep his hair blue

- Nothing about James - he's possibly adopted or he isn't actually Harry's son (I'm kidding... Maybe)

Okay, let someone try to call Voldemort that, and then let him spend a few hours pulling their nervous system out of their body or forcing them to eat their children.

** Plot... I HATE when stories tell their whole plot in the summary. The summary is supposed to hook me, not make me feel like I read the whole bleeding story!

No Flames... Obviously there's something wrong with your story that people would "flame" you about. Clearly, it's not worth my time.

Slash... Not a big fan of most, if not all, slash. Typically I just don't see a point in making a character gay unless it strictly pertains to a plot. Unfortunately, if it pertains to the plot then I'll likely not read it anyways because it likely focusses too much on romance for my tastes.

???... Don't ask rhetorical questions in the summary. Just don't. It's tiresome, boring and doesn't make me want to read your story any more than I would if you didn't have rhetorical questions.

COMPLETE/FINISHED... There is literally a button that you can click to show that a fic is complete. On the flip side, please do write "Abandoned" or "On Hiatus" so that way I can decide whether or not to read your fic.

Time... Don't tell me what time period it is in. Obviously, if it takes place during WWII or something, the date DOES matter to the plot, but otherwise there are categories you can put your story into that tell from which period of the books it is from (Marauder's, founders, post, pre, ect.).

Crossover... DON'T put a crossover into the regular fiction category! If the story, characters, or ideas are not from Harry Potter, they do not belong in the Harry Potter fanfiction tab. Put them in the crossover forums

/-On that note, anything more than one world being crossed over with another is too much. I enjoy crossovers as much as the next guy, but I do have a limit./

!!!... If you've got a bunch of exclamation marks in your summary, but none of them are for a specific sentence, I may read your story, but I'm already wary and ready to click off from the get-go. (For example, Grey! Manifpulative! AU! OOC!, ect.)

Of course, there are a lot more, but I think that the other comments have covered those pretty well.
