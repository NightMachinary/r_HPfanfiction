With Ginny's busy schedule as a Quidditch player and Harry's sizeable inheritance from Sirius and the Potter's, Harry steps down from the Auror Corps to raise their first child.

However, as the years go on Harry becomes increasingly frustrated by a persistent feeling that he is alone in his marriage and parenting, effectively raising their child/children alone as Ginny takes more and more oppurtunities to be out of the house.

After a sizeable row, Harry comes to the startling realisation that, despite how much he loves the people in his life, his circle of trust is very insular and he has no one to really air his grievances and seek advice from in regards to his wife Ginny.

His resolve to open up to more people and expand his circle of trust shakes the foundations of his life...


** Harry meets new people through a hobby he picked up. It was harmless at first thought Ginny. They meet at a store once a week. Harry became more relaxed, but he started spending more and more time on his hobby and with his new friends. And spending money on said hobby. Soon it became an issue when he converted their shed into his own personal workshop and forbid entry into it.

But the proverbial straw that broke the proverbial camels back was when Harry came to breakfast decked out in the most ridiculous outfit carrying his plastic cases full of those strange plastic figures.

"I will defeat the enemies of Mankind. For the glory of the God-Emperor and the Imperium of Man. I'll be late, don't wait up for me."

** I have never liked Ginny as either a character or love interest. I think this would be the beginning of a character-building moment for Harry, as he discovers new people to talk to, who have different ideas about the world and can expand his worldview in a way that Hermione, Ron, and the others never did. Afterwards, he discovers that Ginny is not the woman he thought she was and decides that he wants to take a different path in life. Thus begins a messy divorce, where his old friends condemn him for his actions, as they refuse to see things from his perspective or try to be in any way understanding.

*** Further pushing his point that he couldn't be open about his feelings towards Ginny to them and justifying his decision to make forge new relationships.

*** Yup, I have read a few fics like this, in various forms. There was a fic where Ginny straight up pays an assassin to kill Harry because he caught her cheating, and she couldn't let him "steal" the Potter fortune from her. Luna goes back in time to recruit others (like Daphne Greengrass) to help set Harry on a different path. Sadly, it never went anywhere.

There's also the HP/DxD crossover where Harry, again, finds Ginny cheating on him, so he divorces her, causing the Weasley family to turn on him (mainly just Molly and I think Ron), and then he accepts a job offer as a teacher at a school in Japan, where he runs into the plot of High School DxD. Also his daughter is adorable, and I love that his stance going forward is "father first" when it comes to the romance plot, as in, if the girl doesn't get along with his daughter, then he ain't dating them.

That said, FILFy Teacher (the DxD crossover) is basically the only one I can think of that has any amount of actual story after the breakup, but it doesn't focus on said breakup at all, it's just the impetus to push Harry towards leaving England. The three other fics I can remember reading where the marriage falters were all abandoned at the starting line.

For as much as people hate the pairing, it's incredibly refreshing that they'd just rather it not happen at all, rather than start with it just so they can make Ginny "pay" or otherwise suffer.

***** No, sadly I can't. The author's profile was deleted, and I couldn't find it on the Wayback Machine. If I ever do find it I'll send you a link, though I doubt I will. The spirit is willing, but the Google-fu is weak.
