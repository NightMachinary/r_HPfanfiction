I feel like it'd be something that Draco'd do, and it might even be something that could be headcanon for some ppl. Imagine, discuss.

** wait no, this is actually canon. In the first book when Harry got the snitch with his mouth, Draco started saying that an open-mouthed bullfrog would be replacing Harry. When no one got the joke, it was canonically said that he reverted back to making fun of his lack of parents. I'll try to find the excerpt.

#+begin_quote
  â€˜I do feel so sorry,' said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, â€˜for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home.'

  He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that Slytherin had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he'd realised that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.
#+end_quote

Chapter 12, The Mirror of Erised (yeah... the chapter where he saw his family in the mirror, ouch), Philosopher's Stone.

So it's canon that Draco has a terrible taste at joking, and he's /also/ relentlessly mock Harry for not having a "proper" family (honestly, that's rich coming from an only child with no aunt from her mother side because one of them marry a Muggle-born while the other is a crazed criminal). So, um, why didn't Draco get into a violent "accident"? I know Neville was the biggest pushover, but he's practically an orphan because of Draco's aunt & uncle. Susan's family lost a lot of members, the Aurors were cleared to use the Unforgivables, so we know during the skirmish plenty of people on both sides have died. With everyone being related, how come not a single student, feeling gloomy after the anniversary of their parents/favorite aunt/uncle/grandparents' death during the war, snapped and levitated Draco after his umpteenth "tee hee, orphans, amirite"?

I think if we want a real world analogue of what it would have been like afterwards you'd need comparisons with Rwanda or the like. If one part of a society is violently murdering another part it doesn't end with some fireworks and parties when the head guy dies and everyone goes back to school together and it's fine.

I don't think I've seen people talk too much about the damage that must have done to the culture.

****************** Let's try again with different words and a much longer explanation. What I meant by "There is a universe of difference between saying I want to kill someone physically kill someone" is that Draco speaks, not that he is a serial killer who kills people or actually thinks he is killing someone. He doesn't even think he really wants to kill them or cause someone to die (a striking example of this is everything that happened with Dumbledore). Draco talks and a lot, but it's all smoke and no roast. He never felt cold-blooded about killing someone. It wasn't even a cruel joke to say what he said when the cat was found petrified, but just a very stupid thing. And he may have said it either because he was afraid and hid it behind hatred (people often mask fear with hatred, just to react or conceal it) or to bully. Basically, you and I have a very similar thought about Draco, only that I add the plus of fear to his mix of emotions. But I never thought that Draco was heartless or emotionless, in fact, he is completely the opposite.

****** I'm all for stoning Nazis, but there's some leniency to be given to a child. Like Draco's a kid for most of the books - painting him as an redeemable Nazi /at twelve/ just is wrong to me.

As for his realization in canon, I don't know - I got the impression that he was uncomfortable with what was being asked the more it moved away from just schoolyard posturing. Like, he didn't kill Dumbledore - that had nothing to do with it threatening him or his family personally, in fact killing him would have done the opposite.

What I'd say is more appropriate for Draco is that for a long time, it wasn't /real/ for him - it was all a game, where whatever heinous things his side did didn't really affect him personally and was good. Then, when it /did/ start to actually involve him and affect him, that's when he started at least somewhat pulling away from it.

Which seems fairly appropriate for his age throughout the series, too.

He also took delight in the fact that Harry stayed at Hogwarts for Christmas (in PS) and spent time loudly mentioning how nice it was to have people who wanted him at home every time Harry was near.

And I don't even mention his apparent delight in the "Heir of Slytherin" actions during CoS, or how he talked about Molly Weasley. Draco /may/ have found an heart during the Blood war, but before this he was a complete asshole with no care about how he hurt people.
