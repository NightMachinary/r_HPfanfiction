Harry's PoV would be appreciated. The lack of interest could be anything, from simply being straight up to the fact that both, at some point in their life, supported Pureblood Supremacy/Voldemort.

The end goal is NOT them getting together.


** I cannot imagine Snape hitting on anyone, let alone Harry. The very thought may cause me to have nightmares tonight.

*** Tell that to slash fic authors.

I am in the same boat here, but there are so many Harry/Death Eater pairings that I wanted a parody or subversion of those.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?
