Even better if it develops into romance later, but not suddenly.


** Sacrifices arc series by lightning on wave. Starts first year and goes on. Saving Connor is the first book. Harry is in Slytherin and Draco becomes his best friend. It slowly turns to a romance as they get older. It is the best fan fiction I have ever read. I now ship Drarry because of it.

**** I sure do! [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/]]

Saving Connor is first- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor]]

It really is just amazing! asksubthrowaway is right though when he says they are so so so long, but I'm telling you it's so worth it. Also you have to keep me updated on how you like them!!! I've never had anyone dislike them though. Even my friends who didn't know it was Harry/Draco pairing later, they got so hooked by the first couple books that later they loved them together as friends so much that they actually wanted them together. You are going to love this. I'm so excited for you. I wish I could re-read them and not know what happens.

*** I found it kind of boring. After reading the first book, I know I won't be reading the next ones.

It's well written enough, but Harry acts like a robot (more like a little Terminator, actually) and it just doesn't appeal to me. And the story just didn't grab my attention.

But if you're looking for a well written Drarry, this is definitely the stuff.

**** I can see why you would find it boring, it takes a while to pick up, like the fourth book is when things start getting more adventurous. I liked that Harry was sort of a Robot though, in later books it's Draco that helps him become his own person and get past the abuse of being made into a child solider. I think it made their relationship so much deeper and stronger, because Draco was always able to see past that.

**** Ditto! I've honestly been reading Drarry for like 10 years and never come across it. I'm only in book 2 at the moment but I'm really enjoying it. Not my fave but really well thought out and very realistic to the series.

** Harry/Draco. Draco has found and fixed an 'If Sieve', a magical device which can show alternate realities if people had made different choices. He tries many combinations to see if he could ever have been friends with Harry Potter. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/78806/chapters/104944]]

Harry/Draco. One-shot sequel to the above. Makes the open ending of 'The If Sieve' a little more complete. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/78822]]

Not hugely long at all, but this is easily my all-time favourite Harry/Draco fic.
