I've been looking for copies of the stories of The Order Members Read Deathly Hallows by TwiHard24 and Hogwarts and the Deathly Hallows by CheckersChance2 ever since they got removed on fictionhunt and if anyone has a copy of any of these stories it would be greatly appreciated if you could send it to me :)

*** And what unholy program do i need to download in order to view those files after downloading them? There doesnt seem to be an option to just view the darn thing on the page. Edit: worked it out, dropped the fic first chapter when i realised it was too odd for me.

**** Calibre is my go-to for ebook management, but I think epub can also be opened in some browsers? Mobi is only used for Kindle.

**** If you have an apple device you can open epubs in iBooks (or whatever it's called).
