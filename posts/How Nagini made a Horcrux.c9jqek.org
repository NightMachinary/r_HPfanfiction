I'm doing some background work for a story, and I came upon a conundrum. HP Lexicon (my go-to) states that it is implied that Voldemort used Bertha's death at the beginning of the book to create the Nagini Horcrux, but I don't see how this is possible if he is not corporeal himself until his resurrection at the end of the book. I don't have access to my books at the moment. Is there something I am missing?


** He was corporeal at the beginning of book 4, he was just in his tiny baby form. He kills Frank Bryce himself with an AK. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/1994][The Harry Potter wiki states]] that Bertha Jorkins died a month or two before that. I don't think it's ever explicitly stated when Wormtail started the potion that gave Voldemort his form back, but it was presumably prior to their return to England?

** In addition to the point made by [[/u/bgottfried91]] that Voldemort was able to kill Frank pre-resurrection, there's also another factor you have to consider: it is possible to create a horcrux by ordering a person's death. See: Moaning Myrtle, who was killed by the basilisk on Voldemort's orders - still enough to make the diary horcrux out of her death. So even if it was Wormtail who killed Bertha, Voldemort could probably still use that murder to make a horcrux, as it would have been on his orders.

*** Hadn't even thought about that, thank you.
