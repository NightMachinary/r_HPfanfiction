** Few things I've noticed.

"sounded--almost--disappointed" is awkward to read. "Sounded almost disappointed" works better.

There's a lot of tell vs show and passive voice issues.

For example, you write "his wand had flashed out" instead of "he flashed his wand out".

A lot of stuff seems forced and there are a few changes from canon that I don't think improve your story. Voldemort is frail? Instantly, Voldemort doesn't feel like a powerful villain. He can't kill two kids before the parents can wake up? He can't flick his wand twice to cast killing curses but he has the time to take off his cloak and pick up a baby to disapparate with it? That required a bit of suspension of disbelief. Voldemort (or magic) seems nerfed and I don't think that makes a story better. It reduces the stakes and the wonder of magic. The "Noble House" thing isn't promising either. More times than not, it's a sign of poor writing but I have seen it done well so I do hope you pull it off. Setting it twenty years later can work as long as it isn't an excuse to stick in some song.

The premise is interesting, even if its setup feels forced and requires suspension of disbelief. I'm interested to see where the story goes and I do think there's a lot of promise. The issue with the scar frustrates me as a reader (I'm providing my reaction as a reader; it's not good nor bad).

*** Thanks for the feedback!

About the tell vs show and passive voice: This fic is my first attempt at writing, and I honestly don't expect the first couple of chapters to be any good, so I'm just happy people even bother reading them. I've only had experience writing essays and such to this point, so this is as much an attempt to better my writing as it is to create an enjoyable narrative.

About Voldemort: I'll admit, he was probably one of the parts I thought would come across misunderstood.

I know he comes off as weak or frail, or that magic is weak and frail, but that was definitely not my intention. I don't know how well I can explain this without spoiling the story, but I assure you that Voldemort isn't nerfed in my AU. In fact, his actions (in my head) pointed towards better caution and understanding than he ever showed in canon. He knew that his soul was already very much on the verge of breaking (due to the Horcruxes and his previous evil deeds), and during his later years of terror, decided to remove himself from most encounters, and chose his battles more carefully. He had the support to do so, and for all intents and purposes, it became a proper movement, which further escalated into a civil war. He became more of a strategist than a fighter, and his image as a ruthless killer and Dark Lord had already been established, so there was no need to put himself, or his soul, in more danger. My reasoning was that he only decided to attack Harry because of the Prophecy, thus taking a huge risk with the killing, and didn't want to damage the precious parts of his soul that were still intact with unnecessary killing. So he did everything discreetly, and removed himself from a position where he had to fight anyone quickly, while also taking Harry to finish the job. He took a gamble with his killing curse, which didn't work out for him in the end.

I promise that my intent was never to downplay his threat as a villain, or to make magic less wondrous. It was just my version of Voldemort's rising. After all, Dumbledore rarely fought on the frontlines, right? Even if he never killed.

About the "Noble House" thing. I can also assure that this won't be one of those political fics with bartering or chartering or anything similar. Some characters use this for their benefit, and others do not. But I don't really intend on going to deep into the political rabbit hole that some fics do. It is a part of the story, but a very brief and side one, to that. However, I too hope that I 'pull it off'.

I also don't intend to stick in any existing songs, for that matter. Most would be wizarding-related, anyways. The twenty year change was more because my memory of the 80's is useless.

I'm glad that you think my story has promise (smiling like an idiot rn), and I do feel grateful for the people that take time to write a review out, like yourself.

I do want to ask you about your feelings about the scar, however. You did say it wasn't good or bad, but frustrating. How so? Is it sympathising, or because I did a shoddy job of explaining it? Thanks for any future answers

Cheers, AvydReedr

**** I'm always glad to give feedback. I'm going to provide my thoughts, some of which are disagreements, and my intention behind them is merely to provide my perspective. In no way do I intend to force you to make changes or belittle you for your choices. Merely writing is impressive; I dabble a bit myself and I know that it is far harder than it seems. I write this assuming a canon-compliant magical system, which seems to be what you're going for with your stated intent of expanding the HP universe.

Your intention of making him a strategist instead of a fighter definitely comes across as a nerf. The issue is that removing Voldemort's ability to enter combat is a change from canon. We know from Halfblood Prince "that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact" which means that "it will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes". My first point is that Voldemort's combat capabilities are not diminished by a broken soul.

From your reply, I get the impression that Voldemort's care comes from the need to preserve and protect his soul. I got the impression that his care comes from his physical weakness from the story. You describe his hand as "frail and sinewy" which gave me the impression of physical weakness. You also state that his body is frail, too frail to disapparate. However, we know from OoTP that apparition is reliant on one's mind. The three Ds are all mental and splinching is caused by insufficient determination. We also know that side-along apparition is possible with Harry apparating Hermione and Ron (along with Yaxley). Voldemort was remarkably competent at apparition and I find it unlikely that Voldemort would be unable to apparate two babies. Though again, I do believe that Voldemort could easily have killed the two babies with killing curses. I also think that physical weakness on Voldemort's part would conflict with canon.

You stated that Voldemort has to take care with killing because of his damaged soul from killing. Killing does damage the soul, yes. However, it takes additional effort to remove a fragment and place it into a vessel. Incidentally, Voldemort's creation of an accidental horcrux stems from both his weakened soul and because of his body's destruction from Lily's sacrifice (a unique condition).

Short aside, and I can't believe I missed this in my first comment, the story leaves me with questions about Voldemort's defeat. After all, Lily does not sacrifice herself. My current guess from the story would be magic surrounding prophecies.

In the books, a fragment of Voldemort's soul sought a living vessel. However, I don't think this precludes him from killing other people. Voldemort killed plenty of other people without creating horcruxes. There is also no downside to damaging one's soul via killing (besides the ethical considerations - though I doubt Voldemort cares). If creating a horcrux does not diminish one's capabilities, I find it unlikely that a damaged soul would. Order members, Dumbledore, and Voldemort kill canonically without issues from damaged souls. In short, I don't believe Voldemort has to worry about fighting because there is no real downside to a damaged soul. Voldemort's fighting capabilities (and the fear caused by actively employing them) were a major reason for his successes. Taking Voldemort out as an active fighter would be a nerf. Incidentally, I couldn't find much evidence that Dumbledore rarely fought on the frontlines against Voldemort (Grindewald is a different matter). He fights directly in the ministry battle, turns Snape himself, duels Voldemort in the ministry, and is said to be the only one Voldemort fears. Voldemort and Dumbledore are held up in canon as magical powerhouses. It's a badge of honor to be killed by Voldemort.

With regards to my feelings over the scar, there are two parts. One is a good thing; I'm frustrated along with Harry. The other is that the conflict is frustrating. I've read other stories with a disability and a lot of the time they get frustrating because the main character can't do anything to resolve the conflict. My opinion currently is that the issue of the scar is in a good state right now. That said, if scar pain and Harry's emotional responses continued to crop up throughout the story with ramifications for Harry, I think that it would detract from my enjoyment of the story.

***** I can't thank you enough for the elaboration on your thoughts about the story. While I do agree that most, if not all, of my choices regarding soul magic, Horcruxes, and Voldemort would not coincide with canon, I find that they will make sense in my own universe.

I was a bit wrong when I stated that I would be expanding upon JK's universe. I do intend to do that, but also much more. For example, I would like to introduce or change the way certain magics work, making some, while more powerful, much more volatile as well.

I will begin by addressing the point about Voldemort's magical capabilities. He isn't becoming nerfed (or that wasn't my intention, at least). His change to work in the sidelines is just as much a practical one as it is magical. He has no qualms in fighting, dueling and killing, that much I can assure you. I merely attempted to humanize Voldemort, which does nerf the extent of his actions, as he is more concerned about practicality and his own body. By his logic, the Horcruxes are already the extent of his evil, and he should not push himself further than that, even though magic would allow him to do so.

In my AU, magic intended to harm and heal, and specifically magic regarding powerful forces, such as life and death, have severe consequences. Some more dire than others, but Magic in itself is more volatile and dangerous than in canon.

About the killing of others. Think of this metaphor, or comparison, if you will. You have a full watermelon in front of you. This is your soul as a wizard. Killing someone would be equal to stabbing it with a butter knife. It will cause damage, that much is sure, but it is negligible in terms of everything considered. A Horcrux would be similar to chopping a piece off, (and haphazardly, at that) and inserting it into an object, through a squeezing of the watermelons juice.

Now, the rest of the watermelon is still intact, and very much functional. But when left exposed for a while, the outer layer of flesh gains a darker colour, and it tastes too sweet. This is because it has begun to rotten.

Now, after cutting the watermelon up another five times, and along with hundreds if not thousands of butter knife stabbings, this leaves a very messed up watermelon. This is also taking into account the beatings that the soul received after Voldemort's soul received after dabbling in Dark Magics. You would be careful about stabbing it once more, correct? Therefore, Voldemort realizes the state his soul is in, and acts upon it, choosing to distance himself from further unnecessary harm rather than attempt to heal it. Do keep in mind that Voldemort could still probably duel Dumbledore successfully. His mind (for the most part) and his magic were not very much affected by his actions as his soul was. So I'm not saying he isn't a threat. He very much is. But he is also smart, and realises the best course of his actions with what he has available currently. (in my AU, at least) This involves him decided to risk one more murder, but he doesn't /need/ to kill 3+ more in order to do that, so he doesn't.

Against what we see in canon, Dumbledore is more of a planner than a actor. We see this in other places as well. Newt Scamander remarks that Dumbledore usually never goes out and does things himself, choosing to send other witches and wizards in his place. I'm following on that narrative, which seems to be the case as we are shown in canon, and also implementing it, though not as much, and for different reasons, for pre-story Voldemort. When he comes back, things will be different though.

Dumbledore and Voldemort are still absolute magical powerhouses. But they still have weaknesses, make that magical, mental, ethical or emotional. I'm just changing some of these, and for good reason: so that they adapt to the world I'm trying to write.

Now, about the scar. I'm glad that you felt frustrated along with Harry. That's a big part of the reason I decided to do a pre-travel chapter at all (besides shamefully info-dumping, which I later toned down on). Regarding the other point about the disability. It is mentioned both in the first and second chapter that the Portwoods are looking to deal with it, and they will. I will not state how, because that is spoiling, but it does get addressed. I'm glad you like the current situation. It will stay how it is for a while, though it won't actually be so much of a arguing problem, because the Portwoods will be reaching for a visible goal, but it will still cause conflict, if not between the Portwoods, but with others.

You mentioned scar pain and Harry's emotional responses, but I'm not sure about that. While Harry won't really be having pain from his forehead or visions or anything like that, things change because of the Horcrux, even after he gets rid of the problem.

Anyhow, thanks again for the messages, and I hope you'll bring up more questions, as it allows me to further think about things that I had only outlined in passing. Your thoughts are more than welcome, and greatly appreciated at that!

****** With regards to canon considerations, I think the text implies that Dumbledore and Voldemort fought on the frontlines. Death Eaters and Voldemort fear Dumbledore. Voldemort is said to have cut through order and ministry members and only Dumbledore is said to have matched Voldemort during these attacks. He claims to have avoided killing whenever possible, all of which heavily imply Dumbledore saw extensive combat. I find it unlikely that Voldemort and his death eaters, often arrogant, would fear a man who never fought himself, even if he had a previous reputation from years ago from defeating Grindewald. I do agree that Dumbledore was far less personally involved in the conflict against Grindewald, however.

That said, I do think it'll be an original dynamic in a fic to have Dumbledore and Voldemort avoid combat whenever possible. It's one that I've rarely seen.

I think I understand Voldemort's attitude regarding his soul in your world now. That said, I'm still a little confused as to whether or not the damage to his soul has any repercussions. It seems like there's mental harm? It also raises the questions of his followers. Does the fact that his followers have not created horcruxes mean that his followers have to worry less about soul damage? Does Voldemort simply not care? How will the long-term ramifications of soul damage affect the combat capabilities of his death eaters? Does the order of the phoenix avoid lethal force? I don't mean to force answers but instead offer questions that someone exploring your world for the first time might have.

I also have questions over the blood test. Is there a reason that Gringotts administers the test as opposed to St Mungos or the ministry? It seems a little jarring (though I'm aware it's common) for the equivalent of a DNA exam to be administered by one's bank instead of a healer or ministry official in charge of inheritance.

I look forward to reading more, especially the development of the OCs.

******* Your questions are really good!

I do know that Dumbledore was likely to fight on the frontlines, but I'd put this down more to a necessity of the situation. In other words, if he didn't have to be there to win, he wasn't.

And while I do think that having both Dumbledore and Voldemort avoid combat whenever possible will be a very nice dynamic, it really would only come into play into the canon equivalent of around 5th year onwards. With the exception of Little Hangleton, Harry is mostly tormented through Voldemort's followers.

I'd assume that the damages to his soul would change him mentally, though it wouldn't be direct, I reason. It would be more out of fear or need to protect his own soul, or something along those lines. You can have an individual that has undergone severe mental harm, and still have their 'soul' intact (or have been a relatively good person, in other standards).

His followers have not gone most of the changes that Voldemort has subjected himself to, although there is considerable damage done to them. Examples such as the Lestranges, would have more damaged souls in comparison to Lucius Malfoy (though both pale in comparison to Voldemort) because they have had more chances to hurt their souls, and near none to mend it.

Souls are able to mend themselves over time, though it takes more effort considering the amount of damage. It can also be healed through love, or some other fluffy things I have not established concretely on. But this notion does align with what Dumbledore said about Voldemort. He didn't understand love, and that was his downfall, in the end. (though this is in canon, the 'logic' applies somewhat).

I don't think Voldemort would care too much about the condition of his followers souls, but most of them are far from being as close to broken as he was, even though they killed more. The combat capabilities of his Death Eaters will stay to the same level as before (canon),or increase, if anything.

The OotF does avoid lethality in canon, I believe, and so they would have to use stunners and lesser curses to incapacitate Death Eaters. And don't worry about asking questions. I'm more than happy to think about it. Some information can be considered the exact same as in canon, even if motivation/backstory changes. Others, not so much.

For your last point, I will concur that both /do/ offer blood tests, but that Gringotts has just been favored more because the Goblins are easier to hush. (With gold, of course)

Glad to answer these questions, and I encourage more, if you want to. Looking forward to writing more, If I'm honest. Currently fixing up Chapter 3 so it isn't a complete bog-down.

******** I'm still a little confused on the consequences of a damaged soul, it doesn't seem like there is much if you don't worry over it.

That said, I've only read one other story that really explored the canon feature of damaging souls via killing. I look forward to reading more!

I've pretty much given all the thoughts I can on your first two chapters. I would also advise, obviously not mandatory, to stay away from overly helpful Goblins/Gringotts. It can come over tropey, especially when goblins hold a massive grudge against humans. Good luck writing!
