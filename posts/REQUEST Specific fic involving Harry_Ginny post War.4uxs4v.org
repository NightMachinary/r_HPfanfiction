As some of you know, I'm going through as many fics involving Harry & Ginny after the war as possible and compiling them into a document for people to review.

I'm getting to the end of my first pass of stories I found on fanfiction.net by doing a filtered search. I've gone through 30 stories thus far that met my criteria and have yet to come across a story I know I read before, so I'm hoping someone might be able to help.

In this story, Harry is with Ginny in her room during the summer after the war and things get a bit hot and heavy. At that moment, Molly and Arthur accidentally enter and flip out on Harry, kicking him out of the house.

I've not really come across any decent fics where the Weasley's are anything but supportive of Harry, so I want to reread and review this story.

Does anyone know which fic I am talking about?
