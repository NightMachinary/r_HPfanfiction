No, the way the other Slytherins would interact with Ron would be to consider him a numbskull but nevertheless an invaluable minion to their plans; hence, leading to Ron regularly being sought out by the other Slytherins, to be monologued at regarding their plans to 'try and take over the world', and occasionally saddled with an improbable task relating to aforementioned world-conquering.

*** The currently-updating story /Fate/ deals with this very well. It really explores how Ron thrives in the Slytherin environment to become his own person, as well as the resistance he faces from his family as he does so. In one of the more recent chapters, Percy admits the Sorting Hat gave him the choice of Slytherin as well, but he was too afraid to take the plunge.

I definitely highly recommend reading it if you're a fan of Ron!

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no one is perfect.

**** Any criticism of a character or their actions isn't bashing. After the second year, Dumbledore sending Harry back to his relatives gets less and less excusable every time (In a Watsonian sense. It's clear the Doylist reason is for a consistent starting point for the next novel), but especially after Voldemort gains the blood protection.

It doesn't show Dumbledore as anything that he's not in canon, so I don't think it's bashing at all for a more badass Ron to have a go at him for it.

****** None of the "shit" Ron said was made up, it's just handwaved in canon. Ron has a watsonian reason to be mad at Dumbledore, and Dumbledore has a watsonian reason to want Harry to stay there. All the fic shows is a Ron who was willing to go off at Dumbledore. Canon shows Harry going off at Dumbledore. It is massively upsetting to realize that the hopes of an entire world rest on a teenage boy's shoulders.

Harry was emotionally harmed by his summers there (by his whole childhood there), and the isolation he was put in the summer before 5th year was just plain stupid. If there were invisible guards around his house, obviously they could have delivered letters to him without him seeing them.

Dumbledore clearly made some sub-optimal decisions. That doesn't make him a bad person, it just makes him human. For example, had Dumbledore given Harry the book on Occlumency during that summer, when Harry had so much free time, and insisted he learn it in order to be more informed, so much could have gone differently. Harry's capable of great feats of magic when he knows they're needed, such as a corporeal Patronus in 3rd year. It could have helped him with his grief and trauma from the graveyard. It could have stopped us from reading about an angsty wanker protagonist all throughout the longest book in the series.

If you think that's bashing, I don't know what to tell you. You probably only read incredibly boring fix-it fics where nothing ever goes wrong for Dumbledore. I'd absolutely believe a 3-dimensional, regretful Dumbledore would listen to Ron, who's speaking (yelling) out of concern and love for Harry. Dumbledore understands and respects love, unlike Voldemort.
