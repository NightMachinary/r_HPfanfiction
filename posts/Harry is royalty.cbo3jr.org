** This might not be quite what you're looking for, but Avalon in Arms is a good read.

** Many if Keira Marcos' works feature a Harry with some sort of royal title, usually the Earl of Gryffindor. The downside is that it's Keira Marcos.

**** I'm not a fan myself. I find her fics to be tensionless power fantasies with caricatures for characters, but that's just me, many people enjoy her stuff so maybe I'm just a little bitter bitch.
