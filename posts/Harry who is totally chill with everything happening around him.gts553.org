Looking for fics with a Harry who is completely calm with all the crazy stuff that happens in his life. Mostly wanting to find a scene like when the Fudge and the aurors try to arrest Dumbledore in OoTP and Dumbledore is perfectly calm because he knows he can beat them all, but with Harry being the calm one obviously


** linkffn(*Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) and linkffn(harry the hufflepuff)* both feature a fairly chill Harry. Neither is completely calm but both are a lot calmer than Harry in cannon.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

Harry's so mellow that even Malfoy can't goad him into an argument.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
