It's always a Goblin ritual or a being temporarily killed by a secondary character. There's always the same rehash of canon "waiting room" experience, or a variation thereof. And when Harry finally wakes up, there's always "black ichor drying on his face".


** Well, there are only so many ways to destroy an Horcrux, and the Scar one is even more limited if you want to keep Harry alive. It's not like Harry could survive being hit by Gryffindor's sword or a Fyendfire. And I believe the whole "waiting room" thing (or a variant of it) is kinda unavoidable, if only to explain to Harry what the fuck is happening in the story.

If we go with Canon, only the Killing Curse (cast by Voldemort) would give Harry a chance of survival. Which means that the "Goblin Ritual" and the "Killing Curse cast by another character" are already pretty inventive (or were before more and more author copied the idea for their stories). The "black ichor" is probably because the Diary did it (though it was ink) and some author decided every Horcrux did something similar when destroyed (even if I don't remember any of the other having something like that when destroyed).

Still, there are some stories that deal with the Scarcrux in an inventive way. I remember an Harmony fic where the Scar is chirugically removed from Harry's head and separately destroyed. That was anticlimatic, I hated this (like pretty much everything else in the story), but at least it was new.

** Fandom is very vulnerable to memetic influences. Likely a sizeable portion of Scarcrux destructions are the same (or similar) because someone wrote it once, a bunch of people read it and liked it and wrote their own versions, then a bunch of people read those follow-up stories and liked them and wrote /their/ own versions, etc etc etc.

It's the same for most of the big tropes and cliches.

Simple: the entire theory surrounding the destruction of a Horcrux is to damage the container with something capable of absolute destruction (which, I assume, shouldn't be able to get healed). The Goblins knowing a ritual to cleanse such an item isn't exactly far off, since odds are they would've planned for a situation where a Horcrux needed to be destroyed.

The waiting room is always a way to wrap things up, although it's not exactly a favorite of mine. Feels like there could've been something better used there. But I digress, as when written well, you get to see the true strength of Harry.

*** Why would they have planned for a situation where a Horcrux would need to be destroyed? Would they even know what a Horcrux is? They're bankers and miners and I doubt they have access to wizarding libraries /and/ it's highly secret knowledge.

**** Well, they do employ cursebreakers who they send to dig sites to break curses and presumably retrieve items of value, so it is plausible.

***** They wouldn't have found a Horcrux though, as that would require the person who created it to still be alive. I just think it's highly unlikely they would know.

**** Because they would rather be ready and not need it over not ready and needing it. They would know because of their many rebellions and they would rather know as much as possible to fight. Calling them /just/ bankers and miners is a bad idea, since they forged plenty of blades. They must have had reasons for such an event, and figured out the best options for fighting Wizardkind

***** How would knowing how to destroy a Horcrux help them in the slightest? It wouldn't help them fight wizards given that canonically only 2 wizards have been known to create them. The vast vast majority, possibly even all of the wizards they would fight wouldn't have had a Horcrux.

Again, this all rests on the assumption that they would have known what Horcruxes are, which I don't think is likely. And knowing how to destroy them was even more hidden knowledge that Harry and Dumbledore basically figured out by trial and error.

*** In Canon, Dumbledore states that the only reason Harry survived is that he was willing to die. Following that thought, the only way I can see a "Goblin Horcrux Cleansing Ritual" working is if it was a very high risk procedure, like removing a brain tumor or a triple bypass surgery, and that Harry had to sit down with the cursebreaker/Healer to discuss the whole thing (i.e, that he understands the danger).

No, he doesn't. You wouldn't be wrong to argue that's part of the reason why, but Harry outright asked "how am alive?" and Dumbledore let's him answer his own question with "he took my blood." Dumbledore further explains with "he tethered you to life. He keeps her protection alive and while it survives, so do you."

** I don't have a link but I read a good oneshot where Harry is in St Mungo's Hospital to have the Horcrux removed but the soul fragment torments him with increasingly horrific visions of the procedure, to the point where he doesn't know whether he is actually undergoing it or trapped inside his own mind.

Do agree a lot of fics make the removal very anticlimatic.

** Because there are waiting rooms/areas in most every medical sitting we can think of? Whether you're waiting outside leaning against a wall or you're waiting on a couch down the hall from the surgery- there's often a person waiting for the results/worried about the patient. It would be odder to me if there was no waiting area and anyone with harry was just sent home and no one was allowed to wait nearby.

*** I suppose love could do the trick. If love is truly the power he knows not, then by all rights under the Harry Potter magic system, Magic based on love should be able to do a number of things that wouldn't be possible with conventional spells; the Patronus charm is similar in that it is the only known charm which truly repels Dementors, being powered by the positive emotions they feed on.
