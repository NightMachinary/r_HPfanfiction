Whether Harry or whoever gets sorted into Slytherin,you can bet your bottom galleon they'll become friends with Blaise Zabini (smoothest eleven year old ever) and Theodore Nott (who is smarter than Hermione because of pureblood upbringing or other bs) in addition to the Ice Queen and the amazing girl with no personality

The former two are often treated like good Slytherins who don't believe in blood purity and oppose Malfoy and Voldemort (but who still look down on literally anyone not in Slytherin) but that just simply isn't true.

Both are formally introduced in Half Blood Prince and do not make a great impression. Zabini is portrayed as an arrogant snob who shares blood purist ideals and who is actually pretty chummy with ol'Ferret Face. Nott is portrayed as a "weedy and stringy" jerk who laughs along with Malfoy when the latter mocks Hermione's heritage.

So,why in your opinion,are these two flatly characterized bigots put on a bit of a pedestal by people who write and read Slytherin Harry stories ?


** All we know about them are two short passages from Harry's point of view and that pretty late in their school year. It's easy to give them whatever personality you want and still be canon compliant. If Harry befriends Malfoy, it would be a stretch to make him a well-meaning, muggle-lover. And I think people underestimate peer pressure. Six years in a boarding school, surrounded by blood purists - I doubt there are many people who would not at least pretend to be on their side when in Slytherin. Young children don't care much about ideology and politics, they just want to be accepted and they want to have friends. It's not impossible to imagine that one student (like Harry) speaking their mind early on would lead other children do the same as they would not have to fear being friendless and bullied so much...

*** You might be able to sponge that for zabini who was cozying up to malfoy in 6th year, but the was a death eaters son, and was seen talking quietly with malfoy and crabbe when harry named all their fathers as death eaters in gof.

**** His father being a Death Eater and him talking to Malfoy does not tell you much about him, I think. He was never really part of Draco's gang and they might just have related to each other because both had their parents arrested. And even if he was one at the end, if a story is set at the beginning of the school career, his political views could have changed a lot. And we don't know why people became Death Eaters. Some might have been truly evil, some might have just done what their parents and friends wanted them to do.

I don't think being a blood purist makes you automatically evil (like Bellatrix or Voldi). The same goes for Nazis. Saying they were all truly terrible people would mean the whole population of Austria and Germany was born evil. Things aren't as easy as that. There are a lot of factors involved, a lot of psychology. Peer pressure, social conformity, manipulation through media,... and if your family being Death Eaters made you evil, then Sirius would have been a Death Eater as well. And every German and Austrian citizen would be a Nazi, because most of their great grandparents were Nazis...

***** I don't think Voldie was even a blood purist - he just took advantage of existing prejudice and hated muggles. Really though, he hated everyone who was not him.

** Because they are basically the male equivalent of Daphne Greengrass. 2 boys in Slytherin where are mentioned (so canon ) yet blank slate (or quasi blank slate for Zabini ). If you put Harry in Slytherin, he need to have friends in Slytherin (being a loner would be fine I guess but I'm sick of Slytherin Harry would still save Hermione from the troll and become best friend with him ). In Slytherin, Draco is a confirmed baby Death Eater and Crabe and Goyle are mentaly chalenged, so that leaves Blaise and Th√©odore who can be anything author want.

Zabini is also "smooth " because he is the son of a Black Widow who managed to seduce 7 guys before they had "accidents ". So it's easy to make him like it.

**** In the story I'm writing, (or at least planning forever ), it should happen like this :

1) Hermione isn't at the Halloween feast (not that Harry, in Slytherin, knows about it ). 2) Quirrel enters and yells Troll 3) Harry leaves with the other Slytherin (thinking about where, since the Common Room is in the dungeon with the troll ). They finish the night safely 4) The next day, Harry's friend (Blaise I guess ), tells him an amusing rumor. Gryffindor lost tons of points because Ron Weasley was caught running near the 3rd floor after the crisis. Apparently he knew Hermione was not at the feast and wanted to tell her about the troll. Hermione was, in her case, found in the Library. After crying a little she decided she'd rather read than go to the feast. After this, Ron was seen spending some time with Hermione and being nicer to her.

As for Hermione "brightest witch of her age ", in canon, Lupin only said something along the lines of "Brightest 13 years old witch I know ". Hermione is good, but not good enough to be compared to people like Dumbledore or Voldemort.

** Theodore Nott is described as a loner who doesn't like joining groups. That makes him a prime candidate among Slytherins to go against Draco's club of baby Death Eaters. It's probably more the authoritarianism and pressure to fit in which he finds offputting about Voldemort, not the bigotry.

** JK wrote about 10 characters and gave us little more than names for the rest. Of those actually written characters, all of the Slytherins are canonically evil shitbags. Thus, if you want to write Harry not being an evil shitbag and befriending someone in Slytherin you need to pick someone who either is a total OC (usually frowned upon for whatever reason) or who is named and not much else - Zabini, Nott, Greengrass, Davies etc.

** I think its probably because people want to take pre existing Slytherins instead of full blown ocs partly because these guys are already integrated into the world even if you dont know much about them at least their families will help shape them a bit so you arent completely starting from scratch. But also partly because you want to think some canon Slytherins are good. These guys werent really but they barely had a presence so easily can be rewritten or contextualized.

** I think people just want for there to be Slytherins who aren't bigoted assholes, so they retcon the black guy to not be a racist (which, fair, bit of a weird move on Rowling's part, to begin with) and present the blank slate as a decent guy.
