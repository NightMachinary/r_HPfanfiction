***** Apparently the author's deleted everything on FanFiction and has moved to ao3, but they're editing/revising /Of Blacks and Boardhounds/ and will upload it on ao3 eventually (see comments on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28235271]]).

In the meantime, there is a cached copy on on [[https://fichub.net/fic/9uTXPJow]] if you still want to read it.
