** By the summary description alone? Probably The Forgotten Potter. linkffn(11761202). Full of ridiculous things, though.

  Wrong BWL. FEM Potter. James and Lily Potter has given birth to twins. On that Halloween night, they mistake the real prophecy child, leading to years of abandonment; which ends up being the biggest mistake the light side have ever made. There will be crossovers with many different worlds. Dark FEM Potter. Powerful & Genius FEM Potter. MOD Potter. Warning: Very Extreme M rated.

****** Though this isn't a particularly well-written story, and is filled with cringe cliches left right and centre, including Lady Potter Peverell Ravenclaw Slytherin Le Fay Emyrs, it does have a fantastic twist on the manipulative Dumbledore plot that I haven't seen done before.
