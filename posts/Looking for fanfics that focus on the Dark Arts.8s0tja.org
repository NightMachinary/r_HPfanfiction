No romance of any kind.

Harry can be in any house, the fic just needs to be focused on the Dark Arts.

Not the Dark Side political faction, just the dark arts.

Would perfer stuff that was recently published.

  OotP AU. Dark magic, Death Eaters, politics - and in the middle of it all, Harry Potter. Tested against enemies old and new, he learns that power requires sacrifices, revenge, doubly so. No slash, no bashing, Crouch Sr is alive. Book One of Dark Triad Trilogy.

*** You two keep posting this, but there're about 3 scenes that actually delve into the dark arts (casting some curses doesn't count). The only scene that even jumps out in my memory is [[/spoiler][Mulciber transferring his Dark Mark]]. Generally the story is middling dark grey.

**** Original plan was to have it be more Dark Artsy in general but:

1) I can only stomach so many "practising magic" training montages 2) other things caught my interest more 3) I tried, those scenes really sucked, so I trashed them 4) other people have done it much better, and by that I don't just mean Dark Arts, just magicky scenes in general (off the top of my head, Swimdraconian, Taure, Newcomb)

Fic is more Dark!Harry than it is Dark Arts. I hope I didn't come off as too defensive--your point is well taken.

***** Oh, I wasn't criticizing your work, or even aiming at you, it's just that I've seen yargle hold your series up as *the* Dark Arts story *several times.

Personally, I rather enjoyed the first part, but I found Sirius' character development rather off-putting, since his trauma fueled abhorrence of his family ran rather deep, and he was still very much a damaged child in an adult's body even before being carted off to Azkaban. I can't imagine having one's happy memories strip-mined in Dark Magic Chernobyl would make them any more fond of something they already hated.

** linkffn(The Sum of their Parts;Brightest Witch Darkest house; Imprisioned Realm; Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived; Too Young to Die) There's a bit of romance in Brightest Witch, but only on the sequel, and it isn't particularly annoying nor good, per se, its really on the background. Also, Harry isn't the MC of that story, though he is one of the main, just not THE one.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war?

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
