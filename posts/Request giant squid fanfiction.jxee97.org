I've been trying to get my wife into HP books instead of just the movies and the only character she's even remotely interested in is the squid.

I've told her that he spies on the Slytherin common room (unsure if that's in the books or my own head canon) and she now wants to read more about the squid.


** I'm dying with laughter. I've also been trying to get my wife into HP books over movies and this is entirely something she would do.

The Weasley family magical car is her favorite character. ðŸ˜‚

****** Its focus was entirely set on the big squishy eyes, so Ford Anglia didn't felt the tentacles until the were deep behind its wheels.

It honked in surprise and moved its wipers, but that big sexy squid just looked into its windshield with a randy look. Still, the tentacles didn't move an inch closer, they stopped as if the squid was waiting for permission.

Anglia thought about it only a moment. If there was something those spiders had taught the car, was that life was too short to go around in first gear. So Anglia blinked its lights in a flirty way. As if telling its lover to go on.

The tentacle didn't wait any longer, as they crept with strength and mastery. touching every crevice and gear in its chassis. Anglia felt as if floating. The sensations were too much, and Anglia wasn't sure if it had enough gas for what was coming.

A shy tentacle gave a soft caress to his muffler, then circled in an excruciating slowness around the edge of its exhaust. It enough to distract Anglia, and just as its engine kicked the revolutions, it felt the tentacles intruding his suspension system.
