So Season of Change linkffn(9928419) is actually a gender change fem!Harry femslash story (sadly abandoned). Its not the usual fare i read but was recommended to me because of how Harry (Aka Alya) is portrayed.

I am looking for Fan fictions of a similar nature. That is to say, ones where a reinvigorated and powerful (magically and politically), as well as possibly knowledgeable, independent, and connected Harry, works with all or most of the world unaware of who he is. In Season of Change this is because hes undergone a gender change to become the female head of house Black, and had absorbed knowledge and power during the department of mysteries adventure. The new female Harry tricks the world into thinking she has hidden or taken Harry for his protection and represents him.

I am interested in additional stories with a similar plot device. It doesn't have to be a gender change, and could be dimensional travel, goblin assistance, time travel, or any other thing one can think of that would allow such a situation to develop. Basically a Harry who has taken on a new identity or a Harry that the world does not know. He/She does not have to be the "boy/girl who lived".

I would prefer ones with romance, and while I don't mind gender change Harry stories, I would prefer they be femslash. I just cant get around seeing Harry as male, even if gender changed and have zero interest in slash stories. So only stories with him paired to females please regardless of his/her gender. I also prefer stories with more mature tones within their plot (Smut, lemons, violence, language, and the like) as they are usually more interesting and realistic.

Thanks!

  There were only a few things in Harry Potter's life that were absolutes. He was the son of Lily and James Potter and that he was born male. What happens when he discovers the truth. AU Strong/Independent, Gender-Switch, Fem!Harry, Fem!Slash Mature Themes

*** Interesting, "daughter of Lily and Sirius". This is now the 3rd fem!harry fic ive come across with this including Season of Change. Is this a more common thing than I thought? The Sirius/Lily Daughter = Harry thing?

Regardless looks like exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!

***** Ill have to search through my "finished" folder and see if I can find it. It was so long ago I dont remember and at the time, I wasnt that into fem!harry stories at the time so I dont think it made an impression... although I have been coming around, provided he/she is still interested in girls.
