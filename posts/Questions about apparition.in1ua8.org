As I've understood it the rules of apparition is to have a clear view of where you want to go, and a want to leave the place you are, before you turn on the spot and poff you're gone.

Because of these rules the wizards and witches say that they can't travel to places they haven't been before.

But if it's all about memory, then how much of the place has to be the same for the person to know where to go back to? What if you've once been on a street, but the time you try to go back it's a garbage day, so the street is then full of garbage cans, do you need to image them then too? What if someone repainted their house into a totally different colour without you knowing, does that stop you from going there? Or if someone cuts down/plants a forest? Or takes down/builds a new house? Or builds a new road? Or changes the path of a river? Og diggs away a hill? What if a whole neighbourhood burns down?

Is this why the old houses like Black live in old mansions that clearly nothing has been done with since the beginning of time?

Or is apparition all about their magic to get the feel of the place to be able to magically find it again? If so, do wizards and witches need to be physically there once for their magic to know the place, or can they see the place in a memory and 'know' it the same way as if physically there, after all why couldn't magic transfer the knowledge from one to another?

If its not about the magic getting a feel for it, could you still get to know a place through someone elses memory? Could todays muggleborn use a VR headset and 'visit' the place they want to go to, then actually go there? Could google maps street view work? What if it's a tourist destination, with hundreds and hundreds of pictures online from multiple angles, could that be enough?

So yeah, what do you guys think are the imaginary rules around this magically form for teleportation?

Oh and a bonus thingy, to you guys writing Dumbledore bashing, what about pointing out how Dumbledore was able to apparite to Petunias house to leave Harry on a doorstep of a house in a street that I can't find any good reason for him to ever have visited before (unless it's the childhood house of Lily and Petunia of course, but I don't think it is?). Which means he has been there before, something I find quite weird.


** There are two cases in the books where people Apparate without having been there before. The one you mentioned of Dumbledore and in the 7th book when Hermione takes Harry to Godric's Hollow (Harry has no true memory of the place).

Therefore, I assume it is possible to Apparate to a place you haven't been before as long as you have a name in mind and a good idea of where this place is.

Let's also remember that Charlie Weasley managed to miss his targer location during his Apparition test with 5 miles, which is quite a distance. If it is possible to miss your mark like that (and not get splinched), I think it's fair to say you could go somewhere if you have a good general idea of the location and focus on the name.

So for your modern techniques, I would guess that google maps street view and such could work, but always remember that Apparition is also limited by distance, so you can't just Apparate from country to country or from state to state so to speak.

*** There is a Harry Potter/Supernatural crossover where Harry uses Google maps to Apparate to a place he never been. (I love that fic.)

I don't know about that. There are several examples in Canon where a character manage to apparate to a place where they (supposedly) never went before):

- Dumbledore never went to Privet Drive before, and yet he could apparate there.
- In HBP, Dumbledore apparate in a random Muggle village to find Slughorn. It's not impossible he already went there during his pretty long life, but Britain is big so I doubt he went to every villages and cities.
- Still in HBP, Narcissa and Bellatrix could go to Spinner's End, and it's unlikely any of them ever went to a poor muggle city before.
- Despite never of them ever going to Grodic's Hollow, Harry and Hermione could go there in DH, (I know Harry lived there with his parents, but he has no memory of the place and probably only stay inside the house so I'm not sure it would count).

The way I see it, Apparition is a bit like using a map. You only need to visualize a place to go there. Already knowing the place only help with the precision of the Apparition (like anyone can Apparate to Hogsmead, but someone who already went there before can Apparate right in front of the 3 Broomstick rather than anywhere inside the village).

This is not the case. Lily and Petunia both grew up in "Cokeworth" (the city where Spinner's End is located), which is supposed to be in the Midlands, while Privet Drive is in Surrey.

** As the others pointed out, your premise is wrong. Nowhere is it stated, and no one is saying, that you can't apparate to places you haven't been. Indeed, the opposite seems to be implied. To the examples listed I would add all the people apparating to the Qudditch World Cup.

So, everything you base on that premise i.e. the rest of the post is off the table.

As for the rules: There is a range limit that scales with skill: Many wizards don't apparate at all, and intercontinental Apparition is Dumbledore skill level or beyond. Everyone else is in-between. The three Ds you already mentioned, and I want to point out that "destination" also can mean a place name; "Hogsmeade, High Street" is a perfectly well-defined destination. Magic then appears to do the rest (in combination with skill, again, because being bad at Apparition can cause you to end up far away from your desired location, cf. Charlie Weasley)

Personal preference also says there are spots reserved for Apparition in popular and crowded destinations like Diagon Alley, because we know you can apparate on top of someone (Charlie), and you'd want to avoid that.

** If we go by cannon then triple D's are how the students are taught to apparate so that should be the rule. And last D was Destination, so a clear destination has to be imagined by the one apparating. As long as you keep a particular destination in mind you will most likely reach there unlike the FLOO where you have to clearly pronounce the address.

** I think knowing the location before you can apparate there is just the simplest and easiest method of getting the destination to go to, meaning that if you have a picture of a place, you could conceivably apparate there too.\\
I'd imagine that someone who is very familiar with map coordinates could apparate given just those coordinates and an altitude and appear at those coordinates, for example.

Likewise, it's entirely possible that one of the reasons why portkey's and the floo system were invented could be because some people might not be able to lock down their destination enough that the spell for apparition can take over.

Of course there's a crack answer in that if you apparate to a memorised place then you'll always arrive at that place exactly as it is memorised because apparition doesn't just transport you in space, but through realities until it gets to the closest reality that has the right place as you remember it.
