** Nice quiz thank you.

One detail/question though Question 7: Where did Harry first see Death Eaters in the flesh? Wouldn't it be in the Shrieking Shack with Pettigrew or did you have in mind Death Eather in their "uniform". Earlier would be Lucius Malfoy in Borgin and Burkes in the second book. One could even argue it would be in the Great Hall with Snape as he was one, still has the mark and played the part later or if a Death Eater is a follower of Voldemort, in the Leaky Cauldron when first meeting Quirrell
