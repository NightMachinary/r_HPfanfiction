I'm pretty new to reading HP fanfic and I'm looking for the next thing to read. Completed is quite preferable, I tend to braindump things after I've finished them and by the time the next chapter is released I end up forgetting the particulars of the story.

So far-

[[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction-index/harry-potter/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][HP and the Soulmate Bond]]- I was recomended this one by a friend because I mentioned I enjoy the Harry/Hermione relationship in HPMOR. I like pretty much everything about this except the Ron and Ginny bashing. Ron being an absolute ass, etc, is really starting to grate on my nerves. I really dig the 'Lord Harry' aspect.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][HP and the Nightmares of Futures Past]]- Everyone acts way way way too mature and I find Harry and Ginny's relationship creepy to the nth degree. I like the premise, otherwise, and enjoy Harry being damn powerful. I appreciate the writing and while I don't mind reading smut I prefer good writing.

[[http://hpmor.com/][Methods of Rationality]]- I really wish I could also read Hermione Granger and the Adventures of the Sparkly Unicorn Princess. Some points in this story are very verbose and made me glaze over a few times, but I dig super-powerful Harry and his relationship with Hermione. I also rather like the explanations behind magical theory that come up.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Alexandra Quick]] - I read all four books and enjoy them a lot. It was nice to see a legit American point of view on the wizarding world. Looking forward to the next book.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3954448/1/Questions-and-Answers][Questions and Answers]] So far this is the only canon-compliant post epilogue story I've read and it was an enjoyable slice of life sort of read. I enjoy the redemption of Draco. However, I'm more interested in Harry-centric at Hogwarts sort of material, but wouldn't mind an amazing post-epilogue rec.

I've read a couple cross overs too. One Supernatural xover that I can't remember the name of but I couldn't get past that Dean was the top and Harry was the bottom. It just didn't work in my head. And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]], I enjoy BBC's Sherlock and dig that this fic really digs into magical theory and manipulates the heck out of it. This was actually my first foray back into HPfanfic. The last fanfic I had read was the days before OOTP was to be released and it has been "leaked" and I read some crazy story about Draco and Harry learning to be animagi and Draco was some crazy chimera dragon thing.

tl:dr So uh, yeah, Super-Saiyan Lord Harry recs? Or anything else you may think I'd like? I enjoy Harry/Hermione, but I'm not looking for any particular ships, just well written and complete.

** A bit of advice, don't limit yourself to only completed fics. There are a ton of really good fanfics aren't completed and probably won't ever be.

With that said, linkffn(6256154), time travel without the whole go back to Hogwarts.

Linkffn(8233288), has some Ron and others bashing which is too bad but still a good story, kind of a Lord Potter story in a way.

Linkffn(3384712), not super sayan Harry but he's still pretty powerful, really good fight scenes.

** All H/Hr or unpaired, because that's most of what I've read. I try to avoid anything that self-consciously "bashes" anything else.

/With Malice Aforethought/: One of the better canon-style sixth-year fics I've read, though it rushes to the conclusion a little faster than it ought to. linkffn(With Malice Aforethought)

/Harry Potter and the Last Horcrux/ and /Harry Potter and the Years of Rebellion/: Great dialogue, world building, characterization, writing---basically everything except concision. /Years of Rebellion/ embodies a lot of what eventually became "Independent Harry" cliches, but it does them extremely well. It's unfinished and will probably never be finished, but the space from the start of the thing to Hogwarts is the size of most fanfics and filled with action and novelty.

/The Last Horcrux/ is much more disciplined and dark (and completed); the second half wanders a little, and I could do without the goblin subplot, but it's fun to watch a good writer wander. They're both on [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net][Fanfic Authors]].

/The Golden Age/ is an extremely bizarre, unsettling, and convincing story, which I think is all I can say about it without giving anything away. linkffn(3682339)

** Here's a list of oneshots that I really recommend you read, as well as a few longer stories that I think you'd like.

linkffn(10921110;4396574;4389875;4726291;6975743;4903653;7864670;6815334;3120832)

These stories are all short, but they're all good and they should give you an idea of the breadth of options there are. I didn't discover some types of fanfiction until several months after I started reading, and this should let you avoid that mistake.

linkffn(3384712;5077573)

The Lie I've Lived is by a writer who's now a published author, and has a powerful yet believable Harry. It's not Harry/Hermione, but the romance sub-plot isn't that large and meshes nicely with the main storyline. It's in first-person, but the writing is very high-quality and it's reminiscent of canon.

Runemaster has a few minor plot holes, but it's much more of a classic Powerful!Harry story. I think you'd enjoy it a lot, based on the stories you mentioned earlier.

  Post book 7. Snape is good, but now he's dead, killed in the final battle of the wizarding war. Despite much controversy, a memorial was erected for him on the Hogwarts grounds...a very special memorial. In fact, some say...

But Harry's full of Horcruxes and this world is ripe for the taking- he just has to prevent himself from going insane and becoming the next Dark Lord. Helpfully, he's regressed to a child.

** A few H/Hr stories for you:

Linkffn(Harry Crow by robst) - Robst is not thought highly of around here, because his writing is super trope-y, but if you like that, then he's for you. I recommended this one because Harry is powerful, but his other stories also have soul bonds, time travel, etc.

Bobmin at fanficauthors.net has a great super!Harry duet called Sunset over Britain and Sunrise over Britain. However, there is definitely Ron!bashing. Seriously, great story, but just assume Ron was replaced by an evil pod person.

I love linkffn(Notebooks and Letters by chemprof). He also has some other great H/Hr stories.

Linkffn(The End and the Beginning by muggledad) is inspired by NOFP but prevents the creepy relationship by bringing Hermione back as well.
