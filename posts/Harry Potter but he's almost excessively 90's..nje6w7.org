Share with us, if you will, the most */Violently/* 90's Harry Potter you can find and/or write! Crack, Crack taken seriously, Crack!90's!Harry in an otherwise Non-crack world, Heir-of-Tony-Hawk!Harry, anything! I just need 90's Harry, at any cost. Attending Hogwarts time period would be nice, but I hope we could appreciate on some level the idea Harry being a massive 90's Dad too.

I for one have a vivid image of Harry pulling some Crazy Taxi kind of stuff with the Ford Angelina during his second year.


** "HARRY JAMES POTTER JUST WHAT DID YOU CALL MALFOY?! Hermione demands.

"I called him a Cunt, Hermione. He was being a cunt, so I called him a cunt" Harry dismissed.

"AND WHY ARE THERE SO MANY NEW HAIR STRAIGHTENING PRODUCTS ON MY DESKS!" Hermione yelled.

"Because your hair reminds me of Mel B. Scary Spice indeed. But I'm just Livin la Vida loca" Harry sang the last part, running away quickly before Hurricane Hermione regained her focus enough to chase him.

** It now strikes me as a damn shame that I don't think I've ever seen anything like this. I've seen him introduce Bill Weasley to computer games, but I can't remember where
