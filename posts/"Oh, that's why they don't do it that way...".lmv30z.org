Anything where someone has a /brilliant/ and in hindsight completely obvious idea to solve a problem of the magical world, which then later on turns out catastrophically.


** I remember reading a Lockhart self insert where he went around using unbreakable vows to prove to people he was telling the truth about stuff (where he had metaknowledge? I forget why he was doing it). But that backfired on him because unbreakable vows formed something like a semi-permanent magical drain until they became self-sustaining. So he ended up crippling his magical abilities for a couple of months.

I thought it was a clever explanation for why unbreakable vows don't get used more often but it kinda killed my interest in the fic. The story looked to be shaping up into an OP power wank, which are a guilty pleasure of mine, then the author seemed to use this contrivance to overcorrect. Kinda sucked the enjoyment right out of it for me.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/Magical-Me][Magical Me]], by Publicola. It's a good story, except that it was abandoned five years ago shortly after our SI found out the downside of unbreakable vows.

** "You carved runes to make that muggle comtuper work in Hogwarts? You bloody idiot!" Arthur yelled, surprising Hermione. She had expected Arthur to praise her, and even ask her how her /computer/ works. Not.. this.

"But, Mr Weasley.. it works! See!" Hermione argues, not able to come up with a suitable counter, and just turns the computer on to show it to him.

Before she can, though, Arthur slams his hand on the runes, and does something that disables the computer. Hermione snaps her head to shockingly glare at Arthur, who just glares back.

He says, "Hermione. How do you think the Ford became alive?! I used runes! Do you want the computer to be alive and start running around!?"

** Turns out it's perfectly acceptable to give people accused of crimes Veritaserum but they don't use it because the magical community is involved in so many indiscretions that everyone could reveal information that could completely ruin some politician's career (I mean Barty Jr reveals how Barty Sr bent the laws for him) or even cause the whole system to collapse.
