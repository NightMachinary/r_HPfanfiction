For those that don't know, Darkover is the name of the series and a planet, with harsh and cold conditions, a red sun, 4 moons, various indigenous species, and in this planet, there is a plant that activates latent ESP in humans, after being around its pollen for a while (there's more to that, but its just a minor summary), and this ESP is called Laran.

This planet wasn't discovered by the Terrans during their space colonization, but a colonial ship broke down and accidentaly landed in Darkover. Fast foward 3000 years, the Terrans "discover" it and begins the First Terran Age. However, the people from that colonial ship, mostly composed of Scotts (red hair is a big and important trait here) developed a society based around seven families, with several minor families, with a monarchy led by the Hastur's, and the royalty is pretty much composed by Laran users, called the Comyn.

Each family has a specific laran trait, like the Alton's, who have the ability of forced rapport, meaning, Imperius on their voice (when boosted with Laran), or like the Aldaran's, who have prescience and sometimes weather forecasting. Not only that, every Laran user is a telepath, and to use their powers to higher degree, they have something called a Matrix Stone, which is rare, attuned for each person, with pain of death to use someone else's with the rare exception (not because its law, because the stone itself might kill you). And there are these "Towers" spread all over the world in which a group of strong laran users use a comunal Matrix (I think, its been years since I read the books, I might be mistaken) to map out the world and specific regions to mine ores and other resources, all telepathicaly/telekenisis.

So, imagine a fic where Harry froze himself, like in Browncoat, but instead of being awakened by the Alliance, he's awakened by a random Terran, or by Lewis(one of the protagonists) during his Exile. And he finds this world that has "magic" in it, and he has actual magic himself. That's the idea. I suck at writing, have no patience for it, and pretty much 0 motivation, but if someone wants to write this, or know if someone wrote it, please, let me know.


** Yes. Someone give me a Darkover crossover. Anything.

** Does it have to be Harry ? I'm getting rather tired of him being shoehorned as the protagonist. Maybe a young Dumbledore ?

*** No, no need to be Harry, its just that its already a good setup from Browncoat, with no extra need to create a background. But could work with pretty much anyone. Just not Hermione. I fucking hate Hermione.
