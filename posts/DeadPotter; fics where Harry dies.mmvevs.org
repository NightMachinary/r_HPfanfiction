hiya! I am looking for fics in which Harry Potter dies quite young. Be it as a child before Hogwarts or in the Chamber of Secrets or during the Triwizard Tournament. There are so many ways Harry has been endangered and I was wondering what would happen if the worst were to happen and how the war would thus go because of that

  Harry and Hermione discover an Alien baby during a meteor shower with skin of steel and superhuman strength. They flee to the States to protect him. However it's difficult for an adolescent Alien child to remain under the radar when his best friend and adopted older brother is none other than the spoiled billionaire brat Tony Stark. Man of Steel meets Man of Iron. (HPxDCxMCU)

** In the linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19339288/chapters/46005901]]) and sequels, Harry Potter is killed along with Voldemort on the Halloween of 1981. The rest of the characters never know him.

linkffn(A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story by cosette-aimee) features a post-DH Harry transmigrated to an AU whose indigenous Harry was killed in a car accident along with the Dursleys. (This results in very different political dynamics in that world.)

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

** I am getting annoyed with myself right now. I know I've read a fic like that before.

(I'll leave a general overview of the plot if someone knows what it is and would link it, I'm looking for that author too)

Harry was beaten to the point of death, and in the last few moments he died, a massive burst of accidental magic caused an explosion at Privet Drive. The Hogwarts staff found out the next day, I believe. In one of the epilogue parts, it said that Sirius died in Azkaban because he never had a reason to breakout.

  Complete. Voldemort was defeated in Harry's 6th year. Now in his 7th year, Harry struggles with PTSD. However, surviving the killing curse resulted in more damage to Harry's body than anyone could have suspected. He develops an incurable, unknown form of cancer that only very dark magic can cause. How will everyone deal with it? Trio-centric.
