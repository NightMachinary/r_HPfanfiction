#+TITLE: Thought I would contribute something - this is by far the best fanfic I've ever read (year 7 from Neville and the DA's standpoint). The author goes so far as to include exact quotes from book 7 where the stories line up.

** I thought this was surely going to be a link to Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, so I was very surprised when wasn't. Look pretty good though.

If you haven't read the one I mentioned, I recommend it, especially if you like this POV / time period.

*** Seconding this. The entire DAYDverse is well fleshed out and gives brilliant characterizations for all the other Hogwarts students that aren't the Golden Trio.

** Thanks for recommending this--I absolutely loved it! I liked Neville before, but I hadn't really thought to read any fanfiction of this point in his life. You got me hooked by putting this up here, so I blame you.

...You know... in a good way. :)
