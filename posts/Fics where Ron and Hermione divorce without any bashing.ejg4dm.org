I've never liked Ron/Hermione, but I've also never seen a fic that maturely tackled them divorcing. Normally it comes down to one of them being OOC. Also, if you don't like them together as well, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiRomioneShippers/][there's a currently small subreddit that you might like]]


** Unfortunately I have not come across a divorce fic for Hermione and Ron where the divorce is mutual, nonviolent, or anything other than an excuse for Draco and Hermione to get together. Most of the time, Ron is heavily bashed, called an alcoholic and abusive. If there are any nontoxic and mutual divorce fanfics for Ron and Hermione, I'd very much like to see it too.

*** Here is my own fic - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16423415]])

The divorce is a tiny mention, but I tried to make it as nontoxic as possible.

  Harry wonders if he should accept Ron's badly hidden feelings for him, imagining the reactions of their children and ex-wives, as they flirt in a pub.

  [Trans!Ron; Ron/Hermione, various pairings] He learned his lesson a long time ago. Boys are boys, girls are girls. And Ron, Ron makes a good boy. He's tall, sturdy, manly, not like some of those long-haired Slytherins he sometimes mistakes for girls when they slink in the dark corridors with their robes floating behind them. He plays Quidditch. He loves Hermione, with a little too much intensity and adoration for a boy his age, but that's what constant brushes with death do to you. He shaves; he doesn't jerk off, granted, but apart from that, he's pretty much the poster boy for healthy, honest masculinity.So why is it, then - why is it he can't believe it, not for one second?

** linkffn(Strange Reflections by LeQuin)

They are not married but this is the most mature break up I have seen from them. It is not the main thing but I really enjoyed how realistic it was.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.
