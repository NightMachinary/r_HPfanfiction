This is something I've been wondering recently: how does 'The Trace' work?

If we follow the books it makes absolutely no sense. in CoS Harry gets a letter for his usage of underage magic, though it was Dobby who used magic.

Following this logic it would seem that it isn't so much the wand that cast the magic, but more the place it was cast in. So it would make it that no muggleborns or those living in muggle areas could use any magic if they're underage.

However in OotP Tonk casts magic in Harry's room to pack his stuff, but this time there's no letter, which seems to mean that it isn't the place where magic is cast, but the wand it's cast from.

So they put in conflicting usages of underage magic to fit the narrative, which makes me wonder which makes more sense to use in stories.

Your thoughts?


** A plot device to screw over Harry so readers feel more for him.

The Trace, as implemented in the Books, basically boils down to:

- If Tom Riddle wanted to commit murders, he could simply bypass it using his uncle's wand.
- But if Harry had to use magic to save his life, it would always get him!

**** First of all, the Trace was not active in Wizarding locations at all. That should explain why:

- Hermione could use spells in Hogwarts Express and Diagon Alley without problems.
- Riddle could use magic to stun and memory charm his uncle.
- The Ministry Six could use magic inside the DoM without alerting anyone.

Second, it was heavily location based. The Ministry looked carefully at places where Muggleborns and Muggle-raised lived, that was how they caught Dobby and thought it was Harry.

Third, there had to be wand based tracking, just to get those kids trying to flash their magic in Muggle locations. I believe this was the way how Harry was caught in OOTP. However, when he wandlessly cast the Lumos a moments before, no alert was triggered. Since he was still some distance away from home, I believe the Trace activated here was not location based. Further evidence supporting wand based tracking was how Tom Riddle killed his father without settling off the Trace.

Finally in DH, Moody explained the Trace as trying to sense magic around underage wizards at all times. This explanation significantly violated several above mentioned cases. It also violated the cases where Tonks and Dumbledore cast several spells around Harry in OOTP and HBP respectively. IMO, JKR just wanted to force an aerial shootout and kill off more good guys. She even mentioned in her interviews that consistency in world building took a backseat to plot requirements in her stories.

As conclusion, I think fic writers have significant freedom in implementing the Trace in their stories. I personally favor a combination of wand and location based tracking as this implementation would explain the greatest majority of examples in the Books.

*** Harry was caught because magic was done in /his/ house, close to him. (I imagine the trace having a radius of about a metre or so around the wizard, since their magic is done through a wand in their hand.) He did after all try to stop Dobby.

Tom Riddle, being the son and grandson of the muggles, probably would have been a prime suspect if Morfin Gaunt didn't confess as well as possess the wand used in the murders. They'd definitely check Tom Jr's wand.

** I figured that Tonks works in the ministry and the improper use of magic office is a division of the DMLE where she works. She could have magically blinded it for the evening somehow or something. Easiest way?

However, maybe House Elves kind of use the magic of their surroundings? If a house elf was in a muggle household around only muggles, would their magic work properly? Yeah their magic works /differently/ but maybe they're just able to channel it differently. That would make it so that it was technically at least some of Harry's magic being used in CoS.

I honestly think it's a combination of location and person. Like a two way check. Do wizards live in x radius? If yes, not gonna worry. If no, check it out. Tonks /could/ have registered a wizard living next door or something.

Just ideas though.

*** I think it's simpler than this. It's always important to remember that Ministry /enforcement/ is not the same thing as /detection/. For example, they detect all magic cast during the school term but don't enforce against any of it because it's not against the law.

Another type of magic they don't enforce against is pre-Hogwarts magic.

And a final type appears to be redundant offences: they don't deliver you a notice per item of magic cast if you've already breached the law. So, for example, Harry only got a notice for his Patronus Charm, not his Wand-Lighting Charm. Tonks' magic seems to be another example of this.

** Warning: a whole lot of thoughts, not yet edited for consistency.

The Trace is a charm applied to a witch or wizard when they get their wand. In cases where a child is given a family wand, the Trace may be applied by a Ministry official, Hogwarts professor, or wand-maker; the decree makes this a job responsibility, with fines for lack of compliance.

When magic occurs in the vicinity of the Trace, the charm checks to see if there is an exemption at the location; the Ministry applies these exemption charms to places of common magic use like Diagon Alley, the Ministry, St. Mungo's, all of Hogsmeade and Hogwarts. In addition, an adult wizard homeowner can get an exemption applied to their home for a modest fee.

The Trace will report what spell or effect was used and who else was present, but only by general type: muggle, underage wizard, adult wizard, Ministry official, or Professor.

At Hopkirk's office, the report is evaluated for possible violations: usually a violation is noted only if a muggle is present; a warning is issued if those nearby are all underaged wizards(or the Traced is alone). If there is a Ministry official or Professor present, the Trace is exempted.

The only vague situation is where there is an adult wizard present- the Trace may be designed to err on the side of caution and warn the parent or guardian of the Traced, or it may assume that the adult is in control of the situation and also count it as an exemption. More likely this is adjustable within Hopkirk's office depending on the level of threat to the Statute is currently set.

At a high threat-level, the underaged are essentially providing on the ground intel-gathering for the Ministry, except that wading through all the reports would be difficult.

If there was no known violation, the report is tossed/burned/otherwise ignored. In special circumstances (as when a Ministry official is interfering with Harry's life), the exemptions for adults, officials, and professors may be cancelled at a specific location 'as a security precaution'.

Accidental magic is not processed as a violation but also not tossed away. It's instead referred to the Obliviators squad (or rather the sub-department they report to) to evaluate whether they need to intercede. Much wandless magic registers as accidental. Apparation is a special case; if the Traced is involved in an Apparation, both ends are evaluated. If the Traced isn't present in both locations, the report is tossed. If the source or destination is in an Exempted zone, the report is tossed.

The use of enchanted devices is not subject to the Trace- Portkeys, invisibility cloaks, brooms, flying cars, and such don't set off the Trace. This also applies to potions and use of herbs and/or parts of magical beasts.

1st year problems: Hermione saying she'd tried a few spells without trouble. Possible explanation: she tried them whilst staying overnight at the Cauldron for immersion or she got to the Platform reeeaaally early.

2nd year problems: Dobby apparates in- no notice; Dobby lifts the pudding- notice, but only after dropping it on the Masons; Dobby disapparates- no notice; flying car finds Harry's house (how, exactly? It's not like they were given driving directions or had the internet...), flying car yanks out the bars on his window and flies off- no notice; Harry and Ron fly the car straight up from the lot near Kings Cross and across London- no official notice but Arthur is cited for the car (did he admit to owning it? wtf?) What's worse is that the notices themselves would AUTOMATICALLY make managing the use of magic in the presence of muggles HARDER to explain- not just because of the owls, but they're animated floating origami that talk! [film-version only, but still]

3rd year problems: Was Harry cited for detonating the wine glass? No. In fact he didn't get a notice at all despite having inflated his Aunt-in-law, even after taking the time to grab his trunk, inspect the suspicious hedge and then summon and board the Knight bus. If Fudge had a standing order to redirect any Potter incidents to his office, I might buy it, but it more seems like the Ministry only knew something was awry because a fat woman was floating around Surrey. Also, given what Stan said about the Knight Bus not needing to worry about being seen despite making anything in front of it jump out of its way, how much Obliviating is really needed?

4th year problems: none- all incidents are covered by Arthur's presence. Incidentally, this also demonstrates that the Floo can be enabled for ANY fireplace without even being touched... unless the prep has to do with a messenger owl dropping floo tracking powder down a chimney

5th year problems: cited for the Patronus but made no mention of Lumos. Also, WHY DIDN"T SOMEONE APPARATE IN to keep Harry safe and the Dursleys under control? Arthur and Albus had enough time to make their way in to the Ministry and argue his case- wouldn't it have made sense to send Molly or the twins (OK, maybe not the twins) or Lupin at least? They're all at Grimmauld, right? And then they let him sit and stew for 3 days before coming to pick him up?

6th year problems: Not for Harry, but the Gaunts were being confronted about magic used against muggles in the nearby village pub. How is it safer to allow muggle-hating inbreds who probably never went to Hogwarts or took the OWL exams to live near and taunt those muggles with magic, just because they're over 17? Did they get the Trace at all? Then there's the actual murder by Riddle using Morfin's wand... er, what? No, I think Dumbledore got that one wrong. Tom didn't borrow Morfin's wand and kill the Riddles himself. He cast the Imperius on Morfin while in the Gaunt shack and sent Morfin up to the house to do the deed. All investigations would reveal that Morfin, a known muggle-hater, had personally walked up, broken into their house and killed them. Morfin himself would (truthfully!) recount that he had done so, and any examination of his memories or use of Veritaserum would reveal the same.

7th year problems: the Battle of Seven Potters was predicated on the idea that the Trace would screw them up even if Harry was in the presence of an adult (even an Auror like Tonks or Shacklebolt!). What makes this hair-pullingly stupid is that Harry still ends up using spells in a running aerial battle. He lands first at the Tonks', then portkeys to the Burrow (outside its protections, mind you) yet receives no notices. They were so prompt in the past, too.

**** My take on that: Tom Riddle did go up to the house to evaluate his lost relatives on his father's side. After spying on them and coming to the conclusion that they didn't deserve to live, he headed back to the Gaunt shack with a plan forming.

Frank saw him during the day. The Riddles were murdered in their dinner clothes, at night (when Frank might miss Morfin sneaking up to the house), and found the next morning by their maid.

*** Hold my beer, I think I can fan wank this. Year 1 The trace is applied on the Hogwarts express, Year 2 Dobby used his magic in a way that triggers the trace to help Harry in his own way. Year 3 wandless and accidental magic doesn´t trigger the trace Year 5 They assumed that Harry would be safe the next three days and he had one member as guard, while they needed time to assemble enough people to get him safely away. Year 6 I agree with the Imperius theory. Year 7 this one could be difficult, so they might fear that Deatheaters have access to tools that are used to track underage magic and a simple note that aurors are near won´t stop the the tools from tracking the magic, also they know the general location of Harry and are patrolling the skies to be ready to strike when he leaves or the protection runs out, so they used the seven Potters scheme, he again didn´t get a notice because of politics, because the order made sure, the ministry knows shit will go down. Also I think it would´ve been much safer to just call a cab or just get him somewhere else after year six, so he doesn´t have to flee from the Dursley´s in the first place grimauld place was relatively safe for a while, why not just send him there in the first place? Fuck the protection, it would´ve only been necessary if he went to Hogwarts, which I guess the order assumed he would go because, they probably didn´t know about Harry´s plan to skip his last year, so canon get´s that one I suppose...

** Why are people so adanant that Riddle's magic /didn't/ alert the ministry?

His uncle confessed, and he had the weapon of choice in his posession when they came to his address (after /somehow/ finding out about three magically killed muggles.) They might have thought that the Trace was just triggered by a muggle born neighbour or something. The case was closed, wasn't it?

EDIT: Dumbledore hinted at the trace going off, but not at it being Riddle who did the magic.

Also, if it was wand based, why didn't they just give Harry another wand et voilà, he'd gone incognito?

EDIT 2: Canon is pretty obvious about the Trace being put on wizards not the wand. Moody said that Harry had the Trace on /him/, not on his wand.

** Mhm, well, let's consider this theory. House elves work by leeching magic from the bonded family. Since most purebloods have elves it's likely the lack of letters they receive isn't so much because of exceptions but because house elves doing their jobs will render the point moot. Now muggleborns don't have house elves neither do they know ownign one would be like having a waiver for underaged magic.

Now onto Dobby. Since he could produce Harry's signature it means he was already bonded to Harry at that point, which means this Dobby was a time travelling Dobby from the future that needed to set events going in a way that satisfies that future. So there we are: Dobby used some of Harry's magic to trigger a warning since ministry had no idea Harry "owns" a house elf.

** So, why the Trace didn't detect all the heavy, including unforgivables, spell casting in the cementery at the end of GoF?

It wouldn't have detected Harry, but it would have detected a lot of spells and curses around an underage wizard. The logical explanation is that a Death Eater at the DMLE covered it up, but Voldemort probably didn't have the ministry so infiltrated at that point.

Alright, yes, plot. Or maybe Voldemort knows a spell to block the trace. But that's another exception.

*** Why is there a Trace? Because of the Statute of Secrecy. If there's an adult supervising, you don't need to alert the Obliviators automatically; the adult can make a reasonable determination. So the Trace just...doesn't fire.

** Ok, this is how I understand it, the trace is first and foremost location based, if I recall there was something said somewhere that the trace can't identify who's casting the spell just that what was cast and where it was.

Going by this that means that the improper use of magic office has a detailed record of where students live so they can identify who cast the spell, what I imagine is that there's a giant map of Britain which has locations that light up when underage magic is being used locations like diagon alley, hogwarts express train line and hogwarts are just permanently lit up.

As for the Dobby case, I imagine that really strong magic near someone with the trace could trigger it, so Dobby's magic was mistaken for Harry's. And would explain what Mad Eye says in DH about not uaing magic around Harry as too many people would trigger it, while Tonks was able to use it in OotP as there was just her.

With the Tom Riddle case, maybe in his research into dark magoc he found some way to temporarily block the trace or renove it altogether, seem like something he would do.

there are multiple ways to detect magic but the ministry doesn't have any standardization so one place might use different methods depending on which person setup that area.

the way one area is monitored may change from year to year depending on which employee is assigned that year. also who happens to be monitoring the trace at any given time matters. some people might not give a damn about muggleborns using Lumos in their house but would certainly care about Apparition.

** As far as we know, the Trace is on the witches/wizards, but it's not that it is by themselves but rather that it is a device or charm (most likely an enchanted device) that pings an area if there is magic done there and there are underage witches/wizardsm, and if there are also of-age witches/wizards then it pings that too and if they are Aurors nearby it just ignores the underage ping because why bother if there are Aurors on the spot.

If you go with that model then the ministry (or at least the monitoring device) could see that there is magic being done during the OotP thing but also see that there is an Auror on the spot and ignore it because either it's the Auror who is casting or it's the kid but the Auror will manage anyway since it's just a kid; likewise, since there were no adult wizards or witches and only one underage one in the vicinity when Dobby did his thing, the device would automatically assume it to be done by that wizard. Do keep in mind that the ministry doesn't seem to care about, or bother to monitor, house elves, and there is no reason for anyone to assume that maybe it was a house elf who used magic in an all-Muggle house because really why would they.

An important thing to note is that the restriction itself, at least in spirit, seems to exist as a precaution against casting of magic by those ill-equipped to deal with reversing any effects if there was a need when there is nobody who can aid them with that nearby. With that, there really would be no need to care about spells being done in the presence of Aurors because they are, or at least should be, good enough to not have any problems should something need to be reversed.

Going further with the theory, this (the fact that she would be pinging the trace if she was nearby them) was why Ginny did not go on the camping trip with the trio. Her resignation in this case would make less sense if she could escape the Trace by using someone else's wand, or if she could do so by simply not casting at all until it became necessary, but if she knew that she would ping the Trace just be being there and being underage (and considering that her father works, or at least worked, for the ministry, it would not be strange for her to know that much about the Trace), well ... that obviously would be enough of a problem to justify her not insisting that she wants to go with them when she obviously wanted to.

** The Trace /is/ placed on the wand, but it does not detect the magic cast /from/ the wand --- instead, it detects any magic cast in the vicinity of the wand and sends the info to the Ministry.

Thus, Riddle could bypass the Trace by using his uncle's non-Traced wand if he didn't take his own wand with him and got far enough from it.

Meanwhile, Dobby in /Chamber of Secrets/ used magic while mere meters away from Harry's wand, so it tripped the alarm.

The /Order of the Phoenix/ example definitely has to do with the Order members preparing their trip in advance. If respected Auror Emeritus Moody sends a letter explaining he's going to be in that area casting some magic, but not to worry, he'll make sure the Potter kid doesn't, it's completely unrelated --- the Improper Use of Magic Office is probably going to take his word for it.

********* Of course, if people had to resort to such drastic measures, it would mean they were ready to go undercover and consider the Ministry an enemy.

As we later found out in DH, the Ministry was pretty much an ineffective paper tiger that was only capable of tyrannizing law abiding citizens. Their own aurors, for example Dawlish, got slapped silly left and right when people started resisting. Those Hogwarts kids, who had just a couple years of defense training, were already able to take them head on and prevail.

When the citizens finally rose up at Battle of Hogwarts, their combined force along with the Big Bad's minions got completely walloped up. The Ministry was such a joke.

******** Not to mention, such a scheme would be best enacted by children with magical parents, whereas muggle-borns are the ones who really need to worry about the Trace for the most part.

***** The Alley that is directly connected to the largest shopping center we see in the show?

It's a silly idea that only works in a kids story that such a place is full of illegal items.

*** It could also be that the trace just doesn´t work around wands that aren´t traced, like the trace on the wand can recognize other wands near it and deactivates itself for the time being. Though one solution that is very simple, if not very elegant, is that Dobby just somehow made his magic activate the trace in an attempt to keep him from going to Hogwarts. I actually kinda like the second explanation because it also explains why he didn´t get an expulsion letter after Harry blew up aunt Marge like a balloon, I know he wouldn´t have been thrown out because of politics, but an automated response should´ve come nonetheless. It´s just that only magic with a wand registers and accidental or wandless magic doesn´t, though the graveyard scene opens a anther can of worms.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11234854/1/The-Trace][Here's my take on it.]]

Somewhat revisionist in that the Statute of Secrecy was officially established in the 1600s and this story has it in effect in the 1400s.

** I think that trace traces magic performed where there shouldnt be any kind of magical activity or when there there is a sudden surge of magic and then they compare it to the closest magical child. Dobby- Sudden levitation charm. No previous instance of magic. Lumos while trying to escape dementors- There were dementors which are highly magical creatue. And the lumos was performed wandlessly(But doesnot explain how the patronus was detected. Maybe because it is such a powerful spell??) Tonks packing for him with magic- There were already witches and wizards present in his house. And i also think some wards also play a role somewhere. But i could also be making very wrong assumptions. What do i know? Just a simple muggle.

** Maybe Dobby was under 17 too? Or the spell is set to detect anything that's not from a wizard 17+.
