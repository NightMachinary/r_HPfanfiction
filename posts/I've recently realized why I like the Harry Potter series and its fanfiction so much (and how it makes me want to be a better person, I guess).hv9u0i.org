I grew up reading HP and it was a big part of my childhood. I suppose I was lucky enough to have been part of the generation that grew up together with Harry, as the books were released. I remember being 10, finishing PoA and then starting to read it again.\\
After the series ended, I was in my teenage years, so I sort of grew out of the fandom (and the horrible film series even made me dislike HP for a while) and started reading more "serious" literature, and writing.

So, a few years ago, now in my mid 20s, I gave it a reread, and it impacted me much more than it had before.\\
To add some context, my 20s have sort of been a shitshow. I developed depression at uni, shunned a lot of my friends, and consequently gained some physical illnesses as well. So, like a lot of people in similar situations, I often found comfort in fiction (because escape is of course the easiest way of dealing with shit).\\
The reread was a most intense reading experience I've ever had, I openly sobbed and laughed many times. Afterwards, I started reading fanfiction, and it sort of became a constant in my life.

At some point I realized that I enjoy stories that feature James and/or Sirius present in Harry's life, so I thought about why that is.\\
My own father dies when I was 5, and, well, he was quite similar to James Potter. He was a very charismatic bloke, an athlete, and had a group of very close friends. Just one of those people everyone likes. I also happen to look very much like him. His friends have always cared a lot for me, I suppose because I remind them of him. Tho, somehow, I always felt guilty, like I am making them feel sad just because I make them think of him. I mean, just two months ago I met a one of them whom I hadn't seen in like 15 years, and he recognized me, we talked a bit and he hugged me and said "You know, I loved your dad very much".

I had always thought that not having a father didn't have such a big influence on me. I mean, I have very few memories of him, and I was lucky enough to still have a very happy childhood and adolescence. However, I've come to realize that during this harder period of my life, I needed a father more than ever, even though I am an adult now. I needed someone who knows how it feels to be a young man with growing responsibilities. And so, weirdly, I found a lot of comfort in fanfiction.\\
And it helped me, actually. It's still a long road ahead of me to become a happy person, but I am in a much better place than I had been before.

I guess I am sharing this here because I don't really have anyone in my life I am comfortable enough to talk to about it irl (at least not while sober), and I felt a need to.\\
Hopefully, it doesn't come off as pretentious, pathetic or dumb.


** Talking to sympathetic strangers has long been a coping mechanism. They're less likely to judge you or try to "fix" you. Most of us aren't bartenders or hairdressers, but we're still glad to lend a virtual ear.

I wish you well on your journey. Just remember that life IS the journey, not the destination.

I didn't need such a personal attack. It's kind of funny though- the stereotype for fanfiction was that of teenage girls but now it seems to be depressed blokes in their 20s.

Anyway, I read the books as a kid and only discovered that there is tons of fanfiction in English in my 20s. Though I disocovered it in a roundabout way- watching a video on youtube about easter eggs in The Talos Principle (awesome game BTW). Mind you, only reading fanfiction can become tiresome. It's important to branch out to other books from time to time.

** My confession: I only got into the fandom last year at the age of 21. For me, it was something that I've never experienced before. I could never care for fictional characters this much and I was kinda lost in a state where I didn't really care for any fandom. Why it's important? I'll explain it.

I'm a socially awkward and mostly emotionally numb person and I'm pretty much unable to feel anything other than anxiety and hatred if I'm not experiencing it through a fictional character. This series came and gave it to me. The best way I can describe it that it feels like I'm slowly becoming a human with its help. Before that, I was just a biomass of existential pain.

I always tried to write and do art but I always got bored and never really finished anything. Writing fanfiction and doing fanart really did the trick for me that pushed me out of being a 100% unproductive mess. I still struggle with staying motivated because of my mental health but I guess I would've given up art and writing by now if there was no Harry Potter.

Just to clarify, I don't self insert myself into the stories in my writings. I empathize with the characters, but I often provide them with my own traits and flaws. Sometimes I even alter their backstories to be similar to my own life, like making Luna a wannabe illustrator or making Hermione like Slawomir Mrozek. I really don't know if everyone does it the same way to some extent or not.

** My Dad died a couple months ago, so any story dealing with fatherhood is suddenly hitting me /waaay/ different. Especially Grow Young With Me, for probably obvious reasons.

** Thanks for sharing with us. Often sharing with strangers is easier than anyone you know. (In fact, children/young people are more likely to disclose an issue to a supply teacher than their own, so it's true for all ages.)

I got into fanfiction very young, so the types of stories I've read have changed and refined over time. Around the time I came out, I read similar types of stories. When I was sad but not quite understanding why, I found myself drawn to hurt comfort and when I pieced together that my family really was dysfunctional (no, I don't know how I was so slow on the uptake either) and to this day I really do love fics where someone realises things are amiss and takes Harry under their wing.

With regard to your dad's friends - your feelings are completely your own and understandable. It's also possible that, rather than hurting your dad's friend - he's actually found someone he feels he can share those sorts of thoughts even though it's been so many years since he passed.

** I can relate in some ways - I love the stories where one/both of his parents don't die, or he gains a parental figure. I lost my mom at 20, and it was devastating. I had read the book with her as a preteen/teen, and even the first re-read after losing her was like a revelation. I didn't appreciate at age 11 what it was really like to be an orphan -- I still don't, having had my mom that long, but I can relate a little more to it. And re-reading after having a child myself is a whole other level. Now I'm the grownup who has a kid, and reading about Harry facing all of that - alone or with other kids - just kills me as a parent. I didn't quite process as a kid how fucked the lack of supervision at Hogwarts is.
