:END:
Hello everyone!\\
I'm a desperate man on a desperate search. My partner really wants to read this one James Potter/Regulus Black fic from years ago, but as far as they know it's disappeared from the internet.\\
It's been a few years so the details are fuzzy, but they think it was about James developing a crush on Regulus when both of them were already in some sort of relationship with other people, so they were in this secret thing together that they were hiding from Reg's parents.\\
They think there were two parts, the first one was called something like "Don't Make a Sound" and the sequel was called "Shout out Loud." They read them around 2014-2015, but now cannot find them anywhere. They think this is because the author went on to become a published author and couldn't keep them up anymore?\\
If that sounds familiar to anyone, or if anyone has archives of said fanfics squirreled away somewhere, that would be great. Thank you for reading!
