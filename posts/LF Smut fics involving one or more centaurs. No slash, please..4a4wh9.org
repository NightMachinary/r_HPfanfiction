I'm not entirely sure if this classifies as bestiality or not.

** I know you said no slash and this is a joke request, but [[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/hp_beholder/12471.html][there actually exists]] a Severus/Firenze fic., with accompanying and well done art. I didn't read it, but the quality of work for such a weird pairing was amazing to me.

*** I love that story, actually. It's on my recs list. The author is very good, and the fic ends up being rather melancholy because it's as much a character study as it is a smut fic. The art is lovely, although Firenze's human half looks awfully delicate. But one of the artist's trademarks is attenuated human anatomy, where everyone looks rather gangly and graceful (unless they're Snape).

He'll protect what is his, and nothing else... that doesn't mean he'll won't deal with Voldy when the time comes.
