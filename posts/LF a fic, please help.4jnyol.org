Looking for a fic that for the life of me I can not remember. Some things I can remember: Harry and Fluer are close Fluer has a best friend that gets on really well with Harry but gets badly injured and has to go back to france. I think they we're multiple champions from each school

I literally can not remember anything else about it and it is bugging the fricking hell out of me.

Any help is appreciated.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
