Ever wonder how Petunia convinced Vernon that magic was real? Ever wonder why Vernon hates magic with such passion? How about why Draco reminded Harry of Dudley?

Now you know. Vernon Dursley was born the elder brother of Lucius Malfoy, when it was discovered that he was a squib he was sent off to be adopted by a muggle family, but he never forgot that HE should be the aristocratic Malfoy heir and HE should have gone to Hogwarts and HE should have married that lovely Narcissa.


** Dudley and Draco are very similar in canon, probably bacause their fathers had similar parenting styles, influenced by their own childhood as brothers.

**** To be fair, we don't get to see any of his interactions just with Petunia and we have no idea of either of their backgrounds (beyond knowing the Evanses are from Cokeworth). The Evans parents don't make an appearance.

We don't know if it's Petunia herself who chose to be a SAHM/housewife. Yes, we do know that Petunia was jealous of Lily when they were children. But there is a long gap between eleven and seventeen. Once she accepted that she wasn't a witch, did she actually want a career but just decide to settle for Vernon, did she marry because she thought she was pleasing her parents by marrying rich, or did she aim for a more traditional marriage with someone who could provide for her and her children?

I'm not defending their raising of Harry /or/ Dudley as being anything but vile ‘parenting'. But horrible parents don't always make horrible spouses.

It doesn't necessarily follow that he made her do all the chores and treated her like the Gaunts treated Merope, for example. Canon leaves a lot of room for interpretation.

***** Remember how Neville grew up? He was basically tortured to get him to reveal his powers, and the Longbottoms are supposed to be a light side family. I can only imagine how much worse Vernon would have been treated by a family like the Malfoys. Perhaps his raising of Dudley was a twisted attempt to make sure his son NEVER felt like he had throughout his childhood. He took it way too far, of course, and the way he treated Harry was abominable (though perhaps related to the same issue), but that's what trauma can do to a person.

** I just got an idea about Vernon getting pushed off a pier (like Neville) in an attempt to manifest his magic. His family believes that he drowned and he is rescued by Muggles. He meets Petunia at school and they bond over calculus (more like Vernon saves Petunia from a slow death by calculus) and eventually their mutual hatred of wizards. They get married and vow to live a perfectly normal life (a plan that doesn't go exactly the way they want). I'll probably write this over my break next week.

** Vernon may not be a squib, but he does have to be immediately adjacent to a witch or wizard, because the situation at the Dursleys doesn't make any sense, otherwise. Vernon shouldn't know about magic, period. Muggles who learn about magic get obliviated, and the only exceptions we've EVER seen are nonmagicals who are immediately related to a magical, as in parents, children, or brothers and sisters.

Vernon Dursley must either be a squib, or he must have a brother or sister who is a witch or wizard. There is no other explanation for why he knows about magic, AND has such an incredibly strong opinion about it. Some authors have tried to invent some sort of 'incident' at the Potter wedding that made Vernon hate magic so much, but that has two problems: the first being the intensity of the hatred, and how lasting it is. It's hard to imagine some prank or accident having that much of an effect, even with the Marauders involved. And the second being, why Vernon was allowed to keep those memories. He should have been obliviated if something like that had happened to him.

The only explanation that makes sense is that someone on the Dursley side of the family is a witch or wizard, and Vernon is directly and immediately related to them. This MUST be true, given what we know of Vernon and how the Ministry conducts the business of Oblivations. We don't know who they are, or what they're doing with their life, or what happened to make Vernon hate magic so much (the Squib answer is the easiest one, here, it's envy), but we know it must be true. Vernon isn't as "normal" as he wants to pretend he is. He must have some involvement with magic, somehow. If he did not, he would not know about it or have such a strong opinion on it. He would be totally ignorant.
