Both the Goblet of Fire and Mirror of Erised are powerful magical artefacts. Dumbledore made it such that whoever wants to find the stone but does not want to use it can take it out. I was wondering if the Mirror of Erised can be confounded to give the stone to anyone who wishes to use the stone.


** Probably. It seems like the kind of hilariously obvious option most magicals would miss.

If memory serves, the confounding of the Goblet was to get it to accept a fourth school, not to get Harry's name in. For that, the Goblet of Fire had an easier route - remember when they asked if he'd gotten someone else to put the name in? If they asked about it, that means it probably would've worked. So, the confounding was specifically interfering with the basic functions of the Goblet, meaning that confounding (I think I've written that word too many times now) the Mirror would also be able to affect its basic programming, so I think it would work on that level. I don't fully remember if Dumbledore's thing was an additional spell or a feature of the Goblet though, so I guess it would depend on whether it would work on extra spells or just the Goblet's main enchantments/functions. I would say yes, but it'd have to be cast more strongly than Dumbledore's protection.

Not at all. The part about the age line and the person entering the name themselves was a modern addition, not part of the Goblet's enchantments, which were: "Select a worthy Champion for each school from the pool of claimants entered."

This is where the part about the four schools is relevant. Instead of forcing Harry to be selected instead of Cedric (which would mean going against whichever criteria Goblet uses for its choices) a fourth school was added, with the selection pool of one.

That would mean, only input would be manipulated. Four schools insead of three, four lists instead of three thus four champions.

â€‹

This does not affect the success of the Mirror attempt, however. Mirror could still be convinced that who is before it is in fact Luna Lovegood, there to get the stone simply as a matter of curiosity.

**** That's what I was attempting to say - might not've been what I did say, I admit (my language skills degrade massively when I'm tired) but it was what I was going for. :D

Getting Harry's name into the Goblet could've been done differently with the other person name thing, but the confundus didn't deal with getting his name into the Goblet, it was to get it to think there was a fourth school. That was the basic programming thing, and I was using the 'getting other person to put the name in' thing to say that it wasn't to get Harry's name into the Goblet, because there was an easier way to do that. It was to get a fourth school accepted, which meant that his name would be picked.

I don't know if that paragraph makes any more sense than the original, but I'm definitely trying to agree with you here. :D

***** I can't remember the name of the Fic but I read one where the confundus wasn't needed as the Goblet was designed to select the best champion for each school. So if there were 4 school names used the goblet would pick 4 champions if there were 7 schools used the Goblet would pick 7 champions. There was a different fic (again I'll have to see if I can find it) where the number of schools was a "parameter' that could be "set" on the Goblet.

****** I imagine the confundus would still be possibly needed, in order to secretly change the number from the officially set three to four, but yeah, that would definitely simplify matters for Crouch Jr. :D
