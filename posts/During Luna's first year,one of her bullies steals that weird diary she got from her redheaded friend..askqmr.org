The bully must be a canon character.


** While not the only choice I believe you could use malfoy for this. He wasn't really well informed during cos

*** Problem with that is its implied 99% of her bullying is done by Ravenclaw solely, best to have a Ravenclaw, maybe Terry Boot or Anthony Goldstein?

**** I think this is a great idea, would be fun to see a git who isn't from slytherin. That said if anyone is in that last 1% is likely draco, though admittedly he has few reasons in cos, other than being a insufferable pureblood, to bully her.

** My entire life is a lie.

This whole time, I genuinely thought Luna was the same year as Harry.

*** But Ginny literally says that "Luna's in my year, but in Ravenclaw," when she's introduced.

**** I have no clue. I think maybe because she spends so much time around the Golden Trio and with Neville. I think I've probably had this conversation at least once already with my sister, but it's already ingrained in me that Luna was the same age as harry. She doesn't get a real intro til later on anyway, so I just assumed she was always there from book one.
