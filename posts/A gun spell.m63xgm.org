Now there are fics where some characters use guns which i find ridiculous because magic can be used to disable said gun in many ways. BUT. What about inventing a gun spell? It should be simple. Conjure a 556 bullet , spin it and banish at at 990 m/s and you have a magical AR 15. Are there any fics where someone invents a spell that does this all at once? Should be a cool one shot.


** That sounds like a piercing hex with extra steps.

*** Depends on how that hex and magic in general works in your universe?

Is it a magical construct that disintegrates a column of material on impact? Protego or shields that disrupt magical structures (if those exist) might counter that.

Or maybe it conjures an object from thin air? Conjurations tend to be reversed or undone entirely by powerful wizards.

Maybe using a "real" object, as in "not created or transformed by magic" might be beneficial. Like, in my head canon, magic can /either/ quick and dirty force an object (or a part of the world) into a required state (match to needle, rags to clothes, wood to chair), /or/ permanently change the very being of the object/materials, so that it doesn't change back later, at the expense of "magic energy", time, or some kind of ritual.

So under these rules, undoing or disrupting a conjured object is as "simple" as overpowering the magic that holds the object real, same for reverting a transfiguration unless it's permanent. Magic is forcing the reality to change, and reality /really/ doesn't want to be changed and wants to go back.

** That's a tall order---unless it's crack (no pun intended) illustrating how impractical it is.

The biggest advantages that guns have over spells are rate of fire (if automatic), effective range (due to being easier to aim), and maybe projectile speed (assuming spells move slower than bullets). linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5) explores all these well.

The spell you describe seems to be a very complicated way to lose two out of three of those advantages without gaining anything in return over and above an actual gun. Unless you have non-canon magic that, say, specifically targets firearms and has a large area of effect, if you are able to disable someone's gun with magic, you can probably able to disable their wand, or even the whole person.

*** It could be a useful spell for making it /look/ like someone was killed by a muggle, however.

Maybe also if the way transfiguration works in your conception of magic makes it impossible to transfigure a gun with the sights lined up.

Why not just steal a real gun and use that, though?

Same question as above.

***** An actual gun is better, of course, but maybe you didn't think to do that ahead of time, and don't want to risk secrecy by summoning the nearest one (and that might take a while depending on how far away it is).

****** You know, I think there /is/ a one-shot in this, but it needs to be structured just right. Maybe something along the lines of "How did I get here?" doing something as absurd and complicated as this, and then narrating backwards the comedy of errors that had led the narrator to the present situation.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** That sort of does happen, although never explicitly. Often a standard tactic in fanfic fighting is to 'banish' conjured or summoned projectiles such as pieces of rubble at their opponent. A typical example might be 'summon a marble block to stop a killing curse, it is shattered on impact so banish the shards at your opponent' which is effectively a magical shotgun blast.

** One way this could work would be if magic can't easily affect an object, but inertia still applies---at the end of the day having a tungsten slug accelerated into something at mach 7 is going to be a Very Bad Day for anything in the flight path, assuming whoever designed the protection didn't think of this.

** A far better option is to enhance guns with magic. If Arthur Weasley can charm a Ford Anglia to fly and go invisible, it should be a lot easier to make guns that:

- have vastly expanded magazines
- have magically cooled barrels
- are lightened and recoil free

But why stop here? Why not create magical bullets that can carry Unforgivables, especially Avada Kedavra? Now your magically enhanced gun will be able to fire killing curses:

- at 500 RPM, or at least twenty times faster than spelling it out
- without emotional component
- at least twice the range
- far more accurately because no need for complex wand movement
