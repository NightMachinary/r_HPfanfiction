** As someone who reads a lot of XO fics and loves Mass Effect XOers, yeah.

But I want to give you some advice. There are a good handful of fics that start out like yours already and most if not all of them have been abandoned and gone nowhere.

So the first thing you need to do is figure out what exactly the outline of your fic is. Because there are many that get 10 chapters in and abandoned and we haven't even gotten through what would be quarter of the first game. With ME, it's really easy to get bogged down in the details. If you want to write a 300k word epic, go for it but know that it's a serious commitment and some people will get incredibly bogged down by it.

Next, what exactly would having HP or the magical world in the ME universe do? Are wizards just hyper-powerful biotics? Is the Statue of Secrecy still relevant when biotics are a thing? I think you should focus on HP, and not the magical world because introducing the magical world will probably create more plot and world building problems than anything else. Especially because of my next point.

Next, you're also having a MoD HP which means that he would be an outlier amongst the wizarding community which means that you'd have to scale the power levels of everything appropriately. Which means HP is either a god or has a meaningless title with a niche perk. And if HP is a god, how does this impact the story? How can the Reapers/rest of the galaxy fight against someone who can never die or has so much power he can devastate the galaxy with a flick of his wand? Or is the MoD really nothing special in which case it's a useless title? Is Harry then just another member of Shepard's team? That's an interesting angle, but has it's own separate issues.

Now I don't mean any of this to attack you or your idea, I love OP!Harry and love XOers. I would never tell an author not to write, but since you seem to have a genuine interest I want to level with you my qualms and thoughts as a reader. If you haven't already taken a read at some of the existing XOer fics, I highly recommend you do. But it seems like you already have. Feel free to hit me up if you have questions or just want to talk it out more.

**** I'm pressed on time so here's some HP/ME stuff:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10784770/1/Harry-Potter-Geth][Harry Potter: Geth]]: The Geth make Harry a pretty dangerous cyborg in this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12595819/1/Getting-Too-Old-For-This][Getting Too Old For This]]: This is basically the same premise as Op's, but the author is pretty hilarious. Whether Harry is OP is on the table, but since he's immortal I'd argue it a null point. If you vaguely remember this, the author removed it then fully rewrote it like a year later.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11304904/1/Madness-Effect][Madness Effect]]: This is the third story in a series, Harry is a mad scientist who is pretty OP. I'd suggest reading the previous two stories.

You might also just check [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Mass-Effect-Crossovers/224/2927/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10&c1=1][the HP/ME section]] and look for things that say MoD!Harry, there are a lot.

I'll probably add more stuff in a bit.

  Harry's unspeakably bored, and bored Unspeakables make bad decisions. Like jumping through the Veil of Death, when they're barely even certain it's safe. Now where it goes, on the other hand... That's still a mystery. But hey! Adventure, right?...Right? - Harry steps through the Veil, and into Mass Effect. The Reapers won't know what hit them. MODHarry.

  It's the year 2185CE. Commander Jane Shepard is recruiting members to bring with her on a mission against the Collectors and the Reapers. Among the candidates is Dr. Harry Potter, the reclusive mad scientist who has been missing for twenty years. Who knows what he was doing during that time? Rated M to be sure.

  Harry Potter finds himself, and his normal bi-polar luck, pulled out of a quiet retirement and into the limelight of the 23rd century. He finds a grand new stage upon which his 'saving-people-thing' can act, and before he can say no, is pulled into the middle of a galaxy-spanning conflict. Rated 'M' for bad words and eventual sexy shenanigans, re-worked and re-posted. Enjoy.

**** That;s actually a pretty novel idea at least as far as I've experienced. I whole-heartedly approve of that idea when it comes to magical society! This would allow Harry to be a reluctant veteran forced out in to the thick of it again with the attack on Eden. I definitely see the potential there. Go for it.

Harry acting as more like a capable combat veteran with the rest MoD title being more of a quirk is a good call. I like the approach you're taking.

So I think the biggest questions I have here now that I have a better understanding of what you want to do are so:

I like that you're leaning towards Shepard's POV. Harry could just be another member of the ME ensemble that brings his own flares and abilities to the table. I like it alot. I would hope you approach a more grounded, just another member of the crew approach like Harry from Brown Coat, Green Eyes. That's a good fic to get some ideas for how to make your ensemble. How will Harry fit into the cast? With the grizzled veteran whose strong but rough around the edges approach, he could fill a personality slot somewhere between Garrus and Wrex. Start to plot out who his dynamic will work with the rest of the crew.

If Saren is captured, you're going to have to go super AU. What did you have planned? This is a super interesting take that not alot of writers seem to have taken.

** I like Mass Effect and read quite a few fanfics in that universe but there's one reoccurring issue. Most stories stick way too close to the stations of canon. It's always the same missions, the characters always say the same things (based on the dialouge opinions) and it's always the same squad.

In the HP Fandom we have a deluge of slash which are in no way based on the books. But for Mass Effect there seems to be the rule that only canon pairings are allowed. Good luck finding some decent fics with a FemShep/Tali or Tali/Liara romance. And the background characters are almost never developed. Just look at the amount of fics with characters like Tonks, Daphne Greengrass or anyone from the 70s and compare that to stories with characters like Sheila, Kal'Reegar or the Consort.

While the HP Fandom sometimes goes too far off the rails, Mass Effect lacks creativity when it comes to characters and plot. If you want to write a crossover please don't make it a retelling of all missions with Harry added to the mix. Have Tali choose Shepard at Freedoms Progress, Liara not get involved with the Shadow Broker, Shepard screw over Cerberus in a different way or even just replace Jack with Sheila. Be creative.

** I've read a few, as the setting is very interesting. I also think it's pretty easy to just make it a fusion by having the ME stuff just be the HP timeline's future.

There's always seems to be a few problems though, but it's the same problems you find in any crossover, in that Harry usually ends up as extremely OP, and goes from this random guy trying to not get involved to being the solution to all problems.

There also has to be more to it than simply inserting Harry into the plot and still hitting upon all the normal plot points and everything happening the same way.

Is Harry just joining the crew, if so, how will he affect their missions. Think about cause and effect when interjecting a MoD Harry into the mix.

Another thing to consider, how powerful is Harry. Does he have ultra MoD powers and knows Death on a first name basis or is it more vague and mysterious. All things to consider.

**** I humbly suggest a "no aging" but not immortal take on MoD!Harry. I've read that in one or two other fics, and I liked it. Harry still has to be careful, so no (or less) going in guns blazing recklessness, but still old and wise HP. Or maybe something like he can die, but will slowly come back to life in some painful way so it's not an easy fix.

That avoids a lot of the easy solutions, such as just sending in the immortal guy with a bomb.

** The summary is nothing unique here when it comes to this particular XO, but I always welcome more addition to any kind of XO :P.

On the other hand, count me out if it's going to be anything like HP: Geth, or anything from that XO's top favorite list, or a canon rehash with little change after Harry was inserted into the story. While I can't claim myself to be an expert in ME's lore, I've played the trilogy numerous times already, and don't need to read about it again.

If it's none of the above... well, color me intrigued. As long as your MOD Harry (or the Geth behind him like in a certain story) doesn't turn out to be the solution to everything, it will be fine.

If he's a powerhouse, then make it his only role. Don't also write him to be a charismatic leader or an expert about Prothean as a side job.

He's a master of infiltration with Disillusion and the Cloak? There you go, just don't make him a god on the battlefield as well... You get the idea.

**** Whoa spoiler :(.

What I meant to say was that don't try to put everything onto Harry alone. Either a specialization, or versatile at the cost of power. Too often than not you can see a MOD Harry who is BOTH versatile and powerful, who has the solution for every situation he's in, which isn't very interesting nor it leaves many chances to develope the background cast.

** If you haven't started yet, I would highly recommend considering striking out on your own path, plot-wise. I think every well-written (grammar, characterisation, etc) ME HP crossover I've come across has been a rehash of one of the game storylines. Of course, if you have some way of gleefully subverting the ME plotline, then by all means; but otherwise I think there's a lot of fertile ground to cover in the wider universe rather than the same plot as usual.

Most importantly, have fun. Feel free to ignore everything else if you are enjoying yourself!

*** Thanks for the feedback!

Currently, I'm considering a huge deviation in the form of Saren being captured on Eden Prime from the get-go. But, I have to work out what that would mean in the long-run for characters and plot (like Tali, Wrex, Liara, ME3 when the Reapers have arrived, etc.).

I do want to stick to some form of familiarity, and for that reason Shepard will most likely be the POV character.

**** Will Shepard and Harry be the same person or different characters? I've seen both done and they can both work.

If Saren is captured, I guess there must be Reaper contingencies that come into play. Or they underestimate him and he has a glorious prison break!

** I think I'd like it, actually.

I think I'd like a fic where most. Of the characters end up on the Normandy.

But then again, I like to think about who would be friends with each other if the Canon were to collide.

For example, I think Liara and Hermione would probably get along well. And I think that Garrus and Snape would probably get along well, but Snape and Miranda would hate each other because they're both very bitchy.

I think Mcgonagall and Samara would be best friends, and Harry would get along well with Kaidan.

I think I enjoy thinking about HP meets Discworld à bit more because I love the thought of Mcgonagall and Granny Weatherwax meeting, and I think that both Vimes and Vetinari would hate Dumbledore in a most amusing way.

** Might be a bit late to jump in here but I'm a fan of both these series but am yet to be convinced by a single cross over of the two. Fundamentally my issues boil down to the strength of the Reapers. They're unbeatable. You don't win the Mass Effect games you find the magical off switch. What this means is you have to shift some power balances or else you're stuck with Mass Effect canon but this time with the wise ol' Harry Potter, resident wizard onboard, the only changes is instead of guns and grenades he tosses around spells. The solution has to be the same. The only way around this I've seen is magic and complex electronics don't always get on well at places like Hogwarts. Could magic fry the reapers who are basically computers?

To me a more interesting area would be the first contact war. The Reapers are a story that's been done. Take for a moment the idea that the Human Systems Alliance joined the citadel to avoid a prolonged conflict with the Turians. Humanity entered as a bitch species. If that deal ended the war was there a referendum, were the people ever given a choice, could we have existed separately? Humanity hates being told what to do. Cerberus is born as a political movement headed by the illusive man. Who is more illusive than the man who wears deaths own cloak. A jaded old man with a mysterious past who objects to being told what to do by people who are 'older and wiser'. There have to be parallels between the way the Assari control the Citadel and Dumbledore. You can also see the way human technology is being stolen by the STG, humanity its being exploited because they were late to the party, parallels to Muggleborns vs Purebloods. The one advantage humanity has, magic. How does Harry Pottter carve humanity its own place in the stars?

** Probably - Hell, I'd love one where Harry is the Illusive Man (TIM)...if he's been around for centuries that would explain TIM's wealth and connections, not to mention seeing himself as a guardian of humanity (without actually hating the other races - hell, weren't there hints that TIM has a relationship with an Asari? Would make sense with an immortal Harry (who is TIM) because the other people live short lives compared to an Asari!)
