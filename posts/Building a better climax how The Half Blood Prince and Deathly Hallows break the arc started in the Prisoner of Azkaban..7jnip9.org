This is an AU idea that heavily diverges after The Order of the Phoenix however there are a few changes that happen prior to this that serve to improve the central conflict.

Starting with the central conflict if you look at books 3, 4, and 5 there is a trend that emerges. Book three introduces us to Dementors and the Patronus charm. We also learn that driving off one Dementor is an impressive feat and that the Patronus charm itself is very hard to master (Remus tells us this and Madam Bones is surprised when she learns Harry can produce a fully formed Patronus) . We are also told about one of the greatest feats of magic Dumbledore performs: driving the Dementors station at Hogwarts away after they attack Harry. At the end of book 3 Harry mirrors Dumbledore's feat although the effort is exhausting for him(to be fair he tried to fight the Dementors before as well and that likely weakened him some prior to this.)

Book 4 after surviving the Maze and being tortured by Voldemort Harry manages to match Voldemort in a contest of will and escape. We know this too is a rare feat as there are only five people we know for sure who are capable of this Dumbledore, James and Lily, and Frank and Alice. Between the Maze, the torture, the duel and contest of wills Harry is again exhausted but was able to match feats once more with a much older and very powerful wizard.

Book 5 Harry witnesses the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort and observes what it takes to defeat Tom Riddle. Harry realizes watching them duel that the best he can do is keep up with the action let alone hold his own in a duel. Yes he has the power to rival Dumbledore and yes he is just as strong willed as Voldemort but he lacks the skills to defeat Voldemort currently. Then Harry learns about the prophecy which says that the child chosen by Voldemort will be his equal.

So what happens in Books 6 & 7? Well in Book 6 we don't see Harry working toward becoming Voldemort's equal he is learning about horcruxes from Dumbledore but otherwise does not bother training or improving himself in anyway. This is most obvious in his fight with Snape at the end of Book 6 where Snape does not even see Harry as a threat. Book 7 gives us the same climax between Harry and Voldemort as Book 4 and there is no tension throughout their final fight as we know Harry will win this after all he did win previously.

So how might this be made better? First are the changes that happen before Book 6.

- Professor McGonagall introduces Harry to the Wizarding World. Several reasons for this change. First, it is her job to introduce muggleborn/raised students to magic. Second, she will be able to tell Harry about his parents. Third, she will be better able to bring the fear of magic down on the Dursleys and make sure Harry is treated better and can have clothes that are not his cousins hand-me downs.
- McGonagall saves Harry at the climax of Book 1 this helps to build a better relationship between Harry and his Head of House and turn to her for advice about classes and stories about his parents. *Harry takes Care of Magical Creatures, Ancient Runes (which is just a language (Warding, Curse breaking and Enchanting should be NEWTs level courses which Runes is required for), and Arthimancy (Which is a prerequisite for the Ritual magic and Spell crafting NEWTs)
- Other class changes Astronomy classes start 3rd year as an elective and is a prerequisite for the Ritual magic newt. Instead students take one of two classes Muggle studies (liberalized and kept modern likely taught by Ted Tonks) for Students raised in the Magical World and Wizarding Culture(insisted on by the board of Governors when Dumbledore proposed the mandatory Muggle Studies course) for Muggleborn/raised students (Taught by Daphine/Astoria Greengrass' Mother). At the end of two years students are given a test to see if they have mastered the information of if they need further study. If they pass then they can take an extra elective if they desire.
- Harry takes Hermione to the Yule Ball she is one of his Best Friends and has always had his back it just makes sense. This also starts their relationship.
- Harry is the prefect 5th year. Dumbledore may not want to get too close to Harry but Dumbledore still supports Harry and this is a way to protect him from other students. Draco and Pansy are not prefects (Dumbledore knows Voldemort is back is not about to allow two vocal Pure Blood Supremacists to be put in positions of power over other students (Daphine Greengrass and Baize Zabini will be Slytherin's prefects). This is a minor change over all but makes more sense. Also now Ron can be Quidditch Captain 6th year which fits him better and give Harry more time to Study/train latter on.

Changes in Book 6:

- Summer training: instead of going back to the Dursley's Harry stays at Number 12 Grimmauld place where Nymphadora Tonks, Remus Lupin, and Andromeda Tonks teach him more useful magic. Nymphadora teaches him Auror level combat magic, Remus teaches him various counter curses and defensive spells, and Andromeda Tonks teaches him every curse the Black family library has to offer.
- Harry and Draco's first fight. Instead of this conflict happening on the train and Draco jumping Harry it happens on the path leading up to Hogwarts. Draco hears a twig snap and realizes he is being followed (Snape told him Potter has an invisibility cloak and a map of the school to help Draco with his task) and tells Draco tells his friends to go on ahead he forgot something on the train. Then Draco and Harry fight should be clear that Draco is out matched but can hold his own with deadly and obscure curses Draco spots Luna who had taken the opportunity to wander the woods on her way to the school and fires a severing curse at her. Harry cannot shield her from the spell so he jumps in from and takes the curse for her. Luna heals Harry from the effects of the spell and Luna asks him if he wants to go to the Hospital wing Harry says no and they make their way to the Great Hall. Hermione asks where he was and after telling her what happened she agrees that they need to watch Malfoy.
- Bathroom Fight between Harry and Draco. This fight is basically fine as presented in the books as it teaches Harry the dangers of using curses recklessly. The only changes are that Harry is keeping Draco on the defensive the entire fight and Harry sees Draco's Dark Mark during the duel and attacks Snape for trying to save Draco. Snape holds Harry off with ease but cannot counter attack without leaving Draco to die. Harry does not get detention (Draco attacked first and tried to use unforgivables during the fight) but during his chat with Dumbledore Harry is told to leave Draco alone and Dumbledore make Harry a deal if Draco is left alone Harry can come with on the next horcrux hunt.
- Harry vs Draco & Harry vs Snape As Snape is leading Draco away after Dumbledore dies Harry manages to separate them by banishing Snape down a flight of stairs. Then Harry and Draco have their final duel and Harry crushes Draco (Draco was clearly unprepared for the full scope of what being a Death Eater meant and it shows in their duel). Snape makes his way back up the stairs only to see Harry deliver the killing blow. Unable to prevent Draco's death his oath drives him to attack Harry and in a lengthy duel Harry wins cutting off Snape's hand and snapping his wand. Snape escapes when Harry hears Hermione scream and Harry runs towards her. Hermione had been helping Nymphadora duel Bellatrix only to be hit with the Cruciatus curse. Harry shows up and the three of them drive her off.

Book 7

- There should be three events going on throughout this book: The wizarding civil war, the Horcrux hunt and the search for the deadly hallows.
- The wizarding civil war in the books Voldemort just taking over and that ending the war just ends a plot line. Instead while the bulk of the Order is attending Bill and Fleur's wedding Voldemort and the Death Eaters attack the ministry and while they are driven off the bulk of the ministry's forces are seriously hurt or wounded. This takes them out of the fight and forces the Order under the leadership of Moody to fight the Death Eaters directly. The trio also participates in this fighting their way up the Death Eater totem pole staring with the Malfoys, Crabbs and Goyles and working up to fighting Bellatrix and taking the cup (which is not in Gringotts because why would Bellatrix trust a treasure Voldemort gave her to filthy Goblins. In the climatic battle at Hogwarts as Voldemort realizes where Harry is and what he is doing after they attack Bellatrix and take the cup he goes to secure his last Horcrux (Nagini was killed in the battle for the ministry (sorry Nevile we will give you another way to be a badass)). The Battle of Hogwarts goes much as it did in canon with a few edits Nevile /Hermione kill Bellatrix, Ron kills Fenrir saving Lavender, Remus and Tonks kill Dolohov and Travers (and survive). Harry and Voldemort have a massive drag out battle in which Harry proves himself the true master of the Deathly Hallows (His holly wand takes on the shape of the elder wand (Dumbledore's turned back to its normal shape)) the resurrection stone comes to him and he still has his cloak of course) and he kills Voldemort.
- The Horcrux Hunt the major focus of this should be the finding of Slytherin's locket which various Death Eaters should also be looking for. The bulk of this section should take place in Knockturn Alley which is where Mundungus fenced it. And then realizing Bellatrix has one, and that the last one is in Hogwarts.
- The Deathly Hallows Voldemort is looking for an edge over Harry after failing to best him in Book 4 and failing to hear the prophesy in book 5 he doesn't know how Harry is able to oppose him and is looking for anything to tilt the scale he hunts down and discovers that Dumbledore had the elder wand but when he attempts to steal it from Dumbledore's tomb he discovers it is gone. Then when Belletrix informs him she lost his cup he decides to stage an attack on Hogwarts before Harry can learn where the diadem is. He and his Army arrive but not Hogwarts is ready and the Order is there triggering the final battle.


** Tl;dr Canon Harry is lazy. OP wishes fewer good guys had died in the final battle and that McGonagall was more supportive (to little effect).

*** Man TL;DR is right you missed the entire point of this focusing on minor details instead. The point is to keep building up to the epic showdown between Harry/Voldemort in Book 7 instead of the disappointment of Book 6/7 Harry and friends. I mean they go from fighting inner circle Death Eaters in book 5 to getting captured by tier 3 baddies who are not good enough to be Death Eaters in Book 7.

**** Yeah, the last 2 books sucked in comparison but I think your list of changes are overlong for the payoffs. There are plenty of fics where Harry improves himself in 4th/5th/6th year and several where there is a proper war with the death eaters. (And I agree that Harry should have been in that war gaining experience.)

However, very few of those have McGonagall rescuing him from Quirrelmort.

***** See I think the arc prior to the end of 5 is fine as Harry is learning between training for the Tournament and leading the DA but after that it ends. You may have a point about the length on the changes I mostly just wanted to fully explain my logic for each change.

**** A fundamental issue is Harry's scar. It needed a solution before any significant training of Harry could begin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10132530/1/His-Mother-s-Love][His Mother's Love]] by White Squirrel, linkffn(10132530), already has something similar to your idea. Maybe you can expand on that.

****** The very reason Dumbledore never bothered to train Harry was that he needed Harry to sacrifice himself. As long as Dumbledore pursued that plan, Harry would never get the necessary support from the Order unless he and other members dared to defy Dumbledore (which we didn't see it happen in canon).

The scar didn't necessary have to be dealt with, but a solution other than sacrificing Harry had to exist.

********** I'm not entirely sure an obscure spell or two is going to level the playing field between Voldemort and Harry. Or at least in my mind it shouldn't and I think that would be a let down for me. The man is 50 years older minus the 13 years he spent diddling around as a spirit-y thing..

I also think Dumbledore giving Harry the knowledge of how Voldemort functions and his history is a legit type of training that gets brushed over way to often. Knowing your enemy is key.

However, it's your story so do what makes you happy!! :) Good luck!

********** I agree with the other commenter that Harry would be better off searching for unfair advantages in areas other than dark magic.

Since Voldemort had a huge thing for anything destructive, even Muggle weapons of mass destruction might not surprise him that much. This was a guy who had personally lived through the London Blitz, travelled the world extensively during the Cold War, and spent decades to push his own destructive power to the limit.

But anything that required him to risk his own life or care about other people was totally off limits to him.

*********** That is why I am suspecting that the Deathly Hallows are going to have to be the trump card. Probably after Harry has tried every trick and spell he has learned only for it to not be enough (even after dying and coming back). After all in canon we see that the master of the Hallows embraces death as an old friend and a part of life and that is something Voldemort cannot understand.
