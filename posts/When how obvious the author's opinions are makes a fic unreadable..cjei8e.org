I find that a sign of a good fic is that when you read it, it's hard to infer information about the author. When I'm reading something, I want to be immersed. It's always great when the writing is so well executed that you can read from a pov view of someone completely dissimilar from you but still find it engaging or relatable. I don't want to be able to tell the gender, age, or general personality of an author when I read something.

This makes reading really annoying when I find a well written fic with an engaging plot but with an author who does not understand that "group x" are people. I find it most often with male authors who just do not get that women are human. There's nothing more annoying than really getting into a fic and then getting a few female characters introduces and having to go wtf. Sometimes it so painfully obvious that an author is a guy who has never had a conversation with a woman that was not about sex. There's nothing more cringe worthy than having to read a pov of a woman written by someone who thinks all women are tv tropes. Like, I don't care if you made her a badass, she still doesn't have a personality outside of "likes men" and "unrealistically hormonal."

There's other examples of course. Nothing like a straight girl trying to write gay men for example. Or just some of the horrifyingly racist stuff you find every once in a while.

Anyway, what sort of author's-personality-slipping-into-fics do you all get frustrated by?

*** That's actually a very common belief in America - especially among the older generations. The "We are the best, everyone loves us, they want to be here" is a remnant from nearly a century of constant propaganda from the various wars. A lot of the younger generation is leaving that thinking behind because the internet makes the opinions of other countries pretty clear.

I just find the effects propaganda has on society very fascinating

Edit: As some people rather aggressively mentioned, this is just a trend. See the keyword 'common' which is not a synonym of "100% of time". Yes, this may not apply to you, but it applies to a large enough portion of the population that it is a /common/ belief.

I don't necessarily agree that millennials and gen-z kids are the worst generation ever (as implied in the video), but we've certainly been disillusioned to things. I grew up being told if I went to college, did everything right, I'd have a great job and I'd have plenty to live. Well, my mom hasn't had a permanant job since I was in HS, she's going from contract to contract at 65 years old with no option to retire. I've got college debt high enough it could be a mortage, and if I want a job that isn't retail there's barely anything and they all want more 5+ years experience for an entry level position.

******** I think *most* wizards in Britain and Ireland would be some variant of "Christian", probably variants that don't exist in the real world because magic exists and they can do it. Like, the Malfoys came over with the Normans, right? It's not like the Normans implemented Norse-type paganism in England. At that time the Scottish, Welsh, and Irish Muggle populations would have been Christianised for centuries as well. The Statute of Secrecy was put in place after the Protestant Reformation had happened. It seems logical to assume that when wizard and Muggle populations weren't separated to such an extent the wizards were basically culturally the same as their Muggle neighbours (allowing for some differences of course), and that they probably followed the same sorts of religions and folk beliefs.

The Celtic pagan religion/belief systems had basically died out in the real world more than a thousand years before the Statute was put in place. By the time of the books, Christianity had been the dominant religion of Britian and Ireland for like 1700 years or so.

I could see some hardliner types keeping an old religion alive for a long time, to be fair - we had the Gaunts who were implied to have been inbreeding for some time to keep their blood and inheritance from Slytherin pure - but I do think most wizards would have adopted the "new faith" just like most Muggles did for similar reasons. Today, you'll only find "neo-pagans" in Britain and Ireland.

Also, from Pottermore we know that even some of the "Pureblood" families tried to marry into Muggle nobility or "prestigious" families or whatever (the Lucius Malfoy I and his attempt to woo Elizabeth I) - I can't see her agreeing, as the head of the Church of England, to even entertain marriage to a pagan.

***** linkffn(Goldstein by Laazov) does a similar thing, and I've been really enjoying it.

Anthony Goldstein (his name is actually Yehuda among his family in this fic) is from a deeply, *deeply* religious, very Orthodox Jewish family. Going to Hogwarts, with not just the magic but also the bit where most of the students are not Jews/not keeping kosher etc, presents some unique challenges for such a devout boy.

He has a whole correspondence going with his rabbi figuring out “can I do this magical thing on Shabbos?”, “how do I get kosher food from the house elves?”, “how can I prepare for this important event when I'm so far from home and by myself?” and so on. He has to lie to his whole community, because obviously the other boys from a similar background have all moved on to study together at the same yeshiva and it's painfully obvious that he's not there.

It's kind of fascinating to see Yehuda Goldstein think his way through how his magical gifts and his Jewish identity should interact.

Why? Well, I took a step back and started to see just how facile and obtuse the arguments against religion were on the the one hand, and the value of religion as a social construct on the other.

And when you think about it, if enough people believe in the idea of something, and this idea has deep and wide impact in society, is it not true or real on some metaphysical level?

What also helped me get a better perspective of religion was Jordan Peterson's lectures on the Bible. It didn't make me religious, just gave me some better perspective.

As an aside, before you say anything - I actually hate Jordan Peterson insofar as his ridiculous politics, his attempts to sell quizes for money, and especially his rabid cult-like followers. I don't like the man. But as far as psychology and religion goes, he isn't too bad. Kind of like how Ben Carson is a great neurosurgeon, but still thinks the pyramids were for grain storage.

When a character (they vary) begins to pontificate about how terrible 'x' is and/or rant in a way that comes off as lecturing (see Hermione in canon and replace that with another character), it immediately draws your attention to how...out of place it feels in actual speech. Rearing its ugly head if you will.

Let's call it the /Giraffe Law/.

Disagree, people do this ALL THE TIME in actual speech. As long as it's something that character might actually say, then it doesn't come off as odd or break immersion. For example, when Hermione begins to lecture on how the boys should follow the rules, nobody immediately things the author is some sort of rule Nazi, that's just how they view this version of Hermione.

1st year, Slytherin HAD WON, but Dumbledore waited the last second to award them points, and gave them just enough to go from last place to victory.\\
2nd year, something happened, they don't know what but one day there is a feast where Dumbledore say the crisis is over and exam are canceled, and also Gryffindor just got 400 points, enough to assure once again their victory, and Potter seem to once again be part of this.

** I think you're confusing "opinion" and "bias". I doubt that most male authors who write such appalling female characters actively hold an /opinion/ that women are personality-less bags of hormones. They may be somewhat sexist still, but that's not the point; short of living on a desert island, no sane man could hold the belief that women actually act how they're depicted in the sort of bad fic you mean. This goes double for a /HP/ fan who has, if no one else, McGonagall for an obvious point of reference of a female character who's ostensibly /not/ primarily defined by sexuality.

Your final wording of it as "the author's personality slipping into the fic" is a bit closer to the nature of the issue, though only with a lot of preamble, because it is inevitable that a writer's personality will filter through in their novel, and not at all a bad thing, unless the writer is trying for experimental, super-detached literature. I /do/ want writers injecting their quirks and opinions into their works, that's generally what makes a work good. If one likes the quirks and opinions being presented, of course, or is at least interested in seeing their perspective. I obviously don't think writers should inject their /bias/ in their work, but that's more because they should be avoiding bias to begin with.

All that being out of the way... I'd say Christian bias in canon (and, hewing closer to your issue of male writers who can't write a woman to save their lives, also Rowling's inability to depict a boy's crush on a girl).

I really, really, *really* wish this were true.

While I 100% agree on the difference between /bias/ and /opinion/, there is still a percentage of stories out there where the author's opinion intertwines with the content of the story and the plot in very awkward ways that are beyond unrealistic in the portrayal of women (in particular).

Now, I get there can be a satire or comedic element to having characters interact a certain way as well, but personally, to me, that kind of aligns with the "oh, you can't take a joke? Don't be so soft, I didn't mean anything by it" excuse I hear -- when in all actuality, that person /did/ mean something by it, whether it was racist, sexist, homophobic, etc.

Palpatine refused to replace said person with a female because the Imperial military was all "White Human Males" which made me close out of the fic.

As someone who understands Star Wars Lore, No the Imperial Military was not all white males, yes it was 90 percent human, because the Empire was pro human and xenophobic, but it wasn't just white men, their are female storm troopers and female officers everywhere. But the author wanted to send a political message so.

***** I think it's super significant that the first names you could think of are not publicly celebrated and respected and legendary warriors or leaders.

They're romantic and emotional foils to Luke Skywalker.

And also undercover, with their gender an asset because women are such an oddity.

And also force users, which are rare enough for pragmatism to somewhat overcome bigotry.

And also not military.

Anyway I'm about to abandon a fic where a Harry is a slut shamer too smart to get involved with women and too busy being brilliant to get laid while also being an international quidditch star. So I get abandoning a fic because of this stuff.

I'm just confused at why Palpatine's Empire only being 99% as bigoted as portrayed is an issue.

No. No. A thousand times no. If there is a hymen 'in the way' then that is a serious medical problem which requires surgical intervention. Why? Because even someone with an imperforate hymen (that is, one which covers the entirety of the vaginal opening) *still gets their period* and if the period blood and tissue can't get out, then you've got a problem.

If someone with a vagina isn't sufficiently lubricated or aroused before penetrative intercourse, what happens is micro-tears in the vagina, which cause bleeding. Given that even perfectly consensual first time intercourse can often be stressful or involve people who are unaware of the wonders of lube, some people bleed. Hell, you can bleed during/after sex after your first time.
