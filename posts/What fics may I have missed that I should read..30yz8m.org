** I'd look at some top lists, see if there's stuff there you've missed. Taure's [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkGVr2UUmX3AkexY8P9GZkQFMVfLsxVHckcwW2FzDSA/edit][list]] is good, and I've got one also - it's a Top 20 that was recently expanded to include ~10 honorable mentions.

**** Given that the combined word count of those fics exceeds 500,000 words, I certainly hope so. :)

Glad you liked WYLB! Although I suppose I'm assuming that - it's possible you could have re-read it purely out of masochism.

*** Some excellent ones there. I am re-reading HPMOR now that it's complete and it seems to me that some of the chapters have changed, and not just 102-on added. I'm curious to know if that might ever make your list, as I am often entertained by it. I'm also aware that in some ways it's got deep flaws.

**** Probably won't make the list, no. There are some really good parts about MoR, but the flaws, as you mentioned, are quite deep. If you're really interested, I did actually read the whole thing recently, and posted a [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=807907&postcount=838][review]] at DLP. I'll paste it below, but I'm responding to someone's comment in the thread so this is without context:

#+begin_quote
  Had a lot of travel time this last week, and decided to give this a go now that it's over. (I'd tried once before, when I first started getting into fanfiction, and dropped it around Chapter 20 at that insanely pedantic Harry / Draco conversation about blood, magic, and genetics.)

  So, I read the whole thing, and I have to say, I basically agree with Innomine here. I think a lot of the extreme hate for MoR comes from non-story stuff (interactions with the author, zealous fans inspiring backlash). I tend to kind of mentally edit out people getting heated (one way or the other) about MoR, because honestly it's just not that important.

  If you read it as kind of a "dark reflection" of A Black Comedy (or, as mentioned above, Oh God Not Again), it's actually pretty enjoyable. Both have extreme OOC Harry, a plot that does have some overarching themes but frequently goes off on tangents, and some moments of real humor. The difference is that ABC is a) a lot funnier, and b) not in any way trying to take itself seriously, which is why ABC is my favorite fic of all time, and this is kind of a "has its moments, but has some huge flaws as well" fic.

  I think my biggest problem with MoR is that, in order for it to generate some of these good moments (and it does have them -- anyone saying this is pure shit just isn't giving it a fair shake), it has to create an insanely straw-man version of JKR's world, and then tear it down in an amusing way. So, it's aggravating and funny at the same time.

  It's kind of the same argument I made in [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=801657&postcount=395][this post]]. The author has taken various parts of canon that weren't fully fleshed out, and decided on the interpretation that, instead of there being an off-screen reason for various things, the wizarding world is incredibly stupid and backwards. And then he pats himself on the back (in-story) for pointing out how stupid he's made them.

  An example, off the top of my head: Harry's trip to Gringotts. JKR never fleshed out how banking works, beyond the fact that there are vaults and goblins run them and wizards store money and some other things there. Instead of observing this, and the fact that the wizarding economy exists in canon and doesn't randomly collapse, and inferring that there are off-screen reasons that the trivial "game breaking" solutions Harry comes up with aren't possible, the author just makes wizards really stupid and illogical.

  Same deal with Hogwarts students. Some of the best moments of comedy in this fic are the ways various secondary Hogwarts characters interpret events - their [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic][Insane Troll Logic]] is quite funny, as are Harry's attempts (and frustration) trying to combat it. But, in order to make those moments funny, the author has to make Hogwarts culture a caricature of itself.

  Anyway. Enough virtual ink has been spilled about this fic, I suppose. I'm giving it 3/5, which doesn't seem right, because there's almost nothing average about this fic. The bad parts are really, really bad. The good parts are quite good.

  If you can stomach the author taking self-congratulatory shots at canon that he's set up with straw men to look better than they actually are, and long, long science-y rants, and a plot that often takes a backseat to whatever random tangent the author wanted to explore, there's some pretty solid comedy and drama underneath it all.

  *3/5*

** A good story that I have never seen reccomended is "There Be Dragons, Harry". It's over 750k words and counting. It's a creature-fic, but don't let that put you off: The world building is amazing. However, it is a slash-harem fic. I hate harem fics normally, but I quite liked this one. Harry is a bit OCC - a lot more immature in some ways, but much more advanced in others.

Anyway, that's my two cents :)
