I've met many fics with Harry attending other schools. Though the majority of them are uncomplited and stopped on his 1st or 2nd year.

Are there fics where Harry finally achieve 1994 and goes as a guest to Hogwarts? I don't care if he's a Champion or not.

A crossover with some other book I've never read, but prior knowledge of it is probably not required. Warning: bashing of wizarding world as a whole.

** I read one where Harry and Hermione bail to Beauxbaton's after third year and he gets roped into the tournament as a student of that school.

Can't remember the title, though. Sorry.

*** Hmmm. On further thought Harry bailed but Hermione couldn't come with him. She took every opportunity to visit Harry at Beauxbatons and to help with TWT.
