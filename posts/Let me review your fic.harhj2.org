Looking to spread a little love because I've hit a personal fanfic milestone!

All fics are welcome and any pairing on AO3 or FFNet, my only rule is please nothing longer than 25,000 words in total. So that could be a one-shot, a short fic or a couple of chapters of a longer fic :)

Please post the link below or feel free to PM me with your fics! I'll aim to read them over the next few days :)


** My story is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24557779/chapters/59304109][here]]. Thank you for doing this. It is around 19 and half thousand words long.

Here's the summary:

When Newt Scamander is brought to MACUSA by Tina Goldstein, the last thing he expects is to see his brother's best friend talking with the President. Nor did he expect that friend to then bring his brother to New York.

** I had to check how much I'd published, as I've written a lot more than that! But only 20,000 words of it are out at the moment.

I've been working on a founders era story about OCs a few decades into the existence of Hogwarts. Let me know what you think! Linkao3(the might of the architect by tinyporcelainehorses)

If the bot isn't working, here's the link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23957842/chapters/57621055]]

And here's the summary:

Hogwarts, Britain's largest community of magical learning, is only decades old and already bitterly divided. England has fallen to a foreign king. And as the stone walls of Hogwarts grow ever higher, whispers say that Salazar Slytherin is plotting something... Two students from either side of a war are driven together by events that will change Britain, magical and non-magical, forever.

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister. Harry/Ginny, Rose/Cedric

** Here's my story: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24304897/chapters/58589047][Reformation]]

Summary: (or what happens when Tom Riddle realises the potential of mind control)

"You may think that the best kept secret on Earth is the concealment of the magical world from the muggle one, and you would be wrong. Millions of witches and wizards know that secret. No, the best kept secret on Earth --one that only a select few know-- is the concealment of the muggle world from the magical one." - Arcturus Black

Seven years after he left the magical world, Sirius Black's grandfather contacts him to say that his brother has gone missing. Sirius reluctantly agrees to work with his family to solve Regulus' disappearance by helping decode his brother's journals. Meanwhile, ex-werewolf-soldier Remus Lupin is hired as a personal assistant for Black Enterprises, Narcissa Malfoy tries to convince her sister Andromeda to run for the House of Commons, and Harry Potter is bewildered by the appearance of a stranger at Number Four, Privet Drive.

Very AU. Divergence after Tom Riddle's graduation. (rated M for coarse language (courtesy of Bellatrix and Sirius) and brief descriptions of violence)

Thank you for making this thread!
