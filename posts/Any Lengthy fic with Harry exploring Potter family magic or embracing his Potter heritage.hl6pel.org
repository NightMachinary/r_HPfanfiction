Got tired of reading Hadrian Potter-Blacks.. Rather than Harry blood adopting to a dark Black family, I'm looking for a preferably a long fic, with either a light or a gray Harry exploring Potter Family magic or embracing his Potter ancestry.

No multi/Harem or Fem!Harry please..


** In linkffn(The Power of the Potters by RockIll), the Australian cadet branch of the family grabs Harry and educates him.

In linkffn(The Potter Family Grimoire by Disobediencewriter), Harry buys a book.

I haven't read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Potter Family Grimoire by IamZerokun) yet, but it sounds like it fits the bill.

  Complete! With a Light Lord interfering in Potter Family matters and a Dark Lord hell-bent on killing off the Potters, a cadet branch of the Potter family has to act. Armed with knowledge, Family Magik, and supported by many cousins, Harry takes Magical England by storm. Realistic characters and some bashing, HHR with less focus on pairings.

** Linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt) should fit the bill. I haven't finished it, but from what I remember, it focuses on Harry rebuilding the ancestral Potter manor and involves a lot of Potter family headcanon as part of it.

** Well you could try Faery Heroes by Silently Watches. It's a Harry/Hermione/Luna fic where Santa on behalf of the Winter Queen send the three of them back in time and to a parallel dimension to defeat Voldemort. Harry finds that the Potter Magic was Wards and that past Potters used to use this power to rob purebloods. They embrace this and proceed to go after deatheaters to lessen their power so they aren't as useful to Voldemort.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
