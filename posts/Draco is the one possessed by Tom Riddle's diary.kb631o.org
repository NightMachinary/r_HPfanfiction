At first, he would feel great about it. He is the heir of Slytherin everyone awes and fears, and he can finally get rid of all the muggleborns in Hogwarts like he always wanted. Tom Riddle speaks to him through the diary, strengthening his beliefs and helping him learn dark magic. And it goes like this until someone actually dies. Draco feels terrible about it because it turns out death in real life is so much worse than he expected and he never really wanted to kill anyone, but it's already too late, he's now a murderer. Harry still saves him and defeats Tom Riddle, and then Lucius goes to Azkaban. Nobody knows what exactly happened in the Chamber of Secrets, so everyone in Hogwarts believes Draco killed willingly (which is almost true). So he has to face the loss of his father and the consequences of his actions. Zuko level redemption arc follows.
