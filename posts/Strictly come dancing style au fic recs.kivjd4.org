Following this year's strictly has made me really crave dancing fics! Does anyone know any good ones??


** It's tragically unfinished but linkffn(blurring reality by terrific lunacy) is an absolutely outstanding non-magical (or is it?) AU about ballet. It's one of the most unique fanfics I've ever read and it's so so worth the read even though it's unfinished.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.

*** Okay that looks incredible and it's completely dance-centred too - thanks!! Long enough that it being unfinished isn't an issue either :)

** Beginning of this fic is Dance-ish. He learns ballroom, and then the fic gets to a rather convulted harry vs the world with added complications. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13140418/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-International-Triwizard-Tournament][Harry Potter and the International Triwizard - ffnet]]
