I have been reading a lot of harry potter fanfictions lately and I'm beginning to get a little sick of Voldemort being the end boss/main villain every time, I want to read something where the main antagonist is something like, demons, gods, devils or even aliens that invade the planet.

This means that harry needs to become powerful and smart to be able to fight back because there is no prophecy plot armor to keep him alive.

​

Time travel, reincarnation, or any form of dimensional travel is also welcome

​

please no Harry/Ginny, Harry/Hermione, Slash, or Femslash


** I'm pretty sure that most powerful!indie!Harry fics really have Dumbledore as the main villain.

But you're specifically looking for gods, demons, and aliens, you'll probably have the most luck looking at crossovers with franchises that have enemies like that. Mass Effect, LotR, DC, and Marvel come to mind as possible options, though I can't think of any good matching fics off the top of my head.

** Linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance) has a three-way struggle between Harry, Voldemort, and an ancient Sumerian god.

I agree, though. LV wasn't a great antagonist even the first time I read canon; he has not improved in the years of reading fanfics.

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.

*** I just feel Voldy and dumble's been done to death, it's very rare to see something new, it's pretty much the same thing over and over again, just done a little differently

Thanks for the recommendation :)
