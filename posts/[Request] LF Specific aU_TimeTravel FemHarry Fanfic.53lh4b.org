Currently looking for a fanfic where Harry wants to change everything and ends up in an alternate universe as a girl. This was in FF.net when I read it three years ago.

1. Harry was older in the first universe, and travels to the AU before her first year.
2. He's a girl now, and has a younger, more outgoing sister.
3. James and Lily alive and good parents.
4. Neville is BWL, very bratty. His mother Alice is dead, Frank remarried, stepmother spoils him.
5. Fem!Harry gets along with Draco. Narcissa is her godmother(?).
6. Voldemort alive, sane (still evil though) and teaches at Hogwarts.
7. There was an instance where Lily gets suspicious about Fem!Harry and asks for Narcissa's help, and ends up hurting Fem!Harry.
8. Grindelwald is in the story for some reason. Dumbledore is manipulative. Forces Fem!Harry under submission because she was getting too powerful.
9. Last chapter I remembered had Ariana Dumbledore(?) in it.

Thanks for the help in advance!

  After the final battle, our hero takes time to mourn the lost; for all his tribulations Magic itself gives him the opportunity to regain his loved ones and perhaps make a few more. For that opportunity, no price is too high. Rated M, FemHarry/TMR and more

  After slipping diagonally through time and space to a familiar time in an unfamiliar world, Harry finds himself fighting to save a future that's not quite what he remembers? Crossover between Harry Potter and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with homebrew X-Men and Inhuman elements because studio politics suck.
