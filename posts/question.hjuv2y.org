I for one really like both [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1207646162813100033][this tweet]] and especially with this [[https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/][post]]. Also, read the article linked from [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1269409838318182401][this tweet]].
