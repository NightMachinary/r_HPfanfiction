I read it ages ago and thought I'd faved it, either I didn't or it's been removed but I'm wondering if anyone here has read it and can tell me what it's called:\\
Harry gets a warning from Luna shortly before the Department of Mysteries shenanigans and when Sirius falls through the veil both he and Lupin grab him and fall too. They end up in the Walking Dead world a few years before the outbreak and with some helpful hints from a message from Lunas mother begin to set up a safe house/castle/farm that runs on magic to withstand the fallout and hopefully survive. Harry is a Doctor (it's relevent). Harry finds Merle on the roof and cuts him loose, gets him clean and collects the rest of the group to take them home to Dad and Dad (Remus and Sirius).\\
Harry ends up sleeping with both of the Dixon brothers at more than one point during this.

If anyone can point me in the direction of this I'd appreciate it. I remember it being quite good :). Sorry if the information seems a little random, I wanted to give enough information to find it but I dont remember that many specifics.\\
Thanks
