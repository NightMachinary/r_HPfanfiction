Here and back again. Link to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g36qcf/a_subjective_review_of_partially_kissed_hero_ch1/][Part 1]] in case you want to read it. Since that takes care of introductions, let's get straight into reviewing since I have a headache and want to sleep.

Let's start with a summary of this chapter - we start a bit after the dementors attacked Harry's compartment, the attack itself not actually being shown. Harry is out cold, and Luna takes a bottle of chocolate milk, takes a swig and kisses him to get some chocolate in him. Lupin comes and checks on them, proclaiming Harry to be near death, then hurries to the conductor to make him hurry to Hogwarts. Once they get there Harry is rushed to the infirmary, but Pomfrey's care doesn't affect him until Dumbledore calls Fawkes to help. Luna goes in the Forbidden Forest and comes back with a unicorn to help. Harry spends the night in a mental battle against the Horcrux, helped along by the trifecta of mother's protection, phoenix cry and unicorn aura, and manages to defeat the soul fragment, absorbing all of Voldemort's knowledge in the process. The next morning, news breaks out that Harry Potter has been attacked by Dementors - the newspaper covers it with a photo by Colin Creevy and an article written by Luna, and as a consequence people start rioting and the minister and all his associates are banished from government and maybe exiled. Harry gets out for lunch, and when McGonagall gives him his schedule he confronts her about it not having the changes he requested (dropping Care and Divination in favor of Runes and Aritmancy). After he starts quoting the rules, McGonagall sets up a meeting with Dumbledore to discuss it for after lunch, to which he agrees. We get to the meeting, and Harry opens up with a choice - either Dumbledore lets him change classes, or he'll sign this document he has which will transfer him to Beuxbatons, and he already has Madam Maxime's blessing for the move. They argue for a bit before Dumbledore caves to most of his demands, except for one - he will not give Snape to the dementors, but he will cancel his employment as potions teacher, and to sweeten the deal he will give Harry a time turner to take his classes. Harry accepts the time turner, and takes the sword of Gryffindor with him while going away.

I expected things to slowly get worse over time, but this was way faster than I thought. Like, at the second sentence I had to gather myself for a moment to keep on reading (it's the part where Luna kisses Harry, in case it wasn't obvious).

By the way, Luna is a psychopath. And a plot device, but the first one is more apparent. In this chapter she does three* things of note - she kisses Harry to give him chocolate, she starts writing the article while Harry is still half dead in the same compartment and Hermione is crying, and then she goes to the forest to get a unicorn for Harry.

*I was going to say four, since I considered her non-reaction to half-dead Harry and the article thing to be separate, but apparently the first one leads directly to the second. Like, read this and tell me she's not a psychopath.

  "The Patronus charging up the hall seemed to help as well," Luna mused, then pondered aloud. "I wonder what happens to a dementor if it's forced to drink chocolate milk?"
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  [Lupin says] I fear we may not have stopped that dementor in time."

  Hermione broke down crying on the spot.

  Luna began calmly writing.
#+end_quote

​

Speaking of plot devices, the passage of time in this fic is just nonsensical. Harry is dying apparently, so they need to hurry to Hogwarts - but instead of using a portkey or apparating there they just make the train go faster. Dumbledore is waiting for them at the entrance because he gets an owl from Lupin - a fucking owl is faster than the train. Sure, you can excuse that with it being a magic owl, but god damn it must be the beefiest of owls to beat a magic train going 'dangerously fast'.

Another stupid plot point was Harry's transfer papers. Where did he get them? Unclear. How did he get an owl all the way to France and back in the maybe couple hours until his meeting with Dumbledore? Probably that beefy owl from before. How did he know to do that? I dunno, probably Voldemort's memories.

I remember complaining about Voldemort's memories in Core Threads being used as a rather obvious excuse for any and all changes to Harry's mentality the author needs, as well as pulling any and all knowledge out of his ass he needs for any given scene. It's pretty jarring when Harry starts going off at Dumbledore with 'Snape is a Death Eater' and 'Grindlewald would teach better than him' when he shouldn't rightly know any of those things yet, but it's fine because he got it from Voldemort. Totally fine. Dumbledore doesn't even ask how he knows shit, he just accepts it.

Using a skillful method to change the subject, how about that chocolate? I'm pretty sure chocolate isn't supposed to literally cure dementors. I thought it was more of a way to alleviate exposure symptoms, but I'll admit that I haven't read PoA in at least 8 years, so he could be right. Probably not.

What else... The Ron bashing continues, but it's still kind of low-key for now. When Harry comes for lunch and they all have a reunion, all Ron seems to be interested in is that now he can beat Slytherins at Quidditch. The dialogue isn't bad, if you completely remove the context - you could see it word for word in a much better fic, and take it for friendly ribbing with a pinch of male tsundere bonding. It's not though, this is bashing plain and simple.

Ah, I almost forgot to mention. Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle got thrown off the train (while it was moving) for laughing at Harry being in critical condition. I was thinking of this when I wrote above how fast this is devolving into shit, but damn if it doesn't have competition in this chapter - between Luna's... everything to do with Luna, really, and the conversation with Dumbledore that almost seems taken from the worst indy!Harry fic you can imagine at times, it's kind of hard to point to any one thing.

And speaking of that conversation... I forgot what I was going to say, fuck. A second, I'll skim it and see if I can jog my memory.

Oh yeah, I was going to mention that he says some pretty outlandish bullshit. The one example I'm gonna give is this one where he's talking about Snape:

#+begin_quote
  Someplace where the House Cup isn't meaningless because one corrupt teacher steals it by bloating his own House points year after year.
#+end_quote

This is kind of rich, considering Gryffindor won the cup both years he's been to Hogwarts, and especially looking at the fuckery that went on with the end of the first.

To cap things off with an amusing one, here is a quote from the author's notes at the bottom:

#+begin_quote
  Special thanks to Skysaber for letting me borrow one of his ideas: Language Lozenges, from his story "My Gilded Life." Sorry about not mentioning that in the last chapter.
#+end_quote

For those of you who don't know, Skysaber is another of Perfect Lionhart's accounts. As in, they are the same person, but he's faking being two different people, and here he's thanking himself for an idea he 'borrowed'. BTW, My Gilded Life is a previous fic of his, where Gilderoy Lockhart is replaced, in mind but not body, by what I can only assume is a self-insert. I'm never going to read it. Ever.

Ok then, see you tomorrow for the next part.

*** Never read it (well maybe 1st chapter but "Indi Harry does his shopping" is so overused that they tend to blend together in my mind), but I would guess that the plot will be "fixed" around chapter 5, then 80 or 90 chapters of "Harry has fun with his harem while Ron is bashed to oblivion"before the author remember about Voldemort and prepare a "confrontation" where Harry can have a monologue about how attacking the Potter was stupid bla bla bla before obliterating him.

**** They only ever post at the exact same time, and then vanish again at the exact same time. Their writing styles are also very similar, along with their use of language. One profile just uses a lot more smut than the other. They're also both liars, both vanished for years before popping up at the exact same time, only to vanish at the exact same time again and they both reference the other all the time.

They're either very very very good friends/lovers or the same person keeping their smut separate from their other stories.
