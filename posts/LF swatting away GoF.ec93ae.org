  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.

** Theres a scene like this in Brutal Harry if I remember correctly, but not sure about the Luna bit. It's the bit about the GoF that is jumping at me.

ETA: Found what I was thinking of. Not what you described. No Luna and HP is in the Great Hall, not a corridor. Also, he seems to battle against the GoF more rather than swat it away as you say.
