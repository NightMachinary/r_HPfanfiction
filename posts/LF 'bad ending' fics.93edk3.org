** This one has a bad ending.

****** The same author also does The Unforgiving Minute and Elizium for Sleepless Souls. Both aren't bad endings per say, but they sense of dark/gloom pervades them. They certainly aren't /happy/ endings.

If you liked Concentric Wavelengths you may like them as well.
