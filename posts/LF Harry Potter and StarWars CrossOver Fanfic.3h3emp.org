Hi. I'm looking for any powerful Harry crossover fic. Does not matter if he is on the light or dark side. Thanks!

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  Only the strong may rule, this was the way of the Dark Side, and Darth Millennial was about to prove to his master that he was worthy of the title Dark Lord of the Sith, but first a tremor in the Force draws him to the Unknown Regions of space... I do not own the picture

  A Harry Potter cursed with immortality must not only survive the raping of Earth by monsters far more powerful than any humanity has encountered, but he must rise to save it, and in the process exact one wizard's revenge against the Galactic Empire.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** Well I would recommend Equilibrium by Jon, which can be found on DLP's WBA (Work by Author), though I think you need to register on DLP to read it, here's the link for it: [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=29492]]

** How much have you looked through the ffnet crossover section? Sorting by favs follows, or reviews should get you a decent head start. Other than that I believe Darth Marrs is the typical first response. There are others but I generally don't read Star Wars XO S because they tend to involve time or dimension travel which I'm not a fan of in this context.

edit: I Still haven't found what I'm looking for by kathryn518 and The Havoc Side of the Force by Tsu Doh Nymh were rec'd in another thread, and Darth Marrs just updated another one of his star wars XOs.
