Harry from the future who uses his knowledge to pretend he's a seer? He's at his best when he first starts meddling in the timeline but as the timeline branches away from Canon he has to start making educated guesses.

Guesses that become more and more inaccurate.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

*** I really liked this story. My only problem is that the pacing feels great... until suddenly you're on the last chapter and the story is over with absolutely zero fucking foreshadowing.

I've honestly never read an ending more rushed in my life.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
