Yes, you read it right. Severus Snape self insert. They are real. I'm looking for them. I read both Half-Blood Emperor by dio black at ffn and please help by solea razvan at SB. If there are any more of them pease share. Please help! had was in poor grammar but the story was good. unfortunately dropped. Half-blood emperor is enjoyable but the writer is on hiatus.


** To anybody else intrigued by this premise, I really can't recommend please help. I just spent 15 minutes and read the entirety of 3 posted stories by this author. All of them were pure exposition written in a message on a bottle format either begging for help or lamenting their fate.
