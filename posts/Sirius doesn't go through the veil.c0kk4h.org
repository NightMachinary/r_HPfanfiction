Hey guys! Are there any fics where Sirius */doesn't/* fall through the veil and survives the ministry. Then the story continues as it is now with Sirius as a main character?? TIA.

EDIT: Poor grammar.


** I don't have a rec, but I was just thinking about how I want to find some stories like this about Sirius. Or even a story that has him come back to life by using the veil in an actual interesting way!
