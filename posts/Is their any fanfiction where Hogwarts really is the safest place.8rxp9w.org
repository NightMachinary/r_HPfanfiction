I don't care if the fanfiction is about Hogwarts being really safe or the magical world being unsafe (though if it is this does anyone have any fanfictions of characters being paranoid about it?).


** I wondered something vaguely along those lines a little while ago...something about how if there's no safer place than Hogwarts, and it goes through a DADA-curse, a troll, a basilisk, a (not) serial killer, and hundreds of dementors over just three years, what the heck goes on in the rest of the magical world?

Does a dark wizard, like, let loose a basilisk in Diagon Alley every fortnight? Does Beauxbatons have to fend off a Tarasque every now and then?

*** I feel like Harry's six year of Hogwarts was way out of the norm. Nearly all of those things happened because he was there (even the Philospher's stone could be argued was at Hogwarts because Harry was there).

*** I read one where all those things happened. But it was later revealed that Dumbledore had cast a powerful enchantment over Hogwarts that protected Hogwarts students from death while on school grounds.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** Canon?

Harry needed only two friends and a goblin to make it into Gringotts and steal Hufflepuff's cup, and that's like the second safest place in the world, according to Hagrid.

Doesn't put the bar very high, does it?

  If there are intent-based protective wards such as Albus erected around the Dursleys, how would Hogwarts be if it had some?
