hello. This is my first post on this sub, and I really hope this does not constitute witch hunting. it's more like Change My view post.

so long time ago, on our favourite site FF.net Fake-A-Smile posted two stories 'Taking Control' and 'Free Life'. while it has clich√© independent/rebellious Harry plot, it was well written and interesting. and at that time I was at that age to like that sort of thing.

I was really interested in the story to care well beyond my teen years. so when some one told me some other author named GHL has taken up the story and writing with blessings from Fake-A-Smile, I was interested. The reviews were good too.

but when I actually read the first chapter, I could not stand it. The writing sounded pretensions, the dialogues made me cringe. I still kept at it till chapter 5 hoping it would get better or grow on me. It did not.

have I just outgrown that kind of story or do you find it bad too?

I am at my late 20's and I still read fanfiction, I currently love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian's]] work.

tl;dr: The Prevailing Counterpoint, is it good, bad, ugly?

Havent read them. But if your not enjoing them, no point in continueing is there? Plenty of other independent Harry stories out there to try, to see if you still enjoy them.

*** I am over the trope, I don't think I can read new independent Harry story anymore. I was just invested in this one.

thanks for linking everything. :)

** Have you tried to re-read Taking Control? Does it sound pretentious too?

How similar is the writing between Taking Control and The Prevailing Counterpoint?

*** I did. it did not sound pretentious. I did not identify with Harry. but I could read through the story without feeling "WTF?"

If you look at [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=129801&textsize=0&chapter=1][The Prevailing Counterpoint]], lot of positive reviews and some awards on SIYE. so I thought I was the problem. So I thought I would ask the community.

**** From what I remember about reading Taking Control (Like 8 years ago when I was a teen), it was good at the time, but I can see how it might seem juvenile as an adult. There's definitely a ton of fics I've tried to re-read recently (in my mid 20s), but they're just unreadable. When I was 14 years old I was able to look past a lot of things that are unbearable now.

I've actually been considering re-reading Taking Control, as I followed it during it's original run, but never actually finished. If I do, I'll report back here with my thoughts on it.
