As the titl, says looking for fics where Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna, Neville or other students deal with PTSD in the aftermath of the Department of Mysteries battle or battle of Hogwarts, tho preferably the first.


** Depicting PTSD after Battle of Hogwarts was common in fics, but only a few of them did it to my liking:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/][Cauterize]], linkffn(4152700), expresses it brilliantly in only 1600 words.

In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), they made their enemies pay.

*** I came here to say Cauterize too! Such an amazing story, although it is hard to read. That author is pretty dope at short stories though

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
