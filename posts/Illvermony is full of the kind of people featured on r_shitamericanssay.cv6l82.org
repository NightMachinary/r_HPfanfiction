** Ironically, this is sort of canon in a roundabout way; the “official” history of Ilvermorny and MACUSA has big revisionist energy.

“and then the colonists and the Indians got on extremely well and the Indians voluntarily shared their native magic in return for European wands and lived happily ever after”

Honestly reads a /lot/ like those facebook posts you see defending Manifest Destiny.

***** The magical world stops working outside of the UK. Just compare European borders in the late 17th century with what we have now. And no change made afterwards should be reflected by magical world since those were muggle disputes. But that'd erase half of the States from the map and replace them with countless half-feudal states.

(I think even if the muggleborn has some sort of open carry license, an ak pattern rifle would draw way more attention from cops.)

(On a side note, are there Semi-auto AKs? (+just remembered the dragunov is semi-auto,+ nope just resembles an AK, any others?) The us might have lax gun laws in many ways but we do have an auto weapons ban.) ( I do think I've seen a Dragunov in person before though, that's edit:*/NOT/* a semi-auto AK pattern)

I was really asking about the legalities of owning an ak in the usa, Because the start of this thread was an american muggleborn making wand wood furniture for an ak, and I didnt know if you could even own a ak in the usa.
