Just wondering if anyone knew of any fics where the kids, (major or minor characters, doesn't matter), don't choose Hogwarts or any other school. In The Best Revenge (and sequel) by Arsinoe de Blassenville, Harry is a Hufflepuff, and Sally Anne Perks is pretty average at magic, and half way through first year drops out to join the Royal Ballet of London. Most kids aren't so talented at any one thing that they would choose to do that instead of school, but I'm wondering if anyone knows of anything similar. Thanks!


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871): Harry was blind and couldn't go. Hermione later joined him after being injured by the Troll.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): James and Lily fled magical world after settling up Voldemort. Harry went to a Muggle boarding school and later a military academy.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097): Lucius Malfoy set up Hermione and had her thrown out of Hogwarts after Year 2. Dumbledore sent Mundungus Fletcher to train her as an elite thief. The story has progressed past Voldemort and is actually getting really interesting.

*** Why the HELL would a blind Harry not be able to go?

Blind kids fit into mainstream Muggle schools all the time, and I'd love to see what difference magic makes to adaptive tech!

**** From what I remember it was because blindness isn't actually an issue for (british) wizards, so they have no clue how to deal with it - since magic can heal any eye injury except for dark magic, there are basically no blind people and so no provisions exist for them.

***** No one thinks to train an animal as intelligent as a kneazle to help guide? Crookshanks is half-kneazle, and we know he's bright enough, so getting him a crup or a kneazle and teaching commands would work great.

There's no way for Harry to charm his books so he can listen to them instead of read them, like he'd been using audiobooks all his life already? We know people can receive letters that speak aloud instead of being read, so it can't be that hard.

Eleven year old Harry, having been taught to use a plain old ordinary cane in the Muggle world, wouldn't think to bring it as naturally as he'd bring his arm along?

If he's been disabled since he was a toddler, he'd /already have/ adaptations in place to let him have some independence. People do. We have to. I know I have mine. Finding out he could do magic would just make him excited to figure out some new ones.

****** I'm not sure you're getting what I said. We have service animals and braile and all that shit, because we have had blind people forever. The /Blindness/ wizarding world *doesn't have* blind people, except for the extremely rare case that lost their eyesight to dark magic. When the teachers learn that Harry is blind there isn't a brain-storming session on "how to help the poor boy" - they write him off instantly, figuring that he can't learn magic and the muggles can deal with that sort of disability in a better way.

That actually happens later in the story.

******* My point is that the wizarding world doesn't have to have the adaptive stuff, because /Harry already will/. He's had a decade in the Muggle world to figure out “audiobooks” and “the cane” and shit. If adaptations can't be supplied for him already-made after the age of eleven, he'll figure out his own. People do. That's a huge part of life when you live with a permanent disability - finding out how to do the things you want to do, even if it doesn't immediately seem possible.

I've read this fic. I LOATHE it, because even when he's a little boy in the Muggle world characters who should know better seem to write Harry off. If Petunia did her research the way this fic said she did, the experts she spoke to would universally have told her to put him in a normal school with Dudley. They'd have given him adaptive equipment.

Have you ever seen a blind man ski? If he can hurtle down a mountain...

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Harry didn't spend all day cooped up in Privet Drive during the summer holidays. He found a farm and a love of horses. From that came a whole new world, he found something that he enjoyed with people who didn't neglect him. Set just before Harry's 3rd year. No Slash.
