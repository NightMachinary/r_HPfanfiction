My half-assed googling turned up Lord Ripplescales' *Dumbledore's Training" and Kingnick's *Dumbledore's Apprentice." Both are terrible, so I'd like some recommendations that I can trust. Unfinished or currently updated fics are fine.

*** Ah, Magicks of the Arcane is just so...how can I explain it? It's like someone tried to write something like A Song of Ice and Fire and failed horribly. And yet, it's still very much readable- it's just /so/ fanfiction-y in the sense that it's good but has so many cliched flaws. If there were a class for studying fanfiction, it'd be a case study.

**** I honestly think that if the author redid the story, a lot of that stuff would be fixed, because all the issues arose from stuff when s/he was first writing it.

But it gave us Alcoholic!Dumbledore, so all can be forgiven.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** I'm always excited to share stories where Dumbledore mentors Harry, as it is one of my favorite types of fanfiction.

First, there is linkffn(By the Divining Light; Conlaodh's Song) by enembee. Enembee is one of the best authors in the fandom, although he is sadly not as well-known as he should be. These stories follow a prodigious Harry who discovers magics of old. It is one of my all-time favorites out of the hundreds, if not thousands, of stories that I've read.

Next, there is linkffn(The Other Side of the Coin) by Zennith6. What makes this fic unique is that it features an intelligent, well-characterized Tom Riddle in addition to the Dumbledore-Harry interactions. The dynamic of the three characters is what makes this story so interesting.

linkffn(Dagger and Rose) by Perspicacity is also a great fic. Dumbledore is somewhat manipulative, but not in the sense of evil!brainless!Dumbledore. He is understandable, powerful, and very intelligent. It has Dumbledore beginning to mentor Harry Post-PoA, teaching him an old type of magic that is closely guarded, which makes Harry a target. But I won't spoil you more on that :P

Finally, there's linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher) by Ecthelion3. Simply incredible interactions between Harry and Dumbledore, which is featured in the memory chapters.

That's what I can remember on top of my head for now. All of the stories above are technically competent, stylistically well-written, with good character development and plot progression. I hope you find these stories enjoyable.

*** By the Divining Light had a lot of powerful imagery, but I didn't like how the magic was handled. I felt like "Harry played with some knots" was largely the answer to every problem in that piece, which is such a shame because apart from the *one* thing, I really enjoyed it.

What do you think, did I miss something?
