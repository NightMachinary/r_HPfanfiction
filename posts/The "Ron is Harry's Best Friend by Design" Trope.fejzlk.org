I've seen quite a few fictions that utilize the trope of Hermione and Ron being Harry's best friends because Dumbledore in some way or another arranged it to be so/needs it to be that way to ensure the success of his plans. I don't have a problem with the trope, and some of those stories have been some great reads, but I'm curious about other people's thoughts on this, specially in regards to Ron.

I have heard several good reasons why Hermione would be necessary in the trio: she's smart, has a fantastic ability to memorize and research information, is a voice of reason when others are hot headed, is a muggle born so it furthers Harry's desire to protect that group of people since his best friend is one, etc, etc. For Ron though, I'm wondering what others would say were good reasons for him being necessary in the role of best friend to Harry.

I've seen some people argue that it's because he's a great tactician, but I don't know how much I would agree with that canonically. He's not particularly loyal in a lot of important cases either. So, thoughts? It's been on my mind lately and I'm intrigued to know what others ideas are on this trope, or if you feel that it is just entirely far fetched.


** The way I typically see this resolved is that Ron's friendship gives Dumbledore a place that Harry can "escape" to, but is still under Dumbledore's control as the Weasleys are some of his biggest supporters. Ron's inherent laziness also keeps Harry from learning too much, forcing him to rely on Hermione in fics where she is involved and attempting to limit his power and knowledge in fics where she isn't. A close friendship with Ron also keeps Harry in proximity of Ginny, as there's usually a plot to force a marriage and thus have Dumbledore gain control of Harry's vaults when he dies facing Voldy.

** When I see this it is almost always Weasley bashing, or at least Ron bashing. In fact, I don't think I've ever read a fic where Ron and Harry are forced into a friendship and Ron is still a good guy. (If anyone knows of a fic like this pls tell me).

Strategically wise? Ron has all the knowledge a kid born and raised into the wizarding world would have. This includes all the little things that you can't find in a book (In Hermiones case) or by investigating (in Harry's case). There are nuances and concepts that no one else would know but him, making Ron a valuable source of information. At the same time, he's also from a light family, that is loyal to Dumbledore seeing as his entire family has been taught under Dumbledore, and Molly and Athur were part of the Order. So, the knowledge Harry is being fed about the wizarding world by Ron (whether he knows it or not) is a reflection of Dumbledore's views. And, as an added bonus, Ron balances out the Golden Trio. Hermione is a muggleborn, Harry is a half blood, and Ron is a pureblood. Which makes them all equal in a way. This idea of blood purity being irrelevant is also a viewpoint of canon Dumbledore's, which means the next generation of wizards and witches would care less about purity.

I'm sure there are more reasons, like personality and the Weasley family aspect. But really, it all depends on what the author wants to portray Dumbledore and Ron as. Are they manipulative? Brats? Or good guys? That's what decides motives, I guess.

Thanks OP for posting this question, I definately enjoyed it! :)

*** Ron *allegedly* has all the knowledge of a Wizard-raised kid. But who turned up the story of the Three Brothers? It sure wasn't Ron. Who knows more about Hogwarts? The person who has read Hogwarts: A History. Wizarding etiquette? Errr, none of them, actually. Trends and styles? Puh-lease. Ron's knowledge is pretty much limited to sweets, quidditch, bigotry against Slytherins, and various ways to skate through school (he knows Divination is an easy O, and avoids studying whenever possible).

No, clearly the purpose for Ron's friendship is either to glom onto the famous person (if it's self-directed), or for Dumbledore to tie Harry to a family that's so loyal to him they IGNORE CHILD ABUSE WITNESSED BY THEIR OWN CHILDREN, because Dumbledore says it's for the best.

Remember, in GoF, it's *Dumbledore* who invites the Weasleys to be a stand-in family for Harry. And, as we all know, Molly claims Harry as her surrogate son after only a few weeks in the summers of hosting him, and sending him a few Christmas and birthday presents.

**** I'm guessing you Ron bash then. In my opinion, I like Ron and the Weaslys and I'm gonna defend them (no offense to you though).

I think Ron had more potential than people give him credit for. JK Rowling probably intended this, but it came off wrong for a lot of people.

And is Ron really that terrible? He's got his faults and strengths and he acts like a normal teenage boy. 11 to 17 year old boys aren't eager to study, they are subject to believing whatever they're told (I mean, Draco is a terrible person with bigoted views because of his parentage, but no one ever calls him stupid), they like sports, they can be starstruck, and they almost never like studying.

But on the other hand he's brave, he can strategize and plan (wizarding chess and that time he figured out that Harry was stuck with the Dursley's, so he planned to take his dad's car and rescue him), and in the end he went through life and death for his friends. He's also the element of fun that Harry and Hermione need. He's always got a joke to say, a game to play, or quidditch to talk about. Comic relief is important.

And the Weasleys are completely realistic. No joke, I used to have neighbors who had 10 kids when they moved next to us, and 14 when they left. The mother was so nice and very maternal. She invited me to movie nights, on outings, to church, to birthday parties, and the list goes on. And, unsurprisingly, her kids sometimes felt insecure having so many siblings. It's normal to want to prove yourself when sibling rivalry is amped up to 11. It's normal to feel jealous at times.

And if you condemn the Weasleys for allowing the abuse, then Hermione, her parents, Dumbledore, Mcgonagall, Hagrid, and everyone else who knew about the Dursley's, is going down too. I can definitely understand Dumbledore and Mcgonagall, they literally placed him on the doorstep knowing how terrible they were, but the Weasleys are pretty darn innocent. They helped him the most, giving him a family in the best way they could.

That being said, I think fanfic is fun because writers can change that. People who bash on characters are completely free to do so, that's an interpretation and it's their fic to write, not mine. But people can also write Ron in a favorable light, building upon the things that could have been. Had his character been more thoughtfully written he may have had a better character arch, going from a wide eyed but insecure child, to a quick witted wizard who is confident in his place in the world.

I dunno though, that's just my two cents.

***** I don't personally bash Ron (at least, not so far), but it is an easy stretch for fanfiction. This trope is pretty much tied to bashing fics, and I do enjoy a good bashing fic. I also enjoy non-bashing fics.

Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Hagrid, absolutely. Hagrid may be a "simple soul," but he's an adult who works in a school, and spends significant amounts of time with Harry, and thus responsible. Hermione, for all that she thought she was an authority figure, was a child and I don't blame her for missing it. The Drs. Granger never spent more than short periods with him in Diagon Alley and Platform 9-3/4, so while they're trained to spot abuse, I can go either way on whether or not they notice. But if they *do* notice, judging by how much of a rule-follower Hermione is, I don't believe they would let it go unreported. (For all the good it would do, in a bashing fic where Dumbledore would obliviate any necessary Muggle authorities.)

** A conversation between Hermione and Harry in one of my stories explains my theory (and a common theory) behind the "Ron designed to be Harry's best friend" trope.

--------------

“I mean... it can't be both ways, can it?" Hermione asked, "Either... until that year, the Weasleys ALWAYS took the Floo to Platform Nine and Three Quarters like most magical families, which brings into question about why they didn't do it that year. Or...”

“They always took the Muggle route,” Harry said, “Which would bring up the question about why Molly was confused about where the Platform was, and why she was screaming about it out loud, and also about Muggles.”

“Which points to the fact that they were baiting you,” Hermione said.

... .... ....

“And then there is Ron on the train,” Hermione said. “'Everywhere else is full?' He said that? He lied... there were two empty compartments on the that car alone when I visited you and him.

“And if there weren't, he could have sat with his brothers,” Harry said. “Right. And then, of course, the very first thing he asked me when he found out my name, was 'do you have the scar?'”

--------------

This is taken by facts in the book, with Molly Weasley breaking the Statute of Secrecy with every breath she spoke in King's Cross near Harry, plus Ron wanting to sit with Harry because "everywhere else is full"? On a magical train? PLEASE! He then asks Harry if he has the scar? Fan-boy in the extreme. Why didn't Ron sit with his brothers if 'everywhere else was full'? I can understand Ron avoiding the twins because they were pranksters, and he thought they might tease him and stuff. But responsible Prefect, big brother, Percy would have let his brother sit with him.

So why didn't this happen? Because Ron was designed (whether by his mother, or Dumbledore, or whatever) to find Harry, introduce him to his and his family's (and Dumbledore's?) opinions of the magical world, and become his first friend, and best friend, by the time the train ride was done.

Harry was bullied by Dudley for most of his life before Hogwarts, and Ron's attitude toward Hermione before, and on (and after?) Halloween, was bullying. How did Harry, with a history of being bullied, not realize how toxic Ron was toward someone like Hermione, especially in the first book when their friendship was new?

(Lee has a tarantula and Percy had a rat, which later became Ron's. Do these kids even read their Hogwarts letters? Even if the owl/cat/toad limit is only for first years, Ron *is* a first year when he acquires Scabbers.)

** Typically the trope is there to bash the Weasleys and Dumbledore at the same time - namely, by pushing Harry into a friendship with people that Dumbledore controls, and thus putting him even more under his influence.

If employed in a more generous manner, it could be used to show Dumbledore caring some about Harry - for instance, by asking a family he trusts to come through the Muggle way to make sure that Harry isn't lost, and knowing/hoping that a friendship with Ron - a member of a healthy/loving family - could help Harry. Plus, Molly's mothering instincts are something Harry did need in canon, and often enjoyed.

Canon Ron is not brilliant, he's not a great strategist (other than being good at chess), and is by and large just a normal guy - which most people are. And Harry doesn't need extraordinary friends, really - Hermione turned out to be that way, but there really aren't any others that stand out as much as she does in their year.

**** Don't forget that spiders are his biggest, deepest, darkest fear at that point. Like, imagine your worst fear, and then actively walking towards it. That's crazy. That's the most loyal act you could do.

Damn, the more I think about it, beyond the character archetypes and the worldbuilding, the original books just weren't all that consistent overall, were they? Like, this is the guy that faces his worst fear for his friend, and then cusses him out only a year later, despite knowing said friend would never do what he says he did?

It didn't help of course that all his best lines went to Hermione in the movies, relegating him into a role of "stands beside and looks vacant". What's also weird is how that, then, inspired a weird tradition of extreme hatred toward Hermione, which you can still see echoes of in this subreddit. Like, occasional profanity-laced threads requesting fics where she "gets what she deserves", or those random lads who hate on her character every chance they get.

Ron and Hermione truly get the worst in this community, with Dumbledore at the first spot. Like, there are people who can't even seperate fanon dumbledore from canon dumbledore anymore.

***** I think, deepest fear wise, the books did a number on that. Like Neville having Snape as his worst fear is played up more for laughs than anything else. Yes, Snape was a terrible/scary teacher, but... Well, he came across more as a bad, screaming teacher than something terrifying (His teaching style always reminded me of my 2nd grade teacher, who would scare the parents with her very loud proclamations).

So with Ron, his fear of spiders is contrasted less with a debilitating phobia, and more with 'fear of an angry teacher' on the grand scale of things - and makes his subsequent jealousy the next book not seem incongruous.

(I suspect his jealousy and [temporary] abandonment of Harry in GoF is a big part of why some people don't like Ron, on an unrelated note. I know that it's one that's stuck with me far more than anything about the movies, though I know what you mean about the extreme hatred towards Hermione. That one is at least partly inspired by her being the most visible female character in the series, and thus the subject of a ton of Mary Sue stories, in a way that stands out to some to a greater degree than equivalent power fantasies for Harry).

****** I agree with you, and would like to add that JKR, despite inventing them, doesn't know how truly terrifying and unbeatable a Boggart would be. Like, deepest, darkest fear? In the middle of a classroom with your peers? What if one of those kids had been abused, mentally, physically or even sexually? What if one of them was gay, or trans, or something like that, and afraid of being outed?

The fears she then presents aren't fitting at all - for instance, I don't truly believe that Neville fears Snape more than he fears Bellatrix Lestrange, or perhaps even the idea of her winning over him if he goes to seek revenge.

Or how many of those kids would have Voldemort as their deepest fear.

I also don't congrue with the idea that a Dementor boggart means you fear Fear itself, but that it means you fear a Dementor. You know, those immortal, invincible demons that can take your /soul/ and deny you the afterlife, instead granting a fate worse than death by either sensory deprivating your soul for all eternity or /destroying it/? Those fucking things?

The term "Mary Sue" has also become completely idiotic over the years. Every powerful female character is called that, and it doesn't make sense for 90% of them. Conversely, we have stupid, dumb power fantasies that only exist to show how cool Harry is, or exist to use Harry as an outlet for the author's political views, and they are praised. But god forbid you mention the Arithmancer, because that story has a powerful female lead, it must be a mary sue!

Which, theoretically, wouldn't have been necessary if he had sent anybody except Hagrid for his orientation.

Again, just being a Devil's Advocate. Certainly, the Dursleys being intimidated by Hagrid is what got Harry to Diagon Alley at all in canon. But, rather than going through that fiasco with the multiple letters that irritated them in the first place, there should have been a single letter followed by a teacher visit, as Hermione (and presumably all the muggle-borns) received.

** I absolutely hate this trope.

IMO one of the biggest talents of JKR is that she writes realistic people: villains that have good aspects to their character and good people who are flawed.

Which brings me to the reason why I hate this trope: One, it is common plot-point in "evil dumbledore" fics, which I am not a fan of.

Yes, they can be fun to read, but one of the great things about Dumbledore is that he is a good, but flawed character. His character arch in the book goes from "greatest wizard in the world" to "human with flaws" in book six and seven. It mirrors most children's perception of their parents when going from 11 to 18, which is another aspect that I admire JKR and HP for.

Throwing that out and making Dumbledore the secret villain cheapens that.

Second, it is a variation of Ron bashing (which I dislike) and it ignores the realistic, age-appropriate potrayal of children and teens in the books. (See above.)

Arranging the friendship between Ron and Harry in the way it is portrayed in many of these fics is a level of manipulation that is simply unrealistic in the real world. It can be difficult to force children to do anything they don't want unless you resort to discipline, nevermind make them be friends with a person that you choose. You can introduce two 11 year olds, but there is absolutely no guarantee that they will get along. Just ask any parent or teacher who has to handle two or more kids at the same time.

I can see Dumbledore asking Molly to keep an eye out for Harry, but anything more? No way.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

You honestly should read some "in the defense of Ron" essays.

Ron is the heart of trio, I would argue that he is essential for Harry's emotional well-being. He is a stabilizing influence on the mess that is Harry's life. Ron becoming his friend after years of bullying by Dudley is a big relief for Harry, it is the first link in a support network that allows him to heal from the abuse inflicted by the Dursleys.

​

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Ron is loyal and a great friend. Just read PoA again where Ron tells Sirius Black that he has to kill him first to get to Harry. Or PS, where Ron sacrifices himself in the chess game so that Harry can get ahead.

Yes, there are times when they fight and yes, there are times when Ron could have acted different. But don't forget, he is a normal teenager. He is flawed and not perfect. He is loyal, but not blind and dumb loyal. During GOF he is angry at Harry bc he thinks Harry put his name into the Goblet and did not tell him. He feels betrayed and lied to and acts out. You would be angry too, especially if you risked your life only 2-3 months prior for this person who now stabs you in the back. Ditto for DH when he walks out. He had different expectations, was dissappointed and he wore the locket at the same time.

I tend to encounter Ron-bashing mostly in the form that he is lazy and intends to use Harry's fame to get ahead in the wizarding world, usually with a side order of him being stupid and relying on Hermione doing his work for him.

This is then followed by the argument that Harry would be vastly better off in Slytherin with Slytherin friends who help him become an overachiever, the next Elon Musk or Minister of Magic or Super-Auror etc instead of lazing about playing exploding snap and being held back by Ron.

As if there is anything wrong with not wanting the top job and being totally happy working low to mid-tier level of work. Makes me so mad.

*** The only reason is plausible deniability. It also gives Harry a connection to the wizarding world. Having the Weasley family meet Harry could lay the ground work for Dumbledore to build on. If the Weasley family is innocently being manipulated in a story Ron could be views as a good sacrifice to make to get Harry to trust him. Ron is normally viewed as not the brightest Weasley or the most driven of his family. So if something happens to him let's say in the first three years he can be viewed as a hero protecting his friend while telling Harry you should have came to me first. Hermione is the wild card not loyal to Dumbledore himself but his position (in the beginning) worst case scenario she's a muggleborn with little political connections. Killing Ron early could isolate Harry. Would the Weasley family if he got Ron killed in the first 3 years? I doubt by then Harry would want to go back to the dursleys. I would think third year would be the best choice for Dumbledore to get control. It wouldn't be much for Dumbledore to have Harry push Hermione away for her protection and remind Harry you killed their son/brother if any of the Weasley family tries to contact him.

** It totally has no basis in real canon and i would never, in a million years, imagine Rowling ever had such a possibility in her mind while writing Harry Potter. But imo, it all goes downhill when the author's intention and the actual story are not in sync. This trope became popular partly because it is so freaking easy to see the whole books as a conspiracy theory. The original meeting with the Weasleys screams of a set up. Right, a Sacred 28 family waltzing around Muggle London, breaching the Statute of Secrecy with every word that comes out of their mouth. Then in Ootp, there is absolutely no reason for the Weasleys or Hermione to be at Grimauld other than to create yet another scenario for Harry. There are so many parts of canon that fit so perfectly into the grand conspiracy theory, Weasleys are just one cog in it. Why do you think Dumbledore bashing is so common?

*** While I'm not an anyone-basher (I'm a big fan of the original books as they were written and love the characters as they were originally created), on some level I can see why people want to bash Dumbledore. When you really take into consideration how much of everything was orchestrated by him, and how little he spent time mentoring the boy who was supposed to save the wizarding world, it's easy to put him into the role of a puppet master, and puppet masters never have a positive role really.

As well as that, it's easy to be frustrated with Dumbledore when you think of all the mistakes he made (like leaving Harry with an abusive family with little to no remorse, or keeping him uninformed on things that should have absolutely been his business, etc, etc, etc) there's probably some catharsis in playing him up as someone who is so openly a villain. The author of fanfictions get the chance to right any wrongs they see in the story, and that opens up characters who aren't perfect to being vilified for the sake of telling a story with a more (respectively) satisfactory outcome, whether it be emotionally or just for the fun of writing out some karmic justice on slights perceived.

That's my take anyway.

This is while I'll support Bash Fics. I don't have to read them, no one /has/ to read them, and if someone wants to write Dumbledore as a manipulative old bastard then that's their right.

I might not agree with their portrayal, but I can just close the story if it offends me too much.

***** Ditto. I think there are very few fics I disapprove of, and even then, like you said: You can just close the story. I personally don't find the bashing fics offensive. I've seen it make for some very interesting, fun, and/or intriguing stories! Even when it's a character I like, I've found myself able to read through bashing fics so long as the writing is good and the story is engaging!

** For Hermione, another "advantage" (from Dumbledore's viewpoint) is that she's a slave to authority. Pretty much her first recommendation is always going to be, "Tell Dumbledore." And, we know from the broom incident in the first book, that she's even willing to be a tattle-tale if they won't do so on their own.

*** Dumbles kept his key for 10 years, gave it to Hagrid for his first shopping trip. That is canon. It's implied in the 2nd book, and stated outright in the third, that Harry has access to his vaults, which means he has his key. It's not until GoF that Molly has gone into his vault and purchased his school items without him. How? Maybe she asked for his key and it's just not described in the book. In Book 5 she asks for his booklist but not his key. In Book 6, it's BILL who hands Harry a bag of his own money one morning at breakfast saying that he did it as a favor because of long wait times. (I don't think I'd consider it a favor if somebody, unsolicited, says, "Oh hey, I took this out of your bank account for you. You're welcome.")

I'm fairly certain that the concept of "magical guardian" is fanon, but if Molly and Bill don't have to get Harry's key, then the only logical conclusion is that there's another key out there, and you only need one guess to figure out whose control-freak paws have it.

Don't forget, Dumbledore also gave Harry *his own property* (the cloak) as a Christmas gift. How benevolent.

** My idea is that Ron is a connection to the wizarding world. Harry has no real tied to the wizarding world. I think that Dumbledore would use the Wesley's as a anchor. People may question why Harry Potter would be giving up on magic. The meeting on the platform gives Dumbledore influence indirectly for Harry as Dumbledore influences the Wesley family. The problem with the Wesley family is if there involved with the manipulation. In my mind Dumbledore just mentioned to Molly to look out for Harry to make sure he reaches the platform safely.

I see Dumbledore protecting the Wesley's when things went wrong. Ron nearly getting Hermione killed first year. (Making sure troll incident becoming public. Ron and Harry are responsible for Hermione being in danger. Bad or boy who lives kills muggleborn) the second year with Ginny using the diary. Third year and scabbers. They never questioned about a random rat they found and lived so long. Basically a hand me down pet for Ron.

** My best "benign intent" scenario for Molly's breach of the Statute of Secrecy is that she was doing as many parents do: asking a question they know the answer to, to have their young children give the answer.

** I dislike the trope and the implications it carries, but I'll assume the mindset of the people who use it.

You could make the argument that Ron's familial connections are a strong factor. Two of his brothers were already highly skilled wizards, his mum's a secret badass, and his other brothers well on their way to match.

The Weasleys are also obviously a very loving family; juxtaposed against his upbringing by the Dursleys, they would inspire great loyalty in Harry. Give him something to fight for beyond his own immediate benefit.

#+end_quote

Are they really? Let's explore that.

Mr. Weasley: kind, gentle man. Hen-pecked, hides out in his shed to avoid conflict. Doesn't stop his wife from sending multitudes of howlers, never even attempts to rein in the twins. Lets Molly and Ginny (plus Hermione) insult and belittle Fleur without saying a word in her defense.

Mrs. Weasley: routinely humiliates her children with public howlers. Browbeats her husband (and pretty much everybody around her). Tries to dictate the twins' future careers, including belittling their every effort toward their own dreams. Insults and bosses Sirius in his own home, where she acts as though she's in charge even though she's a guest, including assigning chores to other people's children. Repeatedly insults a guest in her home (Fleur), wants to break up her engagement. Lets the twins get away with pretty much everything, with only ineffective screeching to "guide" them. Used a love potion to "get her man," and feels no compunction about that. Can't tell the twins apart (not that they really seem to want her to), nor remember that Ron hates corned beef.

Bill: Ginny's favorite brother. Brave and skilled. Lets his female relatives walk all over his fiancée without defending her. This does not bode well for her in their married life.

Charlie: the only one I can't think of anything negative about.

Percy: uptight, kind of the black sheep. Pompous and prideful. Blinded by ambition. Even as a prefect in the same house, never noticed his sister's dilemma in her first year. Insists his family cut their ties to Harry. When they won't, he cuts ties with them rather harshly (except to use them as a way to get his boss in to see Harry). Comes around in the end, but who knows if he will let his ambition get in the way again in the future.

Gred and Feorge: on the surface, fun-loving, harmless lunatics. Until you look deeper, and realize they're borderline sociopaths. They constantly harrass Percy, about pretty much every facet of his life. Before Ron even started school, they (1) turned his teddy into a spider [imagine a teddy-bear sized spider!], (2) burned a HOLE in his TONGUE with an acid pop, and (3) induced him to give an Unbreakable Vow (narrowly stopped by their parents). Once they start developing their candies, Ron is forcibly and unwillingly used as a guinea pig. Completely ignore any and all parental attempts to curb their behavior.

Ron: resents his family situation. Massive case of sibling rivalry, as the sixth and "unwanted" son. Wants to outdo his brothers (ref. Mirror of Erised vision), but without putting any effort into making that happen.

Ginny: spoiled and willful, with a nasty temper (known for her bat-bogey curse). Manipulative (dates Dean to get Harry's attention). Calls Fleur names while a guest in her home.

** I'd say that Ron is the only one from the trio that actively doesnt directly run into trouble, you could say he is the middleman to separate Harry and The Boy Who Lived.

Which means that deep down Dumbledore does care and he knows that Ron is loyal to his friends which would make Harry sacrifice himself for his friends.

/whoa/

So basically Dumbledore battered Harry up to serve him with a side of burger sauce...

(Ron and Dumbledore are coincidentally my favourite characters lol)
