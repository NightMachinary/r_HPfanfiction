Having just written an action sequence, I thought I'd share this very useful video with people. It's pretty in depth (30 mins) but gives some great, practical advice on the nitty gritty of stuff like sentence structure, word choice, and pacing. It also uses lots of "worked examples" from literary sources, including OotP.

Highly recommended to all fanfic authors.

** Also series of videos by [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6WIWaqaAHgfES_7nY7BYhA][John August]], e.g., [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRTbAOmL94Q][Entering the scene]]. Yes, it is more on the screenplay writing, but it feels excellent.
