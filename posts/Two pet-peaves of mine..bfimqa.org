1: Abandoned stories should NEVER be marked complete unless you disclose it in the description or the first chapter. Even if you upload an epilogue that contains all the depressing plot twists. (Can you tell this just happened to me? That story shouldn't of been tagged adventure/friendship.)

2: Long (over 300k) stories that are marked complete that don't wrap up and so continue in their sequel, which hasn't updated since 2010.


** People really mark abandoned stories as complete? That's...awful. Would you list out the ones you know that do this, that way the rest of us can be prepared? Thanks in advance!

As far as the second point goes, since authors are usually kind enough to state that there is a sequel in the description of the initial fic, as soon as I see it I check the status of the sequel. I only started to do that /after/ I got through a few series that ended up that way.

*** the two ones I remember are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11344172/1/][Magic Through the Gate]] a stargate crossover that ends very abruptly, the author got flamed so they finished it with a short epilogue.

Now the other one still has enough to be be readable, this one (the one that inspired this post) doesn't get to the point where its plot gets interesting and tops it off with a utterly depressive epilogue summing up future plot points.

  After the war, little has changed for Muggleborns in Britain, so Hermione seeks a place where she will fit in and be welcome. She finds somewhere unexpected, where she can feel useful again. When Harry begins to feel equally displaced at home, due to problems arising from being Master of the Elder Wand, she invites him to join her. For once no Harry or Ron bashing! AU.

*** A quick search of the word 'abandoned', filtered for harry potter stories marked as complete returns 877 stories. There may be some that actually use that word as part of the summary, but it also doesn't include 'on hold' or 'hiatus' or the many more that are abandoned without the author marking it as such.

It is, sadly, fairly common.
