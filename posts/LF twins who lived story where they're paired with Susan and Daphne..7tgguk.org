Something like this [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12379977/11/Harry-Potter-and-the-Power-of-Two]]

If possible I'd prefer no Hermione at all in the story but if she must be in it at least let her be as unimportant as possible and in no way shape or form is she to be in the pairing. Bashing of anybody is fine, preferably no redeeming Snape but that's unimportant in the end.

  Completely AU. A fierce Lily protects her twins from a meddling Headmaster. This time the adults take action. A different Wrong Boy Who Lived fic. Good Potters. Powerful Harry and twin. Goes through 4th year. Very minor bashing, kind of, sort of, well read A/N in first chapter. Some romance towards the middle, when the boys are older. OC (Gary Potter)/Susan Bones.
