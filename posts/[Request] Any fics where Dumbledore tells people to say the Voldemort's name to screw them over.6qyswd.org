We find out in the 7th book that Voldemort's put a taboo on his name, and it stands to reason that he did the same thing in the first war, possibly contributing to the mass fear of saying his name. Dumbledore most likely knew about this, and almost certainly knew Voldemort was going to come back at some point. Why then, did he tell everyone to be more comfortable saying the name, knowing the taboo would likely happen again.

Obviously he wasn't trying to do it on purpose in canon, but I'm curious if any fics with this specific alternative characterization exist, primarily because I have yet to see one, even after 5 years of reading HPFF.

Thank you for the help!

*** Ah that makes a little more sense. It's been too long since I last read the books.

*** It just tells that people were afraid to use his name, but doesn't tell us why they were afraid.
