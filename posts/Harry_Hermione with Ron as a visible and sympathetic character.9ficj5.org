i.e. Ron is there and not a bad guy.

â€‹

Please tell me this exists! I certainly haven't found any on my own. Ron always seems to be bashed or barely appearing.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005), is a very unique postwar fic, canon compliant until the end of DH, and things really got interesting after chapter 5. It's also the first H/Hr fic I've found that depicts Ron (and Ginny) as heroes.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** I remember an AU 6th year story where Harry nearly got beaten to death by the Dursleys over the summer and Ron and Hermione spend some time with him in Diagon. They find out about the abuse (Harry is badly injured after all), Hermione tears into Dumbledore for the whole mess and a lot of supportive conversations between the trio take place.

Eventually, Harry and Hermione are together and Ron supports them, +but I cannot find the story on FFN+.

#+begin_quote
  Set the summer after OOTP. Hermione gets struck by Dolohov's Curse in the Department of Mysteries and that sparks a change in the relationship between Harry and Hermione. They help each other deal with the grief, finding solace in each other and, eventually, love. Rated M for mentions of child abuse, some swearing and mild adult situations.

Try *An Assault on the Senses* linkffn(1260207) for something humorous.

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8/5][*Come Together*]] also fits. It was written way before the last books where published but still takes place postwar.

Zero bashing in any of these.

** Nah they exist. You've got Starfox's recent writing, Harry Potter and the Lady Thief, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief by Starfox5). Without spoiling too much, Harry and Ron are still the best of friends in the story and Ron actually dates Luna throughout it (opposites attract thing). In this story, I actually think they toned down Ron and muted some of his flaws, but perhaps his pairing with Luna and not being as close to Hermione changed his character.

In fact, the two recent short stories, Petunia Evans Tomb Raider and Returned, Reformed, and Really Trying are notable for ending without draco dying (though in RRRT, he does get it pretty bad).

He hadn't died yet in Lady Thief, but theres still time for that.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
