That's humour/crack; Dark!Harry/AU and one shot/Post-Hogwarts respectively. Probably some of the best in their respective categories. Other people would recommend jbern, joe6991 and A Black Comedy, but for the life of me I can't enjoy them.

**** People generally don't like HPMoR here, because though it can be entertaining for some and it's not /horribly/ written, there's a lot of lost potential there and if you don't turn a blind eye to it you can see that there's a lot of arrogance---in the form of “hahah, I am right, you are not”---too (which makes the lost potential taste more bitterly). That said, it's not really put on the same level as “My Immortal”, just in the same category, meaning that it's something that is a hit-or-miss for many.

I will admit willingly that I did enjoy it. But I've also read some of Yudkowsky's other works and I will also willingly admit that he could have done way better with HPMoR and yet he didn't.

**** I wouldn't say they're 'on the same level'. But they're both (in)famous and influential fics that don't contain particularly good writing. And no, HPMOR's not very popular around here.

Personally, I enjoyed (most of) HPMOR, but recognise it's not a very good fic. Cleverly plotted, yes, but there's no depth to the characters. And it has the annoying habit of smugly (and unoriginally) pointing out plotholes in canon while making sharp divergences from canon.

It's funny enough and fun enough that I finished it, but I felt like hitting my head against a hard surface multiple times.

** Maybe I'm just a sucker for the first things that got me into FF, but mine are as follows:

1) Start out with some Northumbrian work. I first got into FF wanting some after the war stories, so Tales of the Battle or Grave Days will work. My personal canon is a mix of Northumbrian's world, After the End, and my second recommendation:

2) Australia by MsBinns. Love the Ron and Hermione relationship that slowly develops. Anyone who thinks that relationship would have been an easy transition from friends to lovers is crazy.

3) A Difference in the Family: the Snape Chronicles. Definitely memorializes Snape too much and gives him way too much credit and tries to dismiss his awful decisions as bad misunderstandings, but so many fans love Snape and so they would love this introduction to a heavy Snape fic.

4) Ok, I'm going to cheat and list some other options: The War Widow, The First Day, The Aurors, The Innocent series, are all great intros into fanfiction.

I also think once you are more advanced, then delve into Alexandra Quick, A Marauder's Plan, The Harder Struggle, and The Lie I've Lived.

** Alexandra Quick 1,2, and 3

Or not, since those would actually probably be better off after they've read more traditional hp stuff, but do say to read those eventually.

For my real answer, something with time travel either backwards with purpose or nightmares of future past or maybe dependa est depending on what you think they would like. Something with a non gryffendor Harry but not an evil one, probably either on the way to greatness, or hp and the boy who lived, or hp and the prince of Slytherin, and lastly either something a bit crackish like seventh horcruz or lily and the art of being sysiphus or something heavily AU like the aforementioned sysiphus or the pure blood pretense, again depending on their personal tastes. This would give a mix of different types of fics.

** Definitely [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]], since it's short, poignant and proves the worth of fanfiction.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4036037/1/Two-Weeks-in-the-Alley][Two Weeks in the Alley]] is a bit longer but far less serious, and the author has a bucket-load more stories to get them rolling.

After those, I'd point them towards a larger work, but it would depend on what genre appealed to them more- action or romance or power fantasy or slice of life...

** linkffn(Isolation by Bex-chan)

One of the more persuasive Dramione fics out there, so it's a good introduction into the ship. Writing quality is pretty high, too. It was my introduction fic into the fandom, and well, I'm still here after a year so.

linkffn(8045114)

I'm reading A Marauder's Plan right now, and it seems like a pretty good introduction fic, too. Features a Manipulative!Dumbledore without being too heavy on it (like those fics where Dumbledore is basically out to get Harry--don't get me wrong I love those fics, but I think they're pretty exaggerated and potentially off-putting for someone who is just breaking into fanfic), as well as Abused!Harry, though the abuse sticks to what we know for sure from canon. I think it's a good intro to the heavier stuff fanfiction has, though, because the someone actually does something about it, and tells us that leaving Harry with the Dursleys in canon was definitely wrong and morally unjustifiable.

linkffn(4927160)

In Care Of is a mentor!Snape fic, where Snape is forced to see for himself the kind of person Harry truly is. It keeps to the canon characterisation of Snape, so it's pretty persuasive. I think it's a good intro into the trope, along with the Abused!Harry trope. The abuse in this fic is more serious than what Harry experienced in A Marauder's Plan, but doesn't go too far beyond what remains in the realm of possibility from what we see in canon.

I'll stop here, but you'll probably notice most of these fics are some of the most popular ones on ffn.net. Personally, I think it's better to offer people what most people seem to like, and if they find a trope or pairing that is to their liking, they can go through ffn.net looking for more and pick out the ones that they'll be interested in. The slogging through series of fics and picking out the good from the bad is half the fun for me, tbh.

** Hmm ... that's a neat question.

Upon spending some time looking through the stuff I have in my history and discarding stuff that is good but not complete nor seeming to near it (because, you know, introductory stuff probably shouldn't be a WiP thing), and the same with crossovers because those might be a tad too different for someone just starting, I think I will go with this:

1. “the family evans” (linkao3(3073562)), also known as that story where Petunia is not horrible.

2. “Cauterize” (linkffn(4152700)), what with it serving as a nice epilogue-esque thing for those who didn't really like the original ending.

3. The “Harry the Hufflepuff” series (linkffn(6466185; 7330591; 10843543)), due to being light-hearted comedy stuff that does not rely on anything to be fun (whereas stuff like “A Black Comedy” and “Seventh Horcrux” might).

Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

  "I'm still alive, as you may surmise from this note. Of course, I could be dead and someone is faking the letter to fool you..." Harry is NOT happy about being left at Privet Drive all summer with no one to talk to.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

By turn, those are:

*The Lie I've Lived*

AU GoF, where Harry has James' memories. Harry/Fleur later. Very entertaining; features the best sorting hat personality I've ever read.

*On the Way to Greatness*

AU, Harry gets sorted into Slytherin. Best of all Slytherin!Harry fics. Very high quality.

*Resonance*

AU Sixth year, where Harry gets adopted by Snape, finishes school, enters auror training. This is among my all-time favorite series. I like Snape as a character; but I hate how he's portrayed in most fanfics. This has great Harry - Snape interactions. As well, in this Harry steadily grows more powerful, but instead of that solving his problems, it usually creates more. The power boost is well balanced by new enemies and hostile politics.

*** I strongly suspect that you meant to reply to someone else given that OP doesn't mention Seventh Horcrux at all.

The top comment does, but it's referring to the the /other/ Seventh Horcrux. There's two:

The pre-DH one (which I've never read)

The one that [[/u/PM_ME_BABY_PANDAS]] is referring to which is a cracktastic fic written much later where Harry thinks he IS Lord Voldemort and sets out to reclaim his rightful place as the DADA professor.
