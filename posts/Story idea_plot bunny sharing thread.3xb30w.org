** Crack idea. Peeves mixes Rage/Insanity Potion in the breakfast food. For the next day, everyone in Hogwarts becomes axe crazy, and all the little things that usually just peeve them now get them into a murderous rage. Everyone's personality flaws are intensified.

** Harry gets an intelligent magical battle armor which boosts his abilities. Think Iron Man's suit, but with JARVIS inside and magical rather than technological. It literally just blinks into existence next to him, no one knows where it came from.

Then there's lots of Harry kicking Death Eater ass and the suit making deadpan robotic comments as Harry keeps freaking out because of his new superhuman abilities. Their interactions would be an easy way to add some comedy.

He eventually defeats Voldemort, but the suit gets irreparably damaged in the process. So Harry's all sad because they've been through so many battles together and became best bros. But the suit's all like "there's no need for sadness. My purpose has been fulfilled. Goodbye for now... my creator."

*** I so like this. If someone could preface this with some sort of background on ancient runes and how Harry could learn and integrate that knowledge into muggle technology. OoooOoOooo

** I've pretty much abandoned my story, so I'll throw it out there:

There is another secret society, aside from the OotP and the Death Eaters. I called it the Opposing Movement, and the function of it was:

1. thickening the plot. Think of all the betrayals, spies and secret deals!

2. Making the story a lot more morally ambiguous. Is killing good in a war? Can you still be a good person after you've killed someone? That kind of stuff.

3. Dealing with my own problems by writing them down. The leader of the Opposing Movement was a guy named Melchior and he pretty much represents regret and a lot of intrusive thoughts. He fled Britain after he saw his wife and an entire muggleborn safehouse being executed by Voldemort and co in a really brutal way. He managed to escape and take a very young girl with him in the thick of things. They're both really scarred from it and they have clear signs of depression, traumatic stress and borderline insanity because they've lived an isolated life for 15 years.

Then there's also a big cat-and-mouse game between the two main characters (Harry and Ginny) and Dumbledore/the ministry/the Opposing Movement/Voldemort, because Harry and Ginny had to flee in the third year because they were spotted with Sirius.

I was really excited with the idea and I had grand plans for Harry being possessed as a grand climax of a very long buildup, and saucy love-affairs, but I got so burnt-out of all things HP related that I've moved on to other stories I may or may not end up posting online.

** I am probably never going to write it, but I have a couple of ideas with a Voldemort win scenario (Harry dead).

In a nutshell: The fic would take place in the near future, the characters are mostly OCs. The story's main focus would be an underground resistance movement against the government, with the help some foreign aurors. I have a main character in my mind very clearly, he is a young death eater.

This idea doesn't leave me alone for years now, but I have absolutely no writing talent, not even in my native language. But I want to read this story so badly...

** This is one of my less sane comedy ideas: 'Some Call Me Tim'- wherein the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Tim Turner is a Muggle-raised media junkie, to the point where he's constantly referencing other works (like Fairly Oddparents and Monty Python). The name is also a reference to the idea that he constantly uses a Time Turner to outmaneuver everyone and set up his jokes that almost no one gets. As a story, the mystery would be trying to discover 'Who is this guy, really?'

** A story in which Dumbledore starts doing a good job of balancing what is right and what is necessary. In canon (and even more in fanon) he's /really bad/ at this. He treats Harry terribly "for the greater good" even though it barely is /and/ refuses to kill inner-circle death eaters because "it would be wrong".

But suppose he got his act together. Or maybe started entrusting decisions like that to Moody, or Bones, or McGonagall or basically anybody who isn't living under the shadow of Grindelwald.

Probably best to fork after Goblet of Fire. There could be some outside prompt (a very brief message from the future?) or just a "what if?" author's note.

It should contain lots of badass!Dumbledore scenes, which are always fun to write.

Remember to upgrade Voldemort too, so Dumbledore doesn't curbstomp.

** I would love to see a grey lady trained Harry. Where the ghosts of Hogwarts train him. (From a post I saw here)

I would love to see a Harry trained by different peoplease set up by Albus.

** A story about coping with the aftermath. Not the personal aftermath: the grieving, the interrupted romances, and so on; but the societal aftermath: rebuilding institutions, sorting the guilty from the imperiused, preventing over-broad personal vengeance...

linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation) has some of this, but only bits and pieces (plus it's unfinished).

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

** An indy!Harry story with a competent Voldemort. Not a super-genius Voldemort, just one who doesn't helpfully wait his turn until the Harry-Dumbledore conflict resolves. One who /does/ take the opportunity to kill Harry while Harry's sleeping in a muggle hotel or something.

** Fifth year Hermione travels backwards in time to Tom Riddle's fifth year in the hopes of preventing the entire wizarding war. This is very ambitious of her, so she's sorted into Slytherin. She quickly finds that Tom is the only classmate who can keep up with her intellectually /and/ the only one who doesn't look down on her absence-of-a-family. Despite all she knows, they warm to each other and fall in love.

Thanks to Hermione's influence, Tom rejects pureblood-supremecy. Instead he concludes that his superiority is a product of his muggle background, and launches a campaign to eliminate the pureblood-heavy ministry and replace it with a "meritocracy" -- himself as dictator of course.

Hermione follows along for much of it, since the wizarding world does need a cleanup, but eventually she rejects some plan as too bloody. After a long and climatic battle, Tom kills her.

Fifty years later, Voldemort is as deadly and evil a dark lord as ever. His 'ideology' is the opposite of canon, but it was never more than a fig leaf over his personal ambition anyway.

** I've always been a fan of the scenario where Harry Potter dies in the third task of the Trizwizard Tournament and they enact some grand summoning ritual at the behest of Dumbledore. From there you can dive into some crack or deal with the more dramatic aspects of the scenario. I'd personally like to see an older Naruto mercilessly extort the wizarding world at large before waltzing up to Voldemort and atomizing him with the rasenshuriken. He takes a look around at the flabbergasted magicals then uses the Flying Thunder God to flash back to the Elemental Nations.

**** Exactly! It's not been done nearly as much as the time travel bit, and there's quite a bit of flexibility in the prompt. Another thing I'd like to read would be a Planeswalker (Magic the gathering) studying this particular branch of the universe's brand of magic. Maybe he/she could subtly help out. That particular branch of fanfiction only has like five or six quality stories I can think of off the top of my head, and I had to dig through Spacebattles/SufficientVelocity to find them.
