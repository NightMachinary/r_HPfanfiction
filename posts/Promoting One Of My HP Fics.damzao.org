Hi all! I would like to promote one of my HP fics here. It has a different setup from the usual tropes and I would like to see it spread to a wider audience. There are OCs present and I know how sceptical this fandom is when it comes to them, but these OCs have a fix role and it is not to go full on Deus Ex Machina and being the power he knows not. All that being said, I would like you guys to give this a shot and ConCrit is always appreciated.

  Just before her eleventh birthday, Violet Potter disappeared from the wizarding world's watchful gaze. When she was eighteen they found her again, but not the hero they were hoping for. Having spent most of her teen years in the streets, she now enjoyed the simple pleasures in life. Why save the world if you could chill and toke?
