** I don't think there is really a good way to make abusers stop being abusive without writing it out of them. Whatever Harry would have tried, they wouldn't have liked him for it. In the books he tried to be as silent and obedient as possible and they still belittled and found fault with him- because those faults don't exist, even if he was acting as perfectly as possible, they would still see him as faulty.

I've read fics where Harry gets odd jobs because they keep him out of the house, which suits the Dursleys. Usually Dudley bullies the money out of him though, and he has less time for chores. I wouldn't call that a good way of him avoiding their wrath.

** It's not hard to take away the Durselys' worst abuse (the cupboard particularly), while still keeping them emotionally distant and making Dudley clearly the favorite child. Obviously that's not a great situation for Harry, but not to the point where someone would want to call CPS (or whatever the British version is) on them.

Or, if you're asking for what Harry could choose to do after starting Hogwarts in order to get a better living situation, them the best option is probably to just never be seen. Either stay in his room or out of the house all day, keep all magic paraphernalia inside his room, and never let anyone magical come visit.

Or he could try talking to the Durselys about how backwards and awful the magical world is, and how he appreciates the normal world much more. As long as he doesn't go too far and convince them that he wants to be pulled out of Hogwarts, they might be able to bond over how terrible Malfoy, Fudge, etc. are.

** In canon, the threat of magic works until they find out he's not allowed. Later, the threat of Sirius finding out and coming after them does the same. Lastly, dudley realizing harry protected him briefly does the trick, though Harry doesn't realize it.

*** I mean, a single, solitary adult in Harry's life not being trash would do it. One teacher who sets child protective services on them and follows up.

** I don't really have anything to contribute to the discussion but the fic "Burning Red" kinda goes that way. The Dursleys aren't technically nice (from what I can recall) but the Harry in this uses his brain and somewhat manipulates the Dursleys to get what he wants.

** Depends on what exactly you mean by making it work for him: if you mean let him have an emotionally healthy childhood pre-Hogwarts, that's mostly not gonna happen (even if he's able to get care and attention from other adults, he's still going home to a pair of willfully negligent abusers whom he /knows/ to be capable of providing far better care than they are), but if you mean that he gets through a shitty childhood relatively unscathed, then I think canon actually does a pretty good job with that. He's definitely unrealistically well adjusted, but his distrust and disdain of and for authority figures and general self-reliance (the only adult he asks for help without trying to manipulate them for the first two books is Hagrid, and the /one time/ he goes to McGonagall, he describes it as "throwing caution to the wind") are both very much indicative of an emotionally neglectful upbringing.

*** I guess I wasn't really so good at explaining what I meant in my post but one idea that I had of how this could work is if the dursleys were more well to do and they hired a nanny who would have been nicer to Harry
