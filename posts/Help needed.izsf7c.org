:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I found this description of a fic, and I'm wondering if anyone knows which one it is.

"James are Lily are alive, the Marauders were all together, Peter didn't betray the Marauders and instead helped lead Voldemort into a trap where James Potter single-handedly destroyed Voldemort with no help from anyone else and escaped perfectly sound and alright just as Dumbledore walked in to see the corpse of Voldemort. He then went on to be an Auror. (Generally James is OP in this book, he survives a bite from Nagini, dodges an Avada Kedavra curse, breaks into and out of Azkaban, obliterates a Dementor, etc. Which really should have been a huge red flag but like I said, the writing was really good.)

So, when Harry gets his letter and all, he is given this talk by James and the rest of the Marauders where they give him points to (and I kid you not) bully the hell out of Severus. They give him the map and the cloak, tell him Snape's old nickname, teach him hexes and tell him other embarassing stories from their Hogwarts days to spread around the school to torment Snape with.

Then Harry goes to school and we finally meet Snape. Snape is reduced to this caricature of a man. I will not go into detail, but the Snape was incredibly OOC, no snarky comments, just attempts to reign in the class when Harry will interrupt his teaching with a ‘sassy shot' and a ‘Snivellus' and the entire class would burst into laughter. Then Snape would sentence Harry to detention but Harry would go to Dumbledore and cry, ‘Bullying!' and the detention doesn't hold, or he would reduce points that McGonagall would then add on, etc.

There was... a lot.

The turning point for me, where I just couldn't finish the fanfic was when they staged a parents-teacher meeting, because Snape went to Dumbledore to complain about Harry. You can probably guess how the meeting went, Harry talked about how Snape failed him and regularly sent him to detention and everyone was shocked about how abusive Snape was, especially Lily and James. Lily then told Dumbledore in ‘her no-nonsense voice' that this was unacceptable and she demanded that Harry be withdrawn from Snape's class and be put in a more competent class that would be helpful to his needs. And Dumbledore agreed with her, and said that since Snape was obviously being unfair, all of Harry's fail grades would be changed to an Acceptable, then James jumped in with a ‘Considering how he was forced to deal with an abusive teacher, I think it should be an Exceeds Expectations, don't you?'

Of course, this wasn't even the worse thing.

After the meeting, Snape is shown to be sidling up to Lily and trying to talk to her. But once he touches her, she turns on him with a hex telling him to get away from her and she is done with his creepy predatory bs. Then James and the Marauders jump in with a ‘How dare you touch my wife. Don't you think you've done enough to my son as it is?' Then Lily herds Harry away, and I think we have possibly been pitied enough to not see what goes down but no. The narrative which had previously been in Harry's POV, jumps to James POV. And the writer re-enacts SWM. Except worse, as Snape is left bleeding in the hallway."

Not my own words, but I'm wondering which fic it is.
