I shipped Remus/Sirius years ago, and I'd like to get back in and read a few. What are your favorites? Remus and Sirius don't have to be the main focus of the story, but it would be nice if there are at least a few story arcs about their relationship. Any other pairings are fine and any era!


** Accidentally in love is a great one (marauder's era)! Stealing Harry is an awesome series that is AU, if Sirius and Remus raised harry from age 8.

linkffn(accidentally in love by lupinslittlesister) linka03(Stealing Harry)

I don't know I tagged those correctly. But yeah those are my favourite; I keep going back and rereading those. remus/sirius is my favourite ship.

*** It's a shame Stealing Harry has been abandoned.

copperbadge is a fantastic writer (look no further than Cartographer's Craft for proof), and it's too bad they decided to end the series.

It's nice they wrote out the outlines for where the series was heading though, so it's not like it's completely abandoned.

**** yeah it's beautifully written and the story telling is excellent. I've reread the whole series a bunch of times.

The ships in Cartographer's Craft are stopping me from giving it a try. I can definitely do Harry/Sirius, but just thinking of Remus with Tonks makes me heart hurt lol. It's like I can handle them with other people if there's only one of them in the story, but if both Remus and Sirius are in a story together it's tough for me to think of them with someone else.

Should I suck it up and try it anyway?

***** I'd definitely give it a shot.

Since Sirius is de-aged (and Remus is very adamantly straight in this fic) it's not distracting at all.

The characterization is done really well in the sense that you actually /don't/ want Remus to end up with Sirius because of how Sirius is written. Remus grew up into a mature adult, and Sirius is still just a kid really.

  There was a reason as to why Sirius Black never married. The girl he loved was married to his best mate. This is a case of Romeo losing his Juliet, without all the deaths. Rated K because it's general. Long one-shot.

** /Total copy/paste from a thread a few weeks ago./

I love Remus/Sirius, especially in the Marauder days.

linkffn(Casting Moonshadows) is great, probably my favourite Remus/Sirius out there. It's not completed, but it's also not abandoned, the author just takes six months to a year to post new chapters now.

linkffn(Once in a Blue Moon COMPLETE) it's been ages since I've read it, but it's a great AU of the Marauder years.

linkffn(Hairy Snout, Human Heart) another AU Marauder year, but don't bother with the sequel. It's not only abandoned it's also not that great (James pretends to be a werewolf to get the heat off of Remus, honestly!)

Keep in mind these are fairly old, so they may have a couple cliches in them, but over all I think they hold up great. They are also, by and large, 'focused' on the pairing. While they all have plenty of plot (and all of it quite good) they are primarily romance fics, and focus on the relationship of Remus/Sirius.

** Check out the [[http://rs-games.livejournal.com][RS Games]], a fest that goes on every year! They produce a lot of great stuff, and serve as a wonderful jumping-off point for finding new authors to read.

NeonDomino on ffn has good sets of AUs, most under 3k but collected as chapters. linkffn(Fifty Shades of Sirius Black) is a more recent collection, there's one for Remus as well, and there are a few sets of A-Z AUs.

LadyFaceElena is over on AO3, and has a lot of good stuff--mostly muggle AU oneshots, but a couple of chaptered fics as well and one long AU with no setting change. linkao3(Wholly Civilised) is a personal favourite, but there are 105 fics there to read!

Another person mentioned linkao3(Text Talk), and I'll add linkao3(Aesthetic: Trash Boys) to that. Similar concept, cowritten by the author of Text Talk, and with accompanying art!

picascribit and pommedeplume/potatoalchemist are both on AO3 as well, and I highly recommend all of their works. Fair warning: not all endings are happy.

Someone else linked linkao3(Stealing Harry) and I will second that rec (and the series afterwards) wholeheartedly. Copperbadge is an amazing writer, and all of his works are well worth reading.

linkao3(Song of Songs by mad_martha) is an old fic that was extended. It's part of a longer AU 'verse, but it stands well on its own. It was originally written before DH came out, so it doesn't hold to later canon. It is, however, one of my favourite fics of all time. Have tissues handy.

bluepeony is also on AO3 with a lot of AUs of varying lengths. linkao3(Finest in Fairford) is my favourite.
