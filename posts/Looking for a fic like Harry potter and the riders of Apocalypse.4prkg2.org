  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

**** His Pre-Hogwarts training and independents definitely helped, but I think it was more the idea of him having the role he has. I personally like him having a sorta powerful role. If you have any where he just tears everyone to shreds with words, I would definitely like to read it.

***** I think you'll definitely like linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) and trilogy (don't worry about the fact that it's a Dresden crossover, there's absolutely no prior knowledge required). There's a few hundred thousand words worth of /really/ gold reading material.
