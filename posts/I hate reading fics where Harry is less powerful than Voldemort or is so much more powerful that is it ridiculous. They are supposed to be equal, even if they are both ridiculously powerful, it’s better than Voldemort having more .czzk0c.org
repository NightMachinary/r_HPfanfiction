#+TITLE: I hate reading fics where Harry is less powerful than Voldemort or is so much more powerful that is it ridiculous. They are supposed to be equal, even if they are both ridiculously powerful, it’s better than Voldemort having more power or Harry having too much that it’s no longer realistic.

** “Being equal” has lots of different meanings, and it absolutely doesn't have to mean they are equal in destructive combat abilities!

In fact, the Prophecy itself is a con. It's at best self fulfilling. This one only gets set in motion because Voldemort chose to act on it and marked Harry in the process.

What you are basically saying is that you also hate reading canon Books, in which Harry is SIGNIFICANTLY weaker than Voldemort in a straight fight. Canon Harry is actually so weak, that he needs the 4 most powerful literary weapons, the Deus Ex Machina, the Author Fiat, the Plot Armor, and the Lucky Hero trope, to win a quite Pyrrhic victory.

*** The thing about the prophecy is that is literally how every prophecy ends up playing out in stories/history/mythology. The act of giving the prophecy causes a ripple that creates the events necessary for it to occur. Herodotus records events like the soothsayer's prophecy to Croesus 2500+ years ago that ended up causing the thing the king was worried about anyway. The caveat to this is that anytime prophecies are ignored or cursed (see Cassandra for instance), they are always doomed to happen /because/ they didn't listen.

The odd question out is why? The existence of prophecy implies, in whatever context, someone is manipulating events to create a certain outcome that is desirable. In Greek Myth, this was the gods acting through intermediaries like the Delphic oracles. But in Harry Potter, who is trying to manipulate events there? And why?

**** Ever since humanities gained consciousness (sentience or self awareness), we have been asking about the future. It's our basic instinctive fear of future uncertainties that gave rise to the prophecy industry.

The literary world is especially infatuated with prophecies. We are now in 21st century, and every sci-fi or fantasy flick has a prophecy. It doesn't matter whether it's in a Galaxy Far Far Away, in Middle Earth, in the cyberpunk Matrix simulation, or in some other lost realms of nowhere. Don't people get tired of it?

At least in HBP, JKR made Dumbledore say that prophecies are at best self fulfilling.

I really want to read fics that completely and totally shit on prophecies.

**** Yes, very similar to Tom Riddle in abilities and outward behaviors, but made a fundamentally different choice.

I would even let the Horcrux merge with him at certain stage, so he does get a power/skill boost, not to Voldemort Prime's level, but much stronger than he was in canon. Then, I would also let Ginny absorb Diary's power, and together they overthrow Voldemort Prime and clean up Magical Britain real good.

Being defeated by your own Horcruxes is the ultimate irony.

** Harry being able to match Voldemort feels like an asspull to me since it makes no sense that a 14/16 or 17-year-old boy with no proper combat training would be able to stand against the worst serial killer in the magical world, who is also on top of the skill pyramid (with Dumbledore and presumably Grindelwald).

Even the prophecy mentions a power Voldemort does not know, which canonically is love as in "the love to lay down your life for another" (which then starts some ex-Machina logic chain). Obviously, there are different possible interpretations, with anything from memory wiping to a sniper bullet from 400 yards or stabbing while asleep fitting "the power he knows not", but given that Voldemort seems to be all brute force, that is not something Voldemort would not know.

*** I actually like the ending as an adult, although I do feel the whole moral dilemma Harry has about killing in book 7 should have been dropped.

Harry should be at best an equal to school age Tom Riddle with different choices. Any further makes any side character a miniscule threat.

I also prefer stories with a competent Voldemort. Someone who is so powerful, an Elder Wand wielding Dumbledore can hope for a stalemate at best.

**** As an adult, that ending sucks. I freely acknowledge that sometimes, people have to die so that others might live. But not in the way Harry walked to his death.

Have him go down Leonidas style, fighting an impossible battle against overwhelming odds, or use the stealthy approach. He walks past several Death Eaters whom he could have killed from under his cloak to the even the odds. Or have him and a few others fight Voldemort in a delaying action like the Finnish did against the Soviets in 39 and die during that. Between Hagrid and Lupin, they ought to have the superior knowledge of the terrain.

*** In terms of raw power, whatever that means in the Harry Potter setting, they should be roughly equal pound for pound. Remember Harry clearing a field of Dementors in third year and keeping the Priori Incantatem up against Voldemort in the fourth year.

In terms of skill, knowledge and plain all-around deadliness it should definitely shift far into voldemort's favour.

**** Raw power means nothing. Even if you would equalise them, Harry cannot utilise that power because he lacks the decades of experience. Voldemort has been a menace before Harry's parents were born.

Kinda like the difference between a 200 W laser and an old 200 W light bulb. One will permanently fuck you up, the other is pleasantly warm and bright. Or a purpose built hybrid racecar with 1500 kW and someone who squeezed the same amount of power out of a Honda Civic. The power might be equal on paper, but only one of those can actually utilise it.

***** You're not saying anything I disagree with. All I mean is that if Harry (or the plot) manages to corral Voldemort into a confrontation where only raw power matters (like the Priori Incantatem in GoF) then it wouldn't be unrealistic for Harry to be able to match him. A (normal) duel is obviously not that confontation.

** But in canon, Harry is weaker than Voldemort.

The prophecy is quite specific on these points:

- Harry has some 'power' that Voldemort doesn't understand

- Harry has the power to defeat Voldemort. (Not necessarily the same as the first power.)

- Voldemort shall 'mark' him as his equal.

This does *not* imply that:

- Harry has to be equal to Voldemort in skill

- Harry has to be powerful

- Harry has to be Voldemort's equal in any way at all really. Voldemort targeting him as a baby is sufficient.

*** True.

But we shanghaied the thread to talk about how powerful to make Harry in a fic.

Canon is great. Easily my favorite book series. But Harry was a lazy, overly idealistic bastard in an attempt to keep the later books kid friendly with adult themes.

I personally think prophecies are all about interpretation. You can interpret it any way, but I think the best fanfiction treat Harry as a mirror of Tom Riddle.

** What most people muck up IMO, is the difference between skill and power. Voldemort has about 40 years of knowledge more than Harry. Which means he should be loads more skillful. Where people go wrong in making a strong Harry is not power, but how he acquires the skill to wield it. Because canon Harry is strong, a patronus as a third year when he is already exhausted. Or the battle for power between Voldemort and Harry when their wands connect. What most fics does is that he suddenly can do magic three years beyond his skill. Like a fourth year that start conjuring. We see that Harry is a prodigy in Defense and that is the explanation behind the patronus. But a lot of fics makes him a master wizard without even trying.

*** Wind Shear linkffn(Wind Shear) I think does this really well. It has 21 year old Harry as a combat match for Voldemort. But, Harry mostly uses simple spells in innovative ways his opponents aren't prepared for. The first fight shown has Harry wipe the floor with proto-Death Eaters using a bottle of whiskey, an Incendio, banishing and summoning charms and an animation charm. Only the animation charm is something a 5th year Harry wouldn't have access to. And he's even shown practicing it later, stating he has trouble with animating water.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
