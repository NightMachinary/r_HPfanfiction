#+begin_quote
  Harry's 5th year was probably the worst year of his life. First Voldemort happened, then Umbridge, then Voldemort AGAIN, and then Sirius died. Harry doesn't even have the time to properly mourn Sirius before he's shipped back to the Dursley's for the summer. He can't even think straight and with each passing day since losing Sirius, Harry feels more and more exhausted. By the time his 16th birthday rolls around, Uncle Vernon has to literally beat Harry just to wake him up. After a rather brutal beating given to him by his uncle on the eve of his birthday, Harry wakes to find something he had never thought possible. He wakes up to find a long snake tail instead of his legs. A few days later, his family abandons him in some random forest. What a wonderful way to start his 16th year of life after the worst year of his life.

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.

  "What did I do," James whispered, glancing at Remus. "I don't know Prongs, but my best guess is that you somehow pulled your younger self forward in time." Canon Harry finds himself in another universe. Everyone seems sympathetic and willing to help him go back, but no one quite expected how shocking and charming one Harry Potter can be - and shock them he did. No bashing!

  It took one look for Hermione to know the truth. Harry wasn't ready to become an auror. He would do so because people expected it of him; he would do so because he expected it of himself, but it wasn't what he needed right now. With that in mind, she gave him an excuse, a reason not to go down that path just yet. More importantly, she promised herself to continue doing so until he was finally ready.
