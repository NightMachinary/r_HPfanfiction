:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So basically in the fic harry just wants to be a normal kid so he never plays hero. Like instead of going down the trap down, Ron and hermione now go alone. And ginny dies cause harry never finds the chamber of secrets he just minds his own business. I think he gets blamed for her death idk. But harry is just a normal kid so all the events from the books play out like harry was never there at all. Any help is appreciated. Thanks


** Not the exact story your looking but fits the idea of Harry not wanting to be a hero and I really liked it so far.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore expected a weak Harry who lived with the Dursley's. He was not expecting a Harry who grew up on the streets and has no interest in playing a hero. After being abandoned in America by the Dursley's Harry learnt to survive using his brains and magic. Dumbledore, Hermione and select Weasley bashing. Dark/grey Harry.
