Hey guys. I always have had a headcanon that certain (muggleborn/muggle raised) characters might bring their love of muggle music to Hogwarts and share it with their peers. Are there stories that any of you know of that include muggle music culture from the 90's (or if the characters are older, from the early 2000's)?? I AM a hopeless romantic so I like romance stories (any parings are fine), but any story that might include music in general is appreciated. I just would like connections to muggle music of the times set in place. Thank you in advance!

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

***** I'm glad you're enjoying it! Iirc the interesting music / magic is used by Harry, so it probably appears more in the second and third instalment - it's very fun, though. You're very welcome, I hope you continue to enjoy!

*** Classical music is great, too! So far I love all the cross references between the wizard world and muggle world. I love when the two crash or interact with one another in realistic ways.

** linkffn(3912184;4236594) have very strong presence of music in the Harry's timeline.

And then there is this next-gen linkao3(373224), where the main hero ends up as a professional musician.

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

** Fluorescentgrey on AO3 is super into music (specifically 70s/80/90s punk and alt rock.) All of her stories weave music into the magical world seamlessly, including both Muggle and wizarding bands. Her story "A Handful of Dust" is about the wizarding band fronted by Stubby Boardman, and it's one of the most intricate pieces of magical worldbuilding I've seen.
