1. Dumbledore is a manipulative bastard bent on world domination, and he manipulates everyone. Grindelwald realized what was going to happen, but Dumbledore managed to grow a big enough pair of balls and booped the first potential threat. Voldemort, around the same time, through being trained by Grindelwald, learns about Dumbledore's evil intentions. He promises Gellert just days before his imprisonment that he'll finish what his mentor started.

2. Grindelwald and Voldemort are good guys, who Dumbledore and Company are slandering. Harry realizes this, preferably before Hogwarts, or during his first year.

3. Grindelwald and Voldemort started out doing stuff peacefully, but were forced to take up arms when the lazyasses in charge realized they were threats to the status quo.

4. Grindelwald and his followers are broken out of prison (preferably by Harry or Voldemort) and take over Europe again, and then they go and help the Death Eaters.

5. Ties in with #1. Dumbledore wants to be the immortal (through Flamel's Elixir of Life) beacon of light in the world by creating an authoritarian regime. Everyone is enslaved to the will of Dumbledore and his followers.

6. Death Eaters, such as Lucius, Bellatrix, and the Lestrange brothers were good guys who were Imperiused to join the Death Eaters before they could join the Light. Dumbledore in this world is actually half competent too.

7. Grindelwald breaks out of Nurmengard, and he and his followers help rid the world of Dark forces. (ex - by helping Harry and Co in fighting Voldemort)

Share your crazy story ideas, and conspiracy theories!


** The wizarding world can't get rid of dementors, just corral them with enough bait, so Azkaban is firstly a feeding ground for dementors and only secondly a jail. The wizarding world uses any lawbreakers they can find to occupy Azkaban and appease the dementors. This naturally creates problems when Hermione decides rehabilitation of minor offenders is more beneficial to society than soul sucking punishment and wizards who don't want dementors to be tempted off the island to find food violently react at the thought of decreasing the number of Azkaban prisoners.

Alternately, too many number of long term Azkaban prisoners were killed off by the second war and the ministry starts over policing the population and punishing small misdemeanors with Azkaban sentences to try and make up the shortfall of dementor prey.

** While not an in-HP-universe conspiracy, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5umihv/i_applaud_the_mods_for_not_taking_this_comment/ddv95h3/][I believe]] there is more to meet the eye when it comes to [[/u/Starfox5]] and [[/u/Taure]].

*** Everything the Quibbler says is true, and they employ thinly veiled noun-to-noun ciphers, and most wizards are too... lacking in common sense to notice.

** I like the imperiused death eater theory, especially because everyone in canon seems to regard it as bullshit but it would be funny if it were true.

I do have a soft spot for Dumbledore being a time travelling Ron, and would love to read a well written epic about it.

Sirius really did have an alter ego called Stubby Boardman and was part of a band.

Any where Albus and Aberforth switch places for any reason.

** A conpiracy? Let's see...

At the top of everything, you find Arthur Wesley and Xenophilius Lovegood, They were lovers in their school days and decided to take over the world. The cunning plan is as follow.

They've decided to make themselves made-up personas in order to avoid attracting attention. They both took wives and made a family, to which they lie through their teeth.\\
Arthur decides to appear as a simple man, honest and incorruptible, with a fascination for the muggle world. Xenophiius chooses the persona of a crazy but inoffensive man. He creates the Quibbler as an easy mean to discretely keep contact with the other members of the conspiracy.

One day Xenophilius' wife discovers the truth. Xenophilius manages to stage her death as an accident but didn't account for Luna to have been present. Fortunately for him, the event is so shocking that Luna forgets the real reason behind her mother's death and becomes obsessed with the phony creatures described in the Quibbler.

They hold both Dumbledore and Voldemort through blackmail (anonymously) since they've got proofs Voldemort's true identity and lineage and what really happened between Dumbledore and Grindlewald. They've managed to put their best people at key positions of the ministry (Croacker at the head of the department of mysteries and Amelia Bones at the head of the DMLE). They intend to stage an insurgency through Voldemort and use it as a distraction and a mean to weaken the ministry before making their moves.\\
Once it becomes clear that the young Harry Potter has been prophesied to kill the Dark Lord, they realize that it's the perfect opportunity. They decide to make Harry a national hero and a martyr, using Dumbledore and Sirius (in fact the former Rock Star Stubby Boardman, the real Sirius having been killed long ago, as he found out the truth while confronting Peter Pettigrew, one of the conspirators and former friend of Sirius, after the Potter massacre), to groom him to die at the hand of Voldemort.\\
Before that Arthur and his family will have become close enough to Harry to use his name and legend to make Arthur popular enough to make him the new minister of magic.

They send Voldemort to Amelia Bones when it becomes clear that she has grown to have moral issues with the plan and intends to reveal the whole plot to the public.

So, how do you like that conspiracy?

** Percy is a spy for Dumbledore in the Ministry. In order to not be suspected he crafted a persona of a young ambitious pure blood that wants to distance himself from his blood traitor family.
