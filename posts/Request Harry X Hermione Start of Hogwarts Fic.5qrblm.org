** I think you're fighting uphill on this one just because the scenario suggests 'true love bringing them together' early on, with a strong possibility of Weasley bashing and Hermione-sue on the forecast. This is not a recipe for great fics, at least as judged by the locals.

That said, you might want to check out linkffn(Harry McGonagall by witowsmp). If that suits you, there should be a mass of Harmony writers in the favorites of that author for you to explore.

** There's linkffn(9873249) but it contains Weasley bashing.

Also in linkffn(The Reclamation of Black Magic) they meet on the train and it's going to be H/HR. One of my favorite fics atm

  This story came from the thought that the Weasley introduction was a setup. This is NOT a time-travel story. The premise is that the Dursleys got him there very early and Hermione, being the perfectionist that she is, also arrived very early. Thus they meet and the glory of H/Hr begins. AU For now not a T rating, will probably change in later chapters.
