So, I'm looking for fics where Harry and Dumbledore have a friendly or familial relationship (eg. "Grandpa Albus"). Think Ingenio ab Artifex for a general idea of the dynamic I'm looking for. Thanks alehhhhhandro for putting me onto this. :)

** I haven't read the fic in your post, so I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but this fic has a friendly relationship between Harry and Dumbledore:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13388022/9/Albus-and-Harry-s-World-Trip]])

Basically, after CoS, Harry is expelled and Dumbledore didn't get back his post as Headmaster. So Dumbledore becomes Harry's private tutor and they go out and see the world and learn some magic. Their relationship is hilarious, Dumbledore is very socratic and wants Harry to figure things out on his own. Plus a bunch of other fun stuff, like Dumbledore owning a bowling alley called Lord Bowl-Some-More. Highly recommended!

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

*** I haven't read that fic either, so I can't really say yet. The first chapter is interesting enough, but it's not terribly clear yet whether the relationship is 'authority-friendly' or they're actually friends. Either way, thanks for the rec! Looks like a good fic, request-meeting or not.

**** You're welcome! I think they start out as "authority-friendly" and evolve to "friendly" over time. Harry's still just 13 as of the latest chapter, so it makes sense that he'd still somewhat consider Dumbledore as an authority figure, even as they're becoming friends. There's a chapter where Harry pranks Dumbledore (in the process of learning wandless magic) in revenge for Dumbledore pranking him, and it's hilarious.

#+begin_quote
  As part of his practice, he worked with water balloons. Specifically lifting a dozen water balloons up to the top of the canopy that was directly above where Albus slept at night.

  In his mind's eye, Harry hit the button to remove the nets holding back the bowling balls. The levitation spells cancelled simultaneously.

  A loud splash and sputtering old man's shout of surprise replaced the quiet of the night.

  Harry filed away the memory in a special place in his mind, and then fell asleep with a content smile.

  Canon Divergence AU  Dumbledore raises Harry from the age of four after the Dursleys are found to be unfit guardians. They live in relative isolation, away from the pressures and dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together in the role of headmaster and student.Nothing has changed except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they mean to each other. And that changes everything.
