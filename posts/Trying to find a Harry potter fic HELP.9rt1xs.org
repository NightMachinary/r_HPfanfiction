** This might be the same one I was thinking of recently and couldn't remember the title of either. If it is, the additional details that I remember are that everyone in that afterlife was killed by Voldemort/the killing curse. It was set on a a mountain or in the wilderness, and the different dead people had little houses and were always on guard for Voldemort/beasts or something like that. Cedric had a cottage.Sound familiar?

**** Sorry, I totally forgot about this. A few days after I posted, I found it! It's called /Cheating Death/ linkffn(567233). Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as I remembered, but the closure was nice! Merry Christmas :)
