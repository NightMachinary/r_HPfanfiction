As in, magic doesn't acknowledge his existence and simply has no effect on him whatsoever, nor he have any effect on it.

I assume, were this the case, the only way he'd end up in Hogwarts is if Dumbledore forged a letter or something.


** So cursed objects won't affect him but neither would things like portkeys or wards. Hey, he could just waltz through wards without a problem and could break open magical locks with a crowbar. But potions and healing spells wont work on him neither so he would have to heal the muggle way. So would the cloak of invisibility work and what about magic based poisons? What about brooms?

*** I would say the cloak would absolutely work. The cloak doesn't make you invisible, it's an invisible cloak.

I would also think portkeys and brooms could effect him, as long as someone else activates the portkey or is flying the broom.

For instance magic wouldn't effect him but you could still use magic to drop something heavy on him and he would die.

**** The cloak seems to only activate when worn, as seem when Harry gets it. It's described as "silver fabric, almost liquid", so it's definitely visible when not worn. I'd say the cloak acts as though it isn't being worn and simply stays in its visible form even when draped over him.

The portkey and broom thing I concur, as well as if another person were under the cloak with him. Objects like this would most likely treat him as a mundane object and therefore ignore him.

I'd be interested if Portraits could see him, or if ghosts acknowledged him. Magical creatures in general, like Dementors and Thestrals would be interesting, as they can only be seen with magic, would his magic void cause the magic hiding them to break?

***** If he can't use a broom.....could he even use a wand??

I mean, it's not the broom's/wand's magic affecting him, but the other way around, right?

And it's not that magical creatures can be seen "with magic", it's that they're seen "by wizards". Though if magic can't affect him, would he even be a wizard? That squib neighbor of his couldn't see dementors, but she was affected by them..... Maybe Harry would be the other way around.

****** Hm. Let's try to build a point scale, shall we?

from -2 to 2, whole numbers.

I'd say that 0 is muggle, baseline human, no magical properties whatsoever.

then it would likely go like this:

2: Full Wizard. Ability to percieve and alter magic and magical things.

1: Squib. Ability to percieve, but not alter magic and magical things.

0: Muggle. Neither magic perception nor manipulation.

-1: This would be our Harry. Magic does not percieve him either.

-2: this would be the hypothetical "magic void" or "magic disruptor". actively destroys and/or breaks magic in their surroundings.

It really depends on if he is -1 or -2, and how reconcileable magic finds him. For instance, a -1 harry would basically be a muggle, but magic would additionally be a dick to him. A -2 Harry would be a magical void, he'd absorb or transcend any magic cast on him.

Since they don't acknowledge his existence, he can't even interact with them. As in, he can't even pick them up, because he passes right through them.

Well, he could interact with a potion while it's in its bottle, but when he tries to drink it, it'll just drench his clothes.

**** I think a broom is a mundane piece of wood that's been given all kinds of charms to make it fly. The question is, does the broom (a) simply fly and not care who or what is sitting on it ir does it (b) need the rider's magic to make it work. I think canon leans towards b because in the first flying lesson, we see them having to issue a command to their broom.

But either way, he could still sweep the floor with one.

***** Well, the rider definitely commands it with magic. Its debatable if it has some sort of primitive mind you need to intimidate or prove yourself to, but the fact is that the first lesson is in wandless broom command and that means something.

However, a broom also doesn't fly on its own - it needs a rider, even if the magic is in it instead of them. So if Void!Harry tried to ride a broom, it would act as though nothing was on it.

** I've written a little scene for this:

Albus looked at the... boy before him, slightly blurry as he was, with an intense sort of gaze. When his letter hadn't been created by the Quill of Admission, he had feared the worst, and immediately travelled to Surrey to check on the boy, and if necessary, take vengeance if he was too late.

However, this wasn't the case. Harry wasn't dead, or starved, or anything really - he was a normal boy, if rather hard to look at.

Not ugly, trying to look at him felt like looking through a drop of water on his eyeglasses, blurry and warped. It made Albus' eyes hurt.

"Now Harry, have strange things happened around you? Perhaps you made a toy come toward you when you really wanted to, as a child?" Albus tried, once again, to coax something, /anything/ magical out of the boy, to no avail.

By all appearances, he was a muggle, yet how could that be? He remembered the night vividly, having relived it in his nightmares many a time, of Lily and James' deaths. Hagrid had taken the boy from the burning ruins, and delivered him to Hogwarts, crying all the while.

And once there, the boy had emanated /Power/. By all accounts, he should have been an extremely able wizard, easily on his own level once trained, but there was... nothing. Or perhaps, even less than nothing.

/Now that's a thought./

** Has been done. The name of the story was "Gingerbread house" or something similar, it was a crossover with the Percy Jackson universe and it is about Draco and Harry being stuck in a Gingerbread house that is a magical maze. During this they find out Harry is a "magi-null", magic does not work on him.

Sadly I cannot find it on ffnet although I am sure I read it there.
