:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
From what I remember, this was on FF dot net. Ron was secretly an Auror and was trying to go undercover to the group of fanatics Percy had been leading. In order to do so, however, he had to make his family and friends believe he had gone dark.

He falls in love with Draco along the way & the only person who knows the truth is Remus.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, even if it was to inform me this was removed/deleted long ago.

Happy reading!


** read the title a little too quick and thought it said that ron was gay lmao
