when harry or whoever else goes back in time, it makes a DBZ negative ripple thing happen, like with trunks and the androids? where the androids were stronger, there were more of them, and then later cell showed up. just this huge shitty luck time travel ripple just cause they went back in time? it'd be cool if harry did that, like he goes back, and then just cause he did it makes voldemort stronger, or have more horcruxes, or breaks out his azkaban crew way earlier, or even maybe some new dark witch or wizard shows up to rival or take out voldemort and do their own thing? just want to see something where the time traveler doesn't exactly have a positive effect on the past. :D
