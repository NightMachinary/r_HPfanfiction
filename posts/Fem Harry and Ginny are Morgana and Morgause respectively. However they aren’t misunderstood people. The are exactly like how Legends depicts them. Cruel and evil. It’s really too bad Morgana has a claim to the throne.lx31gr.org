So we have 2 genuinely evil women who are aiming for world domination. They are both cunning and wait until after Hogwarts for to bring the final part of plan in play but somewhere along the line Voldemort gets resurrected. So now we have Voldemort and his death eaters trying to make their big return, a reincarnated Dark Lady and her equally evil half sister aiming for world domination. Lets see how this plays out.

------------

Ron always knew his sister was different. She was more mature and all of the Weasley boys were scared of her. She had a bit of sadistic nature.

When he got to Hogwarts he met Morgan Potter. She was cold and reminded him of Ginny. He remembered the shock everyone had felt when she was sorted into Slytherin instead of Gryffindor. She interacted with mostly no one except for perhaps the person next to her. She didn't really seem to have /friends/.

When Ginny came to Hogwarts he was only mildly surprised when she was also sorted into Slytherin. What he was shocked about was how she was almost always with Morgan Potter. Like they acted more like siblings than she did with any of the Weasley boys. They seemed to have a particular group that followed them though.

After graduating Ginny and Morgan both disappeared. They were all worried sick about her. When he found out the truth he wasn't sure this was better or worse than them being dead. A few months after they disappeared there was an attack in Godric's Hollow. It brought morale down because it was not a death eater attack. They were already dealing with the 2nd war with You-Know-Who and now there is now another terrorist.

That wasn't the worst part. It was the note.

/You should have seen this coming. Although the fact you didn't is not surprising. Dumbledore's way is not working. Neither is Voldemort's. Why you follow either of them is questionable. They're powerful but nothing compared to us. We hope you will soon see that we are the right way./

/M.P & G.W/

Ron could only stare at those initials in horror. He quickly put that thought away but he knew deep down this was the the girl who lived and his little sisters work.

---------- So there we go. I typed that all on an IPad and my hands are sore. If anyone wants to write a full story on it. Go ahead. Just uhh credit me. I'm good at coming with ideas but full blown fanfics I cannot write.


** Eh, the pure evil thing's a bit too unrealistic considering Morgana and Morgause both had a solid claim to the throne. Maybe in comparison to Arthur they just looked evil, but were otherwise behaved in pretty standard ways for British nobility in the middle ages-as in, discriminating against the lower classes whilst engaging in power plays at court and around the Kingdom(s) they were a part of. Even their purportedly evil behaviour in the legends are rarely ever more than an elaborate attempt to get control over the throne with magic added into the mix.

So while they may seem and act evil to outsiders, I see their relationship going something like this:

The door slammed open, letting a girl with red hair stride into the room in what many of her brother's knights would have recognised as an annoyed aristocratic huff that commonly afflicted the Pendragon line. "Starting a civil war again, are we?" She said with as much petulance as the girl could muster.

The target of her anger groaned in pain. "Can't have. You're not pregnant yet."

"It's your turn this time, you idiot. Or did you forget?" The redhead pointed out, dramatically slouching over the couch. "Can't wait, honestly. Let's see how you deal with lactation and stretch marks. I bet it'll be a hoot. Now spill. Why in the Lady's name did you engage in /direct combat/ with minions of all things?"

"I was /trying/ to bomb the Ministry and blame the Death Eaters for it. I didn't expect them to be meeting right where I was planting the damn thing!" The Heroine of the Wizarding World grumbled. "Hermione is going to give me so much shit over this."

"Well, she should. A month's worth of potions brewing, a hundred galleons in ingredients and enough theoretical metaphysics books to give Granger a doctorate and what do you know? The hyper-compression bomb is now in the hands of the Unspeakables!" Ginevra laughed. "She'll murder you when she finds out what it was really for, you know."

"She'll murder me when I fail to bring back any performance data, more like. Besides, if she murders me, her 'grant money's disappears. She wouldn't dare." The girl with messy black hair said as she stood up. "Damn, the Sleekeazy wore off again. Got any?"

Ginny looked at Harriet with a condescendingly raised eyebrow. "Do I look like I have money to you? I have it all to the twins to fund their little contraband operation, remember? The one you called a 'prime investment opportunity?'"

"Fuck. Anyway, I've got great news!"

"Yes?"

"Bellatrix is pregnant! And it's a Riddle! Had to sneak a little diagnostic spell into the chain, shame about Black but whatever. She's expecting, which means-"

"Ooh! Ooh! Child abduction!" Ginny said enthusiastically, any petulance cast to the wayside. "Works every time!"

"Um, no. No child abduction, because it won't work. Voldemort is simply too powerful. No, I was more thinking about a bloodline curs-"

"Not again!" Ginny wailed. "My little Mordrey-poo, Mama's sorry!" She whispered, breaking down in tears.

"Ugh." Harry grunted. She never could stand her sister crying. Her one weakness- apart from bonfires and witch hunters. It was depressing that Camlann had marked the high point of her political career. "Fine. We can act like uncultured peasantry and just kill this pretender in direct combat. Happy now?"

"Wait, isn't he immortal? Something about his soul, you said."

"Pfft!" Harry scoffed. "He's good, but he's not Merlin with the philosopher's stone and four apprentices good. I just lightly beat and torture him half to death and merge his essence with a piece of obsidian. Job done!"

"Oh goody!" Ginny exclaimed. "But what about his minions?"

"Well, you did say you were looking for some volunteers for your experiments, right?"

"Well yes, but they have to be willing though."

Harry shrugged. "Just brainwash them, I don't know. As long as they're out of my way when I condemn their master to eternal torture and aren't alive or aware enough to talk to the press then I really don't care what you do with the low-born scum infesting my future realm."

"OUR future realm."

"Oh come on! I promised you London, Paris and Rome, what more do you want woman?"
