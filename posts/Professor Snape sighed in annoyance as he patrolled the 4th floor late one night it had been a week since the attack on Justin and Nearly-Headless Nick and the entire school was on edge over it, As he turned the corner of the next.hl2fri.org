He felt the sparks of genuine fear as he took in the scene before him. There not to far from him, with his glass's askew, his bright piercing blue eye's no longer holding the customary twinkle now only holding genuine surprise headmaster Albus Dumbledore lay petrified on the ground. Trying to get his emotion's under control he pulled his wand out and levitated the headmaster's body gently into the air and slowly made his way to the infirmary. With Albus now also petrified Snape knew full well Hogwarts day's were now numbered and the school may very well close, as he got closer to the infirmary he steeled his emotion's trying to keep himself level headed knowing the likely reaction's from the rest of the teaching staff and the school body, he knew it would be a long night and a long tomorrow for the school as it faced a very uncertain future..


** Maybe have the Basilisks petrify most or all the teachers and have the remaining teachers and staff try to hide it from the ministry so that Hogwarts don't close. Or make it from Albus perspective with him waking up to the aftermath of him being petrified, Snape being sent to jail so that the Ministry is seen doing something (ex-death eater would be a easier target than a 12 years-old national celebrity, paseltonge or not), his students being moved to other schools, Ginny dying and TMR resurrecting... basically an all around fuck feast.

** Maybe they hide Albus's body and Snape use a Time Turner and Polyjuice to take over his place while he is petrified.

*** How long can bitter, sarcastic Serverus Snape impersonate Albus Dumbledore?

On one hand: He must be good in pretending, play-acting. It kind of is an important quality for a spy.

On the other hand: The two men are so very, very different.

** I'd reckon things'd turn out more or less the same, really. After all, Harry and co. did mostly everything in most of the books. As I recall, Dumbledore mentioned it wasn't specifically him who sent Harry the sorting hat and fawkes. So, even without Dumbledore, things might turn out the same. But then again, Tom may get bolder and go on a petri-fest.

** Snape is naturally the suspect and is put on trial. Dumbledore is horrified when he is unpetrified and finds Snape in azkaban. 3/4 quarters of hogwarts have an amazing year and actually learned how to brew potions (basilisk plushies were sold as mascots for great profit)

*** Alternatively, half the student population is dead. Broken 'statues' litter the halls when a team of specialists is finally sent in. They find the remaining students and harried teachers barricaded in the medical wing, all doors and pipes sealed with the strongest spells they know, and they've recovered every intact statue they could.

They exchange intelligence for a bit - the outside team relay the situation in the castle, which paths are still viable and where signs of the monster's passage were detected, and the insiders relay information on the monster's tactics, its characteristics and possible guiding hand.

The moment they hear it speaks Parseltongue they narrow it down to a few possibilities, and the notion of pipes and the tracks left in the castle leave one single possibility: giant snake. There exist very few giant snakes, so they take precautions against all of them, including the Basilisk.

A rooster is conjured/flooed in, and enchanted to crow on command. All members of the expeditionary team cast a supersensory on themselves and keep their heads down to avoid any gazes, weapons of iron and silver are conjured, armor of dragonhide is donned.

They set a trap - a decoy, enchanted via spell and potion to resemble a living being, specifically one of the students wandering the halls. The monster takes the bait and is lured into an enclosed space, trapped once it realizes the decoy was a fake. Walls and passages are collapsed. Someone casts the loudness charm on the rooster and triggers its call, and a good bit of Fiendfyre is cast into the space. Once it burns out, they come in and stab it with all the weaponry they have, then scoop the remains into an expanded trunk and bring it to the ministry, where it is thrown through the Veil.

Ginny is never recovered, and the Diary vanishes from the world. With two Voldemorts, one much more ruthless and cruel than the other, many of the snake-like dark lord's forces abandon him in favor of his younger self, and there is a great amount of infighting. Many Death Eaters are killed, including several prominent ones.

** mm... if it goes to that, go get albus's stash of hair, either him or minerva use the pensieve to use dumbledore's memory for the last few days while snape keep making the polyjuice potion. For situation where both of them and dumbledore need to be in the same time, having time turner doesn't hurt.

That still doesn't solve the slytherin monster though.
