So, I saw this on a mapmaking subreddit and I had a few questions.

LINK - [[https://twitter.com/TerribleMaps/status/1234558864575602688]]

Firstly, is this accurate to HP canon? I vaguely recall something about there being eleven schools, but did Rowling actually set areas for them all like this?

And second question, why would Italy, Greece, Armenia, Afghanistan, Crete, Cyprus, Malta, Sardinia, and the Koreas not have magicals or a magic school/links to one of the eleven schools?

Thirdly, given the 'good wands', 'magic place', 'wizard castle' level names of the schools, what do we think the unnamed ones (Nine, Ten, and Eleven) might be called?


** The names are canon-accurate. The "catchment areas" are not, except for Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Ilvermorny. The catchment areas of the others are unknown.

Per JKR, canonically there are 11 permanent magical schools, with the majority of the global wizarding population being either home schooled, schooled in their local community, or attending transient schools. There may also be a system of apprenticeship.

You can easily imagine how these transient schools might appear or disappear: someone home-schools their own child, then teaches a friend's child as a favour, then word spreads and more families send their children to this teacher. Over time they may gather around them other teachers and relocate to a school building rather than using their own home.

But then something occurs to disrupt the school's operations. Maybe the originator retires or dies. Maybe there's no more magical kids in the local area to school, because the wizarding population in most regions of the world will be too sparse to support a continuously operating school. Perhaps there's a scandal or a magical accident. Whatever happens, the school lacks the institutional momentum to survive the disruption, going into decline and finally dissolving rather than becoming a permanent institution.

It's similar to how small businesses come and go in the real world. Even very successful small businesses often fail to survive the loss of a key individual or a change in their market.

In general, I am quite a big fan of this approach to magical schooling in canon. It reflects the historical educational norm, before universal education became a thing in the late 1800s. It means that each school can have a significant mythology attached to it which makes it feel special, something that you couldn't do if there were hundreds of magical schools. It means that the 11 schools become like the Oxbridge of the wizarding world - not the only way of learning about magic, but in a separate tier to everyone else.

The last one also has the benefit of creating a significant level of magical inequality between wizards from the great schools and those who were schooled more informally, where most wizards would possess quite specialised knowledge, and it would only be those who attended the great schools who had access to the full range of e.g. Charms, Transfiguration, Potions.

Another benefit to all this is that it means that Britain is an international outlier in terms of the percentage of its magical population which receives a formal magical education. This in turn nicely fits into why Britain seems to have an outsized influence on the magical world, from the fact that Dumbledore and Voldemort were both British, to the way that the timing of global international events seems to coincide with significant moments in British history (such as the Statute of Secrecy coinciding with the British Bill of Rights).

However, I do feel that 11 schools is slightly too low. In Victoria Potter I have changed the number of permanent schools from 11 to 13. I felt this was necessary to cover the major regions of the world as well as locations which I felt had sufficient mythology to deserve a magic school.

Here are my ideas:

- Brazil - Castelobruxo - Amazon Rainforest

- China - Xifang Xuexiao ("School of the West") - Jade Mountain (Chinese/Tibetan Himalayas)

- Egypt - Wadi Al Mujawis ("Valley of the Magi") - Theban Necropolis

- France - Beauxbatons - Pyrennes

- Great Britain - Hogwarts Castle - Scottish Highlands

- India - Suvaloka - Mount Meru (Indian Himalayas)

- Japan - Mahoutokoro - Minami Iwo Jima

- Persia - Alcaraz Palace - Badab-e Surt

- Peru - El Dorado - Peruvian Altiplano

- Russia - Koldovstoretz - Mount Elbrus

- Norway - Durmstrang - Svalbard

- Uganda - Uagadou - Mountains of the Moon

- USA - Ilvermorny - Mount Greylock, Massachusetts

In addition, there is a magical university (the world's only magical university) in Greece.

I like the idea that the Indian and Chinese schools have an intense rivalry, a result not only of their close geographical proximity, but also because they have overlapping and contradictory founding myths (Jade Mountain, the residence of the Queen Mother of the West, is supposed to be part of the mythical Kunlun Mountains, the Chinese version of Mount Meru).

For all of these schools I have followed the canon convention of magical schools being located in the middle of nowhere, far from Muggle civilisation. It also tickles me that there will be huge parts of the world where there's no magical school at all, and then two very large ones very close together in the Himalayas.

**** Not new, but it never made it in. I had planned for it to be mentioned during one of Victoria and Dumbledore's dinners - with Victoria originally expressing an interest, before she realises that magical tertiary education is a very dry, ivory tower affair which does not condescend to the lowly practice of actually /casting/ magic. But I haven't found a way to fit it in yet.

The idea is that it's not spell theory they study there, but more the philosophy of magic - questions such as whether the existence of magic implies the existence of a god, or whether the universe is anthropocentric, the metaphysics of identity in a world where you can duplicate things, the implications of time travel for the nature of causation, the moral implications of certain spells - that sort of stuff.

*** I mean, pretty much my entire reaction to the first part of your comment before the bullet points is just "Makes sense, you're probably right in that.". I'm with you on liking that 'transient school' method as well and its historical appropriateness. It's also a good way of adding to JK's... underdeveloped canon world and developed canon plot 'implications' (Big British Names, Big World Events linking to Big British Events, etc) without taking stuff away from it like some world-redevelopment fics do. It's a very nice way of taking your Victoria Potter 'Canon+' approach. Kudos. :)

I remember seeing somewhere the idea that Durmstrang was founded by the Scandinavians as a kind of middle-finger to the Russians (the Swedish empire popped up a little while before the Statute, and they fought with the Russians over Finland A LOT at the time). I quite liked that idea, founding a new school out of spite. :D

Also, I sent this to a friend who's big into HP as well (more canon interest than I have) and she responded with the fact that those eleven schools are (apparently canonically) just the ones actually registered with the ICW (most don't, either not being big enough to get a registry or not wanting ICW oversight and regulation). So, she theorised that the odd catchment areas are just because some bureaucrat in the ICW regulated it that way as they're the only official schools to cover the whole world and the locals find it just as weird but can't complain because bureaucracy in the magical world is a nightmare and all the schools are paranoid about security because they keep getting attacked by Dark Wizards. Apparently Hogwarts is an outlier in only taking British Wizards too, but she's not sure where that idea came from. :D

So, if you wanna write a school-based story in rural Algeria, but none of the eleven schools are there, you can create a transient, unofficial school that operates there without having to remove any canon anything. It's like providing options for fan-made DLC. :)

Mostly. Can't say for certain as we don't know the unnamed schools. Part of me wants to believe JKR wouldn't do that to school #10, but Durmstrang's story is convoluted in a way that it didn't have to be.

Korean placement is up in the air as #10 looks /off/ and the Japanese school has the smallest student body with 10/11 yrs of year levels. Afghans probably go to school #9.

The rest probably go to Durmstrang with a few at Beauxbatons, but JKR never tells us who attends Durmstrang and says Beauxbatons is predominantly French with "Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Luxembourgians, and Belgians attending in large numbers."

And imagine how big the Asian school would have to be. There'd have to be so few wizards there to make it work, even assuming the 'only some go to the eleven schools' thing. There's like, 3 billion people in those bits of Asia (approx - and it's still incredibly hilariously bizarre to me that Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and New Zealand are part of the same catchment area, while Myanmar goes to the Upper Asian School :D) and even if the Wizarding proportion of the whole was smaller than that of the UK, that's still at least a hundred thousand magicals across the continent. No idea what proportion of those would actually be children - I can't find much on the generational proportions in each region and I don't want to do the statistics-guesstimation I'd need to get some decent numbers - but that's still going to be a relatively large number of children and even if only the '1%' elite go, that's still a lot.

What makes no sense on that map:

- Unified Italy

- Germany in its form. Either have a HRE with Austria (and consequently larger parts of South Eastern Europe) or have a small German solution more akin to the 1871 borders (maybe without Holstein, but that's another debate altogether)

- Poland has its current borders which were redrawn by Stalin. It should be way further to the East, Silesia should either be Austrian (if the PU prevailed in the magical world), Bohemian or Brandenburg-Prussian (claim by succession dating back to 1675)

- Lithuania likewise should either be part of the PLC or independent, but spanning way further east without a Baltic coast. The Treaty of Lublin was in effect before the SoS.

- The Ukraine should not exist, divided between Russia, the PLC and maybe some tartar state

- The Baltic Duchies (Courland, Liefland) should either be independent in their historical forms or belong to Sweden and the PLC

- Finland should not be independent. To Sweden, maybe to Russia.

- The Balkans should not be independent, either Hungarian, Austrian or Ottoman. Independent Wallachia would make some sense, but using the current Romanian borders does not. Bulgaria should not exist (that's an issue in canon, which mentions Transylvania, and both nations never existed at the same time)

- Norway should belong to Denmark as a personal union

- Ireland should not exist

- Belgium should not exist, either Dutch or part of the Spanish Netherlands

And that's just from the top of my head, without looking closer at the map.

Assuming there is a rough socio-cultural/historical link binding the catchment areas, I would imagine that Australia and NZ would share a school (but a comparatively smaller one) that would not normally include the rest of the lower pacific island countries assigned to #11.

And I trust the other comments saying the number of schools is JKR endorsed (canon?), but considering the diversity of culture and history within the Asia region, I would think there would be a greater number of schools there, clustered geographically closer the way Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang are.

******** There are so many things to consider. For starters, are magical nations a perfect mirror of muggle ones? I always got the impression that that is how Rowling sees it, and, personally I fundamentally disagree with that.

And this leads to: how exactly do magical borders differ? Does the difference go beyond just politics, and there are separate ethnic groups? It's not hard to believe that Muggle migrations didn't really have the same impact in the magical world. And then you have a really complex socio-political issue with how this ethnically separate states integrate Muggleborns.

And even if this is Euro-centric, how on earth is there no great magic school in Athens? Or Egypt? And Uagadu is taking all of Africa? Wow, talk about being ignorant. Africa is the most ethnically and culturally diverse place on Earth. Unlike what Rowling may think, just because they have dark skin doesn't mean they are an identical hive mind.

Korea and Japan, the same school? Big oof. China and India? Two of the oldest, most populous, and most vibrant cultures, couldn't come up with their own schools? Sheesh...

And Durmstrang... man, it's a wonder that place is still standing, given how much most of the countries it includes hate one another. Oddly enough, I can kinda see the Russian school having that territory, since the Tsars ruled it for many centuries now.

​

Idk, I don't think it's even Eurocentric, it's just dumb. And with only 11 schools, the catchment areas can't be all that different from the map.

********* Oh, definitely agreed to your first point of disagreement. Though I do think Magical Nations would have to take their Muggle-corresponding Nation into account, since they might have to make fake documentation for them and they'd have to know where their Muggleborn were coming from. But that image does come from the 'terrible maps' twitter, after all. :D

Personally, I always thought most borders of magical nations would be a lot less clear, or at least a lot larger since their communities are more scattered (fewer of them, more need to hide, etc) and they can literally all teleport across vast distances nigh-instantly in a few different ways (Floo, Apparation, and I'm sure there are others I'm forgetting). Kinda hard to have any workable claim on any large area when you can literally teleport wherever you want.

And that's exactly what I mean by Euro-centric. Europe is developed enough to have three schools, but the rest of the world is so under-developed to the point that three of her stated schools don't even have names and pretty much all we know about the Russian school is that they play Quidditch on trees instead of brooms.

Because yes, the ideas that China and India don't have their own schools (or cultural equivalent) and that Africa only has one are ridiculous in and of themselves. That's like, 4 billion people and more cultural, ethnic, and political groups than I can even think about.

And definitely absolutely agreed on Durmstrang. It's why I've said elsewhere on this thread that the only reason I could ever see that catchment area working is that their magicals would all hate Russia more than they hate each other (Scandinavia in the 1600s pre-Statute was united as the Swedish Empire and they fought with Russia a lot) and basically set up Durmstrang to piss them off and so they didn't have to go to Koldovstoretz. And might actually explain why it doesn't take Muggleborns. :D
