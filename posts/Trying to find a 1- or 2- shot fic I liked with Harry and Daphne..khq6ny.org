:END:
I thought I had saved a link to this fic but now I can't find it... Harry and Daphne woke up naked in an abandoned classroom with a broken window and the door transfigured into a wall after Draco and his goons stunned them in the backs... Harry had a shrunken backup wand hidden in his hair. He conjured new clothes for them and then they went to the Slytherin common room to get revenge...


** Sounds fun. I'd like to read it. Hope you find it

** if it's the one I think it is, it takes place in a broom closet and Harry uses the backup wand to conjure cloths for them and the do a leap of the top of the stair case and use arresto momentum to slow fall down in front of Mcgonegall.

I think it was part of an authors 1 shot collection.
