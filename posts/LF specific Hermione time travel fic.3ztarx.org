Hermione accidentally (I think) ends up time traveling to the past. For cover she poses as a relative of Aberforth. I think she ends up being shipped with Tom Riddle. I don't remember how it ends but I'm pretty sure it was complete.


** If nobody here can find it, I'd reach out to someone like provocative-envy or cocoartistwrites on Tumblr. They're both Tom/Hermione shippers/writers and might be able to point you in the right direction!

  With the war looking bleak, the Golden Trio, Ginny, Draco, and Lavender go back to Tom Riddle's 7th Year to destroy Lord Voldemort once and for all. What Hermione DIDN'T count on, however, is a shared common room, a curse, and a crazy little thing called love.

*** No, it was just her. I think a big part of it was her being Aberforth's fake daughter and helping fight against Grindelwal.
