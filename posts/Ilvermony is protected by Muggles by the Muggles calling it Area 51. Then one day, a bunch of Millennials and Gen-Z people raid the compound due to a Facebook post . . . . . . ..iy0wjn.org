** ...decide to raid the compound and then realise that there's nothing there. Because as well as the misinformation, Ilvermorny uses magic to hide from muggles. So the muggles find themselves walking around a seemingly abandoned cold War era military base, and the spells enhance their boredom so that they all fuck off home less than an hour after they enter the base.

Meanwhile the cohort of wizards hidden under charms watching them breath a sigh of relief, they weren't looking forward to having to carry out so many obliviations in one go.

***** In truth the left side of the school is in Massachusetts while the right side remains in Nevada - area 51 - only magical space rift keeping the two together.

One of the headmasters wanted school with access to the sea but the budget was enough for half relocation...

Also they did not notice they have sea closer on the other side of US...

As you pointed out, wizards are not great with geography and East and West gets confused sometimes or outright ignored.
