:END:
i think it may be post war, hermione is at the malfoy manner meeting dracos parents and lucius was talking crap about her being a muggle born and Hermione had about enought of it and she was either already bleeding or she cut herself and then cut Lucius or maybe lucius was bleeding already too and gave him a good dressing down forcing him to look and see that her blood is not filthy and is really no different then his. she makes him uncomfortable and uncertain to the point he leaves the room. Then the following day/morning lucius admits that it will take time
