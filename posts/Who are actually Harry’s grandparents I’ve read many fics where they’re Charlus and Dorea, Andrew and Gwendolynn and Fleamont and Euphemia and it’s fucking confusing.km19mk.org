** People used Charlus and Dorea because they were mentioned as Potters in one of the books and people assumed.

Rowling later said his actual grandparents were Fleamont and Euphemia.

Some people like the link to the Blacks via Dorea, so still use Charlus and her though.

Not clue about the other names, never seen that. :)

** Fleamont and Euphemia are the grandparents.

Then depending on who you ask, Fleamont dad was Henry Potter who had a brother Charlus Potter who married Dorea Black who was a sister to Acuturus Black whos son Orion Black was father of Sirius Black...

But that last bit is just based off a chunk of fanfictions I don't know how.much of it is real... I think it's broadly accepted that James and Sirius were cousins of some description because purebloods usually are on some level so that's one way of doing it.

** Fleamont was born in 1909. Charlus was born in 1920. Euphemia is like Cher, and has no known last name. Apparently we need to wait for some more JKR drunk tweets for more details.

***** I think that was Pollux Black who had Walburga at age thirteen with his wife Irma (age unclear) in 1925, going from the Black family tree published in movie canon and the one Rowling auctioned off for charity. Walburga's brother, Cygnus Black, married Druella Rosier and then had Bellatrix at age thirteen in 1951 going from the same source.

It has been known that Rowling isn't very good at math but if this was intentional, it wouldn't surprise me. If it tied into the Fleamont and Charlus Potter situation somehow that would be ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù I guess. However from the original Pottermore article on the Potter family, Fleamont's father is a man called Henry Potter, who apparently was a member of the Wizengamot, and Charlus is not mentioned at all.

It's certainly possible that Rowling had an idea of who Harry's grandparents were going to be when she created the Black family tree for Mina Lima, and then when Pottermore came around she came up with something she liked better.

** From what I could see Charlus Potter and Dorea Potter nee Black were first seen on the Black Tapestry way before JKR came out and said who Harry's Grandparents were. So between the Tapestry and how Harry was able to be Sirius' heir implying that Harry had Black blood in him many folks believed that Charlus and Dorea were his Grandparents as that was a clear link between the Potters and Blacks.

Adding to this seemed to be the habit/tradition of the first born son having their father's name as their middle name (e.g., Sirius ORION Black, James CHARLUS Potter, Harry JAMES Potter, Neville FRANKLIN Longbottom, Draco LUCIUS Malfoy, etc.,). Hence why many people believed that Charlus and Dorea were James' parents/ Harry's grandparents.

Then after quite a lot of fanfics have been written JKR came out and said that Fleamont and Euphemia Potter were Harry's grandparents. Problem is there is nothing to tell us how they are related to the Blacks (which raises the question how could Harry be Sirius' heir without Black Blood), how they are related to Charlus and Dorea Potter, and what other families are they related to.

That's probably why most of the authors/stories I have Read use Charlus and Dorea as Harry's Grandparents rather than Fleamont and Euphemia Potter. As we know (or think we know) a lot more about Charlus and Dorea.

Out of the stories I have read that include or discuss Harry's grandparents 85 stories have had Charlus and Dorea as Harry's grandparents, only 9 have had Fleamont and Euphemia.

Bottomline JKR has stated that Fleamont and Euphemia are Harry Potter's grandparents. I think a lot of fanfic authors are ignoring her and using Charlus and Dorea.

#+begin_quote
  Sirius ORION Black\\
  James CHARLUS Potter\\
  Neville FRANKLIN Longbottom

Of the five examples you listed, three are fanon, and a fourth (Draco) is from a dubiously canonical but still official source.

#+begin_quote
  which raises the question how could Harry be Sirius' heir without Black Blood
#+end_quote

Again, fanon. In canon, Harry could inherit from Sirius because Sirius' will said so. Canon makes it very clear that Black family tradition holds that the house needs to be passed to another Black, in the absence of any enchantments that would force otherwise, which wasn't the case.

** Fleamont and Euphemia are the official grandparents, but even after getting confirmation many fanfic writers still use Charlus and Dorea for various reasons. I'm sure one of the most popular reasons is so that Harry is more closely related to the Black family, but I personally think there is alot of potential with Euphemia because we don't know what family she came from. It opens up so many potential storylines. You could have her be a Malfoy, Greengrass, Longbottom, Selwyn. Hell, you could have her be a Gaunt if you wanted.

*** I think I once saw in a fanfic that ‚ÄúEuphemia‚Äù was made into a Ross, and was related to McGonagall which I think allowed McGonagall to take custody of Harry. Don't remember the name of that fic but it was a use for her that I've never seen before.

A lot of people tend to use Charlus and Dorea if they're old fics or if they want Harry to have a blood connection to the Blacks, but Rowling later confirmed that Fleamont and Euphemia as James' parents which I thought was stupid because it removes that link to Sirius and the names are stupid.

*** The names are stupid, but really, who other than 'Fleamont' and 'Euphemia' is going to name their Wizarding Child something as 'normal' as 'James'. :D

If his grandparents hadn't had names like that, James would totally have been called something like 'Osgiliath Montague Tichondrius Potter'. :D

**** Oh, definitely. I can imagine that if James had other children, the boys would probably be something like William and Charlus. I even read the name Evander once for one of Harry's children. I thought it was nice. Not too different, kinda classic, but with a slight wizarding flair for the last two. There's also the plus that the two names reflect on family; Charlus for James's father/uncle and Evander for Lily's maiden name.

***** Basically my response is just "Totes agreed, tru dat" to pretty much everything except the Evander-Evans link. It just seems a bit of a stretch to me, though I couldn't really tell you why.

But yeah, James and Lily would stick to Muggle names or the more understated Wizarding names, definitely. :)

**** True, but I sorta meant as a close relation that would make sense for calling Andromeda or Draco "cousin" or something. It's also pretty useful if you're writing a fic where Harry is heir Black and he can't be argued against since he has a close Black relation to him or something.
