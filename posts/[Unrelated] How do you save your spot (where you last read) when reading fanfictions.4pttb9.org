And quitting mid chapter, how do you know where you quitted in firefox?


** One of the many reasons I always send longer fics to my Kindle - it will always save my place.

Other than that - read to the end of a chapter and then bookmark the next chapter. Saving open tabs doesn't save scroll position, unfortunately.

**** Its way worth it if you read a ton of ematerial to grab a cheap kindle or tablet. I use the kindle app on a free tablet I got from my phone provider. I just download everything to mobi and send it to my tablet's kindle app via the unique kindle email for that device.

And boom... I can read the FF on my tablet whenever and wherever I want, AND it saves your locations and you can bookmark and do all sorts of cool things.

The ONLY drawback to this, is simply that there are some sites where you cant download the FF and would have to physically copy and paste and create a mobi yourself. But all the major sites are good to go, either on the site itself, or via a FF downloader site.

***** Pre-smartphones, I used to manually copy+paste every chapter on to a text file, and convert it to a jar file. Reading it was like reading a really long text message, lol.

There was also an app that converted text to images so I could read them on my PSP. There are always ways, haha.

*** - "I accidentally closed this Chrome tab": Ctrl+Shift+T (reopen last tab, usable several times in a row) also works on Chrome
- "Firefox just crashed": Firefox is /supposed/ to restore the session (windows and tabs) after a crash; if it does not, you might be browsing in private mode or equivalent settings
- "I was reading this page two weeks ago": this is were navigation history shines; you can browse it either from the address bar (using keywords), Ctrl+H (lateral panel) or Ctrl+Shift+H (full new window)

** I primarily read fics either on my Kindle E-Reader or with Calibre (PC software) since I can bookmark the page I'm on with both, but if I don't...well, I use Google Chrome so I'll just pin the story tab and come back to it later. If GC shuts down I can simply retrieve the tab from my history and the page will return to where it was prior to shutting down. If not, I'll just scroll until I find it. That usually takes a few seconds of skimming unless the fic is a 100k word single file, but chances are I'd be reading that type of fic on my Kindle/with Calibre, so.

ETA: OP, if you have a PC I definitely recommend installing Calibre. It's an e-book manager and there are plug-ins that enable you to DL fics from certain fic sites and convert them to several formats. With Calibre you can also tag fics, organize them into folders and sub-folders, bookmark them, change font/background color of the viewing screen, etc. You could also merge e-books together, which makes reading multi-part stories so much easier. It's really useful.

** I just have them all open in firefox. I use an extension called tabmixplus, which should allow you to save your place on every page that you have open. I probably have 80-100 tabs open right now.

When I want to read them on my phone, I can just sync them right to my phone to pick up where I left off with a bit of scrolling. However, my phone doesn't save my spot so it's annoying to read fics with longer chapters.

** Aside from all the other tricks already posted, here's some I use: Most fics have scene breaks. Just remember you're x number of scenes in and it should be fairly simple to find your place from there. Alternatively, you could take note of the scroll bar and remember that you're halfway/quarter-way through or whatever. These methods are fairly simple to remember and easy to navigate to compared to remembering a specific line you stopped at.
