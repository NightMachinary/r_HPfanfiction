If you're looking for a thorough skewering of Harry Potter fanfiction, I could recommend one of my favourites: Potter Ever After.

It's got next to zero fourth wall, and over the course of 5 chapters it mocks sex scenes, marriage contracts, time travel plots, Evil!Dumbledore (and actually reconstructs it), house-elves-should-be-slaves, Dramione, Dirty!Harry, plays incompetent!Death-Eaters straight, mocks Ron-bashing, easy-legal-exemptions...look, just go read it.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

*** Damn, some of that is pointed. Just read it. I feel slightly happy that the plot devices I use don't show up in the fic. It slightly offsets my terrible writing.
