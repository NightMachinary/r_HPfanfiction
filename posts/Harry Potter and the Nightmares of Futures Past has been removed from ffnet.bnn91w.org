** I'd like to thank Tempest and everyone else who alerted me. This was an unpleasant way to wake up. I have an email from ff.net that I am posting below.

S'TarKan,

Title: "Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past" Summary: "The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?" Rating: "Rated: T" Storyid: 2636963

Main reason for removal: "Not the property of uploading writer Please note we do not allow users to post lyrics to songs they did not write. Exception being works in the US public domain."

The above story has been removed because it violated the guideline detailed on the upload page.

** Still up on FFA under their other Pen name (Viridian Dreams) but without the recent update.

Just checked SIYE, and Phonex Song as well, both up, but last updated long ago (chap 40 for SIYE, and 38 for PS)

Can still get the whole thing (including new chap) via "e-book" format off of his forum on his own website.

Side note, I was under the impression that it was completely abandoned at this point, color me surprised.

** Huh. I don't remember that story being very objectionable although it's possible that I'm overlooking something?

I felt that there was some buddying H/G stuff which would probably be weird even if Harry's future memories fade, but it seemed fine. I don't think I remember any crazy violence or anything like that either. I suppose there's some potential copyright implications of how the author does beta-ing though, but considering everything I assumed that everyone was okay with ignoring that.

**** I love NoFP so much. I'm glad your health has been improving. I don't care if it takes 20 more years for you to finish, I'll still be here waiting for the next chapter, you just take care of yourself. With so many dead or abandoned fics it's amazing that you're still working on it as you are able. It's really appreciated.

** The only thing I can think of that makes sense given the stated reason is that somebody doesn't realise that S'TarKan = ViridianDreams and mistakenly assumed that the story had been copied.

I don't believe it's the Patreon thing or surely the ffn mods would have blanked the user profile page rather than one of the stories.

Hopefully it'll be back up again before long.
