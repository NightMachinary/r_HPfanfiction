The first story, /To the Waters and the Wild/ by Paimpont features a Harry that is so sickeningly innocent it's hilarious. He thinks the best of everyone and tries to make friends with everyone and everything.

The second story, /A Snake Named Voldemort/ by estalita11 is a little similar, but much less extreme. He still wears his heart on his sleeve and is far too trusting and kind for his own good.

I'm looking for stories that feature a similar characterization of Harry. Like characters coming onto him physically/romantically and having no idea that it's happening or why.


** Canon?

*** You're not too far off the mark really. It's very similar to canon Harry.

***** Isn't Book 5 the one where he gets told (indirectly) that he wears his heart on his sleeve?

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
