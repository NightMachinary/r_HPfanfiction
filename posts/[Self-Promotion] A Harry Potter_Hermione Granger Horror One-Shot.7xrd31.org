For about a month, I was stuck on an idea I had that involved Harry, Hermione, and a house-elf. Therefore, I decided to write it. The story is called "Sparky's Surprise" and deals with Harry and Hermione rescuing Sparky from an abusive family who decides to repay them in kind. It's a one-shot with elements of romance, drama, and horror. Let me know what you all think! linkffn(12838231)


** Oh... Wow...

Well, the writing is good. The reviewers are right though- you really should list it as horror and put a warning at the beginning. Also, I kind of felt that it would be better if more of the first segment hinted at/ somehow added to the conclusion - the begin kind of felt pointless and the horror came out of the blue, although if that's what you're aiming for, you did it.

That came out of freaking nowhere. Or did I miss a clue somewhere?
