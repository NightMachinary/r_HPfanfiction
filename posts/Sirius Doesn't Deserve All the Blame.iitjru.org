When it comes to the full moon prank, the general consensus within the fandom seems to be that Sirius was 100% at fault and Snape was an innocent victim. Personally, however, I've never been able to understand this perspective. To walk you through as to why, let's go through what we know happened regarding the prank.

1. James, Sirius, and Peter had started accompanying Remus during full moons thanks to their new Animagus abilities.
2. Snape was extremely interested in where Remus went every month and was following them around in the hopes of getting them expelled.
3. Sirius told Snape that all he needed to do was press the knot on the Willow, and he would be able to find out where they went every month.
4. Snape did so and nearly came face to face with werewolf Lupin before James saved his life, but not before catching a glimpse of Remus at the end of the tunnel.
5. Dumbledore made Snape swear not to tell anyone what he saw.

Here's what we don't know: the exact day Sirius told Snape how to get past the Willow. It's never actually stated even though most people assume that he told Snape on the day of a full moon. But for all we know, he could have told him two weeks before the next full moon and Snape just happened to go on the night of a full moon, whether on purpose or purely coincidentally.

I think I just murdered the phrase "full moon".

But even if we ignore that, going purely by canon facts alone, yes, Sirius was absolutely wrong to betray Remus like that. However, nobody forced Snape to go down to the Willow. Sirius didn't drag him kicking and screaming; Snape chose to follow his word of his own free will. I'm truly not certain how people can claim that the prank should be blamed solely on Sirius when Snape demonstrated ridiculously poor judgment.

***** Usually when asked this question I suggest [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][stories by Northumbrian]] (start with “Tales of the Battle” and then go on; other stories are good too, but he is the strongest with his post-War stories I believe). For me, the initial story which persuaded me that stories written by non-professionals may be worthy of reading was “Inner Demons by serendipity_50” linkao3(601124), and only one story is the first one. Other suggest stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]] (Summer goes before Winter). For something completely different, there are “Petunia's Letter by mzzbee” linkao3(11676102) and its sequels, or “Puzzle by we-built-the-shadows-here” linkffn(6622580).

My fanfiction library has currently over 1000 stories (not that I like all of them equally, I tend to store even some which I don't like, but which are important for other reasons), so it is very hard to pick some particular set to begin with. Some other people have different tastes and they would suggest something radically different from what I did.

Setting a bomb on something that might be triggered by anyone is casual violence against everyone, even an innocent bystander.

Sirius' intentions are unclear. We can't say that he was using Remus as a "murder weapon". It is unknown whether he intended for Snape to die. You seem to be intent on picking the least charitable option to demonize Sirius.

Snape had a pretty solid theory on what might've been down there. It doesn't absolve Sirius of the guilt, but it does show that Snape isn't completely unaware of the danger either.

Snape emphasizes on /full moon/, Lily coldly says she is well aware of his /theory/... If you can't see it or don't want to see it in order to maintain Snape's supposed image as a saint, that is your interpretation, not a perfect representation of canon. The text is extremely vague.

************ Well it's a lot more complex than that actually.

Here in the US it's generally illegal to booby trap your home. If your booby trap result in the death of a burglar then yes, you will face legal consequences.

Likewise booby trapping Amazon packages to cause heavy injury to those who steal them is also illegal in the US and probably Europe as well.

The reason is usually

1) The chance that the booby trap can affect non criminals accidentally. So if a kid had accidentally kicked that thing and it exploded...

2) Death or permanent injury for stealing is considered a bit much especially if...

3) The homeowners aren't in immediate trouble. You're not in immediate danger if someone steals your Amazon package. Especially if they never even enter your home. So the force used has to be proportional to that.

Heck even in the US what constitutes as self defense is variable. It's not as simple as “I see people on my property I can now shoot”.

The idea of what constitutes “reasonable force” is complex. Likewise there is a lot of restriction on when “deadly force” can be used.

None of this applies, of course, to Sirius, since we don't know who has jurisdiction over wizards, and what their law is, which leaves us with the moral, ethical debate, and you said yourself that his actions were unjustifiable.

** So Sirius might be my favourite marauder. But I have to say that I am of the firm belief that he deserves the blame and that this event also, in a way, sowed the seeds of his death - and that dumbledore was the worst in this situation.

I think that if Snape was killed it would have been reckless manslaughter.  Sirius didn't appear to have the real, malicious intention to want Snape dead. That's killing-curse stuff.   Rather, I think he wanted Snape scared and humiliated - and was totally reckless to the outcome. Telling Snape that he could find the answers down there? He had to know Snape would go check it out. You absolutely would not do this in the real world if it was, say, a lethal animal like a bear and get to shrug it off and say hey! I didn't force him!

Sirius didn't remotely think it through and demonstrated underdeveloped risk-taking assesment. And then Dumbledore doesn't punish him for it, or at least if he did it has not been mentioned or didn't make a lasting impression. He let Sirius get away with such a reckless action.

The ultimate cruelty is this: Sirius' recklessness is what killed him. And Dumbledore let him down by not helping him learn to mediate his recklessness as a teen. Sirius ran to save Harry without checking or seeking backup etc - If he had done basic risk assessment and thought things through Sirius would be alive.

But Sirius as a teen didn't have adults in his life that were guiding him properly.  Troubled 15 year old boys that are being abandoned by their bigoted families don't need detention or a basic telling off after almost killing someone.  They need significant rehabilitation, to understand the seriousness of their actions, and close, careful guidance. In the modern day, we're talking victim impact statements, community service, counselling, therapy, blah blah blah.  Dumbledore absolutely needed to help him learn from that event. And, heartbreakingly, Sirius was imprisoned pretty soon after finishing school. He had no opportunity to grow up properly and find his own way as an adult.

When recalling the near death of Snape by Lupin's lycanthropy in PoA, Sirius: “Made a derisive noise. “It served him right” he sneered.”

This isn't someone who's been rehabilitated to understand the seriousness of the risks they take - of almost causing a peer's death.  It's someone who wasn't parented properly or rehabilitated afterwards. Who doesn't understand their recklessness. And that recklessness killed him soon after. Sirius totally almost got Snape killed, but he was honestly like a drink driving 15 year old boy, just reckless in youth. Understanding this about him is integral to understanding him as a character, including his tragic death.

** For me, the problem is that Snape had no idea what he would find if he went under the Willow. Yes, Snape showed poor judgment in listening to a boy he hates and who hates him, but they're teenagers and teenagers don't always think things through. Sirius' decision to tell Snape, even if he didn't do it with the intent to get anyone killed, still put Snape in a situation where he would have been killed if James hadn't intervened.

None of Snape's actions or decisions were so terrible that he deserved to be tricked to walk unknowingly into his own death.

I think of anyone deserves the blame beyond Sirius, it's the teachers. They should have been a lot more proactive in putting a stop to the Marauder's bullying, to Snape's harassment (of following them around), and done a much better job making sure no one got near the Willow during the full moon.

Even if he honestly didn't suspect that Remus might be a werewolf, the fact that someone who hated him was telling him to sneak out of the castle at night and poke a violent and dangerous tree should have been enough of a red flag not to go through with it. You're right, teenagers don't think things through, but I feel like most would know not to follow the word of their sworn enemy.

**** Based on how Snape and Sirius interact with one another in OotP, I think each of them had a tendency to goad the other into doing stupid stuff. I can easily see Sirius giving Snape the issue in a way that makes it almost like a dare, and Snape being unwilling to back down because he assumes whatever is there isn't that dangerous. And honestly, Sirius probably doesn't think its that dangerous because the only time he has been around Lupin as a werewolf was as an animagus which completely negates the danger and its easy to forget that just because something isn't dangerous to you doesn't mean it is safe for everyone else.

I can forgive the teachers for their decisions in the main series, because it was written for children and Harry was the protagonist. Having the teachers solve all the problems would make for a boring story, but I do wish that there were more moments showing that they were competent adults and flashbacks would have been a good time to do it.

********** Without knowing what the actual spells were, I can't really make a clear call on that. Lily said their humor was “evil” and Dumbledore knew they were interested in the Dark Arts but in Lily's year, we didn't have Tom Riddle's handpicked Death Eaters who were linked to several nasty incidents at Hogwarts and the opening of the Chamber of Secrets.

Snape defended them just as the Marauders were defended by everyone else. Even Harry admitted that it was a cruel prank and that he couldn't see Fred or George doing something like that or considering it funny.

Mass murder of muggleborns wasn't advertised initially. Yes, Voldemort was rallying support at the time and advocating pure-blood ideals, but most people didn't really know what he was prepared to do. Regulus Black joined and promptly switched sides when he figured out what Voldemort really was. Voldemort loved to operate with secrecy and mystery, I highly doubt he took out an ad at the Daily Prophet saying: Help Wanted! Young, impressionable teens to slaughter muggleborns and all other objectors to a Pure-Blood order. Dark Arts knowledge a must. All interested applicants please address an Owl to...”

So to these misfits and outcasts, Voldemort probably represented a way to boost their esteem by advertising that they were “saving” the magical race by being overlords to the muggles and gatekeepers of magic. Textbook strategy.

Snape might not have been too concerned about what happened to Lily's classmate but he has never tried to actively kill. “Going after his nemesis” was again, not to physically kill anyone but to get them kicked out of school as he thought they deserved. Sirius was way out of line and as much as I liked and pitied his character, I didn't think his actions there were forgivable because he could have really harmed two friends along with Snape. All because he knew Snape was always sneaking around and trying to discredit the four of them.

Dumbledore becomes Headmaster around 1964; Lupin starts school in '71. I can see a new headmaster not being able to immediately allow werewolves to attend school, so he needs to spend some time getting settled and convincing the school board that he should be allowed to this, as well as making plans on how to do it. Then, the school board agrees to allow a single werewolf to attend so they can see how it goes. Dumbledore chooses Remus for whatever reason and until Lupin graduates without any incidents no other werewolf children are able to attend. Lupin graduates in '78, at which point, we have no way of knowing if any other werewolf children attended Hogwarts. I imagine there were, particularly after the invention of wolfsbane.

Think of it this way. If some guy who hated you encouraged you to drive drunk, the obvious thing to do would be to refuse. Everyone knows that driving drunk is dangerous and could result in you or someone else getting killed. At the end of the day, if you choose to follow his word anyway, that's on you. You still have agency over your own decisions.

Or think of it this way. If you give a pocket knife to a friend as a birthday gift and that friend proceeds to use that knife to murder their cat, does that make the cat's death your fault? No, of course not. You might have given your friend the knife, but your friend was the one who chose to kill the cat.

Similarly, regardless of whether Snape knew what he was going to find past the Willow or not, he was still willing to put himself in danger simply by going near it in the first place. It's a well-known fact in the series that the Whomping Willow was highly dangerous and violent, yet he still went down there anyway because some guy who hated his guts told him that if he poked the murder tree in the middle of the night, he would be able to find their secret hideout.

Sirius gave Snape information, so for that, he does deserve some of the blame. I'm not saying he should be let off the hook completely. My point is that saying he deserves all of the blame ignores the fact that Snape was still perfectly able to decide not to go poking the Willow if he wanted.

** Sirius explained to Snape how to go under the Willow knowing full well that Snape would use it to follow Lupin (so a night of full moon). The intent behind his "prank" was to have Snape in front of a transformed werewolf.

I'm really partial to Sirius, and I'll easily admit that Snape acted as an idiot when he followed Remus. But it is a fact that Sirius acted as an asshole when he did it.Without the intervention of James, Lupin would have been expelled at best (and more likely either sent to Azkaban or killed), Snape would be either dead or a werewolf, and Sirius could have easily found himself in front of a jury with a charge of attempted Murder.

Characters like Ron are bashed because they refused to talk to Harry for a month, this is so much worse than that. Sirius could (and should) have been expelled after a prank like that, and the only reason why he wasn't was because Dumbledore couldn't do it while protecting Remus secret.

*** Yeah, I'm not saying that Sirius wasn't an asshole. I'm just saying it's not completely his fault that Snape went down there.
