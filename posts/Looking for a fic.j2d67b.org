:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi everyone!

Sorry I don't remember much. It takes place during the triwizard tournament. Harry was raised by Sirius, and didn't attend hogwarts, he had a tutor for each subject. During the first task Harry used an ice version on fiendfire he and his dark arts tutor had created. The tutors were various nationalities

If you guys have any ideas I'd appreciate it. Thanks!


** Sounds like “Hail Odysseus by Brennus“ linkffn(10645463), ... hmm, but it is not that. There Harry returns just for the seventh year. Anyway, read that story, and many other stories by that author, he is really good.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

** Might be “Soul and Body” by LF74 linkffn(13534233). Harry does attend Hogwarts, but leaves almost immediately to go live with Sirius, only to come back for the tournament.
