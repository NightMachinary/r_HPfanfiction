I'm trying to find a series I read a while back where James and Lily lived and raised Harry and they lived at Potter Manor. Harry ended up being friends with most of the main characters he was friends with in the books anyway - Remus and Sirius were also around. The series had a number of stories and was very well written. Anyone know which one this might be? I've been searching and searching and can't find it anymore!


** Is it the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/111713][Harry Potter: Everyone Lives AU]], starting with linkao3(1746629)? I don't specifically remember whether they lived at Potter Manor in it, but everything else sounds right.

#+begin_quote
  Mr. and Mrs. Potter were not perfectly ordinary people. They did not live on an ordinary street like you or I. They did not have a small house with a number to differentiate it from the identical houses on either side of it. They had, in fact, quite the opposite of it all.----How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived? Ships not listed because I'm unsure if there will be deviations from canon in that respect. Characters will be added as they appear.
