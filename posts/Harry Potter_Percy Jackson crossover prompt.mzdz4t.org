I have an idea for a fanfiction where, while wandering through the woods somewhere in Britain for whatever reason, Percy and Annabeth are attacked by monsters. They manage to kill them, but Percy is stabbed with a poisoned blade (or something else), so Annabeth seeks help. Until she finally finds help --- Harry, Ron, and Hermione's tent looking for horcruxes.
