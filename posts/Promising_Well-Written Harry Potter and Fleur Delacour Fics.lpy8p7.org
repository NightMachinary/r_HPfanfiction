While some are rather silly with Veela soul bonds causing Harry to transcend reality and of course the usual smattering of "harem honeys" fics, I do find that I like the general pairing of Harry and Fleur. Any recommendations? Preferably over 60k words and finished (but I know that's usually a bit difficult to find). For reference, I have read fics like "A Cadmean Victory" and "A Beautiful Lie" and generally enjoy the progression of the relationship in those two fics. Thanks!

  Loneliness was something that Harry Potter was accustomed to. He had learnt that there was none that cared for him, none that would rescue him from his misery and none that heard his pleas for help. Much to his surprise, however, Harry Potter had been wrong. Someone had been listening, had been there with him through it all. But, just who was 'Tom?

** Hope and Healing by gomez36000 linkffn(13819320) It's a revision/expansion of a story that the author had previously published. Although there are only four chapters published so far the updates will be coming every few days. So if you want the wordcount to grow a bit, maybe bookmark it and check back next month. Highly recommend.

  'Colors vary, hues may shine. As lavender sings, "Please be mine."' The world is often hard and unkind to young teenagers, and the Wizarding World is no exception. Between violent animosity from his relatives and keeping his home life a secret while living at the wonder that is Hogwarts, Harry wants nothing more than to live a normal life. Free of the dark, wizard or otherwise.

** 60k ish words, Harry Potter and a Flower written by potterheadcharles.

Harry/Fleur set during Triwizard Tournament. Premise is Fleur is depicted as lazy prodigy. After realizing how underprepared Harry is, Harry asking Fleur for help and he kinda grows stronger. His personality is akin to teenager not immersed in angst, so some slight deviation from canon Harry commonly portrayed. So far I didn't see bashing here which is refreshing here. In order for the plot to move at first, author have to make some division between Harry and the rest but in the later chapter Harry will forgive them in the way Canon Harry is and the trust is back again.

  AU Year 4. Left alone to his devices, Harry is thrust into a tournament where he is absolutely outclassed. Enter Fleur Delacour, a lazy prodigious Veela who is bored. They meet and sparks fly. Dangerous opponents, seriously dangerous creatures and his rotten luck. How will Harry survive this one? And Fleur never told him what her father does for a job...

** Hope and Healing; A Different Kind of War; A Court of Flowers; With Whom to Dance are all lovely longer stories! I've enjoyed all of them. His Angel is also considered a 'classic' of the pairing. There are a ton of hard-hitting one-shots too, if you'd ever want to give them a try. If you or anyone would be interested, there is a dedicated pairing server that is a ton of fun and has great artists and authors involved!
