** Well, /if/ creating the elixir or transmuting things into gold with it is possible without anything but it and not even being magical (i.e. a wizard or witch), then I'd go for the philosopher's stone. The “why” is kind of obvious: I may not be someone who cares about having a mountain of money, and living forever is probably overrated, but being able to make just one gold bar would get me set forever (I'm good at managing my own finances, so it would take me forever and then some to somehow spend €400.000 or however much it is worth) and having something that keeps me in top shape all the time (no bothersome health annoyances) would be the best thing ever.

That's /if/. If not, however, then I'd go for a time turner, as the ability to come back in time, even limited as it would be, would be handy too, especially on the days when there's just not enough time for everything.
