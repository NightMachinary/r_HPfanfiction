One question I Still have is why did McGonagall Take 150 from three first years for being out of bed ?

Looking back it's a bit extreme doesn't it?

Did McGonagall forget that Harry wasn't his father and it was only his first time getting caught out of bed or something?

Do you think the Gryffindors students themselves did anything else to punish Harry for losing 150 points other than shun him ? Did worse thing happen that were left out because it was a children's book?

Like we know at the very least that the quiddich team refused to even use his name only call him The Seeker and they would have had to have been treating him pretty badly to drive him to the point were he offers to leave the quiddich team.

What sort of pranks do you think Fred and George were playing on him ?

Really I think a fanfic about that time in Harrys life would be interesting


** In linkffn(A Dramatic Reading) She was stressed because of the unicorns being killed, and had assumed that they were aware, given how quickly news travels among the students, and she also didn't want to give them any ideas from the Marauders.

*** The fanfiction bot really needs to get fixed...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/1/A-Dramatic-Reading][A Dramatic Reading is by White Squirrel]]: It's a story that uses the plot of 'characters find the Harry Potter books and read them', but actually has the revelations cause big changes in the present-day plot.

Unfortunately, it only covers book 1 (though that's enough to get Umbridge deposed and Voldemort's survival revealed), though another author started a sequel, A Sensational Story, which I'm too lazy to look up at the moment.
