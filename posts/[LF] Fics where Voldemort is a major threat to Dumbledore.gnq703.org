*** I think Dumbledore was stronger in canon. The film didn't properly show it but in his duel with Voldemort at the end of OOTP, Dumbledore manages to easily contain him while keeping Harry safe at the same time.

**** It's at best a stalemate and that depends on how you look at that Fawkes saves Dumbledore while he's dealing with the snake or however that went.

**** To be fair, after he captures Bellatrix and secures Harry, his attention is focused on Voldemort. It was a stalemate.

#+begin_quote
  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.
