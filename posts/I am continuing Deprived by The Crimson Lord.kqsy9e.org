** I would encourage you to do a fanfic of a fanfic rather than a continuation of someone else's story.

*Fanfic of a fanfic*

You take inspiration from their ideas but tell a story in your own words and in your own way.

Canon comparison: writing your own version of sixth year.

Morally speaking, mostly ok, especially where the author has given it their blessing (as JKR has).

*Continuation*

You are purporting to complete a story that isn't yours, stepping into the shoes of another writer and usurping their moral right to tell their story how they wanted it to be told.

Canon comparison: finding JKR's incomplete draft of Deathly Hallows and publishing your own "completion" of her story, working off her incomplete draft.

Morally speaking, unacceptable. Most fanfic websites will ban you if you do this.

** 'Cleaning up' and slightly changing is understandable, from your perspective, but, well, rude, despite your attempts to contact them. Also, you'd definitely be slammed by fans for plagiarizing if you did this. You're putting someone else's chapters under your name. That's just not okay.

A better approach is to present your version as a continuation that picks up from where they left off. I've seen this a few times, and it seems to be met with less rancor. On the other hand, in one case the author had planned on coming back, despite the years-long lapse, and then was really upset that others had 'finished' her fic.

** There are huge issues with plagiarism. If you want to do something like this, you have to have approval of the original author.

**** There are no blurred lines ... any art based on the previous art (and that includes translations, for example, but it certainly includes fanfiction of fanfiction) has to have an approval of the original author. Period. Anything else is plagiarism. And yes, many people violates rights of the original author, and yes, when the original author doesn't know, he is hardly to sue you, but theoretically he can.

****** Yes, they would require, but she actually did somewhere is on the record as giving blanket approval of fanfiction stories for her work.

And yes, other point, is that usually the amount of remedy for breach of copyright is based on the profit ones get from it. Which being zero for all fanfiction stories makes litigation quite unlikely.
