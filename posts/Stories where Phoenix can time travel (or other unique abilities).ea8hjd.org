I've come across a number of stories where phoenix have some unique abilities. And then I recently browsed a story fragment (abandoned) by Golasgil Sindar where Harry and Hermione encounter the Flamels courtesy of a phoenix which time travels. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1698864/17/Musings]]

Just made me wonder about if anyone has any good recommendations that involve a phoenix able to time time travel.

(kind of related, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7395979/1/Whatever-Happened-to-the-Likely-Lad]] they phoenixes which guard The Fountain of Youth. And I also remember one where Harry and Ron dimension hop to the Goblet of Fire -- blanking on the title -- where Fawkes is /aware/ of the multi-dimensions, but unable to bring them back.)

okay, feel free to put in any other really unique phoenix abilities then as well...
