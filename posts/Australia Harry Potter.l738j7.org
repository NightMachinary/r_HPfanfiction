Is there anything out there with Austrailian Harry. Like he grew up in Australia and moved back to England or he pretends to be Australian or something. I know there's a lot of “post war they go to Australia FanFictions” but I would like to read a “prehogwarts Australian Harry“ That is preferably over 5000 words. if there is nothing like that out there then does someone want to write it.

  Harry was left in the Australian outback by his relatives. Rather than dying from exposure, the heat, or any of the many and varied nasties that could have easily killed him, Harry was found. Don't own. COMPLETE.
