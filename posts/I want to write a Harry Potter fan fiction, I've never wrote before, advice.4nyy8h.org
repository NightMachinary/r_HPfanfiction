Hi! So, I have been wanting to write a Harry Potter fan fiction, like my title says. Only I've never wrote one so I had a few questions: What's a good way to keep track of what's canon? I have been re-listening to the books on my phone while I've been working, but I don't know how detailed you're suppose to be with cannon, how many little details should I make sure I get right? What are some no no's with HP fan fics? Over used plots or tropes? What do you generally not like with the fan fictions you read? On the other had, what are some things you do like? What are some things, aside from thing's like proper grammar, punctuation, spelling, that makes good writing with Harry Potter? What are some aspects of the world, you'd like to see?


** Well, the first question to ask is: what's your idea? You don't need to remember every minute detail in canon, you just need to remember the details that are relevant to your story. As such, it's a bit difficult to give you precise advice without that information.

No matter who you ask, you'll probably get a different answer each to this question each time. Some people want Auror Potter magical-noir, others want to see Ron in the world of professional quidditch, or Hermione climbing the ladder in the DMLE, some people just want an old-fashioned romance for all three, and all some people want is canon rehash. Ultimately, tastes are so diverse that it's a pointless exercise to focus on what other people want to see, because you'll end up stretched in a hundred directions. Rather, you should focus on the aspects of the HP world that /you/ want to see. If your idea is good enough, the readers will come.

** Write what you're enthusiastic about, write what /you'd/ like to see, and it will find an audience. How close you stick to canon depends on what you want your fic to be. If it's alternate universe (AU), you can chalk up any differences to that. If you want it to be a story that takes place inside canon, everything has to be right.

Anyway, just write as much and as fast as you can while the ideas are coming (but don't post it all right away), if you get to a point where you're slowing down or not sure about the story, take that time to go over what you've written or send it to a beta.

Just from your post here I can tell grammar is maybe a weak point of yours when writing casually? There is no quicker way to lose an audience than to have terrible spelling or grammar, so definitely go over what you can yourself before sending it to a beta or two. It's okay for your writing to look like shit on a first draft, not so much when you're ready to post it.

I'll just point to my "10 Commandments" from a few days ago.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4nikv4/what_would_you_want_in_a_10_commandments_of/d44qob6]]

I'd love to write a HP fanfic myself, but after reading 100+ different fics, I realize that it's not easy to do. There are so many traps to fall into. And sometimes it takes very little to put the readers off the story.

I remember one story where the author insisted on using a much-used, but wrong, expression. I think it was "could/couldn't care less", or something like that. Being a pet peeve of mine, I just left the story. There are 700,000+ Harry Potter stories just on ffn. I can afford to be picky.

Also, it might be a good idea to outline the story first. Make a rough timeline before you start writing. I use yWriter5 for my fanfiction dreams.

And the most important thing: Show, don't tell.

** I have a separate document to plan out chapters which I can use as a guide for my story, while also a handy way to change things to keep to memory.\\
I think the beauty of fanfiction is you can explore other areas outside of Harry at Hogwarts (if you're trying to keep to canon) as well as other characters who were more so in the background of the original text. It's worth a try giving other perspectives a shot if it works into your story.

If you want a succinct timeline of events that happen in Harry Potter as a guideline (I used this for my story plan when it came to exams, timetables and bigger events in the original) I use the Harry Potter Lexicon. It's a fan based encyclopedia, and I don't know if it's the utmost legitimate in canon information, but I think it might be.

** For canon, the Harry Potter wikia is the most complete resource you'll find and if you search on google you can even find timelines for canon events. As for overused plot points and stuff like that it's been posted many times here so I suggest you search. Personally I dislike canon rehash, so something original would be nice, but even that can be entertaining if you change it enough, just make sure you know where you're going before you start writing so it doesn't end up abandoned.

*** While using a reference is laudable, the HP Wiki is a crappy tertiary source- it treats everything ever mentioned in any media that has a corporate logo on it as equally relevant and authoritative. As far as the Wiki is concerned, Lavender Brown was a black girl up until [magic/central casting] turned her blonde and busty. I guess magical puberty is a real game-changer.

They have an entry for the wizard picking his nose at the World Cup.

HPWiki is about as trustworthy as getting sex education from eleven-year-olds at summer camp.

The better, more rigorously-researched site is [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/index-2.html]]. They don't update as often as during their heyday, but they get things right when it comes to the books.

** Find a good beta. They will proof read to stop you from writing things like 'wrote' instead of 'written'.

Jokes aside though, a good beta will help a lot with pacing, spelling and grammar, and general plot holes. An outside influence always helps. If you like you can pm me your first chapter and I'll go through it for you.

** *What's a good way to keep track of what's canon?*

This might sound bad, but I don't generally give a crap about canon. Depending on where your story starts you only really need to remember the canonical story prior to that point, if you've changed canon, perhaps a brief introductory paragraph early on explaining the differences?

*Don't know how detailed you're suppose to be with cannon*

As above, doesn't really matter. Go crazy.

*How many little details should I make sure I get right?*

Very vague question. There are lots of little details that people are picky about, and there are a lot of BIG plot points that are underused and fans like reading different twists on. One such twist could be that when Hermione turns into a cat it's incurable and she can't turn back - how would that impact canonical Hermione?

*What are some no no's with HP fan fics?*

Bad writing is generally quite a turn off. If you a bad story with good quality writing that makes sense people can still enjoy it.

My pet peeve is two dimensional characters. Let your characters breathe and live a little. So many characters are shoe horned in to be comic relief or just to include them for canons sake.

*Over used plots or tropes?*

There are many, but if you write it well you can pull off any trope. Bad/Evil/Manipulative-Dumbledore isn't far fetched, you've just got to convince the reader of that.

*What do you generally not like with the fan fictions you read?*

Boring stories. Stories that only exist as male power-fantasy with harems and unlimited powaaaaaah. Powers all well and good, and can introduce a lot of really awesome shit into a story we would never see in canon, but people won't really invest in the story without a human underneath all that they can give a shit about.

*What are some things you do like?*

Being surprised. I've read millions upon millions of words of fanfiction and I've not been surprised all that often. As mentioned previously there's a lot of places in canon where the story can derail, but it doesn't. J.K. Rowling has given an immense amount of wiggle room to take advantage of. We know about prophecies and seers yet they are barely explored. You could write a novel on the story of a seer going through hogwarts and learning to deal with their visions of prophecy. That'd be a fucking great read if it could be pulled off.

*What are some things, aside from thing's like proper grammar, punctuation, spelling, that makes good writing with Harry Potter?*

Have fun with your writing and your story and your characters. Not getting lost with sub-plots and instead always making some form of progress with the main story which will give a sense of momentum and inevitability. So many fics I've read meander and get lost because they introduced way more characters and plots that they could sensibly handle. It's horrible to wade through page after page of bullshit to get to the next relevant paragraph/page. Fucking hate it.

*What are some aspects of the world, you'd like to see?*

Magical creatures are woefully unexplored. Knockturn alley and general criminality is very underrated and not used to the extent it could be to flesh out unique story lines/characters.

** In all honesty, to start of writing, it is best to do some tropes. Build on dribbles with them. If you find yourself writing more than 500 words keep going. Not everything you write will be published. If you do put it in a growing collection.

A good fanfic is one that has an imperfection to the character. Super!harry is always hard to pull off because no one wants to read perfection.

Don't do sudden changes. Always write out each action then eliminate. Writing more is better than less. As for eliminating, my writing professor said one thing that has stuck with me all these years. Sure it is great to hear about the billion of inheritance Harry Potter or Hermione have, but is it promoting the story? Is it building character? Is it pushing the plot a long? If I were to take that piece out would it impact the story?

Things that are nice in a fanfic? One thing the books lacked in my opinion was culture and society. Yes, we read through the eyes of a very naive young character who could care less if goblins were actually mean, but it could've been used better. Much like Tolkien used Bilbo and Frodo, use your character to build the world. Allow the reader to learn through the eyes of the character.

Avoid the common dialogue queue of blah blah. You will lose the reader.

Character A "Speak". Character A acts.

Character B actions.

Character B says.

Character A responds.

Character B shrugs (actions).

Character A asks.

Character B talks.

This keeps the characters and their actions separate and clean. It is a neat trick to keep track of what is going on too.

As for cannon. How cannon do you want to go? Outlining the situation or hardcore cannon?

** Fuck canon man. Theres thousands of stories out there. Sticking to canon is a good way to sound like everyone else. If you have a plot thats cool, make your own canon the center of it, not the actual one. Much more fun that way.

** Have faith in your own ability, and write a story that you personally would like to read. Being new to writing, the best thing you can do is to write a lot. A ridiculous amount. Get someone to read it and tell you what they liked/didn't like about your writing, and read it yourself and see the same. The more you write, the better you get. And good luck!
