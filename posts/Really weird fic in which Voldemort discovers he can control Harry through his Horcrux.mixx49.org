:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic a while ago with one of the worst plots and I'd like to have another good laugh. It's a Tomarry fic where Voldemort starts out bored and writes Harry a letter but Harry is too badly beaten by the Dursleys to respond so he worries and checks up on him then he finds out that he can control Harry via his Horcrux and turns him into his lover. He also discovers that he is the son Sirius and James (James was pregnant) and that Hermione(?) is the daughter of Lily and Snape and he has this power where he can switch the fetus from inside a pregnant person's womb into the father's womb. Also he discovers that Dumbledore actually abducted Lily and James and was holding them as sex slaves in the Hogwarts dungeons. Does anyone know the name? Thanks.

** That's wild. No idea what the fic is, though now I'm wondering how Harry got his mother's eyes while being the child of James and Sirius?
