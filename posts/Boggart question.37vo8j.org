If a boggart were to take the form of a magical creature such as a Basilisk, does it gain all the abilities? Harry states that it would be more difficult to create a patronus in the presence of a "real dementor". Does that mean if the boggart took the form of say a basilisk could it kill with a gaze? Would it have the most venomous bite in the magical world?


** I'd posit that the boggart can only replicate /psychological/ effects of magical creatures, and can't or doesn't cause actual physical harm even if taking the physical form of something dangerous. Like Snape.

Otherwise, Lupin's lesson was /horribly/ dangerous, even for Hogwarts. And I find that hard to believe.

*** I like [[http://hpmor.com/chapter/107][HPMOR's]] (link is to chapter 107) take on the boggart:

A boggart," Professor Quirrell said, and now his voice was again that of a Hogwarts Professor lecturing, "gravitates to dark enclosures that are rarely opened, such as a neglected cupboard in the attic. It seeks to be left alone, and it will manifest in whatever form it thinks will scare you away."

"Scare me away?" Harry said. [snip for spoiler]

"You leapt backward out of the room without thinking. A boggart seeks out the instinctive flinch, not the reasoned threat. Else it would have selected something more believable. In any case, the standard counter-Charm for a boggart is, of course, Fiendfyre."

** I'm thinking it wouldn't choose to bite or make direct eye contact because it's trying to elicit fear, not kill?

** I prefer the take on boggarts where they have absolutely no ability to harm a person physically...that would explain why Lupin didn't seem worried about his third year students being in close quarters with a variety of monsters.

Harry's boggart-dementor is pretty psychically nasty though.

** Given that Lupin didn't turn when he saw the full moon surely it holds no actual power and just a physical representation.

** Would a boggart phoenix be able to flame travel? Then again, I suppose the bigger question is "Would anyone fear a phoenix enough for a boggart to take the form of one?"

**** Or without one. I imagine a dark wizard might fear them because of their travel and healing abilities, hard to put down your enemy when he has a phoenix.

** Here's another basilsk question that one fic brought up: does the death gaze still work in a pensive viewing of a basilsk?

*** I doubt it, a Pensieve is like a TV, just a recording of a memory, nothing can harm or influence you physically since it's all in the past.

**** But thats the whole point. We dont know why or how the gaze kills/petrifies. Perhaps it is just seeing the eyes that kills. That is to say it is from the observer observing that kills, not the observee (basilisk) doing anything. In which case viewing it in a pensive would still kill.

***** Surely it's something to do with the magic of a basilisk? Magic that wouldn't actually be present in any kind of recording since that's not what memories are.

edit: I mean okay so memories in HP also aren't what memories are. but magic I guess. I don't know, I guess that not many people will have ever seen a Basilisk's eyes, even in a pensieve.

** I would say no, because a boggart doesn't become the thing (otherwise it could not then transform into something else)

** One could guess that a boggart takes on a limited form of the abilities of a creature it mimics. A boggart impersonating a basilisk might petrify you with a stare, or may be it would just cause your joints to stiffen.

One could alternatively guess that a boggart has a fear auro that is much weaker than the dread and despair aura produced by a dementor.

*** I agree that such a place is awesome, I merely posted it here because I read a fic a few months ago that had boggarts being the worst creatures to ever exist because they can take on the abilities of the forms they take. And that they are introduced at such a young age so that they know how to defend themselves, while having childish level fears in general.
