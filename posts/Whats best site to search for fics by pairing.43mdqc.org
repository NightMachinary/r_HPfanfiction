I don't read slash pairings


** If you don't read slash, you won't have much luck with AO3. DLP has a search engine here ([[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net]]) that I've heard good things about for FFN, though I haven't used it myself. Honestly, searching rev lists is normally a pretty good bet.

*** Scryer is really great to use; a lot more flexible than fanfiction.net's default tool.

You could also try [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/tags.php][searching by tag]] over at the library on DLP.

** DLP is a good site to use. [[http://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/]] is another site that sorts by pairing. I found some good fics there but theirs also some bad ones on the site. Had about a months worth of reading material there.

** If you're into Dramione, [[https://dramioneasks.tumblr.com][Dramione Asks]] and [[http://dramioneficindex.tumblr.com][Dramione Fic Index]] are great sources.
