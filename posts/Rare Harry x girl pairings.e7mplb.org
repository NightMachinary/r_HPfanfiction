What are some rare Harry x girl pairings that you like? Fic recommendations of those pairings are of course very welcome.


** - 1. Katie Bell:

People dismiss her as just a replacement Ginny, but I argue Ginny has drawbacks Katie does not. Namely Ginny comes with the baggage that can be the Weasley family (specifically Ron) being more involved. With Katie you get some separation from that. Additionally shes the odd one out of the Gryffindor chasers, with Angelina and Alicia paired with the twins in canon. Being a year older rather than Ginny's year younger, also sets her up for a "mentor" or "guide" style relationship with regards to Harry. The quidditch elements are obvious. And to top it off, she comes off as just a great all around character with enough substance to give writers some groundwork, but enough freedom to make her their own.

--------------

- 2. Tracy Davis:

Ignoring the obvious interesting element of her being the "friend" of Daphne who is the more common pairing, her being a Half Blood in Slytherin and fighting on Harry's side in the end, indicates she could be an interesting pairing for Harry based upon the little info from canon. She also opens up avenues into Slytherin with regards to Harry Potter for the writer, without going through the more obvious and canon noticable character that is Daphne. I could just see her secretly dating Harry during Hogwarts.

--------------

- 3. Tonks:

Ok I will admit this is not exactly super rare, but its rare enough that I think it qualifies. It would be number 1 for me if it was more rare but I felt it did not deserve that slot since there are a decent number of them around. However, the reason I list it is that while there are some there are simply NOT ENOUGH stories with Harry/Tonks paired up. I absolutely LOVE this pairing and I honestly think they would compliment each other very well. We already know Tonks is not one for worrying about ages in a relationship (Cough/Remus/Cough) and so her paired with Harry would not be remotely shocking. There really needs to be more well done Harry/Tonks stories (just like there need to be more well done Harry/Fleur ones as welll, or even better.. Harry/Fleur/Tonks).

--------------

- 4. Honorable mentions that are less rare or less interesting to me personally, but there needs to be more of them:

Any Harry/OC, Harry/Astoria, Harry/Rose Granger-Weasley, Harry/Lisa Turpin, and Harry/Susan pairings.

--------------

- 5. And just for fun.... A bonus "blank slate" character: Lily Moon.

A dorm mate of Tracy, Daphne, Pansey and Millicent in Slytherin and the one that always gets forgotten. The name alone is interesting within the context of canon, and she would make a good alternative to Daphne (the most common blank slate) as a blank slate slytherin character.

***** Harry is a famous, powerful guy who probably keeps in shape as an auror, isn't actually blood related to her, and has probably treated her like a princess her entire life. That's prime older-man-hero-worship crush material. Yeah it's not gonna be a novel length romance, but this fandom has Harry/Dumbledore smut, a little non-related Uncle/Niece action isn't even close to straining the bounds of believability compared to some pairings that have been written.

***** She might, and here are the reasons why:

1. Hes not blood related
2. Wizards/Witches live (and seem younger) longer and age differences seem like they are less of a thing in the Wizarding world.
3. He keeps in shape as an auror, is famous and powerful, and a good guy.
4. There is likely a fascination to him for her as he was/is best friends to both her parents and Hermione arguably may have harbored feelings to him that "could" have led to a romantic relationship in different circumstances.
5. This is fan fiction... Harry could date the giant squid for all we know.

That last one is the biggest one. I could easily argue there is no way Harry would date Pansy Parkinson, or Narcissa Malfoy, or Voldemort, and yet people create fan fiction where such things become reality. You can CHANGE canon to fit the needs to boot, have characters age or de-age, have them time travel, divorce or marry, change their personality, and so on and so forth. So its silly to say "there is no way". Thats just not how fan fiction works.

Harry fucked off after the war and traveled the world, he and rose meet up in a bar somewhere with no idea who the other was until later.

Story is told by either harry or rose when they have dinner with hermione/ron after being away from england a long time.

**** Good luck. Unfortunately there are precious few. Its partly why I list them. Katie especially should be done more often but again, folks seem to dismiss her as too similar to Ginny even though it does not have to be that way. Ive tried to write some stories myself but I am not great at writing, just good at coming up with ideas lol. Plus I have health concerns that complicate it.

Right now I am personally looking for really good Harry/OC stories to read during my next cancer treatments and I am always on the hunt for Harry/Tonks, Harry/Fleur, or Harry/Fleur/Tonks material.

** ▪︎Harry × Lavender

I can understand why she wasn't Harry's type in canon, and I am kinda impressed that she genuinely had an interest in Ron over Harry. I think a normal girly girl would have done good to kinda ground Harry and help him look past Voldemort and the war for those reasons (Harry × Parvati has the same reasoning in my eyes).

▪︎Harry × Penelope

I have read exactly 2 of these. I don't know why I like the idea so much but I dunno. It'd be an interesting little jab at Percy, she was also petrified so maybe she could want to get closer to the boy who saved the school. And it's a less egregious age difference than Harry × Tonks or Harry × The Black Sisters.

▪︎Harry × Andromeda NOT HARRY × MULTI, but just the two of them, I've never seen one done. Imagine post-war, they've both lost a lot of people and settle down to raise Teddy Lupin together, eventually developing romantic feelings for one another.

▪︎Harry × Marietta

One I haven't seen but, tbf, I've never gone looking for it. She was probably MASSIVELY ostracized after the whole SNEAK incident and I can imagine Harry thinking Hermione went way too far and reaching out to show he'd forgiven her and didn't hold a grudge. Things developing from there.

▪︎Harry × Romilda

She kinda strikes me as a mix between Ginny Weasley and Merope Gaunt. It would be interesting to see Harry actually fall for the Love Potion and see how things developed or Harry trying to teach her NOT to go about love that way. I can imagine Harry kinda trying to be a mento/brotherly figure to the kinda vain girl and the two developing genuine feelings as a result of proximity and genuine interaction.

▪︎Harry × Merope

Not enough of it... the ULTIMATE power move. Additionally, give Harry the opportunity and he would absolutely drag Merope out of the Gaunt household, timelines be damned. She was raised fairly similarly to him, family that didn't love her and left feeling powerless and bitter, they could empathise with each other in a way most in the series couldn't.

▪︎Harry × Padma

Not really THAT rare, but definitely not that popular. Especially as JUST Harry and Padma (and not Harry × Patil Twins). I feel like she'd probably end up written kinda like a more mellow Hermione, someone to turn to for academic help when Harry couldn't/wouldn't go to Hermione. Again, just going from there after that. Perhaps just asking her to the Ball instead of Parvati (who probably suits Ron better than Padma) or, in kind of a dick move, deciding to dance with Padma when she was bored and finding he prefers her company to her sisters.

▪︎Harry × Myrtle

The FEW times I see it it is in a crackfic (and I have only ever read one fic where it was taken seriously). To 'make it work' you could lean into MoD shenanigans or just make up some reason that allows Harry to interact with ghosts or bring her to life. She's very clearly interested and I can imagine Myrtle just wanting to make Harry blush and cooing over how cute he is.

** I like Harry/ Fleur. There are lots of fics with that pairing, but I seem to be getting more picky with time. Most are unfinished, some are only smut, etc. In one I tried recently the Dursleys took Harry with them on vacation to France (they were scared of Sirius) and Harry met Fleur and they were talking about the L-word within 24 hours. Like, damn, slow down a bit. So I'm not completely negative, here's one of the Harry/ Fleur fic I like. She really helps him and comforts him in this one and their relationship takes at least some time to grow.
