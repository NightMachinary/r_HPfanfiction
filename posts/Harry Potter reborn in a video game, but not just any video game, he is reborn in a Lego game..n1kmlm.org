** When Harry woke up one morning, the first thing he noticed was that he felt a bit stiff. The second was that he was back in the cupboard under the stairs, which he was certain he hadn't seen in decades. As no one could have a lifelong friendship with Hermione Granger without absorbing a few points of magical theory at least by accident, he felt somewhat confident in guessing that some sort of time travel trickery had taken place. Alternate universe theory was still pending confirmation, though the way everything was oddly shiny did seem to imply it.

A tapping--softer than he remembered from his first childhood--came from the cupboard door just before it swung open. Aunt Petunia stood there, looking rather yellow. She put her hands on her hips and made a weird grunt before pointing at the stove. Harry had been through enough mornings to know he was supposed to flip the bacon.

Walking past Petunia finally confirmed for Harry that he was in an alternate universe. Or, more precisely, when she hit him confirmed it. Try has he might, he could not remember a single time she cuffed his ear only for his head to pop off.

** And at the climax of the story, Voldemort flies all around Hogwarts after escaping the phantom zone and starts transfiguring everyone into fish.
