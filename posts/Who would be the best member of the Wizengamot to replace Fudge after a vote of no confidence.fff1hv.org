I would have went with Amelia Bones or Augusta Longbottom but I am giving them different roles in the Ministry so they can't replace Fudge.


** Very few members of the Wizengamot are even named, but if you don't want Albus Dumbledore, I saw someone use Griselda Marchbanks once. (GW and Tiberius Ogden both resigned from the Wizengamot in protest after Fudge placed Umbridge into Hogwarts as High Inquisitor.)

** Amos Diggory.

He would have a personal motive to fight against Voldemort. Harry would also respect him a more than any of the others. He can also give speeches about how the ministry will never surrender to keep the morale up and not lose hope as he has not lost hope even though his son was the first causality of the war.

***** Alright, either way I'd rather have someone who is cocky and liable to make a bold move before predicting the ramifications of that move. So, I'd probably say someone with experience from the first war, even further if possible, but capable of defending herself/himself well from attacks.

** Here is a suggestion, make a new character. Don't take an already canon character unless it can fit the bill of what you want them to do and still be how they are. We don't know every single Wizengamot character and so creating your own would be a great thing to do. Less predictable. You will then have a character that the reader has no idea about or any preconceived perceptions, and can make them anyway you want. Just an idea but sketch up an idea of a character and use them.

** Albus Dumbledore

Edit: I dont get why I am downvoted, hes part of the Wizengamot and clearly the person most suited to be Minister of Magic.

*** In my opinion, he has too many responsibilities, or had too many. Now I don't know whether or not Dumbledore is dead in this fic, but he has already been offered the position many times and has turned it down. He was already Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump. I don't know how he is portrayed in this fic, but I know a lot of people, including myself, feel that Dumbledore is a manipulative fool, so that could also be a reason.

**** Obviously as Minister of Magic he wouldn't Chief Warlock any more and we dont actually know what a Supreme Mugwump do, but it certainly doesn't occupy much of Dumbledores time. And him turning down the position as Minister has nothing to do with him still being the person most fit for the Job.

Also while CanonDumbledore was to a small degree manipulative he most definitely wasn't a fool, unless you have been exclusively reading shitty fanfics for the past couple year I dont know what could give you that Idea.

***** I don't mean fool in that sense, just how he was so secretive and didn't tell Harry about the horcruxes until the last minute. He was a bit foolish, so I used the word fool in absence of a better word. Also, Supreme Mugwump is the head of the International Confederation of Wizards, just by the way.

That wasn't foolish, that was clearly the smart decision, Voldemort was literally sharing a connection to Harry's mind and soul and Harry was unable to learn Occlumency until after Dumbledore's death. Choosing to only tell Harry after he found out that Voldemort stopped reading Harry's mind was the logical choice.

I know, but we still dont know what duties he personally has, I certainly doubt hes spending hours every day going on about trade regulations.

** Two words: Severus Snape. He would get votes from both the light side with Dumbledore's vote, the death eaters and the parents or former students who want him out of Hogwarts The soonest possible, his oath to Lily would keep him working to protect Harry and provide a good excuse to Voldemort for not immediately handing the government to the DE(at least until Dumbledore's death) and he showed at the seventh book he can keep the illusion of being at Voldemort's side while helping the light, and Voldemort would have to consent on letting him capture and execute some DE so he can keep his position. Also with his background the DMLE would be keeping their eyes on him and trying to find out if he is really working for the light, that would give him the opportunity to “slip” and “accidentally” give the whereabouts of some DE to the aurors.

Alternatively depending of the background Lockhart could possibly be used as a puppet minister for the light.

Don't really like the Idea of naming the head of the DMLE, they could potentially make a better work leading the fight with full support of the ministry and someone competent at the lead them being forced to play politics.
