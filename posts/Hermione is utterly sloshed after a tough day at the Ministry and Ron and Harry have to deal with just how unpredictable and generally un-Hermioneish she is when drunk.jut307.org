Minerva McGonagall waited for the students to arrive for class, truly amused by how what had become her favorite class to teach had come about.

Brought about by the turmoil of the Voldemort war, it had been decided that Hogwarts graduates needed a grounding in ethical behavior. After much discussion between the Ministry, the Board of Governors, and her senior staff, it had been decided that a class must be taught to each cohort every year. It had been decided that rather than marking out time for a new class, which would disrupt the class schedules in place, the new class would be covered in two full-day sessions each year for each cohort.

Minerva had decided to teach the Ethics class herself and hoped that the Heads that followed her would continue to do so.

Finally, the last of the second years had settled in, looking at her expectantly

"Welcome to your second year," she said with a smile. It was odd how much easier it was to smile at her students now that she was the Headmistress rather than the Deputy with a full class load. "If you recall, your summer assignment was to speak to your parents about an event from their lives where they learned a moral lesson."

Minerva paused while a look of dread washed through the room. Some things about being a teacher never lost their joy. She looked over the assembled second years, her eyes settling on James Potter. This young man had taken it upon himself to assume his grandfather's mantle as the premier prankster of Hogwarts. As such during his first year, he had proven himself almost as disruptive as his father, though, Minerva admitted to herself, poor Harry had never been much of a prankster, and he rarely sought out the trouble he found so frequently.

"Mr. Potter," she said, enjoying the look of alarm that crossed his face. "Why don't you start us off?"

Minerva moved to her desk as the boy slouched his way to the front of the room, a roll of parchment clutched in his hand.

"My dad's story happened on March the 15th 1998," the eldest of Harry Potter's children said. Minerva found herself tensing. That date was from the war. Had Harry actually told his son a story of the war he fought? The three of them had always been closed-mouthed about their adventures.

"My dad, My Uncle Ron, and Aunt Hermione were flying on brooms looking for one of You Know Who's prisons," the boy continued. "Everyone knows that Dad and Uncle Ron fly all they can, but what most people don't know is that Aunt Hermione really hates it."

A titter of laughter rippled through the room, causing James to protest, "Hey, she's really smart, and sometimes really scary. She just doesn't like to fly. Anyway, they were flying, and to keep her nerves calm, Aunt Hermione had a flask of whisky, and she was drinking from it, just a little. They knew that one of You Know Who's prisons was in the area and they were trying to find it. Unfortunately, the prison found them first, which they found out when a cutting curse sheered the twigs off of Uncle Ron's broom. Dad managed to catch him before he could fall, but their weight was too much for Dad's old Firebolt, and the two of them ended up augering into the ground."

James paused and looked at his notes. "They hit really hard. Dad broke his wand hand, and Uncle Ron ended up concussed. They were surrounded by twenty Death Eaters, and Dad thought they were both dead. Then Aunt Hermione landed right next to them and threw her empty flask at the leader. Dad said the flask brained him and he went down like a Malfoy in a fair fight."

"Mr. Potter!" Minerva scolded.

"That wasn't me," James protested. "That was an exact quote from Dad."

"Carry on without slurs toward families, no matter how deserved," the Headmistress directed.

"Okay," the boy sighed. "Anyway, Hermione pulled out her wand and started hexing. She put sixteen of the Death Eaters out of the fight before someone managed to hit her with a disarming hex. Then she pulled out a knife and killed two more, only to have the blade break on the ribs of the second. The last Death Eater she killed by choking the life out of him. Dad said it was the single most horrific thing he's ever seen."

Silence filled the classroom for several seconds while the students wondered how much of the story was true and Minerva tried to reconcile the gentle girl she remembered from her classes with the dangerous woman from James' story.

"And what..." Minerva asked once she noticed James was looking at her as if he was asking if he was done, "what moral lesson did your father say he learned from this experience?"

James shrugged before he replied, "To never mess with Aunt Hermione when she's been drinking."

*** Very funny! I'm trying to place March 15th, 1998 in Deathly Hallows, and I think it's the date when the trio was kidnapped and taken to Malfoy Manor? Would this be canon-divergent then?

** I like the idea that she was conceived while her parents were still in med school and only moved to the nice part of London later. When drunk she reverts to her cockney accent. "Danger Granger" then threatens to shiv everyone and goes off about their mums.

** “So um, Roger I would like to apologise once more for Hermione's behaviour...” Harry began, stopping to nervously clear his throat before looking briefly back up at the nearly naked man and his current(equally nude) partner.

“Hermione had a tough day and...well she had a few drinks and got into a bit of a tiff with Ron and, well, she mentioned you tried to ask her out before you left and seemed to suddenly think you were a...better fit now.” The scarred boy awkwardly finished as he nodded to the face down, stupefied Hermione slumped over the shattered remains of Roger's possibly antique coffee table.

“I would secondly like to apologise for failing to restrain Ron, or trying to calm him before he followed her into the floo-I'm sorry their fight escalated into your home.” Harry plowed on, unable to look at said home owner in the face and instead glancing at where Ron was laying sprawled out over a broken (also possibly antique) grandfather clock.

“However, I would like to know-since it started the duel in the first place /why/ when two people, known across Britain as a couple, stumbled into your living room arguing, neither clearly in their right state of mind while you were...engaged with another women-did you suggest a foursome?”

** Ok so I'm not answering the promt but there exists a Dramione fic that when Hermione gets drunk, she tends to apparate on the spot and go do some PETA level shit like freeing kittens. A small hum is all the warning Ron and Harry usually get before she apparates. In the story, Draco has to learn to deal with this and hijinks ensue.

If anyone knows what I'm talking about, link it! I'm awful at favoriting fics
