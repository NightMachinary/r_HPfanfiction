I think I am around 100,000 words into this arc (ch 35) and it is finally about to end. The story has really slow to a crawl. The story has always been a slow burn; however, I just cannot remember another book where the main character is basically a non factor for so long.

It seems Harry is about to awaken his fifth elemental power, but I think that the same story arc could be accomplished in maybe half the word count max. Does anyone else share these feelings?


** The entire story goes on for too damn long.

Overall I am enjoying the story but there definitely is a couple of flaws with it. I am only around 500,000 word into it at this point so what I am about to say may change. The biggest pro by far is just how “coherent” it is. It is very obvious that the author has put a lot of thought into outline before writing. A lot of things mention in previous chapters either foreshadows or has a direct effect on future events. This is something I do no personally see in many fanfcition. He is also a competent technical writer. You will not see a lot of grammar mistakes in this one. Finally the story so far has been pretty good.

I have four major complain about the story though. First is how lengthy the story is. I have read Game of Thrones, Name of the Wind, and I am currently working The Way of Kings. So I am familiar with long works of fiction, but the story is really dragging along on this one. This is especially true in the imprisonment arc. I honestly do not know what the guy is thinking when he wrote the main character out of the story for about 100,000 words. Before the story is slow but at least it is still progressing. During this arc the story is basically stopped for what is a small novel worth of reading. The author (in my opinion) also has a horrible habit of doing recaps for other character who was not in the scene. These are not last time in DBZ style recaps either. They are very detailed and other than a little bit of commentary from the character being expounded upon there is very little new information. I have actually started to just skip these exposition, and if I miss anything (almost never) important I will just go back and read it for real this time.

The second thing I dislike about this story is the way he handled Harry and Hermione's relationship. They are kept apart based on misunderstandings so big, it will put early 2000's romantic comedies to shame. Hermione realize from day one that Harry has misunderstood her but does absolutely nothing about it. She also seems to oscillate from wanting to be Harry's best friend to wanting to jump his bone at will. Not matter what the misunderstanding just keeps growing; despite the fact that Hermione always seem to realize there has been another misunderstanding right after it happens. Harry for his part seems to always seem to have selective amnesia whenever they might have a chance of getting together. In one scene Harry over heard her parent saying how Hermione told them he misunderstood what she said and that she love him, but that is never revisited again. In another, Harry realize how Hermione has feeling for him, but two days later when he is talking to Dumbledore, he goes back to talking about how much Hermione hates him.

Third, Harry has the biggest case of survivor's remorse I have ever seen, and this stays with him for the entire length that I have read. From the very first Sirius name is mention, to where I currently at in the story Harry's reaction to the death or injury of anyone around him does not change on bit. I do not care if all the deaths drives him crazy. After half a million words there should be some character growth. Once again I started to skip ahead whenever Harry goes on one of his episodes. I can only read so much of the same thing before getting fatigue.

Finally, I dislike how the characters interact with Dumbledore. Just about every person who ever talks to him hate how he keeps information to himself, but then does exactly what he says. This cycle repeats itself time after time, especially with Harry and Hermione. They constantly complain about how the headmaster keeps secrets from them. Sometimes Harry will even decide to tell Hermione everything and stand up to Dumbledore. Just to have him do exactly what the headmaster wants him to do and fail to tell Hermione all his secrets. They both yell at Dumbledore from time to time, but when push comes to shove they always go back to doing exactly what he wants them to do.

**** I got around 700K in before giving up. The only plot point that stuck with me was the bit where Hermione starts ALL CAPS SCREAMING at Harry because of the Black family's past involvement with the African slave trade. Because as the current head of the Black family (of course), he should be able to do something about that...

It felt like boring author tract.

** I came upon this when I first discovered fanfiction. It was my second or third story, I believe. You know, that was the phase when I'd read any fic with no qualms about quality or tropes, since ff was a new thing to me. You can't imagine the bad fics I would easily and happily wade through with no problem... Yet, I had to give up on this one eventually. Just as you said: Too. Slow. Paced. Writing style in general is decent, but fuck if it isn't slow-going.

Not my cup of tea, bit still props to the author for having the patience to finish something this long.

** Did he ever finish the story on FFN? I could have sworn he had the entire thing posted somewhere (ficwad maybe?) but only posted a new chapter on FFN every 6 months or so.
