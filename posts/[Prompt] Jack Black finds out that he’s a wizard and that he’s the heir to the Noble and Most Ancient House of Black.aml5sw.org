He goes to Hogwarts as a middle-aged man and becomes a big target for ridicule. He wants to go back to the muggle world but Professor McGonagall forbids him to leave because his celebrity status back home would only expose the entire wizarding world.

For this reason, he turns to the dark arts and eventually becomes the new Dark Lord. He adopts the moniker, Jablinski, although everyone learns to become afraid to say it. He forms the army of Jablins Jables, and they grow bigger and stronger everyday!

That is, until a prophecy is made...


** He calls himself a dark lord but never really does any dark lord stuff.

He just sits around on his chair and does wacky dark magic

*** This demon wears robes that can't really be described, has a long white beard and asks Jack Black and Neville Longbottom (aka Kyle Gass to muggles) to sing the best song in the world.

when done Dumbledore goes all teary eyed and goes

  “Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here!”
#+end_quote

Thus Dumbledore ends up accepting Tenacious D's leaving from Hogwarts... Ministry Oblivated them both, snapped their wands, bound their magic... and their subconscious equated Magic with the Devil, Albus as a Demon, and Hogwarts as a Crossroad in their life... they remember that they sang 'the best song in the world' but can't for the life of them remember it (cause it was magical yo')... but they still remember the feeling of it, thus they made a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lK4cX5xGiQ][Tirbute]]!

The effects of this song still linger on Albus Dumbledore, making him ignore the negative consequences of his actions/inaction's... having him accept and push through 'imperious defense'-style excuses/arguments... like 'We really don't want to finish our schooling in magic, we'll learn music instead!'

** Jack Black decides the best course of action is converting the children to Rock n´roll and teaches all his followers the sign of the horns as they play Black Sabbath- because that is how Jack Black is a Dark Lord, by bringing Heavy Metal to Hogwarts!

*** Love it! Him teaching the kids about rock music was the first thing that came into my mind, beat me to it! :)

If they ever made a movie about Ilvermorny in the USA, I would want him in the cast. Love Jack. <3
