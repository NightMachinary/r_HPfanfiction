** It made writing a hobby of mine and made it considerably cheaper to find new reading material.

It also made me drop more published books because I am more aware of bad writing than I was before.

*** It definitely made me aware of a lot of rookie mistakes in bad fic, only to see it repeated in subtler ways in published novels. Even if the said novels weren't /bad/, per se, that's still 17.99 down the drain for a new book. I think there's a mainstream perception that fanfic is all porn and bad writing, but a lot of fanfic writers clearly love what they're creating and some even enjoy having a dialogue that helps them improve upon their craft and there's also something exciting about seeing that"new update" notification on a WIP fic.

**** Yeah, I bought my dad a crime novel about a chef doing "hobby investigations" because he thinks it was murder and not a hunting accident. He liked it and told me to read it as well. I dropped it 60 pages in because the protagonist always got "so angry" (various German idioms) again and again. Just reminded me of every bad IndyHarry and the whole "I will not be controlled" rants.

I spend +half+ way more than half my time writing fanfiction instead of regular fiction.

I have more confidence as a writer now that a few hundred people have liked my stories. This is accompanied by crippling self-doubt, because that means a few hundred people will be /reading/ what I write, and it has to be good, and I don't know if I can pull it off aaaaaaaaaaah.

** It did get me into writing quite seriously. It remains to be seen if that's a good thing or not because it has sometimes knocked my confidence in my own ability.

But I'm attempting to write a novel, and I've joined several creative writing groups and made some good friends. So there is no doubt that it has changed my life in that respect.

** It's ruined my life, I am so addicted to HP fanfic that I am reading almost 8 hours a day, sometimes more. My eyes are almost always staring at a bright screen and I sometimes even skip sleeping to read fanfic and forget to eat meals. I also cannot read any new books because I end up comparing it to HP and that ruins it for me. What's worse is it's not like I read particularly good fanfiction either, it's all cliche wish fulfilment fics...

I suppose the one good thing I have gained from reading HP fanfic is a better vocabulary for some reason.

** I don't know that it's actually /changed/ my life, but it's certainly enhanced it. Reading and writing HP fan fiction when the books were still coming out introduced me to a great group of people, several of which became lasting friends. When the Goblet of Fire movie came out, a bunch of us got together to wait on the sidelines of the premier in NYC. That was my first trip to NYC and I've been back to visit my friends there several times. Through sheer chance the beta I hooked up with in 2005 happened to be a local person and we've become pretty good friends.

It's introduced me to writing as a hobby and I've found I'm pretty good at it and it's fun and relatively cheap with a very low bar to entry. I don't have any ambitions to become a Serious Published Author because frankly, that's too much work and I already have a job. I would say that writing HP fan fiction has increased my confidence in myself and my skills.

** There have been two big changes to my life. 1) I've gotten so used to reading on a computer/my phone that I no longer read paper books anymore. Even when I'm not reading fanfiction I still read on a device instead of paper. 2) I'm pretty sure all this reading on devices has increased the strain on my eyes and has resulted in the need for glasses. Worth it!

** I first caught on to HPFF after the long wait was finally over and OotP came out. After reading through that a dozen or so times over the summer, I simply wanted more. I don't remember what exactly I was looking for when I found it; could have been through fan site speculation, could have been looking for more stories, could have been 10 year old [[/u/heff17]] looking for his first smut. I really don't know. I can't even remember what my first stories were. Hell, one of my first bookmarked stories on my ffnet account is a meta story about tropes, so it clearly goes past that. But for whatever reason it was, I found them and I was enamored.

Those stories helped get me through adolescence. I had a rough time of it there for awhile, and being able to come home and disappear into the latest story helped me more than I could even begin to describe. Hell, even my first girlfriend and I bonded through our love for fanfiction; though she read Voldemort/Harry and I was and continue to be a Harmonian.

Basically, I can't give enough credit to the hundreds of stories fanfiction has given me over the years. It gets harder and harder to find quality or quantity the farther we get from DH's initial release, but I still look because a good story still gives me the same sort of escapism I got when I was 12.

** It's both good and bad. It got me addicted way too much that it interferes with me enjoying other books and stories outside of HP. It also t interferes with my day to day activities (I found a solution though with a text-to-speech android app, now I just listen to fics while doing chores and work). But the greatest thing that HP fanfiction did for me was it pulled me out of depression. I still get depressed from time to time, but reading HP fanfics distracts me when I fall into those moments of hopelessness.

** It was through HP fanfic that I learned that people would post all kinds of shit online -- not just uncomfortable 'kinky' stuff, but also borderline illegal content. It was a bit of a shock -- I was so young and naive I'd get nightmares just from glancing at paintings of Jesus on the cross. Now I often found myself thinking "I've read worse on a HP fanfic" whenever my friends mentioned some sick so-and-so content that would haunt them for days.

** It got me in shape.

See, I got disgusted with wasting my free time mindlessly consuming media, so I made a list of more productive things to do. My goal was writing 1,000 words of fanfiction a day, but sometimes I didn't feel like it at all, so I added alternatives like working out or updating my website. Having a choice somehow made it less daunting.

It kind of... backfired. I'm working out regularly now, but still only write sporadically.
