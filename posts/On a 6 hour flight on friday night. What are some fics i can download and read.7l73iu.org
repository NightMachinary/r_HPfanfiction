** I'd recommend the Pureblood Pretense series. Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), Linkffn(The Serpentine Subterfuge), Linkffn(The Ambiguous Artifice), and Linkffn(The Futile Facade).

I read the entire series non-stop during a period where I wasn't working and it still took me close to a week I think. Excellent writing and great worldbuilding. Also probably the best depiction of Potions as a form of magic that I've read in any fic.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
