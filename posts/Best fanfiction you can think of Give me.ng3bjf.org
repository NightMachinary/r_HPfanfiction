Yes, that's right I would like the best fanfiction you can think of without slash, but instead m/f pairing. I'd like it if it could be completed or if not, then a novel length one. I hope it goes from year 1-7. Thank you and please give me suggestions for my preferences.


** In terms if novel length ones that are completed then I would go with the Promises Unbroken, Promises Remembered and Promises Honoured (think those were the names) trilogy. But they are more centered around Sirius Black.

**** Not to be that guy but then you should reword your request as more specific to what you want. Saying "tell me what's the best fanfic you can think of" and then shitting on people's responses is not very nice. The best fanfic I can think of in my opinion doesn't have Harry as a main character for example.

  "Albus Dumbledore discovered Minerva in tears in her classroom late one evening, after she found out about the marriage of Dougal McGregor to another woman. She confessed the whole story to him, and Albus Dumbledore offered both comfort and wisdom, telling Minerva some of his own family history, previously unknown to her. The confidences exchanged that night between two intensely private and reserved characters were to form the basis of a lasting mutual esteem and friendship," says JKR. This is a development---actually, four possibilities, one per chapter, of how it could have looked, sounded, felt like to a younger Minerva McGonagall and a less ancient Albus Dumbledore. This story was featured on The Petulant Poetess for october-november 2013.
