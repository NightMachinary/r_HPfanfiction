What does one do with the ability to converse with various forms of postage and packages?


** No a Parcelmouth is someone with the ability communicate with post-owls, post-officers, and the rare and elusive post-owl officer.

*** Ok this needs to be a Fan Fiction....

Harry Potter introduced to Hedwig, learns the ins and outs of the post owl delivery system, starts his own post owl delivery company, promotes Hedwig to Head Post-Owl, defeats Voldemort with a thousand paper cuts inspired by his memories of getting barraged by letters from Hogwarts at the Dursleys way back when.

*** Having Harry have owl-speech instead of snake-speech could be excellent though. I mean, most of the birds in canon have pretty distinct personalities already.

**** just post-owls and post-officers regardless of their native language. unless of course it really is just post-officers and post-owls are simply an extension of that so if someone decided to use a post-iguana he might be able to speak to the iguana but nobody uses post-iguanas at least not that we're allowed to know because of the telepathic iguana conspiracy at hogwarts so there's no way to test for that.

regular owls? nothing.

****** That would be some funny yet horrifying backstory. Owl animagus form is a magical disease. Nobody knows why but if your animagus form is an owl it's basically accepted that you're going to turn into a post owl one day and not turn back. Like the strongest drug ever made and nobody understands the feeling but only owl-form animagus get that feeling.

** This reminds me that I once considered a semi-parody idea where Nicholas Flamel was really Santa Claus. It explains the "St Nick" origin, unlimited gold allows him to buy all the needed presents, and his Christmas elves are a large number of House-Elves in his employ, whose popping abilities allow for the deliveries to all children in the world. The reindeer-pulled carriage is a clever loophole to the legislation against magic carpets, because at poor Flamel's age, a broom is much too uncomfortable.

*** There is a fic like that. I don't remember the name, but maybe someone else will. It spanned most of their life, they could not have child and ended up adopting an orphan, maybe more than one. They helped plague victims, I think magical people were becoming infected too, but were too arrogant thinking it would only infect the muggles. The house elves made small wooden toys for Nick to deliver with an orange.

Edit: This is driving me nuts, I'll be searching for this fic any time it gets slow at work today.

** I like the idea of Saint Nicholas making a cameo in Hogwarts and giving odd sort of gifts to students that help them later in the year. Kind of like Narnia or that one guy in the Magicians who gives them random objects for money.

I imagine Saint Nicholas' wand is Nine Inches, Bendy, Fir with the Nose of a particularly proficient Red-Nosed Reindeer named Fluffy.

THEORY ALERT:

Saint Nicholas is actually Hagrid, think about it, he takes care of Animals, he gives Harry odd gifts that are actually kinda useful. He takes the trees to the great hall.

** This thread reminded me of the Harry Potter and Me documentary I watched some time ago, where in JKRs house in the background there is a [[http://imgur.com/wqcb0d4][package with the image]] of a snake and the words "Parsel Force, rattling good service", written on it. Made me wonder if this is where she got the inspiration for the word "parselmouth".

*** I think it more likely that the package is a piece of HP memorabilia done on the basis of the very same pun suggested by ForumWarrior. The world "parselmouth" was an old folkloric term for someone with a lisp, just like "floo powder" is an old-fashioned word for a certain type of ash.
