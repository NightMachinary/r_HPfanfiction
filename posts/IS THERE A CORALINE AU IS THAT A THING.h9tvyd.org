Coraline is a novel by Neil Gaiman, also a movie. I was being a dumb shit and watching conspiracy theories and now I'm scared shitless but //ANWAYS// can you please tell me if this is a Thing and if not can we somehow make it??


** UMMM if this isn't a thing then I will RIOT!!!

Lol I kid but seriously I absolutely love Coraline, and I would definitely consider writing something in that universe?????

*** IF YOU WRITE IT I shall riot out of joy! (is... Is that a thing?)

Also same, though the movie scarred me as a young child (it's... Its a children's movie) I absolutely love the unique premises of it and also Gaimans other works as well.

**** I read the book when I was like 9 years old, and lemme just say, I think it's about 10x more terrifying, in part due to the amazing (and relentlessly sinister) chapter illustrations. I definitely need to read it again.

The only thing about Coraline that sort of... defies adaptation as a crossover is that it's such a self-contained story, and heavily tied to Coraline herself. The "other world" is in essence a nightmare realm which preys on the weaknesses of children, so I feel like, to write about this, I'd need to come up with some fresh horrors for the characters to experience. ;)

If I did write this, is there anything in particular you'd want to see in it?

***** Well I guess it depends on how you write it. I'd like it to be Harry centric, and take place in Hogwarts Castle (like, during a time when he's ostracised; like CoS, or when Sirius dies) or maybe the Dursleys? Both have an intresting premise tbh. I would like to see the elements of magic to remain. Or maybe the other world could be somewhere Harry went to from time to time as a child and when he was older, to get away from his depressing life, but over the years it gets creepier and creepier... But these are all just random ideas.

Honestly though if you wrote it at all I would literally be in cloud nine☺️ Gaiman is one of my favourite authors and to see his world combined with my literal childhood would be /chefs kiss/
