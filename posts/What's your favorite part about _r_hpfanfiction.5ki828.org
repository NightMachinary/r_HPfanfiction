*** Anymore, the sub needs a dedicated bot to recommend linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) in every thread.

This will save much time and there will be much rejoicing.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

**** Yep. I had that startling realization back in 2014 when Skyhawke died for a month or so, I went back and checked my other bookmarks and links to rec lists. Half the livejournal stuffs are dead, a quarter of it locked (embarrassed authors/authors closing a chapter of their lives). Checkmate (A big Ron/Hermione archive back in the day) is still dead, the site owner MIA. Many medium sized archives closed down only with a volatile and incomplete archive.org cache, Yahoo groups deprecated. Many more stuffs are hosted on private websites, ISP hosting, geocities, angelfire, etc... left forgotten from over a decade ago, long gone/expired. Even my fanfiction bookmark folder are full of stuffs last updated 7-8 years ago, the author disappearing one day and never came back.

Its a bit sad to know that a large chunk of history is permanently gone.

** The calming feeling that despite all the hectic craziness of life I can always come on here and see what's happening in this week's 'Pet Peeve' thread or see my old favourites come up in this week's Harry/Daphne thread. This place is a bastion of regularity in the life's sea of change.

Also the many inspired uses of magical cores in this community.

**** 1. Everything I say about magical cores relates to canon, not fics.

2. Someone doesn't have to be an author to criticise stories, never mind an author of a finished story.

3. I finished Alexandra Potter.

TL;DR lurk more.
