** Or... maybe you could write your own story, accept that it has shortcomings, work diligently to overcome them and grow as an author from the experience?

Nah, who am I kidding?

Go ahead and assemble your "dream team". Believe me, you're going to learn from that experience, too.

*** Lol thanks.

I've actually put a stupid amount of effort into this. I literally have years worth of notes, plot points, character bios, timelines, and research. I've got the first 20k words done, then another 40k in random scenes.

I've been at a standstill for seven months, though. I feel like I'm spending so much time researching and outlining that it's putting me off the story itself. However, I'm determined to finish it.

I keep having to scrap scenes with the aforementioned characters. I just can't seem to get them right. I'm no good at sarcasm. I've probably accumulated hundreds of sarcastic quotes and witty retorts, I've read tons of other fics featuring the characters I'm struggling with, I've perused dozens upon dozens of writing workshops/tips/etc., and I've exhausted every avenue I can think of in regards to this. At this point, I think I'm just going to have to accept the fact that I'm not capable of channeling an asshole persona.

So, I thought this was worth a shot. If I don't find anyone, I'll keep trying, of course. I just don't want to end up getting burnt out on this story and abandoning it. Might as well try reaching out to the community, eh?

**** You just need someone to edit and make suggestions. The likelihood that you're too hard on yourself is high with how much effort you've put into it already. Have you heard of the Facebook group Granger Enchanted Survivors? There are a lot of authors ( MrBenzedrine, Shayalonnie, Kittenshift, Stephalopolis, Colubrina, etc) which are in that group. They often beta for one another and offer advice. You might think of joining. You just need to be 18 with a Facebook. I think they actually have a network of Betas already set up. Just a thought.

***** If you really want to improve fastest join DLP. They have a better array of authors and are much more critical.

***** As silly as this sounds, I am totally fangirling over the idea of joining a group that Colubrina is active in. She's one of my all time favorite fanfiction authors.

I'm going to wait a while before joining so I can collect myself. I highly doubt that obsessive fawning would be productive lol. But thank you so much for the tip! I haven't looked into that group and it sounds promising. You're awesome!

Colubrina's writing is... servicable. DLP, however, has some of the best writers including: joe6991, Swimdraconian, Shezza, R-dude, nuhuh, Surarrin, enembee, Morta's Priest, Steelbadger, SeriousScribble, Newcomb, Nauro, T3t, Silens Cursor, Perspicacity, vlad the inhaler, Taure, Tinn Tam and so much more.

*** However, if you have any suggestions, I'm open to hearing them. Worst case scenario is that you link me to a workshop I've already read.
