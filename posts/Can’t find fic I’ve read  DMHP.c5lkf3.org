:END:
Ok so it's a harry/Draco and side pairings are Neville/Ginny and Seamus/pansy are engaged during it. AU, Harry gets Draco out of the war, he becomes a healer or something in France with children, then returns to the ministry to help the unspeakables with a dark artifact that is putting people in a coma and killing them. At one point , after seamus' bachelor party, Harry tricks Draco into taking vertiserum. Blood based curse, Draco has to temporarily die to fix it.

Help me find it!!
