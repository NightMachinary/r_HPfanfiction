Tired of all the Dumbledore hate, I've read a few stories where Dumbledore knows he makes mistakes and feels bad for them. I want more stories like that. Stories where he's helpful, and good or a grandfatherly type of character.

The main character can be anyone, as long as Dumbledore helps out in the story in some way. (And isn't bashed).

Would also rather not have Weasley bashing, I don't like Dumbledore or Weasley bashing.

Any rating is fine, would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione as a pairing, but if written well I'll allow it.

Would rather the story be completed, but if not then at least a lot of chapters to it.


** Try linkffn(the refiners fire by abraxan) and its sequels. Dumbledore is very much a mentor/grandfather figure throughout and the Weasleys are sympathetic characters. It's not to everyone's tastes (a bit too cloying for me), though it matches your description exactly.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

**** I do have that one in my library. However the one I was looking for was borderline crack. James and Lily were secretly alive with James' OC Brother Tomix (who was secretly Dudley's real dad). Dumbles and McGonagall were James' parents.

No really... It's pure stupidity and insanity. But it's not poorly written and it's quite lengthy. I just can't find it again after my library reset on the mobile app
