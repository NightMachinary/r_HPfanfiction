So I've read a few stories that tend to use the word mundane instead of Muggle or Muggleborn and I'm like isn't that more of a insult for them?

So what do you guys think? Would Mundane be seen as a insult if it was used in the Wizarding World? Or no? Why or why not?


** Mundane is definitely an insult. The first definition of 'mundane' in the Oxford dictionary is:

#+begin_quote
  lacking interest or excitement; dull.
#+end_quote

Now, this might even be true on a general population level: Muggles might be less interesting than Magicals, /however/ it definitely isn't true on an individual level.

Is Nelson Mandela more dull and less exciting than Ministry Clerk #324? Is Usian Bolt less extrodinary than that Hufflepuff we never hear about?

To call people like Albert Einstein, JRR Tolkien, heck - even /myself/ somewhat 'mundane' is simply an insult, because it basically says:

/No matter what you do, 'mundane' person, you will never even be as exciting as the most boring wizard./

And given the examples from canon that is simply an insult.

Muggle however is a 'new word', and while it sounds a bit funny at least it isn't insulting me.

The most boring wizard has /reality-altering superpowers/. It's easy to see how they would see non-magical people as mundane.

Not saying it is right or wrong, just saying I understand it.

*** Conveniently ignoring the second definition: "2. of this earthly world rather than a heavenly or spiritual one."

Mundane meaning dull didn't evolve until the 1850's. Mundane, in this case, is just an antonym of magical.

**** In my understanding, it is about character in-universe phasing out Muggle, so the exact etymology isn't that relevant - but it still is worth looking into.

Either way, a second definition is always heard when saying something, like with donkey / ass. You wouldn't call yourself "The asses", talking unirconically about donkeys and thinking "Yep, no one will notices that you could also see that as arses". Words do have connotations, and "boring" is a definite connotation of "mundane" in modern English, even if it means "of this earthly world".

The next problem is that this implies that magicals might be "heavenly" or have a connection to got, which a lot of Christian people would take offense to. Why is a wizard closer to God than I am?

No matter how you loom at it, it's insulting. If you really want something "less insulting" than Muggle, take "No-Maj" for one example (Although that is also defining a group by a disadvantage and not really PC, yet still less insulting than /mundane/) or better yet: Make up a new word without such problems.

"Sarper" is something that is (as far as I know) meaningless in at least three languages, that one might work for example. But mundane always will always be more insulting that Muggle, in my opinion.

Edit: In general, I dislike that in the current discussion it is often about 'what was literally said' rather than 'what was probably meant' and 'how could this be understood'. Mankind has hundreds of years of experience and history in loading words with more than one meaning, and playing with language, yet we discard that.

The reaoson why you had to write all these text-interpretations in school is because interpreting what a sentence and word can mean in context besides the obvious literal meaning is important in life.

And when we talk about a word like 'mundane' we obviously have to look at multiple contexts. "Mundane plants and animals" is probably fine, but as soon as you start calling individual people mundane it becomes quickly insulting, even if you /meant/ the 2nd definiton.

The first didn't suddenly become invisible, because most of us are able to see more than one meaning of a word at a time.

***** That's actually kind of what I'm trying to say; "mundane" has far more use in pop culture as simply an antonym to magical. It's use to mean boring or dull is almost nonexistent in modern speech, so trying to pin that interpretation of the word in this context seems specious; simultaneously ignoring the words etymology as well as its prevalent modern usage in order to make an argument.

******* Eh, you're not really wrong, it does have something of a connotation along the lines of "boring," but mostly only in the context of being compared to something else. For example, someone might call you "a boring person," but they wouldn't call you "a mundane person." However, they might say you're pretty mundane in comparison to Mr. Exciting over there.

So in this case, when comparing a non-magical person with a magical one, since the magical one is arguably more exciting, it seems fairly reasonable to call the non-magical person "mundane." It's more factual than insulting, and certainly less immediately problematic than using a term like "normal." That said, someone could still reasonably take offense.

** You bring up a good point.

Calling them "normals" is kinda insulting to magicals, especially since muggle culture has historically taken the view that they need to be eradicated because they're not normal.

Calling them mundanes is kinda insulting to magic-less people, as if they're boring and plain.

Muggle, on the other hand, simultaneously implies a deep rift in culture between the two groups and doesn't sound like anything else. It's pretty good I think. When Lucius uses it it's a curse word, when Arthur does it's almost said in reverence, so it's completely in the ears of the belistener.

** Honestly, I think muggle is a better term. Yes, its /etymology/ isn't flattering, but "witch" is a pejorative term in the muggle usage, so I'd say they're about even. At least with "muggles", the original sense is far from obvious, and most people just see it as "the word for non-magical people", not as an insult.

** If I don't use the word muggle I tend to use non magical folks/people just because I feel like that sounds a bit better then calling them mundane. Because yeah, to me at least that just sounds a bit like a insult.

Now of course the authors I've read that uses the word mundane don't seem to mean it as a insult, but that's how I personally would feel it to be.

** I personally find "mundane" to be just as insulting as "muggle" and less stupid than "no-mag". At least, if a muggle overhears a wizard calling them that, they can assume that the wizard finds them boring and leave them alone. If a wizard says "muggle" or "no-mag" around them, I think that it would invite more hostility than "mundane", or worse, questions.

I once toyed with the idea of writing a fic where the word "no-mag" was more of a PC word, used in newspapers and by government officials, and "mundane" was much more widely used.
