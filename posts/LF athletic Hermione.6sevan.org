From the top of my head, I can name two fics where this was the case:

- linkffn(Keogh by ChelleyBean)
- linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5)

Are there any others? Preferably good, preferably long.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spygirl][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]], linkffn(10959290)

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: but so is every girl in that story, including Lavender, Luna, and Pansy.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

******* Though ordained by an agent of the Ordo Hereticus, this Exterminatus has been put on hold due to [rank issues-ordainer] and will need to be verified by the nearest representative of the Administratum carrying a rank equal to or higher than the local Imperial Sector Governor.

Since the nearest representative of sufficient rank is currently located in or near [Holy Terra, Segmentum Solar] and the ordainment in question is in position number [46,768 out of 598,000] in holding queue, you will only have to wait an estimated [1,235 years] for the approval to be issued.

Please do enjoy the following looped audio clip provided, free of charge, by the Officio Musicalis while the ordainment is processed. Remember that listening to it for longer than fifteen minutes is considered a Dangerous Indulgence and, therefore, Heretical. Please also remember that Heresy is considered a crime by Imperial Decree and carries a mandatory minimum sentence of protracted and painful death upon committal.

Thought for the day: The Emperor Protects as long as you serve the Empire. To forsake one is to forsake the other, no exceptions.

  An unexpected connection is found between Hermione and Professor Snape, but that's only the start of her headaches. Being her father's daughter is one thing. Being her mother's daughter is something else entirely.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
