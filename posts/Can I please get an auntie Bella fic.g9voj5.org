All I want in life right now is Harry being visited by Bellatrix, who decided that since Sirius is his godfather she gets to be an auntie. Good!Bellatrix or not, just, I love her character so much.

Dudley has aunt Marge, and Harry has auntie Bella. Maybe they visit at the same time and Marge is extremely conflicted about this seemingly well put together, obviously very well-off woman. Bellatrix will not be outdone by a muggle, and she simply /must/ prove her superiority as a godmother.

She's still absolutely batshit but good clothes and money make up for a lot- and everyone is too terrified to say anything.

  The Dark Lord nudges Regulus's forehead with his foot. "Get up, Black. Bella is trying to teach your son how to cast Unforgiveables."

  "SHE WHAT?!" Regulus bellows.

  Bellatrix has given little Aries her wand and is helping him do the wand movement for Imperio. "When you master this, Papa will have to give you all of the cookies!" Bella cooes.

She doesn't play the largest role but she is present in a fair amount of chapters especially farther into the story. Harry spends a winter break at her house in one chapter and in some instances thinks of her as motherly. It's not dark!harry (I don't think) but is very AU.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

** Try World Changer by Ariel_Riddle. It's a WIP (though it may be moving into abandoned territory. Last update November 2018), and about 144K words. One scene from it.

Sirius was thrusting something into his hands. "A box of treacle tarts from your Aunt Bella. She told me to tell you she retrieved them from that French bakery you're so fond of and put a stasis charm on them. Nothing but the best for her Harry." "Aunt Bella," he tried, the words foreign and bizarre on his tongue.

**** Yes Hermione is the love interest. Well that's always a problem with any time travel story if only one character of the pairing goes back. Sometimes it's handled by the older version being subsumed by the younger version. Eg it's the younger mind and personality that is in control they just have some information on the future.

Which I will admit will change them (usually speeding up their mental/emotional development). The ones that are tougher are the stories where the older version completely replaces the younger which makes things "iffy" all the way to "creepy". Eg an 80 year old mind in the body of a 14 year old boy who is chasing after a truly 14 year old girl.

She then sets out getting all of the Slytherin girls for his Harem. Neville's grandmother Augusta comes in all ticked off that Bellatrix is anywhere near Neville until Bella uses the "secret phrase". Grandbabies, lots and lots of grandbabies. At that point Augusta is all in favor.
