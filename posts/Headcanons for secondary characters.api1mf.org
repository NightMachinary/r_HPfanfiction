I've just rewatched a bunch of youtube videos of Miriam Margolyes on the Graham Norton Show, so now I firmly see Professor Sprout just like that and really want a fic where she is hilarious, eccentric and telling raunchy stories from her past about... erm... [[https://youtu.be/oeopD53J8MM?t=362][supporting]] the MACUSA during the Grindelwald times in the staffroom.

What are your headcanons for secondary characters we don't know much about?

** 1. I have a headcanon that, out of Molly's children, only Percy and Bill completed 7th year. Charlie spent the summer after 5th year with a friend in Romania, and they visited the dragon sanctuary. He came back and attended 6th year for only about 3 months (during which he was Quidditch Captain.) He left right after his 17th birthday, returning to Romania and receiving a number of Howlers from Molly that he just ignored. (And Ginny and Ron just didn't return to school after DH.)

2. Kingsley was put on Sirius' case in GoF. He did suspect that Harry somehow helped him escape and was keeping in touch with him, and he even knew of some Sirius Black sightings around Hogwarts. He was at the school during the final task, planning to speak to Harry after it was over (and using the event as a way to avoid being blocked by Dumbledore.) He believed Voldemort was back because he saw Harry that day in the aftermath of the graveyard.

*** Isn't Kingsley working on Sirius' case canon? Anyway, he is such a great character who is criminally underutilized in fics. Mostly he is just there in the background as an Auror, Order member or later Minister for Magic. I want shipfics! Fics about him leading the resistance after Voldemort took over!

**** Yeah, it's canon that he was on the case in OotP. The headcanon part is when he got put on the case, how close to the truth he was, and him being present at the Triwizard Tournament and believing Voldemort's return primarily because of Harry.

I agree that there's not enough Kingsley. This is a wizard that managed to get some respect from even the Dursleys. He's special. I'd read a time travel/redo fic with him as the lead, Kingsley becoming Harry's mentor post-ootp, or whatever. In fact, thinking about this has just made me want a Kingsley/Lily fic in a world where only James gave his life for Harry.

** Crabbe and Goyle are actually savant druids. They understand magic in a different way than what is taught and can't explain it to the others in Slytherin due to their paranoia that different = bad. As a result they keep silent unless when talked to and speak in a simplified manor, as they are enraptured into the magic in the air surrounding them.

Flitwick started the choir in the hopes of finding another bard (he supplements his charms and dueling with song spells that he's created).

Professor Sinistra is actually a vampire, which is why you don't see her except for her classes or at night. Part of her contract was only taking of animals blood, which is why she was such good friends with Grubbly-Plank and Hagrid.

** I love the idea of a few of the teachers (ie, Snape, McGonagall, et cetera) just meeting up every once in a blue moon and having a night where they put aside their differences and just get pissed together. It's their way of coping with the insanity that is Hogwarts. (This is especially true in fics where all of the students are pranksters, mini-lords, insane or /whatever/, because the teachers in those fics really need some sort of support group.)

​

Outside of that, I think linkffn(Slytherin Career Day) has some of my favourite adaptations of a few of the Slytherin students. /Especially/ Daphne and Blaise. And Pansy. And/---okay,/ they're all brilliant.

** I have a headcanon where Snape, Minerva, Filius and even Pomona end up talking about Dumbledore and the school as a whole.

"Did you hear that Ginny Weasley and Dean Thomas got together? Filius whispered, looking around as though they would suddenly appear in mid air.

"No! I thought that the youngest Weasley would end up with Harry!" Pomona murmured; a hand over her mouth in shock.

Severus scoffed and turned to leaf through his Potions book; to see if there were any particular questions he could ask the younger years, that they wouldn't get, so he could properly scold them.

"I'm sure it's just a matter of time," Minerva joined in, matter of factly.

"I'll give it a year before young Weasley and Harry are together." Pomona said.

"I'd give it 6 months." Filius said.

"You're on! Loser has to buy the best of the best Firewhiskey." Pomona said.

"Deal!" Filius agreed, shaking hands with her.

Just that idea is so funny to me.

** I never really understood Fleur moving to the UK and starting a part-time job at Gringotts. We know from the books that the Advanced Guard took Harry to Grimmauld Place on the 6th of August 1995, and we find out from Fred and George that Bill is helping her "improve her English". It's safe to assume she moved there in July.

​

Okay, why the hell would you move from France to the UK after you participated in a deadly tournament, which was completely staged by a fucking Death Eater, obviously meant to secure the opposing school's win, and which ended in another champion's DEATH and, also, the resurrection of the darkest wizard of all time?? And only mere weeks/days after it happened.. WHAT!!!

​

I've read fics where she did it because she wanted to help, or that she was trying to prove she was brave. I don't buy it. I find something like that sappy and unoriginal.

​

My headcanon is that she did something *bad*, either during her stay at Hogwarts or as soon as she came back home. She had to run away, ashamed, and she decided to go to Britain.

This stupid idea came to me two nights ago, and I started writing a fanfic. Of course, with this kind of thing, you can go in various directions. For example, the bad thing she did was being falsely accused of murder/she actually committed murder/she stole something - ta-dah, here you go, a crime fanfic. I am unfortunately feeling very sentimental lately, so I am writing a romance/mystery story, but oh well, it's an idea.
