Or, how hormones saved the world. Crack, obviously. Bonus points if all the magical races recognize him for what he is, only to be stunned at his behavior.


** Lol I'd read that

”So we have a crazy psychotic destroyer of worlds running around, but we're not doing anything???”

”Well, currently it's not a threa-”

**** And then the wrong one gets thrown in his path. Hermione (H) Luna (L)

H "So let me get this straight, Harry slept with Greengrass."\\
L "Yes?"\\
H "Which caused Malfoy to declare Blood Feud?"\\
L "Yep. Ronald issued one in return."\\
H "And Nott returned one in kind."\\
L "Neville didn't like that, so he threw in his lot too."\\
H "Wait, how many families called in a blood feud?"\\
L "All of them. Poor Slughorn, his collecting habit finally kicked him back. He had to declare Blood Feud on both sides due to all of the deals and agreements he's made. Both sides didn't take that so well, which caused even more Blood Feuds to be called."\\
H "So, that prophecy... It's still going to happen?"\\
L "Oh yes, didn't Trelawney say so? She said your plan would doom us all."\\
H "FU-"\\
L "Do you think if I swore myself to his service, he would let me keep the Snorkacks if we find any?"

** Could be a good comedy fic. Works even if he isn't the ancient god and some surprisingly benevolent cultists just think he is. Showering him in thots and liquor while working to keep threats away to avoid unleashing his supposed mighty power. Could combine it with that cultist Katie premise from a while back with her acting as their agent on the inside to keep an eye on him.
