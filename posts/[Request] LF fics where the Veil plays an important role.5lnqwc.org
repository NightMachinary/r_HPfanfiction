Inspired by the latest update from Blindness, I'm looking for stories in which the Veil is sort of important to the happenings or has an interesting and expanded lore. By that I do NOT mean simply using him as a opportunity to skip worlds or someone falling in and then returning with some hax powers a'la crack or simply overpowered fics.

I mean, surely someone used that thing for a plot about ressurection or summoning or a source of power or....actually, I don't really know. That's why I'm asking whether there is a fic where it's not just used as a convenient device to switch universes.

thanks in advance~


** The veil and bringing Sirius back from it is an important plot point in the first part of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/1/The-Debt-of-Time][The Debt of Time]]. Super long but definitely worth the read if you haven't read it before. linkffn(10772496)

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

  In the days after Sirius falls through the veil, Harry retreats into silence and watches as the scene repeats itself in his mind's eye. He knows that if he can just understand what was said by those whispering voices, that he could rescue his godfather.

** And I actually know of two WIPs that had the Veil not /kill/ Sirius, but deliver him to Death's realm, where he was then given the choice to go back and change things - and I mean 10-15 years back.

Sadly, both of those were on a challenge site and were taken down once the challenge was over. But this spring's challenge is to finish something from a previous try on that site, so I have hopes. I've re-read my copies so many times.

** I just read one on ffnet where Hermione fell through the veil instead of Sirius and would pop in and out of time throughout him growing up. It was good and complete. It may honestly could have been called The Veil. Will try to find a link for you.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
