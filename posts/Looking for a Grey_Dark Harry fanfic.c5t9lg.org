:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I like to keep pdfs/URLs of fanfiction that I have read incase I want to reread them. There was this one fic that I can't seem to find but I remember it was a linked pdf file when I originally found it.

What I remember about it--- Harry was staying in a room in nocturne alley, I think it might have even been a whore house? The story had lots of ritualistic magic and true dark wizards had blue marking on the side of their faces. The general public was unable to see it. There was a wizarding library that could be used to temporarily 'escape' Azkaban but you would be returned to your original destination when exiting the library. You could not stay there permanently because food and water were not allowed and could not be exist in the library. I believe it might have been building toward Draco/Harry but it was a very slow burn. It was a decently long story, at least 50k+ words.

Anyway, if anyone remembers a fic like this, it's name, or where to read it... I'd love to find it!
