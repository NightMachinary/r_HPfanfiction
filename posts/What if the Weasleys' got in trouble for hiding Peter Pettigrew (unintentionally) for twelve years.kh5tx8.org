** There is definitely a question as to whether or not the Weasleys might get in trouble for harboring an unregistered, illegal Animagus, but given that they did not know about this, it's likely that all there would be is an inquiry.

*** Given how long the rat lived, it can be argued that they should have noticed something. It could end up comparable to "don't trust anything where you can't see the brain" or however that was phrased.

****** God knows how that would go as JK never explained it and i agree maybe it would have been fine or time in jail but i only wanted to say that lot of things would be revealed maybe even Dumbeldore would have faced problem as Sirius and Peter did it under his nose Weasleys would hardly be only ones questioned

****** "Millions? Owe? My good man, you've clearly taken leave of your senses. Your imprisonment was legal. The right of habeas corpus was suspended for the duration of the crisis, with all prisoners presumed guilty until proven innocent, and no trial shall be held unless and until requested by the accused. This was part and parcel of the emergency measures enacted for the DMLE, as you should remember. After all, how many did you and James Potter bring in under those same measures?"

One of the things I think a lot of authors and readers forget is that wizarding Britain doesn't exactly follow UK or US legal procedure.

******* It is very reasonable to assume that the magical world has a legal system comparable to early 18th century Britain at the very least. And if you want an earlier standard, a mob of angry purebloods storms the Ministry, puts a few heads on spikes and leaves again (and the prospect of reducing their taxes would appeal to any pureblood, so it would be a good pretence for them).

** I could see that happening in a fic where Peter is caught and Fudge can't find a way to cover it up. The obvious thing to do, if you're a corrupt politician who only cares about his career, is to deflect blame. And who better to take the fall than the family who housed the criminal for 12 years. Malfoy would be all for it, goading Fudge and the Wizengamot on. At the very least, he'd use the opportunity to drag the Weasley name through the mud.

It would make for an interesting twist to the 'SI/time-traveler catches Peter early' trope, where everything usually goes fine.

** After failing to discredit to discredit Arthur Weasley the previous year by giving the Diary to Ginny, Lucius Malfoy calls on the Wizengamot to press charges on Arthur for using Black Magic to keep a national hero (Order of Merlin First Class) trapped and humiliated in his Animagus form for 12 years.

*** If that's works the Weasleys would be in serious trouble. But it's more likely because it in itself would rise serious questions,( like what happened when everyone thought he was killed by Sirius) that it would backfire spectacularly in not only Lucius face but start an avalanche , or at last Domino effect and take several people with it.

** Alternate idea: Voldemort won AU where the Weasleys are elevated to the inner circle for the crucial role they played by providing a safe haven for the servant who returned Voldemort, no questions asked.

** But apparently no one in the ministry new about Pettigrew and the Weasleys. Fudge only caved after seeing Voldemort himself and learning about Sirius' death. So I don't think they could have gotten in any trouble..

I badly need to re-read the books. I start confusing events that happened in the movies and those in the books. Not good.

** A bit ridiculous unless it is common knowledge for everyone to do the animagus reversal spell on each and every animal that is a fixture in and around their home.

Moral outrage of having (hiding) a death eater in the Weasley home, side eyes with questions of whether they meant to hide a death eater and long exposes in the Daily Prophet about "how could this happen?" seems a bit more plausible to me.

Heavy fines for the unlikely event of a death eater that faked their death and hid as a pet to a family that isn't swimming in money is often used in Weasley bashing stories, and I started to regard it as such.
