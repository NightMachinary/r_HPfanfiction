Got a long train journey tomorrow. Need some fan fics to get me through. Please post your favourite H/G fics, preferably novel length, although quality over quantity. I don't mind humour or romance, and would prefer if they kept away from bashing, though again I'll take them if they're good. Thanks very much in advance.

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.
