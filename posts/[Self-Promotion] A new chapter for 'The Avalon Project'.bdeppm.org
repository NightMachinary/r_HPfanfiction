Hi there,

after I took a bit of pause from writing (you know how it is) I have finally finished a new chapter for my first work. Since the crossover is quite rare, I hope to make it a bit more public by posting it here. If it interests you, you'd do me a great favor by letting me know how you liked it.

Thank you for your time :)
