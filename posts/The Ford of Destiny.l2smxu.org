** I'm now picturing an Easter Egg from way back when I played /Hitman: Absolution/. Basically, if you do certain things in a certain desert mission, a random ice-cream truck appears out of nowhere and runs over the target.

** There was a joke or a meme or whatever that went something like "Ford Anglia Potter, you were named after the bravest car I've ever known."

** "Harry Potter, Come to die... /AVADA KEDAVRA!/" Voldemort called out.

"HOOOONK!" A loud squelching sound echoed through the forest.

/Duhdum duhdum/, something meaty squished beneath the tires. The car went into reverse. /Duhdum duhdum/. At that point, even Harry considered it overkill.

/Duhdum duhdum./ “HONK!” The small blue car sped away, leaving Harry surrounded by a crowd of shocked Death Eaters.

“Um, so how about we all go home and call it a day?” Lucius Malfoy rubbed his hands together.

*19 Years Later*

“And that, kids, is how Voldemort was defeated,” Harry said, sitting back on the couch.

“But you were the Chosen One, dad,” his daughter said, looking up with wide green eyes. “Weren't you supposed to be the one to kill him?”

"Ford Anglia Potter, you were named after the bravest car I've ever known." Harry leaned forward. “But you have your mother's penchant for fangirling.”

** In future years, Professor Flitwick will warn his new classes to be careful with their pronunciation; "Never forget Lord Voldemort, who said 'Kadavra' instead of 'Kedavra' and was run over by an automobile."
