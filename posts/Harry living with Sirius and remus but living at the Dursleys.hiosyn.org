So I was thinking that harry has to return to the Dursleys because of the blood wards yes? So why has nobody (if you have I'm sorry I just never found something like this) ever written a story where they live in a "Zweifamilienhaus" a house which is divided in the middle so two families can live in the same house. And then there is one half with the Dursleys and the other with Harry, Sirius and Remus or whoever you want to raise Harry. I would really like to read something like that so please someone write it.


** Houses like that aren't really a thing in England. The closest we have are either old houses that get divided up into flats or what we call semi-detached houses (I think they're technically called 'duplexes' in the States?). The majority of houses in the UK are what are called 'two-up, two-downs' (named because they have two rooms upstairs and two rooms downstairs), so dividing already small houses in two isn't exactly viable in most cases. I'd imagine that's why you haven't seen them before.

The more possible thing in British culture would be moving in next door, which has been done in some fics. Hell, No Competition had an entire street of Dark Creatures move in to be around Harry.

** I think the issue is that the Dursley's would never go for it They could be threatened and forced to go along with it but they wouldn't be willing to do it and I think them willingly having Harry in the house was part of the wards maybe

*** My thought was that they don't actually have to interact with Harry except acknowledge that he lives on the other side of their house

** I read a fic in which Remus and Sirius set up a tent in their back garden, over their objections. It had potential, but didn't have as much entertaining conflict as I would have liked.

** The Dursleys' primary concern is wealth, connections, and reputation. They live in suburbia both geographically and socially -- Petunia is just as much a busybody as her neighbors. If Sirius and Remus lived next door, they'd be fodder for gossip, and for the Dursleys, that /just won't do/. Their reputation means everything to them, to the point where they lie and lie about Harry living there, being mentally disturbed, going to a correctional school, etc. Having full wizards living right next door, and encouraging Harry's "freakish" nature, would be an absolute nightmare for them.
