(Pre note: Found on Fanfiction.net )Like I said, Half-Giant student who is in the same year as Harry. I found it, maybe 2 to 3 years ago, and I can't for the life of me remember the name of it, I've combed through the search queries, asked google, ad gone to my associates who like fanfiction, and I still couldn't find it. I think the pairing was Hermione, if nor, she was a prominent figure Anyone who know it, please assist!
