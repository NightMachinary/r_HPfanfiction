However being the first time they conduct such an operation and not familiar with the Muggle world, they use the movie Donnie Brasco as training material.

Now Voldemort and the Death Eaters are really confused as to why their newest member uses strange words like "gumar", "fazool" and "I'm just busting balls".

** I feel like if they did it properly, they could have implanted Mad Eye Moody into the death eaters, pretending to be Barty Crouch Jr. after Dumbledore and him had read his every thought. Not sure Voldy is blind enough not to realize the difference though.

#+begin_quote
  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
