Looking for a short crackfic on ffnet about Harry's parents.

What I remember: Lily asks Severus to make a potion to get her pregnant. It needs a drop of blood from the father. Severus wants to be a part of harry so he adds a drop of blood. Somehow a whole bunch of other men (Sirius, Pettigrew, Malfoy, other DEs) all put a drop of blood in the potion. So when Harry is born, his birth certificate has all those people in the "Father" column.

Even with these details I still can't find it since google shows sites with my OTP and the ffnet search bot is really flawed.
