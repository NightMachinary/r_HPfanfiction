There was no betrayal, the Fidelius Charm failed without any of them knowing.

The idea to make Peter the Secret Keeper still goes and Sirius, Lily and James thinks Peter is the Secret Keeper.

Eventually Voldemort decides to kill Harry, Canon events fall, causing Sirius to believe Peter fed Voldemort information and run after him.

What happens?


** My thought is, what if the fidelius charm fails if the secret keeper doesnt want to be the secret keeper? Peter wants to help, but he isnt certain he is the right choice.Sirius nags and bugs him until he finally says fine hell do it. . That doubt causes the charm to PARTIALLY fail as Sirius casts it.

Whenever Peter is confident, the spell is strong. Whenever he doubts himself, the spell weakens to the point that it fails entirely after his mother passes. At this point however, Voldemort doesnt care about the potters as he is on the backfoot and searching for them takes manpower.

A successful raid on Diagon Alley gives Voldemort enough confidence in his position to kill the potters, which happens as canon. He discovers their location by following an owl; something that wouldnt have worked if the fidelius worked. As the black feathered owl arrives, James realizes something is wrong and orders Lily to run with Harry. Voldemort attacks, canon happens.

Sirius discovers things because James snapped off a patronus to him for backup just as Voldemort appeared. Sirius picks up Harry, takes him to Hogwarts to be looked at by Pomfrey and then starts hunting down Peter. He finds him drunk as hell in his apartment, crying. Sirius thinks its cuz he sold out the potters, when its because Peter is depressed after the death of his mother, and not being able to see the potters at all as a consequence of the charm. (The secret keeper can visit, but if they are tracked that is them giving up the secret as well). Basically after a brief fight and misunderstanding, sirius screams out that the potters are fucking dead! And Peter collapses. Sirius, knowing he didnt hit with anything that would kill him, rushes him back to hogwarts, since Albus would know what to do.

Albus realizes what happens when the story comes out. And explains that in essence... Sirius and Peter are responsible for this. Peter was coerced into being the secret keeper, something the charm doesnt allow. They forgive each other, but still have some venom for each other due to this splintering. After all, Sirius attacked him first without even allowing Peter to grab his wand, and sirius secretly thinks that Peter is a coward and thats why the charm fell.

The Potter will is read, with Sirius as godfather but, Peter, the most fiscally stable one, granted financial control of the Potter wealth until Harry turns 11. As Sirius is cut off from the black fortune currently, they are forced to rear the boy together essentially, with Remus joining in as the third.

Harry would grow up surrounded by people who love him, but have grown apart from each other, with them only getting along for harry and remus.

** I feel that the meeting between Peter and Sirius in canon was a premeditated setup by Peter. If the charm just fell, then Sirius would just have turned up at Peter's house without warning. Whether he then kills Peter in the heat of the moment, or tries to question him to find out why he supposedly betrayed him is up to your interpretation of Sirius' state of mind at the time. If Peter is killed not in public and without collateral damage, then there is a chance that if/when the aurors find out what Sirius has done, they hear him out first and Peter is posthumously blamed for the betrayal. If Sirius questions Peter first, then I feel that he would eventually believe that Peter was innocent (with his life on the line Peter would probably agree to veritaserum/legilimency, have no dark mark and I doubt Sirius wants to believe that one of his best friends betrayed him, the same reason that Lupin was so quick to believe Sirius' innocence in book 3).

An interesting AU could be Harry being raised by a combination of Remus, Sirius and Peter. Perhaps Peter is the official adopted father, as they agree that he has the most stable home life.

**** I am pretty sure that canonically Sirius was the first on the scene, so from Peter's perspective nothing had happened. Unless as the secret keeper he felt the fidelius fail and knew what that meant then he would still think everything was fine.

Remus is a werewolf. Nothing against him, but the law likely prevents him from adopting Harry.\\

***** An unbreakable vow to not reveal the secret to anyone without permission from James or Lily would do it. If the Fidelius tolerates that kind of interference, it seems like that ought to be standard practice any time someone wants to hide under a Fidelius. And if the Fidelius requires trust to work and such a vow damages the trust, it's a good explanation for it to spontaneously fail.

**** Conically, that wouldn't work. The fidelius needs trust, and an unbreakable vow negates it.

Of course that could be used as the cause of the failure too.

*** There was a one-shot I read where the fidelius fails if the secret is no longer true. While it's difficult to invalidate a secret that you don't know, Voldemort got very, very good at predicting the way Dumbledore wrote secret phrases and imperiusing officials to change street names. After all, the Order of the Phoenix can't be at 12 Grimmauld Place if the address is 12 HahaSuckItDumbledore Way.

I don't know if it was confirmed in Canon, but that's one of the most used excuse about why Hagrid was able to find Harry in PS.

The secret was something along the lines of "the Potter /familly/ is living at this adress", but with James and Lily dead, it's not a familly anymore so the charm failed and everyone could see the house.

**** Keep in mind it was Dumbledore who cast the actual spell -

but making it so Sirius is the caster (because the DEs would be watching Dumbledore's every move) would leave open the idea that, in the end, they messed up.

Of course, Sirius would be /devastated/ when he realized.

** I think either shoddy wandwork, not deliberate but I always imagined Peter wasn't great at subjects that used a wand but subjects like care of magical creatures, early potions (he passed his OWL but sticks to only simple potions that up to 2nd/3rd years can do. He dropped the subject as soon as he could), herbology and surprisingly history of magic (he enjoys it).

If it were to fail I think it would be like how he was trying to apperate or portkey away and was grabbed hold of at the last moment and thus "revealed the secret" (like in Deathly Hallows someone grabbed onto Hermione when they tried to reach Grimmauld Place).

Complete accident but because of some nasty splinching, "conveniently" loosing his left arm up to the elbow. They never found it but it makes it quite ambiguous as to whether he was a Death Eater or not. He would never betray Lily, James or Harry but it drove a wedge of suspicion in the marauders that never quite went away....

Being incapacitated from the fight and Peter could do nothing but watch as James tried to defend both him and Lily but passed out from blood loss/pain before Lily died.

When Peter finally woke up in St Mungos, the funerals had been and gone and Sirius and Remus had disappeared (they cut all contact thinking he betrayed the Potters on purpose).

He spent the next 10 years thinking Harry had also died until the Daily Prophet runs an article about Harry returning to the magical world and starting his first year at Hogwarts (accompanied with a candid photo of Harry doing his shopping with Remus and Sirius.)

Remus and Sirius had decided to live in the muggle world after the events of Halloween. Instead of Mrs Figg living near by it was them, which meant that someone having a closer eye on Harry the Dursleys didnt grow up resenting his presence in their home and became less fearful of magic with their regular use. Mostly because while visiting Harry both he and Dudley would beg the wizards to show them various magic tricks, playing games of chasing the chocolate frogs around the house.

While Aunt Marge still didn't like Harry for some reason, she was under the idea that the 'pet' dog they owned always "intimidated poor Ripper!" (On the plus side Ripper never bothered Harry because of this).

**** No he didn't. He volunteered to but never did. That's why even he didn't know about the switch between Sirius and Peter.

He cast the Fidelius charm on the Order of the Phoenix Headquarters at Grimmauld Place and was secret keeper until he died. After that it became everyone who knew the secret becomes a secret keeper (I think)
