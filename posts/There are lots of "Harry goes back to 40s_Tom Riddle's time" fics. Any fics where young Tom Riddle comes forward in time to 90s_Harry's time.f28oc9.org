*** I wouldnt recommend it. The general idea is interesting but theres horrible character developement and there no real plot to be found anywhere.

And to much smut + (minor) Harry/Draco.

All in all not worth reading.

***** I wouldn't say to just blanket not recommend it, just to be sure of the tastes of the recommendee first. The fic is dark, with dark development for are main characters. It is sexually explicit with a BDSM style relationship between Tom and Hermione as well as a slash relationship between Harry and Draco. The fic makes it very clear that under Tom's influence the main characters aren't good people, but the story is still told from their point of view.

All that being said, it explores some interesting magic, provides interesting (dark) characterizations for a lot of major and minor HP characters, and has decent enough smut if you are looking for that.

It sure as hell needs a few trigger warning though.

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.
