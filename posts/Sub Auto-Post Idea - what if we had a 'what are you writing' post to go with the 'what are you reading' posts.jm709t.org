I'm sure we've all noticed Self-Promotion posts getting downvoted considerably here - that got me thinking about the idea of sticking them all together. This would, I hope, improve the situation with them for everyone. The people who are bothered by Self-Promotions just have to ignore the single auto-post, and the self-promo posts remain more visible for the authors posting them and the redditors who want more new fics in the sub. Personally, I think it might also bring more people to post their new works here, by encouraging them with that visibility (thereby drawing in more readership for their fics) and providing a platform purely for HP Fanfics (if you follow authors on Ao3 or FFNet, it gives you all their works, even in the fandoms you have no interest in).

Wanted to poll the sub to see if anyone actually agreed with me on this or saw any particular issues before I bothered the mods about it. So... thoughts? Comments? Concerns?

The only real issue I can think of would be people spamming the sub with self-promotions every time they update a new chapter, rather than purely new fics being posted, but I'm not sure how we'd deal with that beyond a rule saying "Uh, don't do that."


** I like this idea. I've had a cute little (super) short story in mind for ages, but I haven't written it because I figured it would never see the light of day, since I don't regularly write for this fandom and my pair is not well-loved.

So if I could just say "hey what do you guys think of this?", that would be helpful.

*** This is why tagging ‘rarepair' on ao3 can be helpful because some of us enjoy reading them in particular. You still won't get the numbers that a starry fic will get, but if you're smart about your tagging it can mean that the people who are really going to like your fic will be able to find it

*** That brings up an interesting question, actually. Would you want/expect some sort of feedback in the post itself, or just awareness of the fic itself?

**** Just awareness. I think limited feedback might be acceptable in a thread like that (if authors wanted it), but longer interactions should be moved to private messages so as not to bog down the thread.

*** I hadn't thought of that. Connecting writers and readers in one place like that could be cool. Especially since the "Don't be a dick" rules would moderate some of the more... flame-ey commentary.

*** I have no idea. The closest thing I can think of is just only allowing first-chapter posts, but that seems a little unfair to people who only focus on one work at a time. And the last thing we wanna do is be unfair to writers - we scare them off and we stop getting new content altogether.

EDIT - Oh, just realised that question might've been rhetorical. Woops. :D

** People already spam the sub with chapter updates, so I think a rule banning that would be helpful as it is.

I like the idea, but I hope they don't do contest mode permanently. I participate in HPfanfiction because I value the opinions of others. So while I see the need for contest mode, I'd like for it to be disable after a while so I can gauge the opinions of others. I find the number of replies to be a poor indicator.

*** But that's the problem. The rule alone probably wouldn't be enough. The Mods can't keep track of every story, so what's stopping authors posting a story once, then waiting three months and posting it again?

I'm not overly familiar with the 'meta' of reddit itself - I can only find things saying Contest Mode just hides the karma scores of comments and randomises them. What does the number of comments have to do with it?

**** The number of comments is often used to judge the popularity of a comment or post when scores are hidden for example.

This might be true on other subreddits but I've found that to not hold up in smaller subreddits. On HPfanfiction, for example, I have seen many posts and comments receive hundreds of upvotes with no replies and I've seen many no quality posts and comments with low scores have many replies. So I would rather contest mode be disable to gauge the opinions of my fellow redditors than rely on the inconsistent metric of replies.

I hope this clarifies my thoughts.

***** That does indeed clarify them, thank you. I've not been around reddit enough to see that pattern in action myself, so good to get the 'low down'. :)

It makes sense. We do have a certain dynamic here like that, so you're probably right that ditching contest mode - at least after the initial burst of posting - would probably make for a more gaugeable post.
