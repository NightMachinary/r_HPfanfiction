Inspired by Fidelius useage in /The Sinister Man's/ */Prince of Slytherin/* series: your character and his/her friends decide to fool around with the (in)famous Fidelius Charm. What places and info do they hide, and what shenanigans ensue as a consequence? Here are a few ideas:

*/Argus Filch's companion is frightening and temperamental./* --- ((Can animals be affected by Fidelius? If so, would not knowing this secret make Mrs. Norris, along with everyone else, only /think/ that she is a nice kitty and justify all of her horrid behaviour as something to be perceived as non-detestable? Whether or not it affects her, would making her true nature a Secret mean that nothing she does would put the students off? And would ANY companion of Argus Filch be regarded as such?))

This stems from the idea of arbitrarily creating Secrets involving other people: */Severus Snape is a horrible teacher who hates his students./* --- */Remus Lupin is a werewolf./* --- */Harry Potter is The Boy-Who-Lived./* --- */Harry Potter has imperfect eyesight./* --- */Draco Malfoy is the son of Lucius Malfoy./* --- */Bellatrix LeStrange nee Black is insane./* --- */The Dark Lord abhors Muggleborns./* --- */Sirius Black is a fugitive./* --- */Albus Dumbledore is a brilliant strategist and invents good ideas./* --- */Luna Lovegood and her father Xenophilius perceive creatures that do not exist./* --- */Tom Marvolo Riddle does NOT love salted caramel with All of his heart and Soul./*

Or making Secrets of lies: */Sirius Black is a criminal./* --- */The Dark Lord Voldemort is a Pureblooded Wizard./* --- */Gilderoy Lockhart is competent at Defense./* --- */Moaning Myrtle's Loo is the only loo on Hogwarts' whole first floor./* --- */Cornelius Fudge is a great Minister who should be voted in again./*

Or making a secret of laws: */It is as illegal for minors at Hogwarts to partake of alcoholic beverages as it is for minors from anywhere else./* --- */Werewolves must register their Lycanthropic status with the British Ministry./* --- */Muggleborns must register themselves with the British Ministry./* --- */Animagi must register themselves with the British Ministry./* --- */Delores Umbridge has the authority to make and change rules at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry./*

And what if the person casting the Fidelius Charm accidentally mispronounced part of the secret and created a secret entirely different from what was intended?

What sorts of wacky hijinks can you invent with this OP spell?


** Voldemort has legs.

  Peter Pettigrew doesn't have to turn himself into the authorities. And Sirius Black isn't innocent.

  Any adult who believes in the pureblood agenda doesn't have to donate all of their worldly assets to charity and then hug a mature mandrake with no hearing protection.

Boom! I just neutered Voldemort.

** --"Harry Potter is Weak"-- Instant coinflip, now you've got a OP Harry, or a decently powerful one. Although, does the Fidelius properly fuck with magic? Or is it just the fact that everyone will percieve Harry as powerful?

So you also have a bunch of hijinks to deal with that, Harry casts a simple incendio, and a gout of fiendfyre explodes the entire classroom, Harry casts Wingardium Leviosa and lifts the castle off of the ground. Etc etc.

--"Harry Potter is bad at Instruments"-- Once more, can a Fidelius /make/ you good at something, or will people just percieve you as good?

Another shitload of Hijinks, Ala Harry picking up a accordion and playing the STALKER theme instinctively, etc etc.

--"Albus Dumbledore Can Lie, and can Omit the Truth"-- And there goes everything pre fifth year, most likely destroying the timeline. I can't even go into detail with how much you could fuck with this.

**** So if Harry, who doesn't really know a lot of impressive spells, is no longer perceived as "weak", what does that mean for the actual /skilled/ wizards?

** I think the Fidelius can only protect locations, but this is a neat concept.

A lot of this also hinges on what happens to the secret, and to what lengths the universe goes to keep that secret. For example, could you fidelius the sun? If you could, it would become completely undetectable, and nobody would know what is going on anymore. If its gravity becomes undetectable, does that mean its gravity stops taking effect on the earth? If its light becomes undetectable, does that mean the earth will freeze over? What about light speed, could a being on Alpha Centauri still see the sun's light for four years, despite that secret having been protected for 4 years of "objective time"?
