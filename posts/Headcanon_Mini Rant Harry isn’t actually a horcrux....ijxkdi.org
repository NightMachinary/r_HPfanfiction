Sure, he has a piece of Voldie's soul in his forehead, but that's it. He gets the parseltongue, he gets the boost in magic (if that's your headcanon) and he can see in Voldie's head, but he isn't a tether to life like all the other horcruxes, as there were no rituals performed afterwards.

Or even just the fact that the splinter of soul simply wasn't enough to tether the main soul to life, and it's all the more likely that that tiny piece just merged with Harry's whole soul, and was happy there, unlike with Voldie's fractured, damaged one.

Rant over, please tell me if my random thought process is wrong or I missed something or if I'm misinformed!


** Since we're on headcanons like this, here's mine:

Voldemort didn't give Harry his scar. /Lily/ did, before Voldemort attacked the cottage. The killing curse doesn't normally leave marks or have any connection to lightning, but for some reason it left a lightning bolt shaped scar? Weird. However, that simplified "lightning bolt" also looks like the Futhark rune, Sowilo. In the actual poems, Sowilo is associated with the sun and destruction of ice, and commonly gets assigned protective meanings, including against death. I can't recall if it was explicitly stated that Lily studied Ancient Runes in Hogwarts, but it wouldn't be a stretch to guess that she did. Carving runes into the flesh of children is a little too dark for Dumbledore, though (if he even knew), so the official story was that Voldemort caused the scar (the Nazis coopting the symbol wouldn't help the PR aspect, either). "Marked as his equal?" That came later, during the resurrection ritual.

Anyway, protective rune, powered by "a mother's love/sacrifice," carved directly into the flesh, as a desperate effort to save the child from certain death? Makes a lot of sense to me...

*** I agree with the scar being a Sowilo rune, but disagree with Lily doing any deliberate magic on Harry: The reason her sacrifice had an effect that nobody else's did was because Voldemort genuinely intended to let her live. If somebody's about to be murdered anyway, possibly after rape/torture, sacrificing their life in an act of desperation to shield their child wouldn't have the same mystical weight as the sacrifice of someone who could live for centuries if they just step aside and move to Canada.

** I believe Harry is a Horcruxe. According to canon, a Horcruxe is a fragment of a Wizard's soul that is put into another receptacle in order to maintain him into the physical realm after his passing. If Harry has a fragment of Voldemort's soul on his forehead (which would explain the Parseltongue and the connection), then Harry is a Horcruxe, even if he is an irregular one.

When making an Horcruxe, the 2 main difficulties seem to be the tearing of the soul, and the creation of a suitable receptacle for it. But both of these conditions don't really apply to Harry:

- When Voldemort attacked the Potter, he already split his soul into 6 parts (the main one plus 5 Horcruxes). Such a thing was unthinkable for the wizards before him, and it not impossible that tearing it so much made the soul instable (which would explain why it split when he died).\\
  There is also a theory (that I likes a lot) saying that Voldemort planned to use Harry's death for his final Horcruxe. If it was the case, the necessary rituals would have been done beforehand, and the soul would have been ready to split.
- Concerning the receptacle, there are actually not necessary to create a "suitable one". Contrary to a "normal" soul, a Horcruxe need its receptacle to exist, and destroying the item holding the soul would also kill the soul fragment, so it's common sense to create a "durable" receptacle to put the soul. But nothing forbid an idiot to put his soul into whatever he has on hand, the item would be as durable as he was before (a diary could be teared up, bunrt or just put into water), but it would still contain the soul fragment.\\
  Despite being a Horcruxe, Harry is a pretty normal human, he can be hurt, ill and is submitted to his own mortality. But it doesn't mean he can't be an Horcruxe.

Anyways, my point is that, if Harry has a fragment of Voldemort's soul in him, then he is a Horcruxe. That's litteraly the only condition needed to make a Horcruxe.

** I'm with you. There's no way that Voldemort's soul should be able to latch onto Harry after Lily's sacrifice had just obliterated his body. Quirrel showed quite well what the protection issues capable of.

And given that, as you pointed out, Harry was never made a Horcrux, whatever Voldemort left behind should be easily removable with a scalpel since it was never magically protected.

** I understand the point and always believed that it made a lot of sense than you needed to prepare the recipient. Otherwise, how would the soul fragment latch onto the object? Why would it stay there? I mean, when people die their souls leave their bodies (in this universe. There was never any mention of reincarnation or anything similar.. You die, your soul "goes on".. Or that's what I got from the books) . If souls attach themselves to whatever object was nearby, wouldn't there be random souls in random objects? How would you direct it to the particular object you want as a horcrux?

Souls aren't supposed to exist in objects, so a certain type of magic would be needed to make them stay there. A preparation or some kind of spell/ritual to stick it there forever.

On the other hand, it is possible that a soul piece would try to unite with the whole as it is not meant to be separated. Maybe, after the course rebounded, it tried to piece itself back, but Voldemort's spirit was already gone so it tried the next living thing. Alive humans are normal recipient for a soul, so into Harry it went. But again, souls don't attach themselves to new humans when their original recipient dies... Wouldn't it make more sense to try and join the other pieces? Or maybe simply leave this world and go wherever they are supposed to go after their recipient dies? If soul pieces can't "go on" on their own, then what happened to the other horcruxes after they were destroyed?

So, in the end, I believe Harry should not be a horcrux, nor any sort of tie for voldy to stay alive. JK Rowling doesn't though.. And as it is her world, Harry was a tether to voldy and the baddie couldn't die as long as Harry lived. Maybe part souls do attach themselves to humans nearby and being alone is part of the ritual of making horcruxes. 🤷🤷

** My interpretation of the whole thing is that hunk of soul has none of the rituals/spells/etc a horcrux is supposed to have, so it has no protections.

What does this mean? A simple Accio could remove it. Or Harry had no need to sacrifice himself to remove it, as Tom dying without any /real/ horcruxes left could cause it to fade.

** My scar-related headcanon: Harry's scar didn't come from Voldemort. It came from Vernon in a fit of rage. Which raises many more grim questions, of course. There's a oneshot fanfiction that addresses this idea beautifully, so beautifully in fact, I think I'll be haunted forever. And I can't get that headcanon out of my head after reading JKR's The Casual Vacancy, where there's a casual mention of a young boy locked in a cupboard for 5 days by his psychotic stepfather...

** JKR already came out with the cannonical statement that horcrux must be created intentionally. He is a container for a piece of soul but he is not a horcrux. There is no definitive proof what would've happened if moldyshorts died while Harry still had the soul piece inside him.\\
[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Horcrux]]

As for all this Ritual discussion, you guys are DEFINITIVELY in fandom territory. There is no preparation of the body or object, crazy complex rituals that have to be done before or after. You simply murder, split your soul and place it into an object with a spell, then cast protective spells on said object if you so choose. Rituals are hardly even mentioned in cannon and are almost entirely a fanon field of magic.

Attempting to kill Harry and thus causing his main soul to spontaneously break off an extra piece which latched onto Harry was unintentional and further weakened his main soul.

Voldemort intended to use Harry's death to create a 6th Horcrux. 6 plus his main soul gives him 7 total pieces which is magically the most powerful number. He never realized a piece resided in Harry thus when he made his 6th his soul was actually in 8 parts at that point. Still only 6 horcrux but 8 pieces.

**** So many of us have only read book 7 once but:

“You won't be killing anyone else tonight,” said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other's eyes, green into red. “You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people ---” “But you did not!” “--- I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?”

Dumbledore needed him to think he was sacrificing himself to create a version of what Lily's sacrifice did for Harry. Love was the power Voldie knew not after all.
