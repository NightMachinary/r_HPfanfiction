** I was really interested in this, so I did a search, and it looks like it may have been Ten Kisses by freak.on.a.leash.13, which doesn't appear to exist anymore

what I found appears to be a French translation on fanfic.net [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4422677/1/Ten-Kisses]]

And a version someone split up and transfered to Wattpadd [[http://www.wattpad.com/259223?m=1]]

I hope this helps!
