I'm searching for an HG/SS fic where she becomes a potions master but doesn't actually realize she's being tested for an apprenticeship until the end because all of the NEWT testing is done separately? I remember there being an invisible proctor and her having to brew more than one potion. There may have been a scene in the same fanfic where Snape deliberately mislabeled potions ingredients and made her sort the store room for detention, or that might be another fic entirely! Please help and thank you ðŸ’–

Also I have no idea how Reddit works and I'm on my phone, so I'm sorry if I didn't "flair" right?

Is what you're looking for, probably. The part with the invisible proctor is more towards the end, when they're taking their NEWTS.

I loved it when I read it for the first time but on a re-read I thought it was terrible. For a lot of reasons.

*** Thank you!

Yeah it had some cringey parts for me as well but I remember it mostly fondly ðŸ˜‚
