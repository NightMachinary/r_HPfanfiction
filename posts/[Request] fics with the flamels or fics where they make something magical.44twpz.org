Hello everyone, periodically I make some fanfiction requests that are odd the beaten path (for me) just to get a sense of what's out there. Since I'm at work and can't actually work (computer problems!) I figured I'd make some requests.

1. The flamels. I can only think of one fic in which they even figure, and that was a pretty minor role (loves the fic, though it was unfinished . . . Harry's mirror of erised showed only dark shapes, was the premise, and the flamels owned an island that harry and co stayed on). Does anyone know of one where they play a more prominent role? Harry raised by flamels? Alchemy as a new class at Hogwarts? Harry given the stone by a grateful, dying Nicholas?

2. We see lots of really cool magical items (the cloak, the resurrection stone, the sword of gryffindor, the sorting hat and even the marauder's map) but in cannon we don't see anyone making them except for Hermione's coins in OotP. Anyone know of a fic where we delve into the theory and practice of making really cool magical objects? The only fics I've read that touch on the matter are linkffn(runemaster) and linkffn(arithmancer). This one has a special valence for me; I lost 20$ betting my sister that harry was going to spend book 6 making magical armor to protect him from lord voldemort. :)

Thanks for your time and replies!


** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][/With Strength of Steel Wings/]] (719,300WL) featured the best Nicolas Flamel I've met so far. The underwhelming part is that he was in relatively few chapters and you'd have to reach somewhere the middle of the story to get to those chapters.

- Similarly, while the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][/Resonance trilogy/]] (1,713,423WL; abandoned) did play with some cool ideas for magical gadgets; introduction of things with such capabilities would imply [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic][fridge logic]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsAlwaysDoomed][world-braking.]]

- And, oh, I think [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][/Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council/]] (362,806WL; WiP; HP × Buffy) spotlighted some experimention with magical tech too.

**** That story is written by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1508866/Voice-of-the-Nephilim][/u/Voice of the Nephilim,]] who has at least three well-written stories posted on ff.net ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][/Elizium for the Sleepless Souls,/]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][/The Unforgiving Minute,/]] and /SA/ itself).

/Sitra Ahra/ has some well-developed and depicted characters, among which are Lockhart and upper-year slytherins. This story satisfies your first criteria --- Harry goes to live with the Flamels (who are French). Drawbacks include some reoccurring\reused plot devices and that it's abandoned.
