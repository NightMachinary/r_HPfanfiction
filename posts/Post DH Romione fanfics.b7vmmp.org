I've read Australia; what are some other really good, preferably long, ones?


** I haven't read a lot of Romione fics, but I liked these two fics, written by the same author.

linkffn(To Know You is to Love You by Coyote Laughing Softly) This one's not entirely post DH (most of it takes place during the canon). But it's definitely a good long fic, and what is post DH is really good.

linkffn(A Quiet Mind by Coyote Laughing Softly) This fic is entirely post canon, but it is primarily focused on mental illness and its treatment.

  Calm, rational discussions have never been their strong point. When a pre-wedding fight shows them that they need to get it together, Hermione suggests couples counseling with an innovative new method. Ron reluctantly agrees, and now the two of them are going to learn about each other in a way never before possible.

  The war has affected everyone in different ways and degrees. For Ron, the changes have been subtle, but negative. For nearly two years, he's tried to help those close to him rebuild, letting himself fall through the cracks. Now it's their turn to be there for him. With the help of Hermione, his friends, and family, Ron begins a journey of love, healing, and growth.
