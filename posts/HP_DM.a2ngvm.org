Looking for some juicy Harry/Draco fanfic. I always thought maybe Draco was always so mean because he knew his father would disapprove his feelings for Harry ðŸ’–


** Anything by astolat or faithwood is a good starting point.

** Some of my favorites are:

Tea and no sympathy by who la whoop

Running on air by eleventy

Turn by sara's girl

At your service by faithwood

House proud by astolat

Walking the line by silentauror

He who must not be normal: Lettered

Also agree with the other poster..Faithwood and astolat have a lot of good fics. Sara's girl is also pretty good.
