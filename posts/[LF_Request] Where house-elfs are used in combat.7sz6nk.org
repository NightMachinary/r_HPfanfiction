House elfs are amazing! The amount of magic and ability they seem to have is almost unreal. I'm looking for a fanfic where they take advantage of the house elfs to help defend Hogwarts, help in assassinations, or participate in a war.

Thanks Redditors!

EDIT: I don't think people understand what the downvote button is for...


** Linkffn(2290003) has this though be aware that it is >300K words and is Snape/Hermione. Not sure if that's your thing. The parts with the house eleves and Vector's arithmancy matrix helping the war were my favourite. So even if you skip ahead to those bits I'm sure you'd enjoy them.

  Hermione overhears something she shouldn't concerning Professor Snape and decides that maybe the House-elves aren't the only ones in need of protection.

** It's not even remotely what you're going to be looking for because the fic is essentially abandoned but Laocoon's Children linkao3(987408) (this is the prequel in a way) was planning on using the house elves as essentially this "promised army."

In the notes to where the story was going to go he/she explains how they'd come up with a myth about a tool being able to bring forth an army and Harry goes in search of it to defeat Voldemort. Yadayada. And it ends up being all the house elves at his command. So again kinda. They feature a lot in the written part of the story too. And it's a great story! But yeah...
