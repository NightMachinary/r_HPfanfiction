** I have a suspicion that most of us who aren't from English-speaking countries have picked up enough Americanisms from movies and mass media. Certainly Queen's English isn't the dominant dialect on the internet.

What I'm getting at is that merely filtering American authors probably won't be enough.

If that really bothers you that much, you may want to look for a browser add-on that automatically change words for you (color > colour, mom > mum, etc.).

*** It's not really the grammar and spelling that bothers me, it's the small cultural stuff --- the details that I'm uncertain about, as to whether it's authentically British or not. Like when I read a fic and have to stop and think, "Would Hermione's house really have a basement? With a ping-pong table in it?"

** Oh gosh yes. Whenever I read "mom" in an HP fic, I die a little inside. When I write fanfic, if it's set in America/American English speaking countries, I use mom, but if not, it's gotta be mum. Really small nitpicking I know but it really bothers me. Can't really think of any way to filter them though :( I usually read on anyway since it's such a small thing.

On another note did you know if you're from another country and taking an American exam, spelling something the non-American way (eg. colour or neighbour) will be marked wrong?? How dumb is that?

*** If it helps, apparently 'mom' is used in the Midlands in the UK.

In Australia I have only ever seen 'Mum' and wrongly assumed the UK would be exactly the same. But I have heard it said that 'mom' is sometimes used.

***** I'm just really curious - can you explain how that happened? I'd expect two siblings to use the same term of address, especially if they were raised together.

I'm not trying to be offensive or anything. Like I said, I'm curious. The only difference between me and my brother is that I'll say "Maman" occasionally (he never picked up as much French).

****** We were both born and raised in Germany, but our mother is British. Growing up we just had different teachers, consumed a different amount and kind of media. There was a time where one or both of us went through phases of not speaking English at home but my brother spoke more English when he was younger than I did. His influence cones mostly from our mother, while I picked up English from all kind of places. So basically just different input in our formative years.

when I was about 16/17 I suddenly developed a North yorkshire accent. Only my cousin (who is from Scarborough in North yorkshire ) and I have this accent, the rest of our family has a Birmingham accent or is close to received pronunciation. Before that I sounded German but I still use mom or mommy

**** I think it might depend on the regional accent, and whether they use a softer 'uh' sound or the harder 'oh' when vocalizing it.

******* I find it really interesting that most British people don't seem to know about it (certainly my mother had no idea). It goes to show that communities can still be isolated and probably that the practice is likely dying out.

There's a few unhappy posts on reddit from UK subs about Americanisms before someone from Birmingham corrects them that they have always spelled it like that.

******** It's probably partially that often regional accents aren't phonetically transcribed anyway and that standardized spelling tends to silence such variations except inside the bubble. You said 'Mom', but surely you meant 'Mum'.

If there's one thing to be learnt from looking at those subs somewhere in the UK probably does every single Americanism.

****** In Chinese we have a bazillion dialects which sound similar but not the same to the main one, mandarin. Most mandarin speakers (excl Taiwan) will also write in Simplified Chinese. Cantonese speakers usually write in Traditional, which is more complicated. I guess mandarin speakers are America and Cantonese speakers are Britain? And the other dialects are like Australia, New Zealand, etc

*** By your logic, my stories would be filled with "Germanisms" yet the only one you can find is the superiority of the mainland Kebab over the British one. No one is anal about punctuality or precision, German cars aren't superior, no one uses Krupp armour or Tiger tanks and Austria isn't getting annexed anytime soon (you get the picture, right?).

There are plenty of American authors who can Britpick well enough that you don't notice their colonial roots.

**** For what it's worth it is incredibly easy to tell you're a native German speaker when reading your stories. Generally by sentence structure, the way words are patterned, and the general author “voice.”

It's probably not noticeable for the average reader, but the first time I read one of your stories (without knowing you were German) I immediately noticed it. This may be because I have worked with English speaking Germans extensively, but it is noticeable.
