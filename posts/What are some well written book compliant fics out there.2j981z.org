Any character is fine, but I am not interested in AUs, OOCs, unlikely pairings or unlikely phenomena such as overpowered teenagers, resurrection, time travel, etc.

*** Thank you very much. That's one amazing story. There are some aspects that are not complying with the actual canon (for instance Bellatrix was not at school at the same time as Snape and the Marauders - being born in 1951), but overall it is an excellent piece of writing. Do you happen to know if there is something similar about Tom Riddle?

** See the collected works (77 so far) of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]].

The author only does canon-compatible stories, and they are well worth a look. As it says in his profile, "I appear to be writing several stories. In fact, I'm only writing one."

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078750/1/A-Call-to-Arms][A Call To Arms]] tells the story of what happened at Hogwarts during Year 7 while Harry and the gang were away. It's extremely well written and cannon compliant! It follows first Ginny's POV, then McGonagall's, then does snapshot POVs from pretty much everyone in Dumbledore's Army.

The author who wrote it, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2814689/My-Dear-Professor-McGonagall][My Dear Professor McGonagall]], has a ton of shorter fics too that focus on different characters and for the most part are also cannon compliant!

*** I may get some hate for saying this but in my opinion it's a better approach than Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness. Thanks a lot.

**** I actually have not yet read Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, though it's on my to-read list from being recommended so often. From what people say about it, I figure it's way darker than A Call to Arms, so I am a little hesitant to start up after liking ACTA so much.

***** Yes, it's rather dark and gory because the main theme is the tragedies caused by the war. What is nice about that one is the fact that it offers background stories to several minor characters.

** Arsinoe de Blassenville's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age][The Golden Age]], a continuation fic after /Deathly Hallows/. Well written and canon compliant, it pulls no punches; 97k words, complete.

** It's been some time since I read their stories, but I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] is known for being canon compliant.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]] is almost entirely canon compliant (give or take some artistic license) and follows the later school life of the Marauders' generation.

One of the best, but more of a human interest story than action and adventure.

***** Am I missing something? I was under the impression that canon compliant meant it /didn't/ change anything and that changing something would categorize it as AU. To me, that story you linked to is AU and the author even labels it AU.

******* I don't have a problem with you recommending it, but OP stated that they aren't interested in AU. Obviously, canon can only come from JKR. However, many people are interested in canon compliant stories, which keep the same events and change nothing, but still add to the world. That story has some canon events but is OOC and therefore not what OP is presumably interested in.

********* I'm sure the story you linked is good, but it's not relevant to this thread. Many people enjoy AU. I enjoy AU. But sometimes, I want to read a story that almost makes me think it's straight from the Big Source and when you're craving caramel you don't grab a chocolate. Both good things, but different. I didn't downvote you or report you or whatever, I was just pointing out that it isn't what OP is looking for. I'm sure many people from the thread will check it out regardless so you needn't worry.
