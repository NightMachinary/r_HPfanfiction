So, I decided to include Rookwood in one of my stories, and it got me thinking about how underused he is in HP fanfiction. Given the dozens of divergences written, and the exploration of a few DE characters, I find it odd that Rookwood is not seen in fanfiction with more frequency. At least, I don't remember reading any story in which he had a prominent role.

Rookwood was an Unspeakable. From that, we can assume that he has a lot of knowledge when it comes to magical theory, besides having access to unknown magic. Someone like that would be a good candidate to remain free after Voldemort's downfall - maybe using a spell unknown to the majority of wizards and witches (even to someone like, say, Dumbledore), to stop Karkaroff from reporting him. After that, he could search for ways to bring Voldemort back, if you want to go that route. There are, of course, many other possibilities.

Another underused character is Tracey Davis. Given the amount of Slytherin Harry stories written by everyone and their mother, it's odd that she's not seen more. Two half-bloods in Slytherin could make a good story about friendship. That's something that I want to write about in the future.

(If you know any fics that include these characters in any prominent role, and do not include harems and bashing, please leave the recommendation in the comments).

In your opinion, what are the most underused characters in HP fanfic? They don't need to be basically a blank canvas as is the case of Davis and Rookwood. Anyone goes.

Edit: spelling.

** Hagrid. For a character that appears in a significant way in every HP book, has an interesting backstory, gets up to all sorts of weird shenanigans that like almost no other character does... He literally bought a dragon egg from Voldemort in a bar. He got expelled and does magic anyways. He went to go visit giants and like... do diplomacy with them. He literally went to Azkaban on false charges!! I know Maxime and Sirius did the latter two as well but what I'm trying to say is that Hagrid is so amazing and there's so much storytelling potential with him, as well as a freaking truckload of character development and experiences that could be drawn from in a pov fic. And yet, he's pushed to the side or included as a half-hearted afterthought in almost every fic I've read. Aggghh it frustrates me so much!

*** I'd love to read a fic that explores his first couple years as a gamekeeper, as it'd be interesting to see how Hagrid adjusts with the social stigma of seeing all his peers advance socially/magically, while he tends to the animals. Plus all of his adventures exploring the forest!

** I'm writing a big story about Voldemort's muggle ancestors: his muggle father Tom Riddle, Tom's parents Mary and Thomas, and Tom's ex-girlfriend Cecilia. Ron's great-aunt Tessie will be prominently featured later. I had to add her as a character tag in AO3, since no one had tagged her before. I think I win the “most underused characters” contest.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** Dudley. 805,000 ish stories on FFN. Dudley is listed as a character in less than 2,000 so he isn't featured much. Thats not to say he's not there but he's a device not a character. 0.2% of stories feature a character that features in every book.

Dudley has a lot of potential, especially post Hogwarts. Stories need conflict. Magic vs muggle, Harry vs Dudley, Dudley vs Vernon, Dudley vs his fears. So many options. He's also got room for some serious character growth. If people can pull of the mental gymnastics to somehow redeem Snape then Dudley being a bit of daft cunt while he was a child shouldn't be too hard. You've also got one of my favourite things to explore. The outsider looking in. How does he see Harry? I'm suprised there aren't more stories that follow Dudley trying to accept the magical world, all while the magical world rebuilds. Dudley/Pansy pairing for shits and gigs as they meet in the middle. A pureblood witch who doesn't fit with the new magical world trying to explore the muggle. Both can bond over tales of bullying Harry. There is a lot of room to work in.

*** Well, why not to go all the way to Petunia? I have yet to find a good story of her coming in terms with her horrible treatment of Harry. I mean really coming in terms, not the cheap facepalm “D'oh, to love Harry, not to hate him, that's what I was missing!”. More in terms of repentance and conversion (perhaps even the spiritual one if you are into such things).

The other such person is of course Severus Snape. Similarly horrible person in need of repentance. His death in DH is one of the most useless and stupid events (one famous Czech writer wrote a whole essay on the death of a character, where he suspected that most characters dying is caused by the author uncertainty what to do with the character and trying to get some cheap emotions, than by the character truly needs to die for some intrinsic reasons). And again, a good, and I mean really good, stories of his repentance are almost non-existent. Either they are whitewashing his character (he was a good guy all the way, but he did hide so well he became a boggart to one of his students; because that's how good guys behave) or his repentance is similarly cheap.

Well, the obvious idea is to get these two characters together, but there is nothing truly good.

- linkao3(A magical love affair by charmed92) is too ridiculous to even contemplate,
- Terms of Matrimony by Galad Estel (not available on normal sites, links to recovered ones are found in my [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/terms-of-matrimony.html][review]]) doesn't ever develop a real story, it is mostly just a very good setup.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1078809][Unexpected Universe]] linkao3(14406414;15341085;15383244;15496950;15604848;15953447;16662913;17057291;17340752;17531390) seems like going in the right direction, but it is still only setup as well and it is also very light on the repentance.
- linkao3(The Paths Diverge by Natasja) is a fun (Bellatrix Lestrange killed by a skillet), but it doesn't deal with inner world of characters at all.
- Series of stories about Petunia by mzzbee (linkao3(11676102;12305793;13682133)) are nice, but it seems they are getting to the actual reconciliation only now.
- Perhaps somewhere among hundred-and-fifty (or so) storylines of linkffn(Strong Blood by CooLibrarian) there is also the one of reconciliation, but I am not sure I remember it.
- [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/1963063][The Peculiar Resilience of the Refugee | Harry Potter for Grown-Ups]] by [[https://www.wattpad.com/user/Squibstress][Squibstress]] is interesting, but slightly too Petunia-centric and hopeless.
- linkffn(Trading My Sorrows by ShadowBallad) is probably the best valiant attempt to make a credible Christian conversion story of Severus Snape, but ... well, it is also unfinished.
- linkffn(Sanctuary by Sheankelor) is again one of those Snape-is-really-a-good-guy; here even a Catholic Christian.

  In July 1978, a distraught Petunia Evans and devastated Severus Snape stumble upon each other. The childhood nemesis share some drinks, pour their hearts out to each other in their drunken mindsets and spend a night of passion and comfort together. Albeit they're moving at lightning speed in their relationship and dangers await them, they hope to master everything together.

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

** There's a lot, but to stay concise, I'll just pull two characters who's stories that I think could be explored more.

​

Tonks. Most fics I've read haven't had her use her shape shifting abilities beyond the most minor of things, i.e. ever changing hair color or pig nose. Being able to change appearances at will has got to make for some interesting stories, whether at Hogwarts setting up some kind of prank or in work hunting down dark witches and wizards. I can imagine her getting involved in a bunch of cloak and dagger stuff simply because she's a trained auror who can turn into anybody.

Dean Thomas. He's always at the periphery of things, sleeps in the same dorm as the BWL, muggleborn, artist, DA member, eventual chaser for the House team, goes on the run with other muggleborns and then gets captured, and imprisoned with Luna and Ollivander, just to be rescued by Dobby. Add in that (according to the HP wiki) he's actually a half-blood and JKR originally wanted to give him an arc about him discovering who his real father is, and you've got more than a few good ideas for a nifty story.

** A good, complex Slughorn is a rare find. He seems so interesting to me as a true slytherin, but not a remotely malicious one. In his own way, he helps students in unbelievably good ways - recommandations can help someone a lot. He lives for easy win-win scenarios.

And he seems a very good teacher. I think that a hogwarts with him instead of Snape could 'feel' very differently, because of their respective attitudes towards (non) slytherins.

A story with a clever, cunning, brave or even good Pettigrew tends to be a good one too, usually. Compared to Remus and Sirius he is very underused and overlooked - though i suppose it matches him.

** Mad Eye Moody. He's always there in the background, but there are so few fics where he is actually more than a cardboard cutout. The only two that really come to mind are linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind; Basilisk-born) which is honestly a shame.

That said, they both have decent Moody's (although The Well Groomed Mind doesn't really show up with him until close to where it was abandoned. That said Barty Jr. was also quite good).

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

** Orion and Walburga Black in alive form, where they are not being bashed in with a hammer. For all the Sirius fanfics out there, this couple is rarely explored to any significant degree.

** I feel like I really don't see Zacharias Smith much? Unless he's some odd villian, or something.

Which is fair, y'know. I don't think I've ever seen a Pomona Sprout-centric fic, either! Which is a shame. I love Sprout. I think there's a lack of well-written professors, really. They've got a lot of potential though!

Oh. And Aberforth's goat!
