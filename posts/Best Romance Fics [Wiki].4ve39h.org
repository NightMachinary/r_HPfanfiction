  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** Seeking Ginny by Casca

Link: linkffn(Seeking Ginny)

Pairing: Harry / Ginny

Status: Complete

Thoughts About It: In my opinion, the best HPFF romance fic. The climax is outstanding and never fails to bring out strong emotion. Ginny's characterization is pre-HBP, so might seem OOC, but at the time this was written it was pretty standard. Personally, I like this characterization far better than canon post-HBP, and I think she has more depth.

Plenty of OCs which can grow tiresome, but the Harry/Ginny interaction is solid. Very little (maybe zero) action, so if that's your thing you will find this sorely lacking though I suppose that's not necessary for this thread.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

** Behind Blue Eyes

Link: linkffn(2095661)

Pairing: Harry/OC

Status: Completed

Thoughts: This by far my favorite Harry/OC. The author does the genre right by not having them fall in love in the first chapter. It's a slow burn where you get to know the OC intimately and by the end it feels like she was a canon character. It also portrays the characters in a more realistic way than almost any fic. Each characters flaws are thoroughly fleshed out by the end.

** PET PROJECT

linkffn(pet project by caeria)

Hermione Granger / Severus Snape

Complete

A beautiful slow burner (in terms of plot and also of how long it took to complete). Written pre-HBP. Based on the simple premise that Hermione notices Snape catches a lot of flak in life and wondering what she could do to make his life a little easier (not like that, you pervs).

** *Magic Within, Magic Without*

*Pairing:* Ginny/Harry

*Status:* Complete

*Thoughts:* This story has liberal amounts of both fluff and adventure; at heart it is a Coming of Age story for Ginny. The premise is that Harry and Ginny are targeted by Death Eaters (for reasons revealed later). The Order then sends them to live with Ginny's great-great-great-(great) Aunt. Ginny isn't too happy to be stuck in the middle of nowhere with Great Aunt and Harry.

What makes this story is its setting, along with its writing and humor. There's Ginny teaching a Jarvey swear words, an anxiety clock that chimes in with a new worry every hour and beautiful meteor showers at night. The setting is /magical/, reminiscent of the early chapters of Philosopher's Stone when Harry first enters the magical world.

All in all, highly recommended.

** Title: The Fallout

Link: It's not posted on ff.net, only Dramione.org [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1]]

Author: Everythursday or Sage

Pairing: Hermione/Draco

Status: Complete

Description: Hermione learns about growing up through the redemption of Draco Malfoy.

This fic takes place right after book 6 over years as a war rages on. The writing is fantastic and every single character is spot on. The love and romance part isn't a major part at first, but is a slow glorious buildup as these characters grow and change and one of the most realistic romances ive ever read as Draco and Hermione deal with loss, fear, love and redemption together. My favorite aspect of this story is it treats all of the characters like they are human beings and not 2D beings and stereotypes.

Check into it even if you're not a H/Dr fan for thr author's hyper realistic take of war and it's effect on children.

Edit: grammar and added link

** UNFINISHED BUSINESS

Linkffn(unfinished business by Ramos)

Hermione Granger / Severus Snape

Complete

Another gem written pre-HBP. The relationship is quite unique here, due to the fact that Hermione dies in the opening paragraphs of the story. Hermione's ghost returns and haunts the potions classroom, and together Severus and Hermione try to come up with a war-winning plan for the Order. Five out of five broken hearts.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long.
