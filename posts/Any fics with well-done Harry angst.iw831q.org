on god I love fics where my favorite characters get to go through some Shit â„¢. I've recently started reading hp fic for the first time since 2012 and there's a lot to sift through! it's great to have so many options[ especially coming from smaller fanbases that had very little in the fic department :(] and I was wondering if anyone had any recs!

bonus points for:

-either no romance or certain ships! drarry and ron/harry are my two major ships, but if it's good, I'm interested! no romance is also a good option.

-it deals with trauma from the dursleys!

-non-harry pov!

-longer fics! [5k+]

-fics on ao3!

would rather not read:

-any fics that involve snape/anyone or voldemort/anyone. y'all do you but it isn't my thing!

-fics that are mainly smut

I'll take anything, especially if it goes with the likes/dislikes above! and thank y'all so much for the other fic recs on here; I've been browsing for the better part of a full day lmao!

** Since you mentioned you like Drarry and Harry/Ron I'd recommend crossposting to [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]].

Most of the angsty Drarry fics I know have the angst more on Draco's side than Harry's so I hope you're okay with that.

linkao3('Dad says'; Lessons in Grace and Decorum; Ship of Theseus by GallaPlacidia; remember me by hupsoonheng; Stop All the Clocks (This Is the Last Time I'm Leaving Without You) by firethesound; Away Childish Things)

Stop All the Clocks has character death (Draco is dead) and flashes between past and present, so Harry is definitely the one suffering. Away Childish Things deals with Dursley abuse. All the other fics I'd say have the angst mostly or more on Draco's side.

  Eleven-year-old Scorpius starts writing to Harry. Harry starts to fall in love with Draco through his portrayal in his son's letters. Featuring an extremely remorseful Draco living with muggles and working at a second-hand book shop, an isolated Harry, and a Scorpius who's dreading going to Hogwarts because he knows he'll be bullied there.

  In Azkaban, Narcissa Malfoy gives Draco lessons in how to manipulate people into loving him. When Draco is released on the condition that he is bonded to Harry as his prisoner, he finally has a chance to put his newfound skills into practice. Forced bonding, eighth year (eventually), a Draco driven slightly mad by grief, a furious, self-destructive Harry, a whole lot of angst and a proportionate amount of comfort.Inspired by an excellent story called Unexpected Consequences by Lauren3210.

  When Harry gets amnesia and forgets he and Draco were ever married, he refuses treatment to remember. ------Inspired by an EXCELLENT fic by hupsoonheng called Remember Me. You don't need to have read it to understand this, but tbh you should just do yourself a favour and read it anyway.

  On a chilly day in October, Draco kisses Harry goodbye before he goes on yet another dangerous, undercover mission with the Aurors. And then Harry doesn't come back. Only Draco believes that Harry isn't dead, and pours himself into finding his husband despite his friends' pleas to move on and grieve properly. What he finds at the end of that work, though, is not at all what he wanted.

*** Had to give you thumbs up for Stop All the Clocks, and I definitely second that one. I legitimately cried at the end of that fic. I don't know anything about the author, but in my opinion, it really reads like someone who's lost someone (perhaps even in a similar, abrupt fashion). It has tons of angst, but it's also done in a realistic way (I think).

Away Childish Things is also good, well done, but not as heavy on the angst.

**** Stop All the Clocks also introduced me to the poem it's titled after, which is beautiful and heartbreaking. I went in expecting to cry but then I didn't and I was almost disappointed haha. firethesound has a lot of great Drarry fics; All Our Secrets Laid Bare is one of my favourites of all time.
