I was thinking about this in bed, and it's really stuck with me.

Have any of you ever met a 'real life' version of Luna, or anything close to her?

I'm wondering this because I would really love to have someone like Luna as a friend, and the world needs more of her.


** Yes, but he was more like a male Luna. I really didn't get him as a kid, but I grew quite fond of him in my early adult years. He just never really lost his sense of wonder and awe; the kind of guy that doesn't need an alarm in order to wake up to see the sun rising.

He's my favorite person to go hiking with.

*** That's so cool! I would love to be able to go hiking with someone like him; it probably brings a different feeling to the experience.

** My aunt.

And, sorry for everyone who likes Luna, but she's insanely annoying. Thinks angels and auras are all around us, believes in government conspiracy theories (but isn't too worried by them), believes fairies exist, talks in a dreamy hippy voice and wears weird clothes she buys from etsy. She's not dumb, she has a top degree and runs her own business, has written books, etc, she's just weird.

Like that's all... fine, I guess, but it becomes very wearing very quickly and honestly it would be nice just to have a normal conversation with her once in a while. Sometimes I'll put a self-depreciating joke on Facebook, and she'll respond with a huge spiel about the power of womanhood and mother earth and how I should be happy and proud of my feminine spirit. I'm a feminist but jesus christ I'm not a magical being I just don't happen to have a dick.

*** I think a lot of people end up liking Luna because we want to be treated like she is treated by Harry if we are ever perceived as insane.

**** That's what I think too. People identify with her because she's on the outside and is bullied. They want to be like her in the sense that she's embraced her strangeness and flaunts it. But they don't realize that being around a person like her is tiring and that they wouldn't actually love/be best friends with her in real life.

***** I like Luna cause it's a funny character. I think she has to be tweaked, though, to be interesting as one of the main characters in a story. In canon, Luna's funny because you barely see her. She would become annoying if you saw her as much as, say, Hermione.

**** I imagine they admire her liberation. I won't deny that Luna and my Aunt feel liberated, free and no doubt very happy in themselves. We all want that. It's a shame that often this comes with loneliness.

***** One of my Aunts a bit like that, and she really doesn't feel liberated. She's not kind like Luna is. And she isn't clever, as you say your own aunt is.

If we forget the strange beliefs/conspiracy theories, though, and concentrate on the kind but forgetful and imaginative side, then I do know a person like that, that is difficult not to like, or get annoyed to.

** I went to boarding school. There was this girl.She would dance in the hall way (like, a big room between groups, so enough space for dancing), she believed she had been in contact with Spock from Star Trek, she had an eclectic tast in clothes.. She had somewhat of a fairy like aura around her and when I first read about Luna it was her who came into my mind.

I was fascinated by her, I was nice to her. But we weren't friends. Teenagers give onto peer pressure far too easily and, being finally away from a school where I had been bullied and finally having a group of friends I did not want them to leave me because I was actually friends with "the weird girl".

... Last I saw her she was getting medicated for some mental disorder. I guess seriousely thinking she was in contact with Spock was not the only one of her issues.

I hope she is ok today.

** There are enough people like Luna to warrant a psychiatric diagnosis (schizotypical personality disorder). I meet some criteria of this disorder according to a diagnostic interview but not the Luna-like requirements such as seeing auras and bizarre delusions. Actually I find it strange because I have met people who I felt were much more like the disorders description than me, believing in the existence of goblin and fairy like creatures and energy fields and such. Go to a hippy/new age festival and almost everyone there will be like Luna. The people from those events also sometimes post conspiracy like things on facebook.
