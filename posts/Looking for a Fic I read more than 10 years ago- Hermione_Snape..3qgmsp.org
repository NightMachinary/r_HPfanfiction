I don't remember much about it, but it followed Hermione after Hogwarts. It spanned several years. It was complete and very very long. I think at one point Hermione went to Egypt and either dated or worked with Bill Weasley, probably both. She was with Snape and then broke up with him and then they got back together. She was also I think pregnant at one point in the story. Maybe.

This was one of the first fics I ever read back in maybe 2002 or 2003 and it really impressed me with the length and decent writing back then, would anyone have any ideas for finding it?


** OMG I remember this! Same as you though, it was so long ago, I don't have any hope of finding it again.

I think it was a 3 part series. I remember at one point her hair was short and curly.

There was a scene where she was riding on the back of a vespa with Bill.

I don't think I read it on FFn, I remember it having like a yellow or light purple background? But I do think it was a still a story hosting for other stories. Was it maybe Ashwinder?

Edit: I think I found it! At least, this is the one I was thinking of, not sure if it's the same for you?

*** No, it was a different site, I know it had a background color... I was thinking brown but I might be wrong.
