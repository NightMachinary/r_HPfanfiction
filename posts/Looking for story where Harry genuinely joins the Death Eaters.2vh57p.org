Harry genuinely joins the Death Eaters?

And, as a bonus, has a confrontation about this with Lily/James (if alive) or Sirius / Lupin / Dumbledore / any other canon character close to him?

If not, is there a story where Harry is a dark wizard / uses dark magic and has a confrontation about this with any of the above mentioned?

Never came across a story like this. (Though in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5866937/1/Control][Control]] the Harry/Dumbledore conversations are a bit like that, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Poter and the Boy-Who-Lived]] will probably have a conversation about dark magic between Harry and his parents sometime in the future.)

Anyway, any recommendations?


** The problem with Harry joining the death eaters is best summed up by Magneto in "X-men: First class"

  I'd like you to know that I agree with every word you said. We are the future. But, unfortunately, you killed my mother.

See no matter how dark/evil Harry becomes, no matter how much he agrees to pureblood supremacy (despite being a muggle-raised halfblood himself...) He would still never join up with the exact gang that killed his parents.

You can write him as dark, as evil, as corrupted as you want. I just don't see Harry (especially if he is selfish and without morals) join the gang that killed his family and tries to kill him.

*** Yeah, if he goes dark he really has to make his own evil gang or not know what's going on/not be in control of his body.

*** This problem only exists when the fanfic uses the canon premise -- Harry being the BWL, his parents killed by Voldemort. But fanfics exlpore so many different options; Neville BWL fanfics for instance offer the possibility to explore a Death Eater Harry in a more realistic way. So I was not only asking about a BWL Harry who joins Voldemort, but generally about stories where Harry - with his parents alive or dead, killed by Voldemort, Death Eaters or a car accident - genuinely joins Voldemort.

** Lady Khali's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] comes to mind.

#+begin_quote
  On Halloween 1994, Harry learns his mind isn't his own. On Samhain morn, he vows to question everything. Armed with logic and an unlikely ally, Harry makes a last ditch bid to reclaim his life. The goal: survive at all costs. On Hiatus.
#+end_quote

Another is Draco664's Harry/Cho tale written about ten years ago, [[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Betrayal_of_the_Best_Kind/index/][Betrayal of the Best Kind]].

#+begin_quote
  When the world turns against him, leaving only one by his side, Harry finds out that life, love and truth are more complicated than they seem. Danger, suspense, heartbreak and treachery abound.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7806632/1/Born-a-Potter-Raised-a-Black][Born a Potter, Raised a Black]]

I believe Harry joins the Death Eaters in this story. He and his friends definitely do things for Voldemort, but I can't remember if they were marked or not. However, it is heavily AU with Harry being raised by Regulus and his (OC) wife.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10267302/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dark-s-Rise][Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise]]

Also heavily AU. Harry is three years older than in canon and James Potter was a Death Eater who gave the Longbottom's location to Voldemort. (That's said in the first chapter, so I wouldn't call it a spoiler.) Harry is marked by his seventh year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2896398/1/Only-Enemies][Only Enemies]]

Description: In the aftermath of the Final battle a misplaced spell sends HP and Bellatrix to an alternative world. It holds everything each of them have lost to the war and yet they find themselves inexorably drawn back to each other. HPBella done right.

There's some confrontation with Dumbledore about how dark Harry is soon after they reach the alternate world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9276562/1/The-Trial][The Trial]]

Heavy AU, with Harry being 3 years older than canon and his younger brother being the boy-who-lived. It's Harry's trial as the only remaining inner circle Death Eater after Voldemort's death. Although, he joined as a spy for Dumbledore, but only 4 people knew that before the trial. (His parents not being of the 4).

Harry has a confrontation with Sirius about his usage of Dark Magic.

I got the distinct feeling that James was, much like Sirius, innocent of the crime. But unlike Sirius, went insane in Azkaban and started to believe the lie himself.

**** My memory on the early parts of the Dark's Rise may be a little fuzzy because I'd been following the story since the second chapter and haven't yet reread it. However, I do recall Sirius and a Longbottom (Algie?) go after James and James killed the Longbottom and knocked Sirius into a coma or at least to a point where he was put in an enchanted sleep to recover. I don't see how he could have been framed for that. I also think that if James wasn't the secret keeper Sirius and Peter would have known, after all in canon if they didn't suspect Remus as the traitor, he would have known Peter was the real secret keeper.

***** I also don't think he has been framed. In later chapters Rookwood mentions that he knew Harry's father as a Death Eater and that he was a ruthless bastard (or something along those lines...).

*** Only Enemies is great, especially the dynamic between Harry and Bellatrix, thanks for reminding me. I know The Trial and Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise too, but I'll check out the others. Thanks!

** Brigade's stories, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8704528/1/Enveloped-in-the-Darkness][Enveloped in the Darkness]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10191404/1/Embraced-by-the-Darkness][Embraced by the Darkness]]. Those are the only ones I can think of right now that has Voldemort actually calling Harry a Death Eater, but there are a ton of fics where he joins Voldemort. In Brigade's series, he gets a ring, and in Athey's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Descent into Darkness]] he eventually gets a leather cuff with a dark mark burned in that he can hide, though as with most Harry Joins Voldemort stories, he's far more than just a death eater. Still amazing though. Athey wrote a sequel, and someone else continued the sequel, there's a link in the last chapter.

I think I read /one/ fic where Harry had an actual, honest to goodness Dark Mark ((somewhere.... /special/)) but I forgot it

*** Only Enemies - linked above - has a Harry that was a bit insane and pretty dark. He goes to a parallel Universe with Bellatrix and finds himself at odds with the Dumbledore there. It also seems to be abandoned, but worth a read nevertheless. Do you have any recs?
