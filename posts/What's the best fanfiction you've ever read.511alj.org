** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] by nonjon - one of the most hilarious fanfics i've ever read. Everything nonjon has written is comedy gold, coupled with an amazing well thought out storyline. Harry accidentally follows Sirius through the veil years after the defeat of voldemort, only to find another world where his parents are alive. Sounds like a common troupe, but this isn't a common story. Also highly recommend Brown Coat, Green Eyes by nonjon - a HP/Firefly crossover. Basically everything by nonjon.
