So, I think a lot of people have seen those old cop dramas where the screen is black and white and the main character is a narrator? Right?

So my idea is that Harry (present tense) can hear Harry(future tense) like 10 years older or 5 or whatever, but past the DH and end of Voldemort. So for example everything is going well at privet drive then all of a sudden (just for Harry) the world goes grayscale or black and white doesn't matter. Then he hears a voice, he can't tell where its coming from or who it is at that age just yet. The voice says

"This was the day everything change. The day the letters started coming. And the end of the dursleys normal home life." or something like that. It could just follow Canon or he could use the information and it could be an au?

What do you thing, should I try and write this?

You'd probably have to involve one of the characters being punted into another world for it to work. Which could be done really easily considering the Never-Never may connect to every world ever.

** Fun one-shot perhaps, but an extended story based on such a premise would be untenable in the long-term.

Perhaps you'd get a lot of attention for the first few chapters because of the novelty, but I doubt it'd really continue over a full 7 years worth of story, unless there were many other changes to create a truly enticing plot. Of course, then the premise of a narrator would detract from it.

I suggest writing a one-shot covering some important moments over the conflict.

The day goes by, with little hints about what Harry's feeling, and then he goes back to his room, sits down, and looks up and says "You know I can hear you, right?"

Like the Stanley Parable, or the InXile Bard's Tale game. Make it a partnership protagonist thing between the present Harry and the narrator Harry.

I hold to my thoughts, however. Again, it'd be a fun concept but wouldn't really work for a long story. It could work if it was similar to the "Horcrux helps Harry" stories, but then the premise would shift from being a narrator to an actual participant. Besides, why force a lengthy story when it'd be more funny as a one-shot?

***** Oh, that was fun. Thank you for that link. :)

And I definitely wouldn't say to force a long story - pacing is something that switches me off a lot of stories - but something like that would definitely make it more of a possibility, IMO.

Though I admit, seeing stuff like the Stanley Parable and the InXile Bard's Tale game is definitely biasing me here. I love both those games, and the protagonist-narrator relationship is done so well in both. Also saw it work quite well in a Mass Effect fanfic called The Lives and Deaths of Commander Shepard where replaying the game essentially added the personality of the last Commander Shepard character into the new one. Bit long in places - even if I think a longer story might work, length has to have a limit - but the overall plot worked.

But hey, the proof is in the pudding, as I imagine not many people say anymore. If someone writes it, they'll prove one of us right. Each to their own, otherwise. :)
