"How does Potter, an arrogant invalid, orphan\\
Bastard, hellspawn\\
Somehow endorse Sirius Black, his enemy\\
A man he's despised since the year's beginning\\
Just to keep me from winning?\\
I wanna be in the room when it happens\\
The room when it happens\\
The room when it happens\\
You won't keep me from the room when it happens,\\
Not this time..."

Basically the shrieking shack scene from POA *except* it's in the style of obedient servant from Hamilton because why the heck not? I'd be interested to see just how people would alter this to make it work. Also prompt title is kinda crap I know.


** Ahh! My brain sung this before I got to the second part of the clause.
