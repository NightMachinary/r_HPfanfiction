I'm looking for a Drarry fanfic ( it may be a one-shot I honestly can't remember) but I know that Draco tries to use the Imperius curse on Harry but things don't go to plan since Harry can resist the imperius. I read the story before I'm just having the worst luck in finding it again. Help would be greatly appreciated!!
