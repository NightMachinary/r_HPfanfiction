Most important caveat: no Hermione bashing, Harry stays best friends with her, perhaps grows closer too.

​

I'd prefer good writing, and not too much angstyHarry at the very least.

linkffn(Magical Metamorphosis) is a great one. That fic where Harry turns into a girl as a prank for the Tri-wizard tournament is also great.

Edit: I'd much rather fluff if possible, but will accept any. Just warn me if it has unpleasant events.

Edit 2: Harmony is very much accepted if it happens.


** Not only, no Hermione bashing, but just the opposite, femslash, if you are into such things (not overly smutty, although it is definitively above PG-13) linkffn(13285012).

And that pranking the Tournament story is linkffn(13132217).

  Harry has died for the twelfth time and his Reaper is NOT happy about it. Given a chance to go back to fourth year and do things again, Harry jumps at the opportunity. But what's this about being a girl! Don't Fear the Reaper with a twist. Fem!Harry. FemSlash.

**** Slightly, but do not expect from it more than it promises. It is not a serious existential angst-filled drama, but light-hearted fun fluffy thing. I don't expect the author getting the Nobel Prize for Literature anytime soon. But not everybody wants to be Hemingway or Dürrenmatt, and for what the story is the quality of writing is appropriate.

Fair warning: Harry does not get turned into fem!Harry, but he gets launched into a different reality by Death after dying and in that reality, he is /that/ Harry's twin sister Rose with his memories of his previous life intact. Hence the title: Harry sees himself from a different perspective and guides the new reality's Harry accordingly. Angst is there, obviously, considering the premise, but I don't think it's overwhelming. Also, it's 13 chapters in and still being worked on. (None of the info are spoilers so no worries 🙆‍♀️)

I hope I could interest you!

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.

*** Sorry, I couldn't continue once she was placed in Hufflepuff because it means she's going ahead with the plan to not befriend Hermione; something i said was a caveat for me, Harry as a girl being best friends with Hermione.

Your writing style is amazing though and you seem to avoid the common pitfalls of fanfic (Goblins, Lords, etc.) so good luck finishing the story!
