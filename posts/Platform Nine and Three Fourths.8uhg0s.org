I have never used ‘quarter' to describe a fourth of a number, before. I know that they mean the same thing, but I'm curious if it's a regional thing, or...?

Do you say Quarter or Fourth?


** It's situational. In maths I'd say three-fourths, but I'd also say three-quarters of an hour. Maths is about number so you say the numbers; real life uses partitions--we split time into quarters and I'd cut a cake into quarters, but I wouldn't call those partitions "fourths".

But this reminds me of a fic I saw where someone wrote "platform 9 3/4ths" and my brain just completely shut down for a minute.

******* It's totally not. There's no justification for adding an s to math, which is just a shortening of the term mathematics, which is singular.

******** You're both wrong.

Math is an *abbreviation* of mathematics. If using punctuation, you would show it as "math.".

Maths is a *contraction* of mathematics. If using punctuation, you would show it as "math's". Another example is "ma'am".

Neither is incorrect. Linguistically, they are both examples of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(morphology)][clipping]].

******** mathematics is plural. It covers a whole field of various maths. Such as algebra, trigonometry, calculus, physics, engineering. See, if i add one math, such as algebra, and another math, like trigonometry, i get maths. That's simple addition, another form of maths.

********* Mathematics is a mass noun which, while referring to a collection of things, is treated as singular in English.

Example: Cheese is delicious. Mathematics is hard.

There's no reason to add the s. The British are welcome too, but it's not a requirement at all.

*********** No it's not.

Mathematics -> maths

is like abbreviating:

Transgender -> transr

Just because mathematics ends in an s doesn't mean it's abbreviation has to.

Are you an american? Do you call quarters 25 cent pieces?

*** We call them quarters but only when referring to the literal object itself. Because that's its name. If you asked how much money we had we wouldn't say we had a quarter of a dollar. We'd say we have 25 cents.

**** Feel free to divide the platform into a smaller unit, then.

Would be fun if you could (I mean, “platform nine and seventy five bricks”?) but without reaching into things not wholly serious i doubt you can.

I'm not being serious now, though./Seriously/, the point is that when something can be divided into smaller units you generally use those instead of dividing the larger unit into fourths or quarters., so the two cases are hard to compare.
