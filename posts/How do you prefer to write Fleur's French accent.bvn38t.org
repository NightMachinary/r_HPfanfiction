Do you follow JKR's lead and strip any and all H's from the beginning of words when Fleur speaks? Or do you just ignore it and leave it all up to the reader?


** I'd rather write a /realistic/ French accent. The occasional dropped 'H's are actually pretty accurate, though it shouldn't be an absolute rule, but the thing I really wish people would stop doing is having her randomly pepper her English with common French words. It is utterly ridiculous for her to be going, “/Oui/, Harry, I will gladly participate in ze tournament". If a non-native-English-speaker uses words from their mother tongue in their English speech, they aren't going to be "yes" and "no"; it's the /difficult/, unusual words for which they do not recall the translation which will be in French.

Also, it shouldn't just be perfect English with accent and some French words (whichever words those are). If she speaks English badly enough to have a comically thick accent, her syntax shouldn't be perfect either. Her turns of phrase should be just a little awkward, using words in not /quite/ the right meaning.

So the example above would, in anything, be something more like “Yes, Harry, I will participate happily in ze, er, ze /tournoi/."

This is one of my pet peeves. I see it a lot in fanfiction, and I'm pretty sure I've seen it in fiction in general. Things like characters saying "da" and "nyet" to show how very Russian they are.

**** There is quite a lot of truth to this. Though one thing Ieould say is that to me, it does not seem too odd. I was am a nativr English speaker but have been taught french, russian, and arabic at various times and have heard decent amounts of spanish as well. As such, I sometimes use words and phrases from those languages when talking to my parents without it seeming odd. Just little things like yes and no, numbers, etc.

**** I'm Swedish and that is actually what happens when I speak English.

Once I'm speaking it's a standard received pronunciation accent, standard grammar, probably more unusual words than native English speakers, but if I'm asked a question and am not totally focused, or if I'm tired, then I can absolutely start to respond in Swedish.

**** Yeah, I grew up in a Latino neighborhood, I heard "si" and "de nada" mixed in with English all the time. Well, I guess it was basically Spanglish that people speak here, so [[/u/Achille-Talon]] is pretty correct (at least considering Spanish). I get a lot of, "no, /mija,/ no menudo today, check back /mañana/." It's also called "code switching."

I get a lot of "yes" and "no" in Chinese, too, but not much else in that language, probably because it's harder to code switch.

*** I see too often the "me" (like in "pardon me") changed to "moi" (which is "me" in french) but it's plain stupid because it's such a simple word and so close to the English word that there is no way anyone that can follow a discussion in English wouldn't know how to say it.

"*mumble* *quiet chain of all non-emphasized-syllables* *so many S's, Z's, and Wuh's people think she's a parselmouth*," said Fleur.

Hermione frowned while Ron just gaped and said, "Brilliant."

"Er. Right, we'll keep it in mind. Er, thanks," Harry managed, while eyeing Fleur to gauge her reaction. Seemingly satisfied, she made her way back to her classmates. "Tell me you got that, Hermione?"

** Ok authors, if you want to write french, please follow these rules:

You can of course write Fleur's accent, because JK Rowling did it, but please either be weary of the sounds used in the French language to know which words she's actually supposed to know how to prononce. I've already read some fic replacing the S with Z but the thing is we pronounce the S the exact same way in french and english. Either make a point in accuratly depicting a french accent or just don't do it.

Don't just use french words in the middle of a random sentence for no reason, do it if the character forget a word in english or something like that only.

If you want write full sentences in french, like for french characters speaking among themselves, find a french fluent to correct it first, Google translate does not count. You can just refrain from it at all, you should either be translating it in notes or narration anyway.

Everything here is valid for any and all languages I guess.

*** You can also add that use of French words is acceptable when the character is in an emotional state, be it anger, sadness, annoyance . . .

Like Fleur saying "Merci, merci, merci" after Harry saved Gabriel, or her saying "Merde" when something bad just happened to her (when the sleeping dragon ignites her robe for example).

** To complete a little the first answer:\\
It's unfrequent word and false friends that she would have problems with, not common words\\
When it comes to pronunciation, the H will pose problems, as will the TH; then comes words like "throughout", which are far from evident, and the difference between short and long vowels (ship and sheep for example)

But as a native french speaker, I admit I'd rather see a mention of her accent than badly mangled english that has few common points with the way a french teenager would speak english.
