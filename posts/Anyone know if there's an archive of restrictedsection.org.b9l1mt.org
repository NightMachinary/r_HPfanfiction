Trying to find someone the weirder/funnier stuff to prove to my fiancee I wasn't making them up, but the site is defunct. Anyone who used to go there back in the day know if there's an archive of the stories posted there?


** You might try asking over at [[/r/datahoarder][r/datahoarder]]. Someone there may have grabbed it or know where it's at.

**** Search won't work because of the way the site caches backups, it only takes a single snap of the site so searching isn't backed up for a lot of websites.

The only thing I can recommend is using /httpp://[[http://www.restrictedsection.org/story.php][www.restrictedsection.org/story.php]]/ replacing "story" with the name of specific fic to see if there are any backups of it.

That's all I have though :(

** It probably will show up eventually at AO3. They try to save fanfic archives. See [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Open_Doors]] .
