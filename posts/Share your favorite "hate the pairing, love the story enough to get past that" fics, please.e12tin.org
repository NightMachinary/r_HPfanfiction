Basically, I want to know what fics people have ended up reading and loving despite the featured pairing being one they normally really can't stand. For me, that's StarFox5's "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution" - it's a /fucking amazing/ story, to the point that I can get past the Harry/Hermione ship (Harry and Hermione are basically siblings in my brain and I have a really hard time seeing them outside of that context).


** Again and Again. The only fic to ever convince me that HP/LV wasn't absolute absurdity of the highest degree.

  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.

** I loved the plot, character development and well written horror of [[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/][Getting the Hang of Thursdays]] enough that I was willing to ignore the pairing tag. (It also helps that in one ending the pairing doesn't come true.)

The basic premise is that an accident in Potions class causes the entirety of Hogwarts to get stuck in an endless loop of repeating the same day over and over. Snape and Hermione are the only people who realize what is happening, and thus begins a slow spiral down into psychological horror.

I remember in Wind Shear that the relationship is completely one-sided for nearly the entire story; Harry thinks she's a monster but rationally knows that she hasn't committed any atrocities... yet, she's just /capable/ of them, so he's very hesitant to give that sort of thing the time of day. Bellatrix is obsessed with him from the beginning, though.

** I /never/ thought I would enjoy a Snape/Lily fic, but I read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11622306][Puzzle]] linkao3(11622306) based on a rec from this sub and I'm so glad I did, because it ended up being of the best fics I've ever read. The plot and writing quality are both top-notch, but what really puts it a step above is its characterization, especially of Snape - none of his bad actions are whitewashed or sidestepped, but he's rendered so human that you can't help but understand him.

** Mines also Starfox5, "The Dark Lord Never Died". Romione squicks me out really hard because it feels like two people who sorta like each other settling for each other because they don't think they can do any better in canon. And they actually are both great, but in ways that the other can't really grasp so it's super tragic.

But in this AU Hermione didn't develop her nerd shame she got in canon from being friends with Ron, and Ron got military training that beat the inferiority complex out of him, so it works out.

Divided and Entwined is similar but the AU is subtle enough that I still see the canon versions of them so I had to drop it when they started acting romantic.

It was too bad that she had never met anyone as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to Hogwarts.
