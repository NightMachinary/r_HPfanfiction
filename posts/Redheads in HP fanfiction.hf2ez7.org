In quite a few fics I've read, typically Harmony ship fics, Harry, or someone close to him will say that his attraction to Ginny was creepy because she looked like Lily as they both had red hair. This will oftentimes be tied in with Harry being dosed with love potions.

I understand that redheads are a minuscule percentage of Earth's population, and therefore there may be people out there who have never met a redhead, or have only met one or two. However, as a person with two redhead sisters and a redhead niece, as well as a few redhead friends and acquaintances over the years, I must point out that redheads, like blondes and brunettes, are not a monolith. Redheads can be anywhere from deep auburn to strawberry blonde. While most commonly thought of as pale and freckled, redheads can also be Black. Redheads have different eye colors, body shapes, face shapes, heights.

It seems like lazy and prejudicial writing to me when an author chooses to use Ginny's hair color as a reason for Harry to not have a romantic relationship with her. Relationships work or don't work for a variety of reasons. That Ginny and Lily both had red hair should not be a dealbreaker.


** I've read a few fics that while ginny has red hair she doesn't look anything like lily both in body type and the shade of Red. If I remember correctly they had Lily with a more darker robust shade of red and Ginny with a brighter more "safety orange" shade of red.

This is canon. Lily's hair is described as auburn, while Ginny's hair is red. Personally, I also imagine Ginny to have an orange shade of red hair, while Lily had dark red hair.

** Exactly. There are plenty of ways to avoid Harry/Ginny without the stupid bashing or "creepy redhead" route. Harry could simply consider her a sister, just like Hermione. This doesn't even need any logic to back it up. It's just an inherent feeling that doesn't require justification.

**** That is a very good point, I suppose. Ginny would have to be a sufficiently major character for the 'sister' angle. A lack of romantic feelings is better, as it wouldn't require complicated logic either.

The chemistry part though... That is extremely frustrating. People just get together after barely any interaction.

*** My problem with the Sister trope is that Harry never had a sibling and his home life with the Dursleys never gave him insight into how a "good" family interacted. So he doesn't have a good idea how siblings work or what anything he feels might actually mean. So I never bought that Harry thought that Hermione was a "sister" to him.

Now as far as a reason to not be with Ginny you don't need to go the Red Hair" route. You can simply use the very common IRL "she's the little sister of my best mate" which means she's off limits. Now because of this I could see Harry deciding to treat Ginny as a sister once he decides she's off limits because she's Ron's little sister.

**** I understand what you're trying to say. He doesn't have a sibling, so he doesn't know how it feels. But he does see Ginny interact with her brothers.

A less than ideal upbringing doesn't make Harry unable to comprehend or feel complex emotions. He is perfectly capable of feeling them.

He knows how other siblings treat and feel about each other, and is therefore able to 'name' how he felt about Hermione. There are people I know IRL who don't have siblings but treat their closest friend(s) in a manner that is not dissimilar to how actual brothers and sisters treat each other.

Agree with everything else though.

***** For the most part I would agree with you that folks are capable of relating to experiences they never personally had.

However in this case we are talking about Harry, a child who had never received a hug until he was 11 years old, a child who never was told he was loved growing up, who never participated in celebrating holidays let alone his birthday nor had he ever received presents while at the Dursleys, etc. So a very emotionally stunted child.

So I don't believe that he would be very good at relating to things that are so far out of his experience. And a loving family, siblings, respect/praise from your family, love interest, etc., are all things he yearns for but has pretty much never seen let alone experienced. So how would he truly be able to differentiate that the feelings he has for any girl is love and whether this love was sibling love or romantic love as he has never seen or known love himself?

  Mrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother. The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs. Weasley held him to her. His mother's face, his father's voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him.

*** In my headcanon (which may be way off since we never really see Lily much in canon), Lily is magically talented and great in Charms (and might have become a Charms Mistress had she survived) but while she's intelligent, she doesn't study for studying's sake (like Hermione) but rather only the stuff she finds interesting. As in, she's a top student in Charms and probably Potions (having had Snape the Potions prodigy as best friend for years since they were small children probably gave her a similar intuition for it as Snape himself had, on a lesser scale), but far from an overarchiever and "only" decent in other subjects -- above-average but not at the top. On the other hand, unlike Hermione, she isn't socially awkward and is actually close to her housemates and is somewhat popular in school.

** The most annoying thing about this is that Lily is described with /dark/ red hair and Ginny has 'tomato' locks. Lily is likely auburn and Ginny is as ginger as they come. Nevermind the fact that Ginny is of the short Weasley variety, and Lily is likely tall like her sister, or average. Green eyes, brown eyes; freckles, no freckles; long hair, short hair.

One thing I've always found odd in Harry Potter is that redheads are so many, for people who are supposed to have the rarest hair colour, they're a lot. Outside of the Weasleys there's Lily, Mundungus, Dumbledore, Marietta Edgecombe (strawberry blonde, but it's still 'ginger'). But maybe they seem a lot because the Weasleys are nine already.

** On the one hand I really want to agree with you about how it is really lazy writing. On the other hand as a ginger, a lot of people really do say how much you look like every other person with red hair. Like to a really weird degree. Like I remember in university there were 3 other red heads my year everyone assumed we knew each other, and I even had people ask if any of were related, despite at least in my opinion looking no more alike than any brunettes do. And while I know it's obviously different for a whole host of cultural/ historical reasons, I've had a co-worker who was of Chinese descent call me over to tell me how much a kid in their sons class looked like me. Kid had different eye color, different facial feature shape different shade of red hair, but we were both red heads so we looked a like, and it's just awkward because you can't really point out that I look as much like that red head kid, as she did any of the Chinese kids in that class. I'm using this as an example, but you'd be surprised at how common it can be.

That doesn't make it any less uncomfortable to read people making it a creepy looks like your mom thing, but people for some reason do seem to think that red heads look alike.

******* Recessive means you need two copies of the allele to express the gene. Hence any redheaded women wed by the Potters would have 2 copies of the redhead allele, and would thus necessarily transmit it to all her descendants. So Harry necessarily has one redhead allele, and one brunette allele. If he wed another redhead, his kids will all have 50% chance of being redheads (50% chance of inheriting their dad's redhead allele, rather than the brunette allele), which is roughly what you get in canon.

If Potters continue to marry redheads, at some point you'd expect the head of the familiy to inherit 2 redhead alleles, at which point all their kids would be redheads, unless he break the pattern and wed a brunette.

It's a lazy shorthand, exaggerated and exacerbated by headcanon and fanon warping memory of canon. If you want to write a ship /well/ you should form the basis on how the characters interact, their chemistry and, ideally, how good friends they are to start with.

  Harry, or someone close to him will say that his attraction to Ginny was creepy because she looked like Lily as they both had red hair.
#+end_quote

I've always found this to be quite the leap of "logic". Harry doesn't even know his mum to be able to avoid dating a woman like her. I'd maybe understand it in a fic where Lily survives and raises him, but otherwise there is lots more to a personality than just hair color.

And I'm sorry to all the Weasleys, but my favourite redhead is Simone Simons. She is not only one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen but also has an absolutely amazing voice.

** Not only is Lily described as having dark red hair and Ginny (being a Weasley) having bright orange hair- not to mention they have no physical similarities other than falling under the vast umbrella of red/ginger hair and pale skin- but they had vastly different personalities.

*** How to differ between Hinny and Jily art: try to find a scar, or look at eye colors. If unavailable, pretend it's whatever you'd like it to be the most.

Seriously though, every artist has their own interpretation I don't see the problem in having difficulty seperating the 2 ships art-wise. Hell, once on fanlore when reading about various ships, I saw a SSHG art piece. Except the author didn't intend for it to be SSHG at all but actually SSLE. I... really couldn't see it myself (no offense to the artist).

EDIT: If anyone is curious, I'm referring to the rightmost image [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Snape/Hermione#Notable_Fanart][here]].

** Redheads are actually far more common than average in Scotland. Just thought I'd point that out. You're otherwise entirely correct.

Besides, there's different shades of red, just like there's different shades of brown, black (kind of), blonde, etc. My visualization of Ginny and Lily was never that similar at all besides both being redheads, and that means just about as much as saying that Lucius and Narcissa is visually different "allthough both are blondes".

To me, Weasley hair (including Ginny's) is almost orange. Meanwhile, Lily's hair color is a far darker auburn but closer to red than brown -- sort of blood-red I guess. I also imagine Ginny as being somewhat paler than Lily in skin tone, but that's not nearly as well-developed a visual perception of mine as their hair colors are.

** I can say that I am a redhead - more specifically, a strawberry blonde - I am white, although I have a rather nice tan, I am freckled and have hazel eyes.

I can agree with you, Ginny having redhair should not be a dealbreaker at all. The only redhead that I can think of from the top of my head that I will not pair with Harry is Pyrrha, as she has red hair and green eyes.

Considering that RWBY and HP crossovers aint that popular, there really isn't many fics like that.

Even though they aren't related at all, I still find it weird to be with someone that has the same shade of red hair and green eyes.

**** Seriously!

There's so many things you could use instead of "like sister":

-Ginny tended to fangirl over him because of his (fake) reputation before he came to Hogwarts; Harry hates his fame, and thus his fangirls. Flimsy, but not as lazy. -They don't have much in common besides Quiddich, Ron, and being attacked by Voldemort -She has a mean streak that can border on bullying; Harry likely doesn't like that because, you know, bullies.

Or, if you really want to go with the "too familial" route, you could just go with "the Weasleys are basically family, therefore Ginny is family"

Most of these are lazy, but at least they're more believable.

Harry considers them making fun of Ron or Bill and 'Phlegm' a fond memory he shared with Ginny.

#+begin_quote
  Harry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince himself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely elder-brotherly. They had lived, had they not, like brother and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, *teasing Ron, and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm*? He had known Ginny for years now. ... It was natural that he should feel protective . . . natural that he should want to look out for her . . . want to rip Dean limb from limb for kissing her... No ... he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling. . . .

** Hmmm....might going against the grain of the general feeling of the comments here - and don't get me wrong, I agree that it's lazy writing to list this as the only/main contributing factor to make a case against the Ginny ship - but I kind of got the impression that Harry/Ginny was intentionally written to mimic James/Lily.

J.K wrote James/Lily like it was the most beautiful love story in the world that ended when the two were tragically young, the only evidence of themselves left in their sole surviving son who just happened to be the spitting image of James.

And of course, Harry idolises his martyred parents, and never once hears a bad word about his mother (except from Petunia, whose only real complaint was sheer jealousy). Harry badly wanted his parents back, or at least to have a loving family of his own.

And I'm not saying that Harry deliberately went for Ginny because she looked like his mother, but that perhaps there was a narrative choice there that when Harry did finally marry, it was done in a way that looked like a ghost of James/Lily finally getting to live out their love story.

I mean at least for my part, it often takes me a couple seconds whenever I see a new fanart to work out whether it's a Harry/Ginny or James/Lily picture. Sometimes it really just comes down to which one has the brown eyes and which one has the green ones.
