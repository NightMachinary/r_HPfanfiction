I'm looking for fics that are set in other magical schools. I'm especially interested in fics set in Durmstrang, but any other school, whether an original creation or one of the schools that were revealed on Pottermore, is more than welcome too-especially if it has world building unique to that school/country. I'd prefer it if it was an OC main character, but it doesn't have to be.


** You're looking for *Alexandra Quick.* One of the best reads on the Internet.

*** I read the first book a little while back, but I didn't enjoy it. I think it missed the whimsy and wonder of magic for me. It felt very strict and it (perhaps ironically) reminded me of the (for my country) strict Catholic primary school next to the school I attended where all the girls had to wear ankle-length skirts. It always felt rather bleak, and that was how I felt the school in Alexandra Quick felt too. Does that change at all?

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

***** Thanks, I finished reading it and I enjoyed it a lot. I wish we could have seen the Triwizard Tournament play out, but what is included in the fic is definitely interesting and I really enjoyed the friendship between Harry and Viktor-that kind of surprised me, but the different strengths and ambitions were very nice to see.
