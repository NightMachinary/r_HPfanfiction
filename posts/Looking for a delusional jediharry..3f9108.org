I remember a fanfic from about 5 years ago where Harry somehow injures himself and believes hes a jedi. He arrives at Grimmauld place and pansy whom i think he was dating was there. Harry ends up with a piece off a motorcycle and somehow contains fiendfyre into a lightsaber.

I'm assuming its been deleted as my googlefu has failed me, Any help would be appreciated though.


** Man, if someone could find this I would read the shit out of this...Harry Potter and Star Wars? All they need is a little LotR thrown in and I can die happy.

**** NO! I'm a huge HP book fan for many years, but I only recently got into HP fanfiction, though I've been a fanfic reader for ages.

I wanna see Harry with a lightsaber.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  A Harry Potter cursed with immortality must not only survive the raping of Earth by monsters far more powerful than any humanity has encountered, but he must rise to save it, and in the process exact one wizard's revenge against the Galactic Empire.

  Only the strong may rule, this was the way of the Dark Side, and Darth Millennial was about to prove to his master that he was worthy of the title Dark Lord of the Sith, but first a tremor in the Force draws him to the Unknown Regions of space... I do not own the picture
