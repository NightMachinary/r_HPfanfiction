I've been reading a lot of fanfic in the last year or so, but one thing I've noticed is that any fanfic that mentions Dumbledore as having a partner (who isn't female) either pairs him with Grindlewald in a platonic tragic way, or has him evil and screwing Snape, who is at best an unwilling participant doing so to keep out of Azkaban.

I don't need Dumbledore to be a perfect paragon of goodness and light, but I'm tired of reading stuff that propagates the "Depraved Homosexual" meme. ( [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedHomosexual]])

Are there any fics out there that have Dumbledore with a male partner in a healthy, non-evil way, explicit or not?

I can honestly say I have never seen any fanfiction with this premise, nor do I want to. (Any romance/sex with Snape involved weirds me out for some reason.) And yet I find myself wondering where the hell you found it.

*** It was some Harry/Hermione thing with copious Dumblebashing. I think it also had James and Lily surviving by meeting /Emma/ and /Daniel/ Granger. (I hate that convention too, by the way.)

It wasn't explicit about it, but it had a very amoral out of touch Dumbledore sad over the fact that he had to murder his lover to cover up his crime of setting up Harry's parents for death.

**** I'm not sure how to feel about the fact that I needed it pointed out to me that the convention of naming Hermionie's parents Daniel and Emma was supposed to be a reference to the actors' names. I mean, I had noticed the trend, but once it was spelled out for me I was all "whoa..."

***** That's okay. It took me until last year to realize that Nocturn alley was a double entendre just like Diagon is.

**** "A different Halloween" by robst? Ignoring the strange Dumbledore/Snape subplot, it's a fairly decent slice of life story. [[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween]]
