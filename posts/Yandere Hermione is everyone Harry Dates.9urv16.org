A Crack Fic, where Hermione develops new and different ways of disguising herself, as well as replacing the person Harry is supposed to be dating (Stunning them and locking them in a cupboard or something) Starting out with Muggle methods, going for Polyjuice, some way of developing Metamorphagus powers, and other methods. Harry doesn't like Hermione in that way (or at all) because of her Yandere side when they tried dating once, and uncovers all of Hermione's plots, as they get increasingly Hanna-Barbera Cartoon Villain level of ludicrous, but Hermione MUST have Harry.

Mostly a Dig at the "If there's a Harem. Hermione is in it. If it's Harry Fleur? It becomes Harry Fleur Hermione because Harry is so madly in love with Hermione that she's added to the Veela bond in bordering on meme levels of stupidity" trope


** God, it'd be even better if he had a harem and Hermione had to resort to polyjuice+time turner shenanigans to keep it going.

** I can imagine this escalating until Hermione winds up being the "Power The Dark Lord Knows Not" when Harry tries dating Voldemort /just/ to get away from her.

** Not quite what you want but this has Hermione as the harem recruiter/ organizer to an unwilling Harry. It's smut/horror.

  Harry has low self-esteem and a penchant for sacrificing himself for others. How do you think it would really play out for him if he had instant soul-bond/ stepfordizing sex? Probably not too well.

*** It is an archtype in Japanese media describing a character (usually female) who is obsessively in love to the point of deranged mania. Often it is a villian or comic relief focused on the main character. The comic relief character is often 'hiding' it (playing a standard female love interest, but when the object of their affection is threatened or they are spurred, instead of going off and crying they pull out a bazuka). When played seriously it is often... Much more disturbing.

With the heavy emphasis on violence and over response, they tend to be less believable a character trope than the related 'Tsundere' or 'violently protective girlfriend'.

It occurs in Western media (even non-japanese inspired), particularly in mediums where exaggerated violence is par for the course (cartoons); but it's prominance there is generally why it is called by the Japanese name.
