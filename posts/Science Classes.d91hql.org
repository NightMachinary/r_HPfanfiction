I have read many fanfics in which classes in Hogwarts are changed to introduce classes from the muggle world such has mathematics, english, history, science and so on. Though most of them are fine, the science class has bugged me several times. This is primarily because it is usually not clear how the magical circumstances of the students are incorporated in these classes. Like how do Newton's laws of motion work when everyone in class can invalidate them at will; how do theories of the environment incorporate magical effects and so on. And its not as if you can think of magic as an outside force affecting these theories since for the students it is part and parcel of life.

I mean you can introduce the class but when students can straight up negate the things being taught it will pretty much reduce the value of all such courses. What do you all think? Are there any fics which address this issue?


** My problem with science classes is the same one I have with any other new subject fics introduce to Hogwarts, be it maths or alchemy or warding. They are never thought through or needed for the plot. They are just mentioned, because the author thinks Hogwarts would be better if it had them.

*** Hot take: Extended "going to class" sequences are as unnecessary as the Diagon Alley shopping trip. Writers think they need to put them into their fics, just because they happened in the book.

What they don't realize is that JKR skips classes and shopping trips so she can cover a year in 100-300k words. And when they're in the story, they're always there for a reason - so Harry could meet Ollivander, who tells him about his paired wand, which pays off 3 books later. Snape's first Potions lesson is a quick introductory rundown on his character, the awful biased teacher who hints at his mysterious depths when he speaks in Victorian flower language.

This is how JKR could finish Year 1 in 75k words, while fanfic authors spread Harry's first year into 450k words and abandon the fic by Year 3.

**** Including class scenes are vitally important to the 'feel' of the series - but JKR doesn't dwell on them. But showing some of the normal day to day life adds to the flavor of the world and anchors us to it in a very real way.

She doesn't dwell on them, so that's why she /can/ include classroom scenes/situations in it without dragging the book out - but they aren't always to fill a role in particular I'd say. Some do help to set something up - eg, a spell that they use later on. But stuff like History of Magic or Trelawney's classes aren't really to be used later... just for fun/worldbuilding.

Depending on the style of fic being written, that approach may or may not be the right one to take. In some cases, it can be very interesting to have extended class scenes, but it has to have something new/different. A way to introduce/expand upon new magic, interactions with the professors, etc. Otherwise, speeding through them is the way to go, along with sprinkling them in to add a bit of life/time passing.

#+end_quote

I disagree with that. It may not be obvious in that moment of the story, but History and Divination do have their payoffs and uses later on.

Professor Binns gets his moment to shine during the Chamber of Secrets, when his inattentiveness is used to sidetrack the lesson into explaining Slytherin's history. (This moment was taken by McG in the movies.) And the class is established to be very boring, allowing Harry to have his weird scar dreams and Fred and George to peddle their prank stuff to start funding their shop.

Trelawney's class is meant to show what a fraud she is, which builds up to the point where the reveal that she is the real thing comes at a surprise.

An element doesn't count as "just for fun" when it directly influences or foreshadows the actual plot. If one whole chapter was dedicated to the trio charming pineapples to dance, and there was no pineapple-related Chekhov's Gun, that would be a "just for fun" thing. But in the book, every class/homework scene longer than a paragraph /does/ contribute something to the story.

**** I agree, class scenes, like any other scenes, should move forward the plot and/or develop the characters. And if a new subject is introduced, it should also be relevant to the story. No matter how cool that subject is, if it's not relevant to the plot, it has no reason to be in the story. On the other hand, Hogwarts can have knitting classes for all I care and I will be all for it it if Harry's defeating Voldemort with a knitting needle.

I've long believed that most fics don't need to be longer than 120k.

**** Good point. I think part of it though is that we as fans want to experience magic as a part of a person's life. Like it is real enough that we could learn magic ourselves. One way in which this can happen is by details such as classes and random magic usage which is part of daily life. However, these things may not advance a plot forward as reality tends not to have an overarching plot. So authors may be trying to achieve a balance against these two impulses.

** As far as I've seen, fics that bring in muggle science are almost inevitably going to be full of Mugglewank.

And serious Mugglewankery can only exist in an alternate universe where magic is nerfed in order to be feasibly countered by muggle tech, because the magic we see in canon is much more powerful than 1990's tech, to the point where the standard wizard attitude to muggles is, "silly muggles, whatever will they think of next, teehee!!". Magic in the books breaks most of the standard rules of physics, and even the in-story limitations of magic (Gamp's principal exceptions) are wishy-washy as fuck, especially that one about "no creating food from nothing".

#+end_quote

Any fics that address the issue are going to be making up their own issues to address. Eg, introducing magical cores and mana pools, so that magic can be empirically measured in units of energy, when this was never an issue in the books.

I'd feel reasonably confident in asserting that magic counts as an outside force for the purposes of Newton's laws. The force itself would be coming from nothing, but it would be there.

** I can think of two potential ways to teach science classes at Hogwarts: as part of Muggle Studies, in a "here's how muggles think this works" capacity, or teaching things that magic doesn't necessarily outright contradict and that could help the students to understand the theory behind the magic they're using, like teaching them about atomic structures in Transfiguration.

I don't know of any fics that do either on a school-wide basis, but Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) features Harry personally learning about both. (IRRC; it definitely has the latter, but I may be making up the former.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** If you go with pure "rational" approach to magic, it would work. Basically the idea that magic is just a form of force where, for example, the levitation charm pushes against an object with a force equal or greater to its mass, making it float. It violates the "conservation of energy" principle or has magic take care of that though, otherwise, transfiguration would be as devastating as nuclear weapons.

Not my favourite approach to magical theory, but I have seen it a few times.

** Eh, there are probably some uses of physics in advanced magical item making so the maker knows what basic forces they're trying to twist or thwart. For instance, broom makers are probably taking into account wind sheer, gravity, g-forces, etc.

It seems like something that might be covered in Arithmancy though.

** You do realize that most of physics is taught in a theoretical friction-less vacuum, right? That said teach it like they teach actual physics, with the "Ignoring these constraints" and then show those willing to stick with it how to mutilate it to their advantage.

The ability for the students to be able to keep up with muggles in a conversation without falling back on confundus and obliviate would be worth teaching them muggle classes, including science.

** I think that science classes (and other ones/expansions) are highly dependent on the expansion of the Wizarding World. As it is in canon, as small as it is, it's hard to justify something like a science class.

But the more you change, the more reasonable it gets. For example, historically speaking alchemists (which fit readily into the Harry Potter universe) were most certainly into science/research - almost like proto-chemists in a way. Add to that the muggle world's advances in science, and I /guarantee/ there'd be muggleborn who'd dedicate their lives to trying to square the two.

An author could take two approaches to implementing science into the curriculum at Hogwarts. The first is the way that you're implying - taking regular muggle science and teaching it almost straight up. This is the easier one - though as you noted, it is incongruous with the magic that's learned. I'd argue that it's nice to know how things 'normally' work when learning magic - it can make for some interesting combinations. (Eg, one that I've seen some fics use is that of dust/powder being highly explosive - something that's readily able to be created magically and used). In this respect, I'm sure there's plenty of creative uses that can be created when you use magic to cheat the laws of physics... and then achieve an effect through exploiting that deliberately.

The second approach is to flip it around - and teach science based around magic. Now I know there are a lot of people for whom anything resembling scientific based magic is anathema - but in universe I guarantee there'd be researchers looking to find models of how magic all fits together. And that doesn't need to have numbers and precise measurements and whatnot - but presenting an understanding of magic, similar to how, say, biology or chemistry is taught, would make for an interesting background in the world - and perhaps a source of tension. There could be friction between the 'civilized/scientific' way of looking at magic, of the more researched and controlled types presented in the curriculum - and more wild, untamed magic.

I think the latter would be an interesting addition, and could include a modelling of how magic and mundane science would fit together. Those don't really have to be stated explicitly, but background mentions of them (eg, muggleborn magical researchers trying to connect the two) seems like something that's not the worst. There are other ways of looking at inspiration for this approach as well - eg, using older ways of viewing the world, like picking up older philosophies and using that as the basis/inspiration for wizarding science.

All of that can occur in the background - but in general, the larger/more established the WW is set up in a fic, the more I imagine this type of structured look at the world as becoming fitting. The small scale, less serious WW of canon does not need it in the least. A serious, expanded one would have a need/spot for this type of worldview, I would say. Because I refuse to believe that all wizards, even the muggleborn, have no desire to fit magic into their understanding of how the world works.

*** Wizards are probably trying to understand the nature of magic, sure. But would they do so using the scientific method? It appeared quite late, and had not been the standard before. Rather, metaphysics and philosophy were used. Those would make a lot more sense, thematically, for magic than applying the scientific method.

Demystifying magic is a rather big mistake, for a HP fanfic author.

**** The Scientific Method predates the Statute of Secrecy in universe - in addition, even earlier methods of analyzing the world (eg - Aristotle's) would work. I did mention using such frameworks as philosophy for inspiration as well.

Demystifying magic is not a straightforward mistake imo. It can be - but in certain fanfics or ideas it isn't a bad thing. Now, maybe it shouldn't be done entirely - but having well understood magic be taught as a science of sorts is certainly not a deal breaker for me (though I know that many disagree).
