Voldemort regains a body far earlier. Or he never lost it. Or something. Either way, it's an actually human body.

He's also sane.

He drops in on Harry a few times as Harry is growing up. Eventually takes him in. Harry is perfectly willing to go. Harry learns that Voldemort killed his parents, and either doesn't really mind or rationalizes it.

The war is still kind of going on. Voldemort takes Harry when he breaks in to get the prophecy. They hear it, Harry panics and runs. He and Voldemort might like each other, but he knows full well that Voldemort is a Dark Lord.

The Death Eaters catch Harry, but Voldemort doesn't kill him - Voldemort says something like prophecies are tricky things, and that the two of them have lived this long.

Harry goes to Hogwarts. At the train station, Harry forces (disguised) Voldemort to give him a hug, or to cause a scene. Voldemort swears vengeance on Harry upon his return.

That's all I remember. Anybody know what fic this is?

*Edit*:

I replied to a comment below with some more details, so I figure I might as well put them up here. Quoted from below:

#+begin_quote
  Here's some more details, but I don't know how helpful they are for searches without actual quotable sentences/phrases.
#+end_quote

- I think [[/u/TimeTurner394]] is right about this fic, and Voldemort's appearance stops little Harry from killing himself.

- Harry is rather friendly with Barty Crouch Jr. Harry definitely gets along with him best out of all the Death Eaters.

- Harry at one point ventures into the Death Eater's dungeons and speaks with one of the prisoners.

- Bellatrix does not approve of Harry's presence, but Voldemort keeps her from doing anything dangerous. Still though, putting her alone in a room with Harry is not a good idea.

- Even so, I think Voldemort tells Harry he plans on having Bellatrix teach him dueling or Dark magic or something. Harry is more than a little nervous about it, but Voldemort is confident in his ability to keep Bella in line.

- When they go to hear the prophecy, Dumbledore interrupts. Once they catch up to the panicking and fleeing Harry, Voldemort uses him as a human shield to help escape I believe.

- Once back at.. whatever Manor they're staying at, the narrative says that Harry wouldn't go so low as to beg for his life, but that he /is/ crying. Voldemort squats down and tells him directly "I'm not going to kill you Harry". Harry responds "But you said wizard's prophecies always come true". Unfortunately, I seriously doubt those quotes are 100% accurate and they're rather generic.

- At Hogwarts, Dumbledore calls Harry up to his office asap of course. Dumbledore asks if Harry knows that Voldemort killed his parents. Harry pretends to be devastated briefly, and I think it's mentioned that Harry sees a flash of triumph in Dumbledore's expression/eyes. But then Harry reveals that he knew. Dumbledore and whoever else is in the office at the time are flabbergasted, wondering how Harry can side with Voldemort. Harry tells them that Voldemort has made up for it. They question how he can possibly make up for that, but Harry doesn't clue them in on the Dursley's abuse. I don't think.

- I think Voldemort gets struck occasionally by fits of dangerous insanity. He and Harry will be speaking, Harry is being snarky and accidentally triggers it. Voldemort's eyes go red and his mannerisms change, Harry can tell that this is very dangerous. When Voldemort reverts back, Harry asks what that was about. I think Voldemort replies that it's the cost of immortality, and one he has no problem paying. Or the cost of delving deep into Dark Magic. But I'm pretty sure it's the former.

"No."

"Hug."

"Never."

"Do it or I'll scream."

"Don't threaten me, brat."

*** Lol. Pretty much.

Harry says he'll stay hidden in Hogwarts over the holidays. Voldemort says he can't hide away in the castle forever.

** Can you remember any of the exact dialog? How about how long ago you read it? Did it have a lot of chapters?

I've spent a couple hours searching with not a lot of luck so far, some additional clues would be awesome.

*** Unfortunately I don't think I can remember any of the /exact/ dialog.

Not sure when I read it.. maybe 3 months ago? No idea, really.

I would be surprised if it had more than 20 chapters. Again, though, this is really just a guess. It wasn't finished and it wasn't very long I don't think.

That's all I can think of at the moment. I know it's not much to go on for a search, but thanks and good luck!

*** I can't say for certain, but that does seem to ring a bell.

It may have been the first time Voldemort stops by. If so, I don't think Voldemort really did any convincing or actual physical preventing - just showing up and possibly commenting on it was enough to stop Harry.
