:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So in this fic Harry is the stolen son of Bellatrix and Snape. This was not a romantic encounter it was something they agreed upon. Bellatrix is married to Rodolphous and I believe they were on good terms. Harry being stolen is what drove Bellatrix to Voldemort because Voldemort promised her they would find him. Later she & Lestrange bros tortured the Longbottoms thinking they had information. I think the fic is set in 6th year but it might be 5th. Anyways Snape somehow discovers the Harry is his son. Snape genuinely thinks Bellatrix is crazy, and I think Narcissa is the only one who knows that it's all an act. When Bella meets Harry all she cares about is ensuring that Harry's safe, effectively making Voldemort enemy no. 1.
