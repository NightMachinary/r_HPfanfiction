I'm not interested in Werewolves or Vampires, which were once human.

** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifices Arc]] fits as a large portion of the story is about the magical creatures. The Dememtors, Goblins, House Elves, Werewolves, and Centaurs all feature quite heavily, and the Veela, Vampires, and various other magical creatures are featured infrequently.

Be warned though, the fic is larger than the original books, is Draco/Harry, !powerful Harry, and takes a while to get into what you specifically want.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771/1/Partially-Kissed-Hero][Partially Kissed Hero]] has a lot of background info and references to the Fae folk, and a lot of explanations to a lot of things. It isnt from the PoV on a specific creature, and there's a lot of =Dumbledore is a Dark Lord= but the fic is really good if you last it out.

**** Krahae's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5001827/1/Grimm-A-Fairy-s-Tale][Grimm, a Fairy's Tale]] comes to mind. It's quite good writing for fanfiction. 95k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Pre-Hogwarts. The stuff of legends, myth and majesty were the realm of the Fey long before wizards named him Boy Who Lived. Maeve of the Unseelie Court has decided to take one of wizarding kind's myths, to shape as her own. Vastly AU.

***** Buddy, I know that story but something tells me you're either in the wrong subreddit or you are trying to be a smartass. I asked for a recommendation... if you're not going to provide it, just leave me alone.

****** uh, what the fuck, cool your jets dude

you asked for stories about sentient magical creatures, no I don't know any fucking harry potter fan-fictions about those things, honestly I don't read a lot of fan-fiction because I think it's better to expand your horizons, but what i did fucking do is give you a god damn recommendation for a book, with a similar vocabulary level and similar writing style that's about the topic you're looking for.

God damn what a fucking rude response are you fucking stupid? I hope you don't find shit.

apparently instead it's dumbass questions and assholes who flip their shit like you're some kind of freak for suggesting that they read a different godamn book

*********** Well, I am sorry then. However I still believe you should have been more clear... It's a Harry Potter fan fiction subreddit afterall. If you have a look around here you will see that when it comes to recommendations they are Harry Potter fanfics so you can't just come and throw something unrelated without any additional explanations.
