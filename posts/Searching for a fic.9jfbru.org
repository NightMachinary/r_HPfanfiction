I've found the beginning to a great harry potter fanfiction which I really enjoyed reading, the problem is, I can't find the rest. I found it posted to Instagram and the name and writer wasn't mentioned. (I think it's from Tumblr.) It's supposed to be about 75000 words long. I really want to read the rest of it and so I would much appreciate if anyone might recognize it and tell me the name of it and maybe even link it.

The plot is that Harry works as an Auror looking for missing people. He gets assigned to find Draco Malfoy who has been missing for three years. Harry takes help from Draco's mother and ex-wife looking for him and he becomes friends with Draco's ex-wife's new family. He discovers a lot of things about Draco while trying to find him but he seven months later, he's still searching. Draco starts to appear in front of Harry as some kind of "ghost" after a while. Draco isn't dead so it's not a ghost but it is like Draco is there and can talk with Harry but he isn't really there and appearing in front of Harry takes a lot of energy from Draco. Harry is also engaged to Ginny but they break up a while into the story.

So that's basically it. I apologize if my explanation was poor, I've never been the best at summarizing. Again if anyone knows the name of this piece of fanfiction I'd be really happy. It is extremely well written. Thanks in advance.
