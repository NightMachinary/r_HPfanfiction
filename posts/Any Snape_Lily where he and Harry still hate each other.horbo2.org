Can be any step parent or partner of either parent, though.


** There's one that was very AU where James died and Voldemort was defeated somehow (I believe) but Lily was raising Harry on her own and once he went to Hogwarts started seeing Severus again. What she didn't know was that the two only 'behaved' when with her at home, but hated each other at Hogwarts. Sadly, thats all the info I have, I just spent 10 minutes looking for it in my documentation but it's not there.

** In /Obscura Nox Animae/ Snape doesn't care for Harry. The two don't really interact though, so if you're looking for that dynamic, this might not fit the bill.

But if you wanted to see Snape and Lily manage the conflict around his dislike for (and cruelty toward) Harry, then this fic does a pretty good job.

On top of that, it's a very unique premise, and the writing's great.

  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.
