#+TITLE: Hermione had told Harry that he was in plenty of books. Ginny likewise had read the books when she was younger, are there any fanfics about those fictional books about Harry?

** Well Hermione specifically mentions the books she read in about him: The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts, Modern Magical History and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century. I know this is not a discussion but quite frankly I think those sound like boring books for most normal children.

My thought is that Harry was a mystery. He vanquished the darkest wizard and then disappeared into the Muggle world. I feel like many of the stories would have been spread through word of mouth as Harry was rumored to be sighted by some wizards.

I can totally imagine Dedalus Diggle saying "I ran into Harry Potter and he was fighting this evil hag and her pig minion as she was dragging him into that Muggle carriage thing. I wish I could have helped him but I was too taken aback." to which someone responds, "Oh, I think he's safe. I saw him the other day being chased by a band of half trolls-half goblins and he just flew on the roof of a Muggle building to escape them."

** In canon, all the books mentioned by Hermione are History books (which make sense considering he pretty much singlehandely ended a Civil War). There are absolutely no mention of any fictional book about Harry ever existing (which is totally the kind of thing, if it existed, would be mentioned either by Draco when mocking Harry or by Skeeter when she wrote her articles in GoF).

The fact that no book exist about him does not change the fact that Harry Potter probably became a household name and that every child at least heard about him and how he survived "You-Know-Who".

That being said, I don't think I read any fanfic about this kind of story. In the rare case where the "Harry Potter fictional stories" are even mentioned, it can usually be summed up by:

- "/Harry find out about these books./
- /Harry is outraged that they didn't ask him the right to use this name or gave him money./
- /Harry sues the authors and/or publishers and get the books taken out the stores with a big sac of galleons going into his vault/".
