I'm not looking for any fic in particular, just ones that follow the basic plotline of:

- Girl is seen by the Marauders
- Girl tries to get away from them, the Marauders keep seeking her out
- Girl tries to resist but ends up becoming a Marauder

Thanks a whole lot if you reply!


** Maybe this one: linkffn(10772496). Might not be exactly what you are looking for, but it is still a great fic. Pretty damn long though.

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*
