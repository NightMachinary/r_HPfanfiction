This is the first creative writing I've done since high school, and even in college I'm not taking many paper-oriented classes. But I've read a couple of fics with this premise, and none of them went down the path I wanted them to go, so I really wanted to write my own. I really need feedback to make this decent.

The premise is that there is no prophecy, and Voldemort won the war when Harry was eight. Magical Britain becomes a police state, and even the thought of change leads to punishment. Harry is forced to take every action that would minimize the torture; even if that means insulting Muggle-borns, allowing Slytherins to walk all over him, or holding back in his classes. Resistance seems futile, but that changes when Harry comes upon a strange room.

Anyways, please let me know what you think, and what I can improve on.

Thanks!


** Overall, it's an interesting premise. I think that Harry doesn't sound like an 11 year old; not because he is too mature (since that does make sense), but because he's too erudite, like in the following passage:

#+begin_quote
  The only other class of interest was Muggle Studies, which was basically a continuation of our lessons at the orphanage. We learned about Muggle history through a twisted viewpoint which highlighted all of the flaws and portrayed Muggles as savage, unintelligent, weak creatures.
#+end_quote

Another thing that stuck out at me was the casual attitude to the Cruciatus. It's supposed to be the pain spell to end all pain spells, yet the characters pretty much shrug at it:

#+begin_quote
  "Crucio," he cast, striking Neville directly. He held the curse for a couple of seconds before dropping it. Neville, to his credit, didn't cry out and simply took the pain with a grimace on his face.
#+end_quote

More generally, the children --- who are not Mudbloods --- strike me as oddly unaffected by what was supposed to be a traumatic experience that included the Cruciatus and Oblivation. (And, remember, a poorly performed Obliviation causes brain damage.)

*** Yeah, everyone seems extremely numb, to everything, I can see the seeing legillimency and obliviation as normal if they grew up with it (though they apparently didnt) , but the cruciatus? Thats supposed to be incredible pain, and it seems as though everyone in the story doesn't even feel it.

** So you've got a very interesting premise, with a lot of scope for world building. But these things have to be done gradually, or you wear the reader out.

I can see what you're trying to do, you're trying to show that these kids, especially Harry, are desensitised to violence and horror because they've been through so much. But do a bit of research on those that have lived under authoritarian or violent regimes - child soldiers in central Africa, North Koreans, accounts of Jews that grew up under Nazi rule.

They still feel, they still show emotion, they're not robots. The blank, unfeeling, unfocused stare that we associate with PTSD does occur, a lot, but it's not how they permanently live. More than that, they do not suffer continuously. It's remarkable how humans find happy moments and humour under awful circumstances, but they do it.

The point is to remember that there are ways of showing fear, paranoia and chaos in the background of a world without it smothering the plot. Think about how Rowling herself does it - even in the midst of battle we see a bit of humour as McGonagall leads a herd of galloping desks. Constant darkness and angst becomes boring if you don't break it up now and then, and it loses its effect. A character can appear to others as if they are coping, or that they don't care, but their thoughts and feelings under the surface let the reader know that they are suffering.

Then there's the world itself. With dystopian worlds like this, it's important that the oppression itself is not so relentless - it needs to be written subtly. We need to believe that people find that their lives are significantly better if they comply. If everyone suffers, all the time, the regime falls apart, as is the case with every oppressive regime. The impact of reward and punishment and swift, unpredictable changes is far greater and far more sinister than continuous punishment. The scariest oppressors and villains are those that you cannot predict.

** Before anyone reads this, fair warning, this comment may be somewhat harsh considering how little writing the author/op seems to have done. Im also writing this fairly late at night so please ignore any errors.

Well, one thing that i notice almost immediately was your sentence structure. It reads and looks like this. I did blah blah I said "blah blah" Your sentences seem to follow this pattern a lot, especially at the beginning. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a big fan of flowery descriptions everywhere. For example: He eloquently stated "blah blah" He pretentiously sneered and spat "blah blah" Or He gracefully spun on his heel dodging two bright rose colored flashes that would have knocked him out had they hit him. That being said, your sentences do need some variety to them otherwise they quickly become boring and stale. At some points your fic seems to turn into a list of actions. For example, the first and last 3 paragraphs /I/ ignored the screaming. /I/ had grown used to it.

/I/ continued down under the watchful gaze of the guard. /I/ went deeper and deeper down, where the crashing waves were but a whisper, and then faded to nothing at all. It was cold, so cold.

/I/ stopped at the bottom floor, and walked forward, down the hall. The screaming had stopped; the faces that surrounded me were bleak and almost lifeless. A couple more cells, and /I/ had reached my destination.

/I/ finished lunch quickly, and got back up. That room - it seemed extremely important for some reason. /I/ knew full well that it may have been the result of a Compulsion Charm, but /I/ had to find it again. /I/ made my way back through the fourth floor, passed the Greenhouses, and found myself staring at an empty wall, where just before /I/ was sure there had been a large door. /I/ wandered a bit around the area, but /I/ couldn't find the door that /I/ had gone inside earlier. Just when /I/ was turning back and /I/ passed the initial spot /I/ had come to, it shimmered into existence.

And suddenly, looking at the door, /I/ remembered.

It was midnight when /I/ left. /I/ wasn't sure what had happened during that time, but /I/ knew that /I/ had to come back

While using I certainly isn't some terrible sin it seems you start way too many sentences with it.

My second obvious issue has to deal with the fact that we almost never get any feeling, emotion, and very few thoughts from Harry. What does he think of this. Does he approve, in some strange way, of what Voldemort is doing? Is he jealous of the death eater kids? Does he pity muggleborns? Is he disgusted with the system? Is he resigned to his life? Does he wish he could change things? We just don't know anything about how the main character feels. And it's kind of annoying tbh. I mean, the story is in first person for crying out loud we should see the character feeling something, at the very least feeling indifferent. It seems as though he is a very boring emotionless husk of a character.

tl;dr overuse of I to start sentences, and lack of emotion or feeling from character.

Edit: more criticism (hopefully constructive): It doesn't really feel like this new world has the sort of looming government you seem to be trying to create where you do anything out of line and /bam/ obliviated and cruciod to hell personally, I have no idea how to create this sort of tension not being much of a writer myself, but IMO Lady Khali's Linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind) does this quite well with Dumbledore, maybe that will inspire you.

Edit2: praise (which i totally didn't forget to do in the 2 earlier times I typed stuff out /s ): I do really like the idea you have here, it seems to have a fair amount of potential, though I have no clue where you're going to go yet. As its kinda hard to judge from the little I have to go on.

** Agreed- it's a great premise and I'd love to read more, but it's really tricky to get through as there seems to be very little characterisation. Harry really sounds nothing like Harry, in his speech or in his descriptions of the action. Ron doesn't really sound like Ron (just putting 'Mate' and 'yeah' in isn't quite enough!) etc. When that's sorted, and the bits the others have mentioned, it'll be great!
