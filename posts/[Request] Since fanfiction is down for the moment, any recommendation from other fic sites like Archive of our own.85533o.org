** A self-recommendation, and a story that's on SIYE only:

[[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130209][Driving Miss Weasley by me]]: 28k words, short story about Harry and Ginny as past lovers slowly rediscovering their bond as they get chased by a group of mercenaries.

[[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128050][Bonds of Blood and Magic by Duelist]]: little over 300k words, sadly abandoned. Harry is kidnapped from the Burrow before Bill and Fleurs wedding. Later Ginny disappears as well. One of the most exciting fanfics I've ever read.

  AU. The Sorting Hat doesn't just let the Sword go when it falls on Harry's head in the Chamber, but also Sorts him again, this time into Slytherin. Harry is furious and terrified, and the adults aren't helping much.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

He's fallen in love with her, and he wants to keep things exactly as they are - the problem is that Dream Hermione keeps insisting she's real.

  But sometimes --- sometimes she slips in a cryptic tweet that has her followers scrabbling to work it out or she types out song lyrics that fit with how she's feeling and she presses send as Harry hooks his chin over her shoulder and hums along.

** linkao3(Whom the Gods Would Destroy)

It's a post-apocalyptic story that features shifting perspectives from Hermione Granger and Charlie Weasley. It takes place in 2010 in which Great Britain's Muggle population has died off whereas the wizarding community is beginning to follow suit. There's a romantic interlude with Hermione and Charlie though I'm not sure if it'll continue to the end. It's completed and stands at 133,916 words spread over 26 chapters. Quite simply, the story is stunning. I'm on Chapter 13 and I feel completely awed from what the author (ianthewaiting) has penned. However, it doesn't seem very popular with 14 comments, 50 kudos, and 832 hits. If stories like this interest you, give it a try.
