I would like fics that deal with time travel

Fics that deal with founders

Fics where Harry is Lord of multiple houses

Fics where Harry is in Slytherin (and possibly quickly ascending hierarchy)

Fics where Harry is in Gryffindor (stated just because Slytherin Harry isn't wholly necessary)

Fics where Harry is dark

Fics dark might just mean that he utilizes spells that might be considered dark. Magic is neither dark or light it's how it's being used.

Hope this isn't to strange. I've found limiting options leads to less options.

Thx for future help.
