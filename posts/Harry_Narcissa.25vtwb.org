Does anyone know of any stories where the paring or side pairing is Harry/Narcissa.

Thanks


** I don't really know any, but now I suddenly want to read a version of that pool table scene from American Pie with Harry as Finch and Draco as Stifler.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9072505/1/][Letters from the Asylum]] is a delightful piece of cracked with a good dose of Harry/Narcissa, though that's not the only pairing. Not a serious fic by any means but I don't know any serious ones

** It's an interesting pairing, but from what I've seen usually tends to be more smut/harem focused. If that isn't a problem here's some links:

- [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/browse.php?type=class&type_id=4]]

- [[http://www.favoritestracker.org/publicList.php?list=1621]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=103&c1=550&c2=1&_c1=6&_c2=347]]

As for ones I've read:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2426698/14/Time-for-Independence][Time for Independence]] had a neat 50k setup, but was sadly abandoned before it could really get going more.

- [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1041][Inheritance]] is one of the smuttier "Harry bangs all the Black daughters, and all the veelas".

**** Just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8695313/14/Black-Heir][The Black Heir]]. 79k, and unfinished, but it was surprisingly not smutty, and instead was an interesting and unique look at an older Slytherin woman getting together with the Gryffindor golden boy.

*** 'Delenda Est' isn't a Harry/Narcissa fic, so why would you recommend it here?
