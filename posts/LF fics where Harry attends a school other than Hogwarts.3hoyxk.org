** Well there's the obvious linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]]) in which Harry transfers to Durmstrang

There's a few more chapters here. [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=14378]]

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** I've heard about this story for a while now and still haven't got time to read it but it's the first time I read that Harry gets transfered to Durmstrang, yet it seems like an interesting enough part of the plot to mention.

**** It's really good and Durmstrang is interesting because you can test into higher classes and in every class you're required to do end of the year projects and it's just interesting to see what people come up with. You see how Harry is doing magic above his grade level but it doesn't feel over the top. On top of that it brings in dark magic and some other things, all the while Harry's twin is still taking care of the boy who lived stuff so that doesn't just get in the way.

  After his second year, Harry begins to realize Hogwarts isn't everything it could be. Are there other options available? While the Hogwarts characters belong to JK Rowling, the story is obviously outside of canon.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

** I recall two other fics that I remember being sorta readable: linkffn(9884872), in which Harry goes to Beauxbatons. Been a while, though.

There also was some fic where Harry goes to an Irish school, but I can't be arsed to remember the title. Anyone know what I'm talking about?

EDIT: I /think/ it was The Irish Choice by DisobedienceWriter, as linked above?

  In which Harry goes to Beauxbâtons instead of Hogwarts. Butterfly effects ensue, with Voldemort reviving without opposition from Harry, Dumbledore trying to save the situation and Fudge making everything worse. Meanwhile, Harry learns French. (Twist on the cliché and a slow-going Independent!Harry)

I half want to read this out of curiosity and half don't because i've never read a fanfiction where Ireland wasn't butchered.
