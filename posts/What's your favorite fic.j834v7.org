I'd love to know people's favorite fics. What do you love to read over and over? Let's share our favorites so we can find our next favorite read!


** It's easier to say what are my favourite writer's because there so many great stories out there: High up on the list Bobmin (mhRIP), LeQuin is up there too, despite his unfortunately habit not finish his stories Vance McQuill ist an enjoyable read too. Somewhat new on the list (but working their way up the Ranks is PetrificusSomewhatus. Of course there are many talented writers out there but if I write everyone I enjoy to read I'll here till tomorrow.ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‰

  "O, isn't this what my mother never wanted?" - Analicia Sotelo, 'South Texas Persephone'.Tom Riddle was not the only strange child to come out of Wool's. After eleven years of self-imposed exile, Amy Benson returns to Hogwarts to protect the only thing that matters: her precocious daughter, Mae. Offered the position of Potions Master, her alma mater seems like the safest place to keep Mae away from the darker elements of their world. But the wizarding world of 1957 is not the one Amy remembers, and while the threat of war may be over, she quickly discovers that peace in magical Britain is far from assured. As a radical new faction led by a charismatic Tom Gaunt rises to power in the Ministry, and a rapidly expanding Hogwarts braces for a post-war generation determined to leave its mark, Amy and Mae find that the secrets they keep for and from one another may be their undoing.

  Ron looked down the table in surprise and realized he was right. One kid was reading a comic book, two were playing chess, another group had transfigured jelly beans into monkeys and sent them down the table to steal the platter of bacon, which was out of their reach. Further down a jaded looking group was sipping coffee and discussing nihilism, and at the end of the table a couple who looked like they were seventh years were making moon eyes at each other and feeding each other across the table. The rest were eating.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
