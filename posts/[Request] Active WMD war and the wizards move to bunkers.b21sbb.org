** Would they really need bunkers if they have wards? And if they can create wards that protect from nukes then I would think their lives wouldn't change much considering wizards dont travel to the muggle world much.

*** also, wards are only as powerful as the user that had put them up. does a wizard have the power to combat a splitting of a atom, or the destruction of 1000x blasting curses at the same time

*** I don't think that wards stop physical damage.

The only real wards we hear about are ones that forbid entry, confuse a would be trespasser or cancel out magical attacks.

The wards on Hogwarts didn't stop serious structural damage during the battle, and that is supposed to be the safest building in Britain, with powerful wards added over a millenia.

I doubt that canon wards would do much against modern conventional explosives/projectiles like the MOAB ([[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBU-43/B_MOAB]]), let alone the raw destruction caused by a hydrogen bomb, which can cause structural damage to buildings (and third degree burns to people) hundreds of kilometres aways from the initial blast.

**** *GBU-43/B MOAB*

The GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB , commonly known as "Mother of All Bombs") is a large-yield bomb, developed for the United States military by Albert L. Weimorts, Jr. of the Air Force Research Laboratory. At the time of development, it was said to be the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in the American arsenal. The bomb is designed to be delivered by a C-130 Hercules, primarily the MC-130E Combat Talon I or MC-130H Combat Talon II variants.
