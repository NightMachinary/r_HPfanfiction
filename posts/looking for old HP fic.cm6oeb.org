** Bear with me as I don't know how to use the bot, but that sounds a lot like Xerosis by Batsutousai

Edit [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/Xerosis][here's a link!]]

*** Yea, came to link Xerosis too. That's the one.

And the non-mobile link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/Xerosis]]

Fics from 2011 are now considered old. SMH.

** You may be talking about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October][October]]. Harry (the personification of Death) unintentionally travels back in time to Tom Riddle's Hogwarts years. He eventually attempts to rewrite history for the better, which includes creating a nation on Mars as a safe haven.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, Tom/Lily and Tom/Harry, not threesome

** It might be a series by mad_fairy.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447]]

Harry basically starts a club with interest in space and eventually moves the magical community off of earth. The club becomes really branched out and successful making real money and with people researching. A lot of fun worldbuilding too . Harry's a son of Loki(marvel) and SHIELD is briefly mentioned as suspicious of them. There's also a young Tom who gets adopted by Loki and spans across multiple years.
