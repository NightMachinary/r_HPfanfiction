When genderbending what names do you like to for the characters?


** I've only really thought about Harry's name, but I like Holly the best, starts with h, double letter, ends with y, and follows the plant/flower theme for girls in the Evans family.

*** Most people give fem!Harry flower names from Evans side. It makes sense to me, but I think she can also be named after people from Potters side.

So, how does Dorea/Euphemia Lily Potter sound?

** I've seen a loooooot of names for Fem!Harry but my favorites are stuff that make sense. Holly. Jasmine. Rose. Rosalynn in one case. Y'know. Sensible girls names, or at the very least, names you can read and associate with a girl. Unlike Harriet, or Harrietta, Etc.

I think people try too hard to keep “Harry” as a nick name.

I read a Boy!Luna fic where he was still Luna, but his first name was Sol, with Luna being the middle name.

You ever see Fem!ron get called Ronalda? I have. It's as painful as it sounds.

***** Is Harry short for Henry? He is never called Henry in the books and while Harry is a common nickname for Harry, it isn't that uncommon for people to have short forms as their genuine names, there are a lot of people called Jack who have Jack as their legal name when Jack was originally a nickname of John. Tom Riddle is another one, while Tom is short for Thomas, he is never addressed as Thomas and I know real life Toms whose name on their birth certificate is "Tom" not "Thomas".'

Also in chapter one of the first book Petunia dismisses Harry as "a nasty common name", it seems less likely she would do that if he was called Henry which is a name given to Kings and Princes among others.

****** Harry is a diminutive for Henry. Whether it's Harry's full name? No clue. Better than Hadrian though. I think Harry is his full name.

Diminutives are fun. Let me demonstrate: Jack is a diminutive for John, James, Jacob, Jason, Jonathan, Jan, Johann, Johannes and Joachim

** Weasleys name their children after English/Germanic royalties. In this gender bent world, they keep having children until their first son, William, is born. The names of their daughters could be: Anne, Aethelflaed, Emma, Elizabeth, Guinevere/Ginevra, and Victoria, with Guinevere/Ginevra being the elder one (Chronologically speaking, she was the first of these famous British queens).

[[https://www.behindthename.com/name/ginevra][Ginevra]] is the Italian form of Guinevere, and is etymologically the same as Jennifer and Geneva (that Swiss city). But anyway, after Ginny's full name was revealed in HBP in 2005, [[https://www.behindthename.com/name/ginevra/top/italy][the popularity of Ginevra]] really takes off in Italy. Coincidence?
