:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find a fic I read years ago just for the childhood nostalgia. It was a crossover with Supernatural. Harry was, as most of this type of story in the day, astronomically powerful.

I remember that he was the only wizard left alive because the Angels exterminated the Wizarding world on the orders of God? It followed the story of Supernatural beginning in season 2 I think. I know Bella from Supernatural played a fairly large part.

Harry was essentially a broker/dealer similar to what Bella was in the show and ends up getting wrapped up in the Winchesters shit. If I remember correctly he has a real beef with Angels because they killed his family?

Any help is appreciated! Thanks!


** If I remember right it's this one but it's been a while since I've read it so I could be off

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.
