The hero's ship being a flying motorhome with wings and rockets attached seems very much like something wizards would do.


** Synopsis: Everyone is in Space on serious business. The Wizards are here to fuck around. Watch as the galaxy learns how to deal with its new cohort of wand-waving, robe-wearing, physics-defying lunatics one bumbling disaster at a time.

*** "For the last time, it's not a 'space gas station', this is a mining station and a refinery!" shouted the alien, waving their tentacles around for emphasis.

The human did not seem very impressed.

"Yes, buuuut - don't you refine fuel? And then sell it?"

"Yes, but-"

"Splendid! I'll take one full tank, please."

He pointed towards the spaceport, and between the titanic fuel tankers and container starships, one could just make out a speck of chrome glinting in the darkness of space.

"That's not... ugh, fine. That'll be 20 iotas of metallic hydrogen."

"No problem. Here you go!"

The human waved his stick, and a glass vial floated from his belt. The alien inspected the container. Ran it through the scanner twice, and then sighed deeply.

/'bloody humans and their bloody magic phials I swear to Xares one of these days I'll...'/

The alien's voice was lost in the general humming of the corridors as they walked towards the spaceport carrying a case of high-grade antimatter fuel cells.

Humans were so weird! And their ships even more so!

What kind of FTL-capable starship had /wheels/ and a /retractible roof/?

**** Oh dear lord, that's amazing!

Admiral Xi'rulon did a double take. Was that a... Ground vehicle floating in-between the 'Soulwrecker' and the 'Killfist'? The being keyed his Com. "Captain Schuster. Explain." The Admiral growled.

He felt as much as he heard the wince coming from the comms system. "Sorry Admiral, but we caught a Wizard... Um... Ship making a beeline for the Transit Gates. The security team is already questioning them and setting up the standard Welcome & Safety Briefs we give to all Galactic newcomers. The station's magical law enforcement teams want a look over the... Ship before we release it though."

Xi'rulon sighed. Why did everything Humans do have to be so bloody complicated. "Get the inspection done Captain. We have more important things to focus on-"

"Hi!' A voice said from exactly three return pings behind his main audio receptor.

The Admiral jumped in surprise as a number of venomous spines fully extended before retracting again. Turning his secondary optical receptors to the source of the noise, Xi'rulon beheld a... Human. Wearing what looked like a cloth tube rather than the standard P-suits all spacefaring species did. And a cloth cone on its head. The Admiral briefly wondered if that didn't make their furry sensor array on top of the head uncomfortable, but dismissed that in favour of focusing on what the tiny human magical wanted. "Greetings. What are you doing here?"

The human blinked at him. "Looking around." It said, rocking back on the balls of its feet as his command staff finally noticed that the human was there and alerting security.

"Can you do that somewhere else please? We're busy." Xi'rulon said brusquely. "I have at least a dozen megahaulers and five line ships to clear for transit this month and don't have time to act as a tour guide."

"Oh, sorry." The human said as the Marines' cloaked frames crawled in from ceiling vents above it. "I'll just go somewhere else then!"

There was a thunderous /crack/ as the human vanished, followed by a crash as half a tonne's worth of power armour dropped into a point between the Admiral and where the human had been standing.

Warbling to himself, the Marine stood up and deactivated his cloaking system. "Admiral, my apologies for the tardiness."

Xi'rulon waved it away. "Find the human and bring it back to that ground vehicle. " He said, keying his comm again "Commodore Nature's Fury, are there any missing crew members for the Wizarding vessel?"

"So she appeared right behind you too, eh? Don't worry Admiral, the MLE humans are on it."

"Just get them off my station please. And comm any Wizard vessels not to come near the gate in the future."

Commodore Fury laughed. "Sir, I'm sorry, but they don't /have/ comms. Or on-board computing systems. Or even star charts!"

Xi'rulon stared at his communicator with an extended optical receptor. When was the last time his subordinate had taken recreational leave again? "That is impossible. How do they navigate then?"

"Two very advanced pieces of technology-a compass and a special stick!"

One of the comms technicians burst into a hideous shrill. Xi'rulon looked over. Yes, the magicals had just managed to make a Super-predator Alpha female laugh on duty through their existence alone. The Admiral directed several optical systems to glare at her, which they did with great success. "Enough of this. Just get them out of here quickly, Commodore."

"Aye Admiral." Commodore Fury said, keying the Salute tone as he signed off.

"Admiral!" A bridge lieutenant called. "A new vessel is approaching us! It... It looks like a bus sir." The lieutenant said in clear disbelief as a Double Decker bus bobbed into view from behind a Chargon Freighter, merrily going thousands of times faster than any bus Xi'rulon had ever been on.

Xi'rulon palmed what most other species assumed to be his face. Today was just not his day.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13693477/1/Star-Granger-season-1][Here]] is a WIP HP/SG-1 crossover where Hermione encounters a Goa'uld and can, subsequently, operate their technology. Starts serious but is becoming wonderfully crackish as the story progresses. Not to Spaceballs levels yet, but I could see it getting there...

** I have this

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/530818]]

Its most likely abandoned and thus an unsatisfying read, but the content is really top notch. It is worth reading one time though
