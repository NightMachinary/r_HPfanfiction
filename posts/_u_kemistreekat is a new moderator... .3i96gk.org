So as I was doing to State of the Subreddit survey and looking at the moderators, I saw that we have a new moderator, who has been a mod for about a day now: [[/u/kemistreekat]], who is also the Head of Slytherin on [[/r/harrypotter]] and th Deputy Headmistress over there.

Sorry [[/u/kemistreekat]], but I did some research, and it doesn't look like you have participated on the sub before, so... Congrats on modship? Just wondering, why is there a new mod? I'll batsignal [[/u/denarii]] too.

No harm meant by any of this, just very perturbed.

Edit:

* Just to sort out some confusion:

[[/u/denarii]] did not add [[/u/kemistreekat]], [[/u/CatholicGuy]] did in an effort to strengthened the bond between HIS community of subs, that HE created, which in my opinion, gives HIM a lot of power over the Harry Potter community on reddit.

[[/u/CatholicGuy]] is not an active member of the sub, and neither is [[/u/kemistreekat]]. I believe they should have addressed the sub.

I also believe that if a new moderator is needed, it should be chosen from the community.

** Disclaimer: This is not an attack on any member of this community, mod or otherwise, or any member of any other community.

I'm relatively new here, but I had no idea that [[/u/denarii]] wasn't the head mod, and I'm actually a little bothered by that. Maybe I just don't know what's going on behind the scenes, but it seems to be that s/he (sorry, don't know gender) is the mod that is most invested in this community and does the most for it. I'd actually feel a lot more comfortable if decisions weren't being made behind his/her back, and would wholeheartedly support a promotion. But again, I acknowledge that I may not have all of the information. This is just my gut reaction.

***** I don't think it was disgraceful and I don't believe there's anything your or anyone has to apologize for.

My only point is that it reflects on the style of moderation and type of community the mods are seeking to build. Namely, that we are here at their pleasure and executive decisions will be made without our input. We can all buck up and accept it or else leave and go start our own sub. Fine, I can accept this.

I suspect much of the backlash is optics. The last time a mod appointment was made, there was at least a token attempt to engage the community and select from their ranks. This set people's expectations of a similar process being followed in the future. Had the outside member been brought in along with appointing one or more internal members (after a more formal selection process), then I suspect nobody would have a problem.

When someone was brought in from outside who is an unknown to the sub and who doesn't even read fanfiction, then it's natural for active members of the community, some of who are popular writers of fanfiction (and avid readers of same), to wonder whether we are so wanting as to not even be considered. Hence, the comment about being an acolyte of someone's cult of personality.

In the end, it really doesn't matter. It's a sub devoted to fanfiction, not a matter of life or death.

Obviously, it is clear this is not a democracy, but I do hope that the community's opinion on these matters will be taken into consideration.

(I don't really have a horse in this race, except a desire for transparency and including in decision-making processes a community that, frankly, seems to me to be one of the most respectful, diverse and self-regulating fandom communities I've come across, and has shown no indication that they need to be treated like children.)

I did not appoint [[/u/kemistreekat]], [[/u/CatholicGuy]] did. It came as a surprise to me too. The reason we hadn't said anything yet is we were still figuring things out ourselves. [[/u/CatholicGuy]] is the founder of the HP subs he mentioned and if he wants to operate them as a network, that's his prerogative.

I'm confident, however, that she'll make a good addition. The themed posts proposal in the survey which has received pretty positive responses was her idea.

When I get home this evening I'll try to address specific posts.

You moderator several other subs, 1 of which is very large and 2 others I know of that are in the same size category as this one. Like I said, enough experience, but also raises concerns about how much time you can afford to spend on [[/r/HPfanfiction]].

I am also concerned that you haven't actually read much in the fanfiction community. You may not be able to properly moderator debates or threads which are looking for fics.

Essentially, put yourself in the sub's shoes:

1. You're part of a great, small community where all the active members know each other really well.

2. The person who created this sub hasn't been here in forever, doesn't put any time or work into the sub.

3. At one point, another moderator asks active members to submit their names if they would like to be a content moderator. It's all very transparent and lovely, and you're happy that your friends and people you know know the sub like the back of their hands - and what it does and doesn't need - have this great opportunity.

4. No one gets the position, but that's OK because you have one active moderator and that's more than enough for the size of the sub in your eyes.

5. Suddenly, the person who created the sub, who hasn't been here since its conception, suddenly adds a new moderator. This moderator happens to be the person right under him in another one of his subs - this sub he's actually still in control of and is still active in. That means this sub will be forever linked with that other sub you've never really been on. Your mini-sub is going to be more and more moderated like the other sub.

6. There's never a post about it /before/ or /after/ it happened. No one told you. In fact, the only way you found out was one of your friends glanced at the mod list and noticed the new name.

7. This person has never been on [[/r/hpfanfiction]] before. They've never even read fanfiction.

8. The actually active mod makes a post saying "Yeah OK the maker of this sub may not have done this right, but he's acknowledged that and apologized!" When he has not.

No one's really attacking anyone personally, they just think it's an insult to pass over the competent, great, qualified people we have here for someone outsourced from another sub no matter how great they are, too.

******* Nope - what I see is a number of people attacking [[/u/kemistreekat]] from the start. She didn't actually do anything wrong. I think the tone of the original post sets everyone up to be negative towards Kat (deliberately or not), hence my defending her - the person, not the mod.

******** I actually haven't seen anybody attacking her. It seems to be people are expressing valid concerns that really have nothing to do with her personally, and unless I've missed a comment, everybody tried to be clear that it wasn't personal and they don't think she did anything wrong. I think that the community should be allowed to say how they feel about the direction this subreddit is going, and as long as they are doing so in a respectful manner (as they seem to be), I don't think telling them to just shut up and deal with it is a fair response or one that is going to get the results you like.

For the record, I personally don't have a problem with her being modded, and I don't have a problem with any of her responses. However, I find your defensiveness offputting and it is raising my hackles. I do not mean this as an attack. I merely want to let you know that, at least for me, you are not getting the reaction you probably intend.

Yeah i'm being very forward about how little I like her being a mod because I really don't like the idea of picking someone outside the sub and I still think she seems lovely on a personal level.

**** I don't post a lot (or hardly at all), but I do visit the sub often - to check the spam folder and mod logs to make sure everything is running smoothly. And there has never really ever been an issue here. You guys are act really awesome and denarii doesn't a great job at running the place.

I love HP fanfiction, which is why I made the sub years ago. I just finished reread the Snape Chronicles last week.

****** Snapes life from his POV. It's astoundingly well written/researched (like the muggle world is /perfect/. My only complaint would be that it really downplays the marauders interactions with Snape and Snapes own actions. Like he joins the DEs for a particular spoiler reason and doesn't find out what they're really like for ages.

It's basically a very whitewashed but fantastically well written version is Snapes life.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
