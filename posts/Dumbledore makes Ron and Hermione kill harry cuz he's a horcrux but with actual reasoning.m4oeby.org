I've seen some fanfics where Harry time travels after being betrayed by the order of phoenix and they usually have Weasley bashing and Hermione bashing where Ron and Hermione often say things about how they hated Harry all along and how he's so evil and dark. Instead I wanna see something where they were actually his friends but Dumbledore gave actually convincing and detailed arguments about how Harry would be corrupted by the horcrux and how even if he seems fine and normal, it could be acting like how Grindelwald impersonated Graves. I have no idea where it would go from there so just write whatever.


** Maybe he even teaches them the killing curse but since it works with pure hatred they have trouble using it on Harry whom they genuinely love and are heartbroken over needing to kill him and they only succeed in casting it by focusing on their hatred for riddle. It is also a bit wish-fulfillmenty/deux-ex-machina for my taste but maybe that focus makes it so that the curse only strikes riddles soul from harry's body.if you wanna go the tragic bait and switch route you can have them still be unsure if it worked/if riddle is gone and not believe Harry saying it's the case because it's what any villain with a brain would do as well so with tears in their eyes they finish the job some other way

*** Oh that sounds really good. This could probably make a really good one shot or two shot.

** Harry: Hermione tried to push me off the moving staircases this morning. She said it was for the Greater Good!

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled madly: She did? I'd like to have a word with her then.

** *Hermione:* ... and so that's why you have to die, according to Dumbledore.

*Ron:* Yeah, mate, but we're your friends, and we don't care. We're going to stand by you, come what may!

*Harry:* Guys... /[hugs them]/ Thank you so much! But I can't risk this being true! /[tops himself]/

*Ron:* /[looking at/ */Harry's/* /corpse]/ Blimey, I can't believe that worked!

*Hermione:* Well, Dumbledore is pretty manipulative. He makes good plans.

*Ron:* Man... And I spent a week practising the Killing Curse for nothing!

*Hermione:* I believe that no learning is truly wasted. So, what's for lunch?

** Rise of the Wizards arguably does this to some degree.

It's not quite what you're looking for, as there's still the bashing you're trying to avoid.

*** This probably has the most irrational, over the top and unbelievably stupid hermione that I've ever read.

Seeing has this also has a neo-nazi harry that makes a wizard ethnostate I think it makes sense the author made Hermione so beyond the pale stupid and anti-harry
