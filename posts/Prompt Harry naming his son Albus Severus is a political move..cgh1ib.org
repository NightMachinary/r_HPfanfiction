I can imagine that after the war very few people would be willing to give Snape the credit he was due. He would be known as the killer of Dumberdorw and the Headmaster who sanctioned the torture of students.

There's only so much good will I could expect Harry to be able to create given how little evidence he has, as well as how fickle the wizard if world is. Especially with people like Rita Skeeter running around. And just because Harry defeated Voldemort doesn't mean everyone will now like or believe everything he says. Dumbledore defeating Grindelwald ended up mattering very little when it came to swaying public opinion in the face of a propaganda machine.

So in order to combat all of this, Harry names his son after Snape. The great wizard Dumbledore and the man who killed him, juxtaposed together in the savior of he wizard of world's child. Given how in general people are moved more by their hearts than logic, I can see this more than anything helping to convince people that Snape actually was a double agent.


** I can totally see that. I would go as far as to claim that the whole “Albus Severus” is a political move.

Privately, Harry should be rather pissed at Dumbledore. But in post Battle Britain, their hold on power had been shaky at best early on, so they used Dumbledore as some kind of symbol and flag to rally around.

The fact that Dumbledore died in the line of duty must have appeared like a martyr to a huge portion of Wizarding Britain. Harry could claim as his heir in addition to his status as “The Boy Who Triumphed”. He could push through lots of agenda under Dumbledore's name, even though they are his and his friends's ideas to begin with.

Thus, the public expects him to pay some kind of tribute to Dumbledore, and he did it by naming one of kids after him. It's not necessarily fair to his child, but in real world politics, people will sacrifice a lot more to meet public expectations.

Harry was pissed at Dumbledore, but forgave him during their talk when Harry died. He even notes how he cant be angry at Dumbledore anymore.

*** I agree with that. In fact, James Sirius's middle name might be at least in part intended as a message to the general public as well. After all, wizards were hearing stories about 'Sirius Black, crazy psycho Azkaban escapee, You-Know-Who's right-hand man' for a decade and a half, and even after Harry cleared his name after his death, it would still be in the public consciousness.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

** Did most of the wizarding world know that snape killed Dumbledore? The prophet was implying that harry killed Dumbledore and iirc he mostly told other order members, not the school, though I may be misremembering.

I feel like if it was well known knowledge that the dude who murdered like MLK was now the Dean of Hardard or some shit that there would have been a lot more outrage and people would have left.

The book never seemed to explain why people didnt try to leave to another country. Like, it's not hard to apparate and it's never mentioned if wizards have border control in other countries.

*** The school knew. They were there at the BotAT, and noone was surprised when Harry exclaimed that Snape killed Dumbledore during the Snape v McGonagall duel.
