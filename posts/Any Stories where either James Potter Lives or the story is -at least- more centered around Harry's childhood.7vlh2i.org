** As far as whether I would read that story, it really depends on what the plot is. James surviving isn't really a plot, it's something that happened in the past.

As far as I know, there aren't that many people that will turn down a good story just because it has James Potter in it.

If James surviving is your only search parameter, off the top of my head, linkffn(2913149; 11191235)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern). Not quite what you're asking for, but James figures into it.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Dream Come True by grand admiral chelli). Voldemort banished James to hell, but he comes back. I didn't like this one.

There's another one I can't remember the name of, but Harry is the BWL and has a twin (or at least a brother). Lily doesn't love James, but married him at Dumbledore's urging. She wants to go with Dumbledore's plans for their safety, but James decides otherwise. He ends up raising the boys on his own.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
