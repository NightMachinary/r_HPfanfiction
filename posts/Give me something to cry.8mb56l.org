I'm looking for a fix that would make me cry. It has to be a little long so you can connect to characters and when someone dies you can cry your eyes out. It could be something with time travel and marauders. Maybe something with harry losing everyone and everything. Maybe Harry dies I don't know I just want fic to make you in love with a character and than take him/her away.


** It's s crossover with Discworld, but really amazing and so sad.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/54obkd/request_something_to_have_a_good_cry_over/d83sx2a]] is first and foremost the most comprehensive thing I have for you.

linkffn(Speak Softly, Love by Silens Cursor) fits very well, except its about Antonin Dolohov. Very solid.

linkffn(Don't You Worry by Potato19) deals with Harry's wife dying in childbirth and the father he became. Has its tear jerking moments.

linkffn(Letters by Morning Lilies) is solid as well.
