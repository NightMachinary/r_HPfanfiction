Okay, so I've noticed that in a lot of fics (even very highly reviewed and liked ones) characters mention pranks and practical jokes incessantly... without ever following through. Like otherwise serious characters will have entire prank wars with eachother that the reader isn't privy to outside of the occasional "I'll prank you for this!"

I legitimately don't get it, the only characters that we see being into pranks are the Weasley twins and maybe the marauders.

Why do fics suddenly have McGonagall Penn-and-Tellering the other professors and then offscreen of all things?

Can someone explain where it's from, or why its never shown i. e committed to?

(This is my first reddit post btw - so, if I'm doing anything wrong, apologies.)

EDIT: wow i sure wrote 'these all' instead of 'all these' lmao

** well a lot of the pranks that are written in fics aren't funny or even pranks imo.

Giving Cho a truth serum mixed with a bragging potion so she spills how she molested Harry is for example not a prank.

Also targeting one particular person over and over (Draco Malfoy) is actually bullying, even if he is a racist or bully in your story. Especially if it is things like destroying their home work, changing their clothes, getting rid of their clothes, giving them a rash from itching powder...

Harmless things that disrupt the monotony of school life however can be fun. I can't remember the title put in one fic Fred and George made the stairs play different tunes when you step on them. Now that is in the beginning chaos but can lead to some fun scenes like playing the Hogwarts Song on them.

As someone who has worked in a secondary school as a teacher I am quite happy that besides pranks done by graduating classes, these pranks are seen by students as juvenile. They prefer making funny / snarky comments to make others laugh. +Well and the occasional cock and balls on the blackboard.+

** Good pranks are funny, and also very hard to write. I know, since I'm seven chapters in to a story about the young Weasley twins' pranks. Doing light frivolity well is hard work.

I think writers who merely allude to hilarious pranks without describing them are cheating, trying to get credit for wit without actually being witty.
