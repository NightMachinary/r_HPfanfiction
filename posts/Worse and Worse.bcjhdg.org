I'm looking for a fan fiction where Harry, shortly after defeating Voldemort, goes back in time in his body as a child and try to save as many people as possible. But instead of getting better things get worse, and he keeps going back in time but he'll never be able to fix things.

Eventually Harry goes mad and somehow destroys the world himself, but it's optional.


** Ultimately Harry is alone on a barren Earth. Alone with his thoughts he still wants to correct things... whatever the means. If going back to his previous self cannot help then he must find something else, something more. In a last bout of madness he finds a way to send a part of him earlier than even his birth but only his stronger feelings go through as it's not his body.

With so many years in darkness, what is sent is the feelings that are the most deep rooted in his psyche. That the world isn't what it should have been. It must be corrected whatever it takes. But with that also. A deep loathing against Harry Potter. Naive boy who destroyed the future.

So when Tom Riddle receives those deep rooted but hidden and insidious feelings he can't separate them from his own wants and goals. So begins a quest to correct this world and when he hears about the Potter, he doesn't know why but they can't continue to exist or all will be lost. He first kills the elders but it's no use. Their son is already a man and soon to be a father. This can't be. This child cannot see the light of the world for he would only bring destruction.

  Harry gets another chance - and another and another. At some point, they stop feeling like chances at all.
