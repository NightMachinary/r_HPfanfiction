** I believe this is "they shook hands." Never got around to reading past the first few chapters, though. Draco was just way too ooc to start, I think.

*** That is exactly "They shook hands." Definitely worth reading imo. The entire Malfoy family is a bit OOC (and indeed, has an OC older brother) but it's a good series in its own right.
