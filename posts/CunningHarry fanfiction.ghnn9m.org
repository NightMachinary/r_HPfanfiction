Hello!

I'm currently obsessed with fics where Harry arrives at Hogwarts much more Slytherin and more prone to the dark (if not already dark) than canon. For example, I just finished [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13893606/chapters/31970736][/souls touch, and the future changes/]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][/Evitative/]] by Vichan and am currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8704528/1/Enveloped-in-the-Darkness][/Enveloped in the Darkness/]] by Brigade.

I'm not sure how to describe what I like about these fics, but I'll try. What I'm liking about them is the character study. I like the details about what has happened to him and how that has changed him. I loved the Slytherin politicking in /Souls Touch./ I want him to struggle but I want it to be more realistic than I see in a lot of fics where he goes to the goblin, find out he's a Lord and suddenly has all the money, allies, and know-how to pull one over the most powerful people in the wizarding world.

Basically, I guess I am looking for *long*, *complete*, *well-written* *cunning and intelligent Harry*. I am open to *any pairing* or none. Any recommendations?


** The only requirement this doesn't meet is being complete, but it is 130k and updates every Saturday. It will be over a million words when all is said and done --- likely quite a bit over. linkffn(13507192)

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
