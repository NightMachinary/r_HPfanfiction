Looking for a fic where Harry is sorted into Slytherin but has no friends within the house beginning of 1st year. Snape hates and refuses to mentor him. Marcus Flint steps up and mentors Harry 1st year. Second year Snape wises up and tries to build a mentorship but Harry tells him off. The troll incident happens first year with Harry, Neville, and Hermione. Mcgonagall gives Neville and Hermione points but leaves Snape to deal with Harry. Snape grounds Harry for being Gryffindorish so he's forced to spend time with Slytherins. He has to be escorted everywhere, normally by Flint. Third year Lupin goes to Snape for advice on Harry and Snape tells him how he messed up and Harry isn't very forgiving.

  What if Petunia put the blame where it belonged instead of on Harry? OOC Petunia Dursley Rating for mild language
