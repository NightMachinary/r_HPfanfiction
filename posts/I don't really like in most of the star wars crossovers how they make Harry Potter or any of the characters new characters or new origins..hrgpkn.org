I have been reading some star wars-harry potter crossovers fanfics and most of them are just cringy because they tried to make Harry or his friends jedi. There has only been two I enjoyed and that is the Stars Crossed and Potter in time. Both of them I enjoy because it feels like a normalish star wars-harry potter with the each side of the characters having meaningful interactions. Like in potter in time, The skywalkers reminded me of the wesley's. And in the Crossed stars, it makes the golden trio in danger and human. I really do hope they update both of these.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

*** Yeah, it these stories that I don't really like, it is just weird. I always like it where it is either the Harry Potter Characters in the Star Wars world scare and confuse or the star wars universe in Harry Potter's world. I like the stories when they feel natural. That is why I enjoyed Stars Crossed and Potter in time because it feels more natural.

  An aged, broken Jedi general came to Earth hoping to retire. However, when he went to a park and saw a young boy with unlimited Force potential getting the snot beat out of him, he knew the Force was not through making his life interesting.
