I'm looking for a fanfic were Luna Lovegood is the MC, not one of the MC's.. THE mc. I'm hoping to find one were she acts crazy but she's doing it for people to underestimate her, and she trains like crazy, a serious fic not some 'on crack' fic. I've found some like this but she wasn't the MC. I don't even know if there is one out there with my exact requirements.


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15842229/chapters/36893670]]) this Luna/Hermione fic is the nearest I can think of atm im afraid hope femslash is okay? I'd say Luna is the joint main character with Hermione and they share 90% of scenes together. Luna is very powerful in this fic and there are scenes of her and Hermione training in wandless non-verbal magic something this version of Luna is great at. Luna is also a lot more knowing in this fic and seems to sometimes be seen to be putting on an act or using nargles and such as a way to cope with her house mates bullying her. Its mostly very fluffy fun stuff but has gotten darker and more serious as of late due to Bellatrix Lestrange being introduced. I hope its mayeb close to what you want? if not.. sorry i tried lol

  While patrolling the castle one evening Hermione runs into a certain someone or rather falls over a certain someone. A rather odd someone in fact, who is in need of a little help.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasly loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

**** *MC* is usually used by rappers in their names. [[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3fterm=MC&amp=true][It usually means Master of Ceremonies, or mic controller]]. People often think of *MC* as a prefix for a rapper's name instead of *M*ain *C*haracter.

** Would love to read such a story too. Just this week I dreamed I was writing a HP fan fic from the point of view of a Ravenclaw. If I don't find that story, I may put that dream into reality myself.
