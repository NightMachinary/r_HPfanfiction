Title pretty much covers it. Preferably 100K+ words and complete, but not necessary.


** Here's an awesome one. Long and complete, with a sequel that's a WIP:

** My personal favorites:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]] - V. Long, 6-7th Year, Excellent characterisation, - Unfortunately WiP (or abandoned).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2429621/1/I-ll-Take-it-Shaken-Not-Stirred][I'll Take it Shaken Not Stirred]] - Long, 7th Year, Excellent characterisation (Same Auther as TLAT), - Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10939132/1/An-Unexpected-Attraction][An Unexpected Attraction]] - V. Long, 7th Year & Beyond, Multi Character POV, kinda full of Drama, but I like it - WIP, with regular updates.

#+end_quote

It's basically an OP Harry fic where he outsmarts/overpowers everyone. If you're not a fan of that, then no. If you're in it for the romance, no. If you don't like the beginning chapters, then no. It was started by 2 people and one of them left early on and, IMO, it showed. It won't get any better than beginning.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3503913/1/You-Want-To-Make-A-Memory][You Want To Make A Memory?]] - Canon relationships. Long and complete. Covers all 7 years at Hogwarts and beyond.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1110486/chapters/2235718][the lost generation]] - Canon compliant Remus/Sirius and James/Lily, but focuses on platonic relationships. Incomplete, but still updating. Haven't caught up with this one/read it in a while, but I think it covers all 7 years at Hogwarts.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1657883/chapters/3517166][Strays]] - AU, with Remus/Sirius. Complete. Covers the time after Hogwarts, with the premise that Remus did not attend Hogwarts and meets Sirius + friends in the Order.

** linkffn(9757451) Three Turns is a Hermione and Harry time travel to Mauraders Area, but it's complete with a plot. I also feel that it gets the feel of the Mauraders and makes them the stupid, funny teenagers they were and not the super brooding, amazing at magic type you see a lot. It's really lighthearted with a hint of seriousness when it comes to Voldemort.
