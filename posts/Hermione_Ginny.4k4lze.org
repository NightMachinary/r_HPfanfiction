Links to best Hermione/Ginny relationship stories. Short story preferred.


** I really enjoyed linkffn(Image of You by angelic1hp), though I can see why it's not for everyone. Dark as fuck, includes cheating and intense guilt, but /so/ worth it in the end. Then again, I prefer fics that really make you really work for your happy ending.

  The engagement party of Ron and Hermione is one that Ginny really didn't want to attend. Ginny's tried to lose herself in alcohol, sex and a relationship with a man she could never love until the one she wanted comes back into her life. Femmeslash HGGW

** The best one I've ever read: [[http://questionablecontent.net/spacewizards.html][Space Wizards]]. Written by fictional character Marigold Farmer, who is written by Jeph Jacques.

Probably not what you're looking for, but it's mildly amusing.
