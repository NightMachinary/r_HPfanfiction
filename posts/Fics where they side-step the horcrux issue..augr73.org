It seems to me that while it might not be easy per se, it might be a lot easier to crucio Voldemort into a vegetable. Whatever it took for the Longbottoms? Lets triple it. Then obliviate the bejesus out of Vegetablemorte. Voila, one permanently incapacitated Dark Lord.

It doesn't have to be that specifically, but I'm looking for any fics where they deal with him without playing into his horcrux game.

HPMOR and A Black Comedy (kinda) are two that I can think of off the top of my head that fit.


** linkffn(The Connection Reversed).

Just a somewhat humourous one-shot, but it ditches the horcruxes.

  "Clear your mind!" wasn't actually the best advice. Harry is fed up and takes things into his own hands and discovers a way to end the war on his own terms. No one was expecting this of the Gryffindor Golden Boy.

** I like this idea (does that make me a bad person?) but the problem I could see with that approach would be when he does die naturally, he would quite possibly return from a hit of his souls that is functional and does have memories. It also doesn't take care of the death eaters.

***** Yeah, I would assume that a Horcrux would contain the memories and feelings of Tom Riddle or Voldemort from the time that he made it, so if he was resurrected from it, he would regain those memories and likely the physical strength. Turning Voldy into a Veggie doesn't make the Death Eaters disappear either, and there would still be people who want to see him dead. Anyone could kill him and a Death Eater could them resurrect him, then you'd just be back at square one, possibly even worse because the whole process would be more secretive.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
