:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read it about 5 years ago and it wasn't updated?

I don't remember much but I think the context was that 3/4 founders had planned before they died to come back into new bodies sometime in the future (Hufflepuff chose not to). I remember that Harry was Slytherin, Ron was Gryffindor and Hermione was Ravenclaw.

I think Harry like 'awakened' first and then helped prompt Ron and Hermione, and I think there was this arc in the story where the trio made everyone forget about their normal identities as Harry/Ron/Hermione.

I dunno hahaha, it was so long ago but I've been trying to find it for an eternity. Might not even be any good, don't remember at all


** I tried to find it some time ago (year or two), but all my searching (days) was in vain. I remember it wasn't very difficult to find previously, so my only explanation is that it was deleted from ffn.

*** yeah that's the conclusion I came to as well, since I stumbled on it pretty easily when I first found it. :( Thanks!

** Is the story you're looking for one of the one's below.\\
Both seems to have Harry (Slytherin), Ron (Gryffindor), Hermoine (Ravenclaw), and Ginny (Hufflepuff) and they all go back.\\
Granted, this does differ from what you said since you said you thought Hufflepuff decided not to go back so it might not be it.

linkffn(The Founders Four)\\
linkffn(What-Went-Wrong)

They were both on my reading list (I read a few chapters of each in the past, but it's been awhile I forgot most of it).

I know there is 1 more that I remember reading (it's not either of the above I said) that had the same premises (with the same 4 people).\\
I'll check my fanfiction downloaded stories and see if I might have that one (with 3 of 4 founders) since now that you mention it, that story does sound a little familar.

  On a dark and stormy night, the staff and students of Hogwarts were taken by surprise when four mysterious figures appeared outside on the grounds. Who are they and why do they look like the Founders? What does this mean for the war? AU Time travelling

  Their plans all worked, but the cost was too high. Voldemort might have died in the long run, but he takes so many people with him that it cannot possibly be considered a 'victory'. So a group of four decide to send themselves back in time to fix it... What could possibly go wrong? Alternate Reality; Time travel; Reincarnated Founders; Harry is Salazar; Canon pairs

*** Woah, awesome! Thanks for the reply!

Yeah, I'm not 100% sure if either of these stories are the one I was referring to (It would definitely be a lot older than What Went Wrong, haha I'm ancient), but they seem to be along almost exactly the same line/trope. So thanks for bringing them to my attention! Sometimes I feel as though I've read [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] dry xD

**** I found one much closer to what you were talking about:\\
linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550820/1/Strange-Visitors-From-Another-Century]])

I started reading it and it seems Harry, Ron, and Hermione went back (unintentionally) but not Ginny this time.\\
The 3 of them end up 1000 years in the past and end up right in front of the 4 founders.

  The destruction of the time turners in the Department of Mysteries throws Harry, Ron and Hermione a thousand years into the past. There they meet the Founders of Hogwarts, who are not at all pleased about what has happened to their school. They decide that something must be done.
