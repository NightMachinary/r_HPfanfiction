Over the past year, I've been noticing a decline in the rate of new fanfics and updates of existing ones. Is it just me thinking this or is it actually happening and is there a reason for it?

Not a troll post, but genuinely curious. Many fandoms on fanfic.net seems to be less active to me.


** The last book was published almost 12 years ago, with the last movie being almost 8 yrs old.

All attempts to expand the universe (Cursed Child, Fantastic Beasts) were nowhere as popular as the original story.

**** The problem with it is because it wasn't a complete movie. They did what a lot of movies try to do where a movie leads to the next.

The problem is that most of the time they do it in a convoluted way instead of a seamless one, resulting in a movie that feels "incomplete".

It had a ton of sub-plots that didn't go anywhere, left too many questions unanswered and just felt off in general. And that is not even mentioning some dubious writing decisions related to the world-lore.

*** I'm pretty sure this is it, but then I started reading HP fanfic when I was 11. My FFN account is almost 15 years old and I waited until I was 13 to make the thing. I had this thought within 6 months of DH being published. The stuff people were coming out with between books was incredible. And then, all at once, I couldn't find anything to hold my attention. It's not like people stopped writing "Here's what I think will happen next" fics... and even if they did... for the most part they weren't really my thing unless one hit it big. I like the full length AU's that start with one little change - Remus finds out the truth, gets Sirius out of Azkaban and they both raise Harry starting when he's four here's how everything changes type of thing. Those just seemed to... stop. Idek. But I did to.

I kept following Dangerverse but otherwise essentially left HP fanfic behind until a week or so ago when I suddenly missed it.

Still can't find much of anything. And... my favorites list on FFN is essentially empty except for the stuff from my '09-'11 Glee kick so all the old ones apparently got deleted.

Really, I think you guys are still going strong, especially considering there's only so much material to go over for the 10 millionth time. But yeah, pretty sure HP fanfic's been dying for years.

I'm not bored with it. I just can't find anything to read.

***** You know, I thought somebody might ask, lol, but it's hard to say.

My biggest problem before was that everything got flooded with Snily and Snarry, Drarry and Dramione got worse, and Next Gen fics where Harry and co are... an after thought. When it comes to the core group I like my canon ships, okay, and with the Next Gen stuff... they're like a quarter step above OCs and the fanon versions didn't exist yet. I couldn't find what I wanted because all I could find was stuff I knew I /didn't/ want.

Lately (as in the past couple of years lol) I've been in the mood for Dudley redemption and post war recovery, but wasn't really feeling all that picky so...

This past week or so I went to AO3, excluded all the ships I know I don't like, a bunch of "uh...no" ships, and quite a few "wait, what?" ships until I got a mix of "Yes, I like this" and "sure, why not." I didn't even mark a main ship to exclude from just excluded a bunch of things. Marked complete. Took out crossovers because they've never really been my thing and I wasn't in the mood. And sorted by Kudo's.

60 pages later and at least a 80 attempted fics later.... I'd finished something like 15. Things like writing style or characterization kept making me back out. These are the four I enjoyed enough to bookmark.

They're all essentially post war (way post war for most of them) character studies.

The first [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31886][one]] I clicked on it for Dudley redemption and got pulled into... whatever that was... but it was a fun ride even though Snape? Don't care. I was invested in the kid.

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/304864][second]] one's my favorite and I'm not even sure why I clicked on it in the first place... Percy or James Sirius have never been characters of interest for me.

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8125531][third]] one one... well I've had a soft spot for Professor Potter since OotP came out. He's... becomes what Remus was to him I think for a bunch of kids.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1068305][fourth]] one is old enough that I should have found it before I dropped HP fic altogether, but Fred and George were never my focus. Basically how it goes from Fred/Angelina to George/Angelina.

There's nothing more recent then 2016. I tried to single out what it is I like about them, changed the search, and tried again but found.... well nothing.

I'd definitely like a long immediately post DH recovery fic focused on Harry, I think, but anything I could find that happened was a one shot that went something like... "Harry wakes up from nightmare in Grimmuald Place. Ginny follows him downstairs. He just unloads on her. They kiss and go back to bed. She's still 16 and they're living together." There was at least 5 of them.

or a... Lupins Live, Teddy/James Sirius get together AU told from Harry or Remus' perspective could be fun.

and I'm still a fan of mostly canon but Harry's raised by X AUs... but I tried all of the ones recommended on here before I even went through here looking for a rec list.

****** Hmm, interesting. Recently, I've seen many stories focusing on a female Harry, which just doesn't float my boat. I'm also more into post-War but am not a fan of the canon pairings. My preferred ones are Harry/Hermione and Charlie/Hermione. I actually don't read any stories of the characters at Hogwarts anymore because it just doesn't interest me. Post-DH has a plethora of ways you could go and isn't a retread of what canon was. But I can't say I'm much of a fan of AO3. I mean, it's alright but the tagging system is disastrous. I mainly operate on FF.

It's honestly annoying, because there's some stories and crossovers that I wish would be written - why don't we have a truly amazing HP/GOT crossover yet that's actually finished? Or a HP/SW one? Or HP/Marvel? - but no ones done them, and I'm not even close to talented or patient enough to do it myself.

ps. I mostly mention crossovers because I feel I've read almost everything I could ever want with straight HP stories.

Hermione and even Harry would be able to completely revolutionise the word, even with elementary school knowledge. Stuff like the printing press, microbiology, even basic forms of electricity (lighting, telegraph) or flight (hot air balloons would already be a huge military advantage). Since bells are a thing in Westeros, you could have cannons within a few months. And considering how transfiguration works, Hermione would have a running steam engine within a few days.

This is so silly, man. You're not seriously suggesting that reading a couple of books on dentistry is going to make someone capable of starting a revolution in anything, are you? That reading a couple of books on /anything/ is going to make you capable of such things?

The average college student wouldn't know how to build a steam engine from scratch, much less a girl who stopped her muggle education at the age of 11. Same goes for the printing press. You don't learn how to build these things with some rudimentary knowledge you found in a couple of books.

Hermione would easily stomp through practically all issues in the GoT universe, but there's no way she'd start some science revolution. Hermione's smart, but she isn't literally a walking encyclopedia of everything that's ever existed and how it works. You're glorifying her to unreasonable levels.

You can build one basically using Legos and stamps. I am talking about Gutenberg style printing presses, not the stuff used to print papers nowadays. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Single_Acting_Oscillating_cylinder_steam_engine.gif][And basic steam engines are not that difficult to figure out]], especially if you have transfiguration to go through ten ideas an hour through trial and error.

Transfigure something, use the gemini charm to make it self-replicating and you basically have an infinite amount of stuff. There is nothing in canon which would stop such world-breaking things.

Pretty much completely worthless. Without a way to prove it you'd be called a charlatan. You couldn't even rely on results because you don't actually have medicines.

Steam engines existed since antiquity too, but they were worthless without the engineering and material sciences advances required to make them efficient and powerful enough to do anything of note, and the same goes for most technology.

The "go to the past and revolutionize tech with high school education" trope is mega bullshit.

​

I mean sure, you could handwave all of that away with transfiguration, but that's cheap as fuck and it would break the setting. Can you even do magic in GoT without being persecuted? I seem to remember the maesters and the church being very against that sort of stuff.

But as a whole you're right. HP magic is too 'all powerful' to not just destroy everything in Westeros. Imagine if Harran the Black's best wizard friend just Transfigured Balerion into a kitten. Goodbye Aegon I.

There's nothing in GoT that could effectively counter HP magic. And the only real ways around it, like say the Red Priests of the Warlocks of Qarth, or possibly even the Faceless Men are too far removed from the actual plot that it would be a struggle to make it interesting for the average fan of both.

** Just as a random check I looked at the Browse option on ffnet for English language HP stories and had to get down to p10 before things were older than 24h. So that's ~250 stories new or updated in the last day. I have no idea how that compares to a decade ago but it's not shabby. Nor do I have any idea of the quality of those 250. Wow, there's even a new story from Rorschach's Blot - linkffn(13179863).

I think there's been a lot fewer generic redo-with-minor-changes sort of stories and more that go substantially AU - linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) and linkffn(Cleansing the Sins of the Past) are two personal favourites.

We get bogged down by very specific character likes and dislikes and it affects how we search for new fics and which ones we'll bother to read. I personally find it incredibly difficult to read new works by unknown writers because I'm a stickler for really well written stories and completed stories.

That seems bizarre. How are you going to find good stuff if you don't even try? How 'incredibly difficult' can it be? Every well known writer was unknown once. You are doing us a great disservice. And frankly, a few paragraphs will at least tell you if the writing is of a good standard. It's only a few minutes of your time.

If everybody shared your attitude, no new writers would even bother to post. Then there really wouldn't be any new fics to read.

This is much less than what's on ffn, but a lot of them aren't on ffn (some are crossposted there, some on lj, etc). Now, not everything is amazing and there are A LOT of multi-fandom xovers (not my cup of tea). I think ao3 has an overall better interface and search engine as well, plus it allows you to download works as PDF, HTML, EPUB, and MOBI so it can be read offline. Plus, no ads!

But enough of my free advertising! I don't think HP fanfiction is dead. I've been reading HP fanfiction since I was a wee lass of 11 (I'm now 21) and I haven't noticed a significant decline in the volume of fanfiction being produced.

Personally I would totally be down with a HP MMORPG to be honest but I think I will have to wait forever for that.

But I honest to god doubt that the fandom will every be actually "dead". The franchise is too big, the community to gigantic. Fics in numbers may decline, updates slow down, but truly dead? We still have to wait many years for that to happen, I believe.

  It's really good, and just now starting to pick up steam. It's also pretty far off canon. The Red Wedding was much smaller in scale. Tyrion's trial is pushed forward. I don't think there's been mentions of the Others yet.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  Hermione realized it began with a sense of Impending Doom and finished with a battle outside her tent. The deciding line between staying and helping Robb Stark, or returning to her universe, is getting harder to see the longer she's in Westeros. But it's a decision that she has to make, or it's one that will be made for her. Part 1 complete; Part 2 is now ongoing!

** I don't know that it's dying, but it's probably slowing down from the high point of when the original books and movies were coming out. I was very active from about 2005 till a bit after the DH book and then I didn't write anything until 2016. Since then, I've completed and posted 15 new works, including a 39 chapter book. I'm currently working on a story for a Valentines challenge and when that's done, I have another one to work on plus ideas for several others. I'm part of a pretty active community of writers on Discord and we're all toiling away, apparently in obscurity because people think the fandom is dying with nothing new coming out.

**** Remove your word count thing and it jumps to 76,000+ even with excluding almost every significant pairing in the fandom. 15k words is more than a lot of oneshots have; I know the one fic I've published, a single-chapter non-slash Death Eater!Harry, is only about 2500 words long. It'd also cut out new stories that otherwise match, which might need the views/kudos/encouragement. It seems unnecessarily harsh.

You do you, though.

** It should perhaps also be noted that it is easier for fandoms to get separated/fragmented, and thus seem a bit smaller than they actually are, even when compared to 5/10 years ago.

Over the years, there have been websites for specific portions of fandoms that have closed down, just from the effort required to keep them running if nothing else, or platforms just dying out in use (looking at you, livejournal). In comparison, it is MUCH easier to have subreddits dedicated to specific pairings (there are four in the side bar alone) or even specific fics (again, there are two in the side bar alone). If reddit closes down it obviously becomes an issue, but at least for now there is a profusion of folks just going into their separate corners with Reddit handling the high effort/back end portions of running the site. A survey of Discord servers (again, fans letting someone else handle back end details of running a server) would probably find similar communities as well (I know, for example, that Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin has a dedicated Discord server) Tumblr contributes to this as well (though we will have to see what all the repercussions to that platform are post "porn exodus"

Moreover, with this fragmentation, content can become more and more niche, such that less gets "published" because it doesn't have the wide audience that would justify doing so. As an example, I will take the Naruto fanfic Dreaming of Sunshine.

While I personally really like the fic, this isn't a stump speech for it. It will simply suffice to say that it has a very active community in terms of writing recursive fiction and crossovers for it. /A lot/ has been written (and even that is something of an understatement). But the vast majority of it is written within the shared forum dedicated to the fic. And the stuff that is published to Ao3 or fanfiction.net understandably has a limited audience. Not because it isn't good/great, but because just to have a baseline understanding of what's going on requires knowledge of two works (Naruto canon/Dreaming of Sunshine). And that's not getting into the stuff that builds on other DoS fanfiction, essentially fanfiction that's recursive 2, 3, 4, 5, even 6 times over. While I love a whole lot of it, I completly understand it not having a wide readership given the rabbit hole required to jump down in order to understand everything.

** I disagree with one of the recurring points being made in this thread; that the overall standard of the fanfics have dropped. In my experience, the opposite is true; during FFN's heyday it was chock full of young teens, whereas now, the demographic has shifted in favour of maturity. True, there are less 'good fics' being published nowadays, but it's because of an overall massive reduction in quantity, not a statistical decrease in average quality
