Looks like an interesting concept so far. If Alastair Jr. is a muggleborn, however (I think I read the story correctly), I'm a bit confused as to why he has a house-elf, since those are typically inherited. Maybe he's a half-blood and his mum's a witch? Anyway, I'm curious as to what might happen next.
