Has anyone written a fic that covers someone chasing/hunting former death eaters/Voldermort sympathizers who have escaped Magical Britain by fleeing overseas?

I just have this sudden urge to read something that covers the wizarding world equivalent of Ratlines and I was wondering if anyone had any recs.

*** Thanks for the rec. I've actually finished Sum of Their Parts, and it may be responsible for me wanting different takes on post war Death Eater hunting.

It doesn't even need to be Harry that does the hunting. It could be a vigilante that Harry has to stop because their methods are too insane.

**** In that case, what about linkffn(The Aurors by FloreatCastellum)? It fits your second situation pretty much to a T.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  February 2000 Newly Qualified (in record time) Auror Harry Potter remains obsessed with ‚ÄúThe List.‚Äù The ten people still wanted for their part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Their capture is essential. It will bring closure to the events of the past few years. Harry has set himself a target. He wants to see ‚ÄúThe Last Death Eater‚Äù and the other nine captured before the second anniversary of the battle. His attempts to meet his target will bring heartbreak, danger, pain, and a lifechanging injury for one former DA member.

** Linkffn(miles to go before I sleep by rannaro) is one where Snape survives the Battle of Hogwarts and helps round up the Death Eaters that also survived. They don't go international, but it's still fun and well written.

Edit: not the one I wanted; ffnbot!refresh

  This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?
