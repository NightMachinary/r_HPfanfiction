Fic where uses forbidden magics in secret or finds ancient tome full powerful spells... Something of this kind..


** Since not everyone has read the original, could you elaborate a bit more about what exactly you're looking for?

Just dark and forbidden magic being a thing? How should Harry react to it? How much is it used? In secret or openly as outlaw? In what direction is the plot going?
