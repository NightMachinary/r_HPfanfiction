Can anyone give me a good reason why Death Eaters that were caught weren't executed? As far as I know the punishment for treason is execution not life imprisonment l.

If all the Death Eaters that escaped Azkaban were executed then Sirius, Remus, Tonks and Fred would have been alive. They were killed by Bellatrix, Dolohov and Rookwood, all caught at the end of the first war.


** Firstly, if Sirius can be sentenced to life imprisonment without a trial, then there's nothing stopping them from executing him without a trial.

Secondly, Sirius's death was accidental and there is no indication that Bellatrix wanted to kill him.

We don't know this for a fact. For all we know there could be a whole slew of spells all equally nasty in their capacity to deal death that cover the red shade of the light spectrum.

Yes. In many places of the world, there is no death penalty. Apparently, the wizarding world is one of them.

Here's what you should have asked, though (or maybe meant, and didn't clarify): Why didn't the Death Eaters get the Dementor's Kiss?

And the answer to that is that it appears the Kiss is limited to escapees from Azkaban, since Azkaban is considered unbreakable, and no one imagined people would ever return from there.

*** I mean, the Kiss basically is the death penalty I think. Presumably it is the punishment for escaping from Azkaban on the principle that you have proved you can't be locked up, so the Ministry has no other option, even if they don't like it.

***** I think that's more of a fan theory. In books it's just implied that the Dementor went loose and attacked Barty Crouch Jr, presumably because it identified him as an escapee from Azkaban.

****** I've wondered about this one myself; given that the Aurors were introduced in that same book, wouldn't it have been more logical for Fudge to use an Auror or similarly trained wizard as his bodyguard rather than a Dementor?\\
For that matter, what obligation did he have to come and see Barty Crouch Jr. for himself, in lieu of sending an Auror representative?\\
 \\
I think, last time I thought about this, I reached the conclusion that Fudge's decision to bring a dementor with him was a continuation of the kiss-on-sight order on Sirius Black; the last time a Death Eater (or alleged Death Eater, that is, Sirius) was apprehended in Hogwarts, despite only being left unattended for a couple of minutes, he escaped before he could be subjected to the Kiss.\\
Thus, acting on the assumption that the captured Death Eater might be Sirius again, Fudge brought a dementor with him so that the Kiss could summarily be issued if it was Black. Of course, it wasn't Black, and the dementor jumped the gun on things.

******* I think that it's more of a case of Fudge recognizing that his position was at risk. A dead Champion after the tournament was made safer, an underage Champion after saying that nobody under seventeen would compete, and the reveal that there was /another/ escapee from Azkaban would've ruined him

** Well...in the first war against Voldemort, he and his followers made widespread use of the Imperius curse. Voldemort himself before the war made use of False Memory Charms to frame other people for the murders he committed (Morfin Gaunt and Hokey to name known victims).\\
With that in mind, it'd be very difficult to achieve a safe conviction of any Death Eater, even those caught in the act, simply because it'd be virtually impossible to prove that someone wasn't under the Imperius.\\
 \\
Though, in canon, Barty Crouch senior did authorise the Aurors to use Unforgivable Curses against suspects, and he did send Sirius to Azkaban without a trial (and the Lestranges with basically a show trial); in the latter cases, with Voldemort seemingly destroyed, the Imperius defense wouldn't hold much water (after all, who else would cast it?).

It is interesting that linkffn(11500936) got this right (and I have rather uneven relationship with this fic): executions of Death Eaters & co. were the last capital punishments in UK, then the queen abolished it even for the exceptional crimes like a treason.

** They clearly have capital punishment, since we know two methods of it: the Dementor's Kiss, and being thrown through the Veil.

Why wasn't it used? Well, why were so many others let off entirely? Corruption and family politics, corruption in that the ministry still had sympathizers plus people taking bribes, family politics in that it's a smallish community dominated by old families all calling in favors and applying pressure on getting the "right" outcomes.

So that, plus the fact that they thought Azkaban was inescapable like the Titanic was unsinkable. Hubris is a thing.

**** It's a thing they found which they aren't entirely sure what is or how it came to be. A Mystery, as it were.

The Veil wasn't deliberately built as some sort of magical guillotine though, if that's what you're asking. Or if it was, it was long enough ago that nobody remembers. It's believed to be (but not proven to be) a portal to Death, thus the Veil, i.e. between the living and dead. The one part they're mostly sure about is that it's a one-way door to "don't know, but nothing we've sent through has come back, even the really persistently unpleasant stuff."

It's managed by Unspeakables, not Aurors, which I gather is only a bit of researching hidden truths and more of Magical SCP whose main job is to keep shit nobody understands bottled up as securely as possible so that it doesn't destroy reality or spontaneously render the Statute of Secrecy moot.

From context, I'd assume the Veil is used for executions either when the prisoner can demand a more dignified death due to social status than is implied by a ghoul sucking your soul out and slowly digesting it Sarlacc style, or else as a method of dealing with cases which have gone excessively SCP shaped that they have reason to believe "feed it to a dementor" is no longer sufficient to make whatever it is die properly and stay that way.

As far as noble / rich / well-connected prisoners being executed goes, I'd also assume "sentence them to a Dementor's Kiss, then act surprised when it doesn't happen because the prisoner has taken poison / gotten a hold of their wand then eaten it / died quietly of a sudden heart attack no one questions despite it being easy to induce artificially" is a thing that comes up as often in wizard culture as it has historically in non-magical culture.
