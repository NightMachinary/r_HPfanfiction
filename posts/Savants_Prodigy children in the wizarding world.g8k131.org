Particularly gifted children in the Muggle world can skip years or even go almost directly to another academic level after just starting it for very rare cases. But what if a witch/wizard who lived in the wizarding world happened to be one of these highly intelligent and very rare people? Would they be allowed to attend Hogwarts before the age of eleven? If not, could they skip years once there if they prooved to be advanced enough in their classes?

Please don't say Dumbledore this or Tom Riddle that, the former was gifted but otherwise neurotypical and the latter, while sociopath, was only above average in terms of intelligence. Considering the number of witches and wizards, it is very unlikely for it to ever happen, but it's always nice to think about hypothetical scenarios. Otherwise, we would have considerably fewer fanfictions.


** In such a small school it would no doubt be perfectly feasible to advance a student into another year group. However, advancing in individual classes would be really challenging because of timetabling clashes. Most likely I think is that teachers are used to providing extension work to students who are moving through the material faster.

"Oh you've mastered the charm we're doing. Alright, if you look at the second half of the chapter in the book you'll see there's a list of 15 variations which have specific purposes. Work through that and see how far you get."

I think Dumbledore is also the sort of Headmaster who would encourage that approach rather than advancing into older years, in order to benefit the social education of the child.

** I think this is conflating a few things. There's Savant Syndrome, which is basically a person being a genius at one thing and not really functional at anything else; and there's being a genius, who may or may not be neurotypical. Why would we expect a savant to skip a grade in something, when a neurotypical genius didn't skip a grade in everything?

I am not sure where you are getting that Voldemort was "only above average". Throughout canon, everyone, friend or foe considers him to be a genius.

I think that one reason /not/ to let people skip grades in Hogwarts is that unlike mathematics---which is probably the most common subject for skipping grades---magical knowledge can be used to cause immediate and irreparable harm to oneself and others. So, you don't necessarily want someone learning the more dangerous magics until they have the maturity to handle them, even if they are prepared intellectually.

** This is only tangentially related to the topic, but this post made me realize just how much action-focused fanfics within the Potterverse could benefit from introducing very clearly, very early on a couple of Itachi and Haku--type characters, making it clear that there is always some child genius better than you, and enriching the cast due to the addition of god-level characters /other/ than Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald. It could be a really good way to balance and excuse making the /main character/ (presumably Harry himself) more powerful than his peers in his youth, or advancing faster than others, without the feeling of making a mary sue.

** I don't think that this is as common in Britain, and HP is set in Britain. As in, I've never heard of anyone being able to move up a year or stay behiind a year at /all/ and I'm British.

** There is a somewhat popular trope that postulates that Durmstrang lets you skip grades. It's found in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi), linkao3(Making Their Own Heroes by slythernim), and perhaps others.

In linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel), Hermione, a maths prodigy studies Arithmancy from her first year. She doesn't skip grades in any other subjects, though the reasons for that are a bit contrived, IMO.

I vaguely recall a fic in which Percy (and, later, Hermione) set out to take their OWLs early.

** There was a fic that covered this, only the students tested into 3rd year at 11 by taking tests at the Ministry.
