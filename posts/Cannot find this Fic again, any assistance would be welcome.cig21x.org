:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember it followed a circular time-travel structure that involved Harry, Luna, Hermione, Ron, Neville and Ginny being sent back in time by 6 hooded figures in the DOM. Once they were sent back, the hooded figures revealed themselves as the 6 and started to provide evidence to make some changes necessary to the wizarding world.

It followed the journey of the 6 as well, being sent back to Hogwarts where they used different identities to finish their education before returning to the present to send themselves back.

I can't remember if it was fanfiction or AO3 that it was posted, but it was above 60k words. I believe I read it in 2017/18 and it was a few years old possibly.

I believe it also involved Albus as a villain character that they had to make changes to save/improve the future whilst in the past.

Any help finding it would be appreciated.

Update: [[/u/Gilrand][u/Gilrand]] found it. Thank you for the assistance.


** Hey just a note for the future, it's better to put some actual description in your title. A lot of people on this sub don't even look at posts like this. Whereas if you put something in the title, people who recognize it are far more likely to respond.

** Was it the one that's Harry/Hermione and Lily alive? I think Harry was immune to the killing curse too, that was cringey.. Or maybe even this one? linkffn(Stages of Hope)

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
