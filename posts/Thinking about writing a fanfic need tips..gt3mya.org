So I'm thinking about writing a fanfic set in America. It follows a boy named Brian Eliss who loses his parents to deatheaters who fled after the battle of Hogwarts. Basically he is raised by his grandparents and attends Ilvermorny and is sorted into Wampus. Similar to the original series the fanfic wilk be follow all seven years of his schooling. So anyways one of the things is he inherits a notebook from his dad that details a spell he was working on and he begins to try and finish it. He actually completes in 6-7th year not sure yet. My question is what year should he get the notebook. I was thinking Christmas 3rd year but want opinions. Also will take any input for tips maybe ocs yall want or plot input.


** What is the main plot in this? Because just writing about the normal school years won't be appealing to most readers. Also, OCs are very difficult to present properly, but make sure none of them are Mary Stues. Other than that, I would recommend you to get a beta.

  What year should he get the notebook? I would recommend before 4th year and he finishes the spell the summer before 6th year so that he can try it out during his 7th year or something. Best of luck!

*** While each year will have it's own little thing the main plot will follow the New Salem group trying to invade Ilvermorny.

** Just keep a strong narrator all throughout and you basically have like 30% make use of the narrator as another writing tool, what I mean is, think about the kind of story that you want, what the narrative and main plot lines will be and choose a type of narrator that's going to help and advance your plot. That means no head hopping, no changing POV's unless it's s to advance the story and keep tabs on your characters during scenes so you don't unintentionally have plot holes. Most of all have fun and create a believable world, honestly world building will get you far with keeping reader interest, so make use of your literary resources, but smartly. Writing smart is just about using your sentences to the most, it's where that “show, don't tell” advice comes from. If you can write something that tells the reader a few things and shows them a few others you build a kind of rapport between reader, narrator and characters that to me is just gold. Take your time and most importantly don't take it too seriously, if you feel to deep you'll bleed all over your story.

*** Honestly I don't really need help with writing abilities as I'm not bad as a writer. What I wanted help was ironing out plots and for people to suggest OCs for me to fill the school with.

**** In that case, I think maybe summer after 3rd year should be nice. He would have time to realistically read over and research without the excitement of Hollidays, if he lives with grandparents he would have Christmas and traditions and diners and stuff with them. If he has friends he sees out of school that are involved in this plot it's easy for them to stay over and visit and work on the spell with him without pressing things such as homework, classes (during the school year) family commitments (during Christmas) Hope that helps

***** Yeah it does. Now I just need some characters to fill the school. I've got 5 so far as the core group but need some characters to make the school seem more real.

****** Well whatever you do don't just have all of them be unique and diverse. Don't get me wrong diversity and representation are great, but for all of them to be so is not believable. Not only you need to have a majority demography, but it's exhausting to read stories where each and one of the characters is “not like other characters” and it's just as exhausting to write them. Just figure demographics first and then you can make a few of them stand out from just background characters. Flesh out those few and include some diversity some special quirks and at the end you have like a mass of characters that hopefully will mesh organically. (Remember to have minorities even in the background tho)

******* Well I have as of right now 5 core characters in the story. While they will all have unique personalities on two will be minorities. One the mc's sister will be a lesbian but I plan on writing it without any fanfare or coming out of the closet. It'll just be mentioned in a offhand way and maybe have her dating a few girls in the story. Not much real focus on it will be given. And the second one will be a asian character but obviously gonna ignore stereotypes. Otherwise the characters will be unique in personality but I'm gonna avoid diversity just for diversities sake.
