I'm looking for recommendations for SS/HP slash fanfictions that are novel length. I know there are a lot on AO3, but any recommendations would certainly help to narrow my searches. Keep in mind they don't have to be on AO3. Thanks to all those who comment!


** Hi! I would recommend heading to [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]] and posting there. Good luck üëç

** I actually think I replied last time you posted too, but here's some less well-known ones that you may not have seen before! Some of them are WIPs, not sure if you're looking for completed only. linkao3(10308596), linkao3(1097794), linkao3(2269161), linkao3(11190081), linkao3(6752560), linkao3(3174698), linkao3(7892593)

  Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived to Defeat Voldemort, Head Auror of the MLE, finds himself stuck in his 11-year-old body after a potions accident. How does 28-year-old Harry deal with being a First Year, with Voldemort rising back to power, and himself a Horcrux again? How does being sorted into Slytherin affect his relationship this time around with Snape? EWE. Slash.

  Meeting in dreams, Severus and Harry formed a friendship that would span across the years. When they figure out who the other truly is, how will this affect their relationship and the end of the war? Cannon compliant until 5th yr. Time-travelish.

  The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes. The same question rises in every soul: "For what, for whom, must I kill and be killed?"...Or, a classic approach to stubbornness.

#+begin_quote
  A re-imagining of the Harry Potter series in which Harry Potter is sorted into Slytherin instead of Gryffindor.This will be a slow-build as I've no interest in writing a majorly underage Potter/Snape relationship. I plan to write my way through all the books, developing the characters and relationships with a good amount of fluff and angst.Right now, the relationship tags are just indicators of what is to come, there are no slashes or relationships in this particular work.This work is a gift for my sis, Chewbecca, and bestie, Starlightwolf <3Obviously, and sadly, I'm not JK Rowling. The characters aren't mine, I don't own anything. Just playing with them a little!

  More than twenty years after Voldemort's death, Snape discovers Harry in long term care at St. Mungo's with chronic memory problems. Snape doesn't care that Potter has forgotten the war, his family or his schooling, but Severus Snape will be damned if he lets Potter forget him.
