Hello, I'm looking for any stories that have Harry as a teen dad. I don't care who the mother is, as long as it's well written! Thank you!


** "Teen Dad" / "Just plain Dad" Harry stories are straight up my favorite genre. Here are a couple I've enjoyed reading:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7969757/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Greatest-Gift][Harry Potter and the Greatest Gift]] by mini-mid (this is my favorite, even though it's incomplete, fair warning)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3123443/1/The-Little-Child-to-Lead-Him][The Little Child to Lead Him]] by BlueRosesAtMidnight

I'm also currently writing my own, but it's slow going.

**** "Greatest Gift" hasn't been updated in a while (February 2013), but as I don't know the author personally, I can't speak to its "official" status. Some authors just have very long update cycles. But personally, I would lean towards it being abandoned.

Still worth a read, though.

**** Good god, I'd almost completely forgotten about that one. I can't remember what it is called either, but it's an older one, that's for sure.

******* No, the lack of 'www' makes a difference, at least on my computer.

The first link times out, the second link responds immediately.

********* I use chrome and it doesn't work. Do you know why it would be different for me?

Edit: Sorry about responding to such an old post, but I'd had this open in a tab and forgot about it.

Edit again: If I delete the http:// at the beginning the link works without www.

** If Harry adopting before leaving school qualifies, give this a try:
