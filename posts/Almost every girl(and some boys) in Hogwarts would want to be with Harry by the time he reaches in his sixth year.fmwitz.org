Like, seriously. Canon Harry alone would be a chick magnet like no other. Just to list of things:

1.  He is the freaking Boy-Who-Lived. A literal legend in the wizarding world.
2.  He is the youngest seeker in the last 100 years. And by the time of his fourth year, his skills are on the level of world's best professional players.
3.  He has killed a 60 feet Basilisk(ok, not sure how much of it is known to general public)
4.  He has participated in the Triwizard Tournament and though the last task may have been made easier for him, he did manage to get the egg from the most dangerous dragon from the four with his own skills.
5.  He is easily above average at studying when he puts his mind to it(so is Ron by the way).
6.  He is actually better is Defense Against Dark Arts than Hermione, the brightest student in her year.
7.  He can perform a corporeal Petronus since the age of 13, a very advanced spell from all accounts.
8.  He is ridiculously selfless, kind and brave.
9.  He is at least somewhat rich.
10. And if Daniel Radcliff is anything to go by, and I do think J.K. Rowling has said he looks quite similar to what she imagined for Harry to look, than he would be at least considered easily above average cute if not downright handsome.

I want to see a fic that explores this. Because I have a hard time believing that only (potential rapist) Romilda Vane would be interested in Harry, and Ginny I guess. Could be serious, could be humorous. But no bashing or Harry being a total dick.


** ad 4. He *WON* the Triwizard Tournament (or was in the tie with the other contestant, who is unfortunately dead now). Do you remember that “eternal fame” Dumbledore promised in the beginning of the year? I sometimes wonder what happened to it.

** Except canon Harry is a bit of a prick to girls.

He asks Parvati to the ball, and ignores her after the first obligatory dance, making eyes at another girl. He sets up her sister with Ron, who is an even worse date to Parvati's sister.

He goes on a date with Cho, and tells her that he has to meet Hermione - someone who nearly any girl will feel threatened over, especially seeing as people believe they were together at some point, thanks to Rita Skeeter's gossip.

Then, when Luna, one of his friends, finds herself under the mistletoe with him, he jumps out of there like he was a eunuch. He goes with Luna to Slughorn's Christmas party, and leaves without so much as a goodbye to Luna.

You can give him a pass as a reader because he's just stunted from his years being raised by the Dursleys and he genuinely means well, but if I were a girl in Hogwarts who knew him casually, I wouldn't touch that mess with a ten foot pole. Even as a teenager, I had neither the time nor the patience to hold a boy's hand and explain why it's dickish to ask me out as a last resort and then ignore me for the whole dance while he eyes another boy's date. And if I went though that, I'd warn all my female friends not to bother with him, tragic backstory or no tragic backstory.

** Well, without "everyone" wanting a piece of him, Canon Harry is already pretty popular. I remember Rowling saying that he "inherithed the good look of both his parents" (but it was probably on Pottermore and it's not in the book so not really canon. But even without this, in the book (ignoring the first 3 years because he was too young) :

- 4th Year : before the Yull Ball, girls where often looking at him in group, having giggle. If not for his focus on Cho, and his general lack of knowledge, a lot of girls would have agreed to go with him to the ball, probably dumping a previously chosen date to do so (almost a shame that of all Hogwarts, he had to ask the only girl who was asked by a older, handsome, almost perfect fellow champion).
- 5th Year : despite the Daily Prophet and the Ministry doing his best to destroy his reputation, he still managed to go out with Cho who is described as a above average girl (who was probably not in the best state of mind after Cedric death but it's a detail)
- 6th Year : As the Chosen One, he could have asked around 80% of the school female population and received a positive response (so pretty much any girl outside of the worst blood supremacist and the one already in a pretty serious relation). Romilda Vane was the only one trying a love potion, but not the only one thinking about it. But Harry was too busy dealing with "the monster in his chest" and each time he saw Ginny and his daily Draco stalking to notice other girls.
- 7th Year, on the run most of the year. Could have bedded 70% of the wizarding population after it but already in a relation with Ginny.

So yeah, without being swarmed by girls, he seemed already very popular, especially when you see all the shitstorm that always follow him.

Just his broom is one that professionals use. So I guess it would be like if he had the most expensive sneakers? Or like some kind of professional level gear?

People might find it hard to approach him if he is always hanging out with hermione and ron though. Plus everyone probably assumes that he is dating hermione.

Although tbh people might think he murdered Cedric himself. Just to beat the competition or something. You have a dude go into a maze and then come out with his opponent's dead body. Not a good look.

Now, I don't necessarily think that he flies at a professional level - the one time he sees actual professionals play, he's incredibly impressed, it's unlike anything that he's seen.

However, to compare brooms to something like sneakers for running is definitely an off comparison because even the most advanced running shoe doesn't require skill to use. I think that a better comparison would be something like a stock car for Nascar; it requires skill and practice to use well; if a regular driver were to try and use a stock car, they wouldn't drive it effectively and would end up crashing. I think that brooms are the same way. I think that there's likely a reason that most school age Quidditch players don't have Firebolts goes beyond money, I think it's likely that the pure ability to control the broom is a skill. It can be something natural - a category that Harry clearly falls into - or it can be a learned skill, otherwise they wouldn't have flying lessons for first years.

** In my opinion, Daniel Radcliffe is not above average, he is strictly average in looks sometimes even below average (that doesn't mean I don't respect him or love him as Harry). But, in the books Harry is described as looking exactly like James who was canonically dashingly handsome, intelligent, tall, and a chick-magnet. Harry, also, has bright bright green eyes and black hair. Even without any other redeeming qualities many students would be falling head over heels for the tall dark and handsome with "jewel" colored eyes look.

James potter was never described as handsome. Sirius was the one described as handsome. But at least book Harry has some height going for him. Hes probably maybe 5'10 or 5'11 by book 6?

tbh i know lots of dudes who really aren't all that good looking but are just really outgoing. looks definitely help you become more confident and outgoing but if you're just that type of personality as long as you aren't hideous you can be very popular. most people would be attractive if they just put more effort into self care, clothing and working out but then that would probably raise the bar on attractiveness.

I believe in a quote at one point, jk rowling imagined the trio as more "nerdy" looking than the actors that played them. I think ron is mostly spot on except i imagined book ron as having a thinner build so maybe more like the twins actors. obviously emma watson is gorgeous and hermione was not supposed to be that pretty. if you look at like the art that was on the original books it seems like daniel radcliffe's build is completely off of harry potter

** I feel like, at least to me, Harry isn't really THAT attractive. Sure, he's famous, and lots of people want that, and he did do all of those things BUT by the time Hary is dating age, all the hype has pretty much died down. He and Ron and Hermione have a pretty tight nit group, and even the "Silver Trio" doesn't really get in. After the end of GoF, people pretty much hate him, and then only believe him in Year 6 which is when the Romild thing happens, so it's safe to assume that's when it started. From Philosophers Stone to PoA, he's only like 11-13, and still looks little and scrawny. He has his friends and though he's part of the quidditch team, he tries his HARDEST to stay out of the spotlight. He's also pretty tiny in GoF and then the Voldemort returns fiasco happens as soon as he grows up... I can see post DH Harry getting hit on A LOT. Though to me, Ron was definitely the more attractive one- book Ron, to clarify.

**** Maybe, but you also have to take into account that Harry himself was a bit of a dick to girls. It's a scientific fact that boys mature slower than girls, and so even if the girls were crushing on him, nothing could have really happened. We can say that like 1 in 4 people are gay and so 25% are gone. Lets just say that, for the sake of the argument, JUST, 10% of the remaining 75 aren't interested in him. That leaves 65% originally. For a couple of years, till he's, lets say 14, nothing can happen. During this time, he saves the school a bunch of times, but it's never really public. Assuming maybe 5% of people have found relationships by this point, that leaves him with 60%. In fourth year, he goes out with Parvati Patil and that's a FLOP. Word gets around and because he was a DICK to her he loses like 50% of the 60, leaving him with 30%. At the end of that year, it goes down significantly, since no one fucking believes him and he basically only has Ginny for two years. After the chosen one shit, it increases, but he begins to date Ginny, so it doesn't really matter. Just for the heck of it: if we take out people with relationships, maybe 65% MIGHT want to date him.

** 1.  Which always comes with scorn and envy but sure. Take this one.
2.  2. They're not necessarily on par. In fact, we don't know. Krum says 'you fly well', that's pretty much it. He might've simply been polite, seeing as he was glad Harry wasn't with Hermione, but even if he meant it, it doesn't really mean much.
3.  Yes, with lots of help, stupid amounts of luck, and circumstances. He was very brave though. If I were mean, I might argue that he was beyond reckless.
4.  All the tasks have been made easier for him. In point of fairness, the same could be said for all the other champions, too. Still, Harry didn't really do much except 'fly' -- which he is very proficient with, granted.
5.  Above average, yeah. But since we don't really know the grades of people like Malfoy (who seemed to have tested in his OWLs (which weren't influenced by Snape) an O in Potions and at least an E in Defense) that doesn't really mean much.
6.  He's got better nerves than Hermione. In actual spellwork she's almost always better, and she's better with the theory. Harry just doesn't lose his head as often (see Y3 final test or her nerves before the OWLs).
7.  He can -- with lots of one on one teaching sessions nobody but him was allowed to attend. Still, he can do it -- fair's fair.
8.  He is ridiculously +selfless+ reckless, emotionally somewhat underdeveloped, and somewhat prone to act without thinking. But yes -- kind and brave, too.
9.  Not necessarily. But he's doing okay.
10. I'm not a specialist on sources that aren't the books, but I happen to know that Rowling once admitted that Harry, Hermione, and Ron kind of look too good in the movies. Harry and Hermione really were more average kind of people, physically.
