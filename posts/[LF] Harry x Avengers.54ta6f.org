I am hoping to find some more where Harry becomes the master of death and cannot die. Whether he ages doesn't matter but I would like 50k+ words that are complete. Thank you all.

Edit: Thank you all for your amazing suggestions. Although it seems like I have read all the longer completed fics for this crossover.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

  When Harry finally accepted the fact that he had stopped aging, ten years had passed and he knew it was time to leave. AU.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six-year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.
