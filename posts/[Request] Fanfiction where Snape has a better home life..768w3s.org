In canon, it is assumed that Snape has an abusive home life. I want to read a fanfiction where this is not the case.


** linkffn(They Didn't Know We Were Seeds by LucyLuna) has Snape getting out of Spinner's End to live with relatives.

The SI of linkffn(Raining Dust and Gold by bluejanes) helps Snape and his mum get away from his dad.

  Being reborn as Lily Evans' younger sister definitely has its merits, but that's completely overshadowed by the fact that the First Wizarding War is going to start in nine years. And she'll be damned if she lets her sister die. SI/OC fic.

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. COMPLETE.
