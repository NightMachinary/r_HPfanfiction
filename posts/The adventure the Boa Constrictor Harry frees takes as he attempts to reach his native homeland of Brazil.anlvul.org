**** It pops up once in a while, not everyone understands that she isn't stupid/silly but she legitimately has a mental illness, i can't remember if its downs or aspergers but it causes her to come up as very pep or energetic (with a love for capslocks) when she writes. Usually the community tends to be quite understanding, but not everyone "gets it." It tends to take a full post about it to let the newer members know about it before she gets some peace.

** HP movie version boa is supposed to be nagini. First movie snake has same markings as movie nagini. Rowling mentioned it in some interview. It is also mentioned in dvd extras, if i remember correctly.
