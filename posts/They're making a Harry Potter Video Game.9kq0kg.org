** Erm, haven't there been dozens? I mean, it looks okay for a phone recording of a tv screen or whatever that video is, but I've had enough of the games I think.

*** There hasn't been any decent RPG ones. This one, if real, actually looks good. All the other games have been mediocre, if not outright terrible, and usually based off the movies.

If it's real, and it seems to be, this is pretty huge.

***** We don't know.

I'm honestly not sure how Transfiguration can be put into combat. There's so much creativity there that it seems like it'd be unreasonable to ask them to include the majority of the possibilities.

But hopefully we get a few choices. Turning things into dogs, wolves, birds, etc. to attack your enemies. Or turning things into sharp objects to Banish at your enemies.

****** For the most part this is what I would expect. Maybe throw in raising walls and at higher levels creating shield. But not just combat. I should be able to use it to make disguises, lock or unlock doors by messing with hinges, vanishing is part of that field too.

*** But never an RPG at this depth. People are going to go mental because this is a proper game since the very first Harry Potter game, which was the best one out of the lot. The fact is, this isn't another mobile phone cash grab. If this works and hits a good level, then this will be game-changing.

I'm on the Hogwarts express hype train already and there's no stopping.

*** *Harry Potter video games*

The Harry Potter video games are multiple series of video games based on the fictional world of Harry Potter, originally created by J.K. Rowling, and published by Electronic Arts and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Many of the Harry Potter inspired video games are tie-in's to the novels, and films of the same name. The main series features a video game for every novel (As well as two for the finale), and often multiple distinct versions for individual games.
