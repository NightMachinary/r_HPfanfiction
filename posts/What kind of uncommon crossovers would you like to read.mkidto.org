Basically the title. For me, two of my all-time favorite fantasy series are *The Nightside* by *Simon R. Green* and *Alex Verus* by *Benedict Jacka*. I would love to see good crossovers between Harry Potter and these two series. For example, a fic about Harry who has been raised by Alex Verus and has learned cunning from his brilliant guardian, and like him has zero tolerance toward people who want to kill him or his friends. Or a Harry who has been raised in Nightside and after seeing all the weird shit their is totally unimpressed with the wizarding world.


** I'm surprised there aren't more crossovers with Artemis Fowl (also, TIL that there's a movie and its apparently awful - what even was 2020?), and I agree that a Harry-raised-in-the-Nightside fic would be awesome.

Honestly though, I just like crossovers. Don't even care if I'm familiar with the other fandom - if the premise looks interesting, I'll read it.

*** I only read book one of Artemis Fowl series, but I agree. They kind of fit. And I like crossovers too, although I'm not having much luck finding good ones. The last really good ones I read were *Kicking Gotham* and its sequel *Toppling Heroes*. They were masterpieces.

Anyway: If you're interested in a list of crossovers, let me know. Just state up front what you like/don't like and I'm sure I can find you something lol. In other news, the author of KG/TH is also well known for their in-progress LOTR crossover, so you could check that out too. linkao3(23628394)

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed, but the wounds inflicted during his time in Angmar's dungeons run deep. He wishes only to return home, but that road is long and twisting, and fraught with danger.Begins 1000 years before LotR.

***** Thank you. :)

I'm interested in Harry-centric fics in which there is no slash relationship for Harry, although the other characters are fair game. Prefer post Hogwarts fics. They are usually more fun. And I like fics that don't have too much sappy romance and domestic fluff things. Something like Nonjon and Steelbadger's works, really.

****** Well, since you mentioned Nonjon, his crossover with Firefly was a lot of fun: I've read it a half dozen times, easily.

- Three of these are pre-Hogwarts, raised by somebody else comedies (City of Angels, Epsilon Brown and Elder Sect), two begin during the triwizard tournament (Pack, a comedy and Incedio which is more serious), and the remaining six are EWE. For all of them, there's only one per fandom.

- All but /maybe/ the MiB crossover are probably fine to read even if you've never heard of the fandom. (Knowing the basic premise of MiB is likely enough, fwiw.)

- Be aware that the Lucifer crossover (City of Angels) is the fluffiest of the bunch, and that Wizard of Harrenhall is probably the weakest of the stories linked. I would've chosen 'The Brightest Sun' as the GoT/ASoIaF crossover instead, but it's incomplete and likely abandoned.

- None of these are romance-centric.

- Honorable mentions for Of Wizards and Heroes (MCU) and Whispers in Corners (Sherlock). They're both amazing stories... but they're slash. oWaH is more /implied/ than demonstrated, but it's still a part of the finale. WoC has more written about the relationship... but it isn't all that explicit either. Try or not, it's up to you, but rest assured that a) the romance is secondary and b) they're both top notch fics.
