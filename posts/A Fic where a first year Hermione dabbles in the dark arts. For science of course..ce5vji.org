  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.

*** Also linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House), which is less humorous but plenty dark. You do not want to cross Valerie Campbell, for she is subtle and quick to anger.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** Because people think my first one is too harsh.

"Miss Granger, I'm very disappointed in you. You stole Mr. Potter's cloak, snuck into the restricted section, then proceeded to practice dark magic."

Dumbledore looked into her eyes, no twinkle to be found.

"I once knew a man in my youth. He was expelled from school for twisted experiments on the other youth. He was brilliant and came to me during a time of grief. We bonded instantly."

"I gave him a slogan in a debate we had, a motto he took to practice the dark arts and murder. It was the Greater Goodâ„¢."

"I was on a dark path, broken out of it by tragedy and my brother's fist. That man I discussed was Gellert Grindelwald, and he currently is locked in Nurmengard for crimes against humanity."

"So let this be clear, if I ever catch you in the restricted section without permission again to practice the dark arts or violating another student's property, I will expel you and snap your wand. Are we clear Miss Granger?"

"Crystal, sir."

"Good. You have a month's detention between Professor McGonagall, Professor Snape, and Mr. Filch."

** "My cloak, Hermione," Harry said with a glare.

Hermione shrunk under his gaze and passed back the cloak.

"Miss Granger, due to your theft of another student's belongings to study the dark arts without permission, you are hereby expelled from Hogwarts," Dumbledore said. He took her wand and snapped it.

Hermione sobbed, future in the magical world ruined.

*** Not one of your downvoters but this is why It's hard not to get the impression that you hate Hermione in a general sense, Here we have a prompt meant to be comedic in tone and in 58 words you use it to completely ruin her life. She is probably going to be dead before the age of twenty.

**** I've been writing depressing replies for the last week. It's a little bit of fun I have, and takes a direction no one else takes. I did one with Ron smoking that I think I'll turn into a fic later.

I don't hate the character, I do dislike the character though. Mild dislike of her in the books, a dislike of her character in the movies, and a major dislike of Mary-Sue Hermione. All purely from a narrative perspective. It's not the idea, rather the execution of the character that bothers me.

But seriously, if she had asked for the cloak in the prompt, I would have gone for a very neat Dumbledore lecture. I might actually go for it.

Seriously though. If someone writes a Hermione that learns tact without being taken to task by Sinyk's +over-compensation+ Harry, I'd read it immediately.
