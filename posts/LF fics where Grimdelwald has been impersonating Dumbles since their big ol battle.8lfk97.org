Makes sense to me tbh. Elder wand is unbeatable, Grimdelwald wins but overall his side is losing pretty hard (especially on the Muggle front) so he jumps ship and locks up Albus in Nuremgard or whatever it's called as a polyjuice supply and doesn't allow visitors.

There's gotta be a few out there where this happens, right?


** If Grindelwald was running the show, he would have neutralized that upstart Riddle as early as 1945, and he would have taken over Magical Britain very quickly. Any opposition would have been swiftly dealt with.

*** Couldn't agree more. Compared to Grindelwald, Tom is a whinny failure. Like Hitler vs the town neo Nazi clan. People who think that Voldemort only suffered a setback because of Harry and the prophecy -- forget that even if he had taken over the ministry, his rule wouldn't have lasted long. His methods do not sustain a powerbase for too long. Tom may have been an equal in magical powers but he failed as an insurrection leader. Whereas Grindelwald caused a great wizarding war that spilled into WW2.

****** Voldemort was never sane. That's a popular misconception. Perhaps it might make for a more interesting character in a fic, but canon Riddle was /always/ a mad genius underneath the veneer, but with enough intelligence and self-control to bide his time and /pretend/ to be calm and charismatic. Modern-day Voldemort hasn't "forgotten" how to be charismatic, he's just reached a point in power where he can just blast away anyone who disagrees with him rather than having to win them over, so he's stopped bothering.

Also, FYI, Grindelwald was /not/ a Dark Lord. Dark Lord is a title Voldemort made for himself, which nobody before or since has carried that we know of. Grindelwald was either "the Dark Wizard Grindelwald" or just "Grindelwald"; ancient villainous Voldemort-types like Ekrizdis, Herpo or Raczidian are universally called "Dark Wizards" and never "Dark Lords".

******* I disagree with the first part, honestly. People are not born /insane/. I, honestly, also believe that people are not born as psychopaths or sociopaths. It's something that events in childhood causes. Not everyone is the same, of course, as is the human brain and the sheer different a single event can make on an individual, making everyone, and their mental state, unique.

I do believe that if Tom had grown up in a loving family with people that actually cared for him, he would not have become the Dark Lord. Sure, his ambition and desire to be great would have remained, but he would have done it in a different manner. Even J.K said something about Tom not taking the path he took if his mother, Merope, survived and looked after him.

Also, I'm unsure if you've ever been in the foster care system (seeing as orphanages were abolished in the seventies) or not, but those places are absolute /hell/ for children and their mental state. Almost every child seeks love, validation, and acceptance. An orphanage offers /none/ of that, no matter if the orphanage is a good one and is not a clich√© one you would find in a book. Seeing a couple that could be your future chose someone else over you is crushing, even more so when you know the child they are choosing is less deserving than you. It plants seeds of hatred in you, and each time, the seeds are watered and flourish quicker than any plant you have seen.

The most important thing, however, is that Tom grew up during a war. People always seem to forget that Tom was probably afraid and had no one to speak to about it. He was a wizard, unable to use his magic to save himself, in Muggle London as it was getting bombed.

He cannot be defended, he was evil in the end for the sake of being evil, but that is J.K's fault for starting the series for children. People are not born evil. They don't come out of the womb plotting world domination. Too many authors (mainly fanfic authors) don't put enough focus on the mental mind state to create a believable villain. I mean, it is easier to just say that ______ was born evil and was always that way. It requires less explanation and effort.

******** I actually agree with all of this. When I said "Tom Riddle was never sane", I meant the Tom Riddle we always hear about --- Hogwarts-years Riddle. Though I am pretty sure he medically had some sort of sociopathic disorder, he could definitely have grown up into a better (and happier) person in the right hands; that Lord Voldemort became who he became was, indeed, as much due to circumstance as to his nature. My point was simply that he was already a murderous blaggard beneath the polish of his schoolboy self, and perhaps I went a bit hyperbolic saying it.

** There's a problem with the premise: you are assuming he would need to switch places.

Without Dumbledore, no one could stop him (Deathly Hallows, Ch. 35). If you buy the idea that the most powerful wizards/witches can't be stopped with just numbers, he would have found a way to continue with his objectives, which seem to be some mix of ending the SoS and territorial acquisition.

A good example of this idea is The Skitterleap by enembee linkffn(The Skitterleap), where Grindelwald won and had Dumbledore briefly imprisoned in Nurmengard before executed. He then proceeded with his European conquest plans. Its a great fic and a fantastic piece of world-building, but most of this is in the background and the story just sort of ends with no real resolution.

Now if there was some reason for him to switch places, it would be a not unreasonable idea for him (the two were close in power and skill and Grindelwald probably had some idea of how Dumbledore acted/behaved). The way I see things:

1) He was unlikely to return to Hogwarts immediately. He was not Headmaster at the time, so his power was less cemented there. He would probably focus on establishing political power. Canon-Dumbledore has significant domestic and international political power (seemingly) and Grindelwald would probably utilize this to immense influence.

2) He would return to Hogwarts once he has secured his position and to maintain his disguise (Dumbledore loved teaching, whatever else he may have been). Given that Tom Riddle was graduating in 1945, its unlikely Grindelwald would have been aware of Dumbledore's suspicions (and his history from the orphanage). Without this, Voldemort garners little notice and Grindelwald continues to cement his power. As headmaster, he may even change the curriculum (ex. remove "restricted section" or teach different courses like the Dark Arts). Voldemort asked Dippet in '45 for the defense job, but without Dumbledore to caution him he would probably receive the position then and there.

3) Politically, I see him setting society towards a more republican Rome style: those with the greatest ambition and power will invariably rise to the top of the food chain. His moniker was Magic is Might!, and the strongest should be rewarded both for their power and their ability to use it. Grindelwald would argue for greater integration of muggleborns, probably in the vein of Voldemort in the Prince of the Dark-Kingdom or The Dark Lord Never Died, including cutting them off from their families and stamping out blood supremacy. He would be ideally positioned to do this, as Headmaster he could indoctrinate the students to practically any idea, while forcing through laws and policies that suit this agenda.

4) What happens with Voldemort is a wild card to be honest. Grindelwald was more powerful, and had far more authority. But he lacked Dumbledore's previous knowledge, without having been raised in Britain, may have overlooked some of the historical and cultural keynotes that could turn people against him (ex. he may not have known about the Gaunts and their ancestors). Since Riddle does not trust Dumbledore already, Grindelwald would find it difficult to get a jump on him. The story could veer off wildly from here, including Voldemort's assassination or forced exile from Britain or even imprisonment.

There is only one complication to this hypothetical: Fawkes. Was the phoenix already with Dumbledore? If so, its likely the bird would know he was an imposter and free Dumbledore, or at the very least leave Hogwarts. Nobody noticed Dumbledore taking Grindelwald's wand, but they would definitely notice if Fawkes just up and vanished.

Just my thoughts, but I think it would make an amazing story, if one understands political maneuvering enough.
