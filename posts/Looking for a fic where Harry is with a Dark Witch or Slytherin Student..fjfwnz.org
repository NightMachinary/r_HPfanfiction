I would prefer a not Dark or OP Harry - I would like the Slytherin Student to be Dark to a degree.

Any Dark Witch or Slytherin Student is fine, from largely done ones like Bellatrix or Daphne down to OC's.

Preferably fics of 60k+ words.

Thank you all in advance for the recommendations.

Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with snakes in the garden, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing that's happened to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. [Fem!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, AU Retelling]

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
