:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey guys,

I'm new to the whole reddit experience so please be kind. I am looking for a fic I read about 3 to 4 years ago. What I remember from it is that Harry somehow got taken in by the Queen, and trained as a guardian? Defender? of the realm. At some point, I think it's Neville, joins him in his training by I think merlin or some other legendary historical figure. They definitely become dragons via tha animagus (transformation/transfirguration? (Never been quite sure which it is.)) They go to Hogwarts and stuffy happens. One scene I recall in particular was Harry talking to A.P.W.B.D and reveling that he was knighted or some and has a badge. That the big parts that I remember. I should also mention that it's very AU, OoC, and non-canon obviously.

Please let me know if any of you remember this fic as it's been in the back of my mind for ages.

Edit: I've started to read the story listed below, quoth the raven, nevermore. I don't think this is the right story.

I've tried to recall a few more details and I think I have a few. Harry grows up at either the Royal castle or some Royal property, I am pretty sure Neville joins him at some point. Before he goes to Hogwarts or maybe in between years he either becomes a purple dragon animagus by accident or on purpose. There's also a lot of emphasis on defenders of the realm of some sort. Not sure what they called him but he had a badge or sigil that basically told everyone that he was exempt from certain laws. He also has a white uniform or armor of some design.

Sincerely, JJ

  The Tower of London has a dark and bloody past both in the muggle and wizarding worlds. Besides being a prison, it also served as a sanctuary in times past, what if it became one yet again? -AU

*** I just started reading this from your rec. It is well written and, so far (ch 8) a darling heart-warming story.

**** It is one of those stories which have rather nice setup, but then I am afraid the author didn't know where to go with it. Finale seems kind of “meh”.

***** As of ch 19 the authors seem to be setting HP up as a Mary Sue - good and amazing at everything, in addition to the blessing/protections/etc.

Is my guess that it would be hard to sustain the sort of story this was originally intended to be when the main is a Mary Sue correct?

***** I just finished it.

The problem was not with Mary Sueism or similar.

To me, it simply shifted away from the personal and richly emotional start into a typical ‘HP wins in a different way' story. Not bad, okay in itself, just not carrying through with the early brilliance.

*** I've read the first few chapters and unfortunately this doesn't look to be it. I'm not 100 percent confident of the dragon part but it's stuck with me so I think it is in the story. Thanks for the other fanfic though, really enjoying it.

I didn't finish this myself because I didn't enjoy its portrayal of the queen, but it has the defender theme and Neville and Merlin, so it might be something you want.

**** I think the problem was excessive use as a side character when I tend to not like real people who are alive at the moment being characters in fanfic. A personal preference pretty much.
