Hi everyone, I just wanted promote my fic a bit, it's a story that took me over six years to write and I still go back from time to time to edit and make it better. Please check out my Memoirs of a Redheaded Witch, it's the entire HP story in Ginny's point of view and I worked extremely hard to make it as accurately cannon as possible! It's over 250,000 words and it's very detailed. I've won a few awards for it over on SIYE and would love to expand my audience! Let me know if you catch any mistakes!

** I haven't read it yet, but do plan to. It sounds like it's very good. You might also consider posting this to [[/r/HarryandGinny]] :)

** I read the story some time ago, and I enjoyed it. However, it's a bit confusing when chapters are added in the middle of a completed story. I didn't re-read the story each time you've inserted a new chapter, especially when the new chapter was about the time Ginny was with Michael and Dean. I'll definitely read the story again someday.

*** Totally understand, it was mainly for my benefit as I went back to read it, I felt I couldn't leave it as it was with so many plot wholes! It's mainly for new readers and my records. Nothing in the story changed, just amended and made for a better read.

thanks!

** I remember really liking this so well done!

This post got me thinking about a topic that's posted a lot on this sub and [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]. The basic question is which character's perspective would you want to read the 7 books from. I've always argued that for obvious reasons no other character could maintain 7 books of interesting story without completely making up new storylines. But there are several characters who have enough of a story to carry a few books. Dumbledore and Snape are clear choices and they could probably cover 3 books. But I really think Ginny is one of the small number of other characters who could carry several books (Chamber of Secret, Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows) so I'm generally a big fan of these types of stories.

**** Yeah, there's definitely a story there, but I think the romantic aspect, which still takes up the bulk of Ginny's story, is better told in HBP.
