The last time I read this was in the work by author section in DLP - it was planned as a much larger story too, over 150k words. I tried to to re-read it but the writing style is turning me off - too grave, too formal - however I would still like to know the plot synopsis, if only to get some closure. The few plot points I remember is Harry basically engineering his imprisonment, having soul issues and drawing runes that represented people, or something to that effect. Thanks in advance, if anyone takes the time.


** *In chronological order, rather than the order presented in the fic:*

(Spoilers, of course)

Before Harry graduates Hogwarts he goes traveling with Dumbledore, devoting all of his waking moments to intensive training that should make him powerful enough to defeat Voldemort.

When the war kicks into full swing, Harry and Dumbledore both return to lead the forces of good against the Death Eaters. There is a climactic battle at Hogwarts during which Dumbledore is killed by Voldemort.

Distraught, Harry enacts a ritual involving soul magic that is supposed to return Dumbledore to life. Unfortunately, the ritual has disastrous results. Afterward, Harry is somehow broken. (The nature of this break is the mystery at the heart of the story.) Harry ends up committing monstrous acts against his friends before he is captured and locked away by the Ministry.

While he sits in prison, Harry invents a unique runic language which everyone assumes is a cypher. Hermione is brought in as a consultant to figure it out. Harry uses her visit as an opportunity to escape and abducts her.

Harry gives Hermione a pensieve full of his own memories to make her understand what led him to this point. He then coerces her into learning his runic language so that she can aid him in a ritual that is supposed to undo the abomination created by his attempt to resurrect Dumbledore. The learning process takes months, during which Harry gives Hermione cryptic hints about the truth of his condition, what happened to Dumbledore, and what exactly the new ritual is meant to accomplish.

Eventually Hermione is ready enough, and Harry enacts the new ritual, using his runic language in an array inscribed on the floor. Hermione feels inside herself that something has gone very wrong, but the ritual must have succeeded because 'Dumbledore' shows up. He attempts to keep Harry subdued and examines the magic in the runes to figure out what failsafe Harry has worked into the magic. Meanwhile, he tries to persuade Hermione to let him kill Harry. His attempts are unsuccessful. Harry wakes up, they fight, and 'Dumbledore' finds peace in death. Then the failsafe kicks in, ensuring that Harry doesn't survive to continue on in his twisted broken state. Fawkes arrives to spirit Hermione to safety.

The end.

**** Hermione ruminates on that and gets hints from Harry. Basically it's a personal runic language that describes Harry's own essence with symbology related to events that have emotional significance for him: his scar, learning magic, flying, phoenixes, snakes, etc.

I particularly love the moment when Hermione first starts to decipher the runes:

#+begin_quote
  All of this explained why the experts couldn't figure it out. She was truly the only one besides Harry that had a chance to interpret this language. The reason why the symbols changed also made sense now. It was because his own interpretations changed. A bird's essence is not going to change but a person's... well, change was inevitable.

  The decoding of this language was going to be nigh impossible but she now understood how to do so.

  Her eyes immediately locked on the top rune in the circle -- one of the seven large ones placed. It stood out somehow from the rest and depicted two feathers seemingly floating in the air. Almost transparent, a serpent wound itself silently around the feathers.

  She could do this.

  The rune had to be something deeply ingrained within Harry's past, perspectives, or beliefs. Her mind immediately flew to Buckbeak. Clearly this bird had had a large effect on Harry and was important on his mind. Hermione tried not to remember the closeness they had shared on that adventure's trials and tribulations. Did the rune represent loyalty? Flight?

  Fifteen minutes later Hermione realized that it was not Buckbeak.

  Inspiration struck her soon after - Flitwick's class. There were slight movement lines in the feathers showed feathers falling.

  Flitwick's instructing voice came to her mind as if yesterday, "Good good class! Now levitating isn't just the rise, but the fall as well! Practice levitating the feathers down, in a slow gradual descent... a gradual descent."

  Harry and her had gotten the descent part immediately and she had caught him smiling in appreciation. Harry had remarked in his third year, in a rare moment of verbal reflection, of his fond memory of that particular day.

  Two of Flitwick's words hit her with deep gravity, the "gradual descent."

  Hermione's eyes flicked to the lightning bolt in the middle.

  Oh.

  The Gradual Descent.

  What Harry had been drawing was indeed a title page, and the packet of papers underneath it was a book. But not just any book, if the lightning bolt had anything to say about it.

  It was an Autobiography... of Harry.

  The Gradual Descent.

  Hermione was breathing very rapidly, tears of emotion falling ever so softly.

  Oh Harry... What happened?

** spoiler obviously

this is explained in chapter 6 what went wrong and in chapter 7 how he intends to correct it.

Harry resurrected Dumbledore but he screwed up and it took nearly all that was good from his soul and left him with mostly evil. He's almost entirely evil in the story but that is tempered by his life experience.

Harry is trying to fix himself to get back what he lost. He has since refined his knowledge of the magic he used to resurrected Dumbledore and is teaching that to Hermione so she can fix him. With the process refined Hermione will make a full recovery and Harry will be back to mostly normal as well.

The whole story is Evil Harry's plan to heal himself back to Regular Harry.

That's pretty much it

#+begin_quote
  I think he is trying to do some kind of ritual? It's been way too long since I've read it... there's a big action sequence / duel with a resurrected Dumbeldore in the end I think? IMHO that fic is extremely overrated... >!

**** I feel I have to backpedal a bit, but I'll get to the point later. Just to be clear: It's very well written and has some interesting ideas.

I just cannot stand "red herring" mysteries like this. I've only read it once so correct me when I misremember... the fic does this whole song and dance about "Oh, could Harry really do this? Maybe he was framed? Imperiused? Is something else intriguing going on here?", but then the big reveal comes: "Oh, he's just insane."

Okay.

It felt so anticlimactic to me. "What?! That's it?!". Yeah I get it, there's this whole mumbo jumbo about soul magic and how he got insane, but the point of the matter is he's just insane and a public menace now. I just don't know what I'm supposed to get out of a nihilistic conclusion like this. A story like this just leaves me with nothing to take away from it. "Well I guess it sucks for you if something backfires and you go insane?" It doesn't work as a tragedy for me because I don't see the ultimate fatal flaw that caused this. Just shit luck.

I suppose I like this fic because I enjoy stories about psychological horror, where a person can't trust their own mind, or they feel themselves changing in ways beyond their control; tragedies that go further than the simple Jekyll & Hyde idea. Stories which explore that spectrum tend to pique my interest.
