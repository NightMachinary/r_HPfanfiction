**** Update: I just noticed that they're a 2.5 month old account with ~8k karma, but none of their posts are older than 10 days, and those posts have almost no karma.

Is this one of those famous resold karma farming accounts that people talk about?

** ok, so taking the quiz and already saw one major flaw.

question 12: which unforgivable did Moody do to a spider in his class.... All of them and one can only pick one answer.

*** Yeah. That was the only one I got wrong when I finished the quiz. I thought it would be a technicality. Moody technically didn't cast a curse; Barty Crouch Jr. did but apparently that was too smart for the quiz.

*** I got the same one wrong. I had to guess at the theme park one but got it right. Last I checked, the location of a theme park isn't in the books.

**** that is another problem I have with the majority of these 'tests'.

They always involve some obscure knowledge that is never mentioned in the books at all.
