Also, my understanding of the Trace is thus.

Dumbledore says in the quote that the Ministry can trace the magic but not the perpetrator.

This leads me to think that any and every person (adult or children) whose magic is cast in the country is recorded (not necessarily recorded, but rather shown as a blip on the map for as long as the magic lasts) in the Ministry.

Why? Because if that wasn't the case, why should the Ministry even be confused on who did the magic around an underage wizard if it didn't record magical signatures of everyone in the area?

I see people saying that the Trace is activated by an underage wizard in a Wizarding home, but the Ministry can't know who did it. If the Trace actually activates only by an underage wizard who used his magic, then it's perfectly clear that the underage kid in the Wizarding home was the one who did the spell as the Trace cannot be activated by an adult.

Thus, the Trace is a fancy way of saying the location of the child is recorded.

If I'm wrong, please enlighten me with your understanding.

Edit: Updated one sentence


** Ron's statement about the Trace must be taken with a grain of salt. If he knew so much about the Trace, he should have been sneakily using it at home, but he didn't.

The only reliable information about the Trace can come from Dumbledore or perhaps Moody.

Or else he was just that terrified of Molly, a most reasonable state of being.

**** Haha, that is true. But, maybe a simple Summoning charm when he's in his room wouldn't have been noticed by her. But he didn't do that, because he strongly believed he could be Traced, even though he couldn't have been.

It speaks of good parenting on the Weasleys' part, but what about muggle-borns or Half-blood without parents who are not at home? If they accidentally used magic, would it be Traceable?

** I've always thought that the Ministry receives an alert whenever magic is used in a dwelling, although they only act when it happens around Muggles or where there aren't other wizards around (or sources of magic that the Ministry are aware of).

I know for a fact that it also works on the streets.

**** Hmm could that also be explained by Umbridge setting the dementor on Harry purposedly?

** Yeah, the trace probably picks up all the magic but it isn't ever obvious who did it unless it is a muggle-born or lone wizards using magic outside of magical society. It would be pretty clear-cut in cases like Harry being attacked by dementors -- he was the only wizard around -- and might be further argument for "pureblood elitists" who can effectively get around the trace, since they are almost always surrounded by other wizards. Half-bloods and muggle-borns are far more likely to get caught and since the Ministry is very strict on the Statute of Secrecy, probably only seriously pursues cases that take place in front of muggles.

The Weaseleys could probably get away with it, but it's not really in their character to skirt the law, besides the fact that they are overall looked down on by the ruling-class of wizards, so they'd have to keep their heads down more than other pure-blood families.

I might be mis-remembering this, but doesn't Dobby use a bunch of magic in the Durseley's house to get in Harry in trouble?

*** I agree with everything you said.

Yes. Dobby did use magic. That's my point. The Trace picked up magic in Harry's location and so they sent him a warning. My point is if sixteen year old Harry were to be somewhere else alone would it be possible for the Ministry to say it's him using magic?

** It's also possible that children with no wizarding parents had a magical monitor put on their homes specifically. This would fit with Tom Riddle sneaking out to kill his father/grandparents (although its possible it also didn't exist then).
