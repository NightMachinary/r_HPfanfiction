I'm looking for dimension travelling harry fics.

I mean proper dimension hopping (going to several different alternate realities/universes)

A prime example is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Potter-The-Lone-Traveler/116621/99/2/1/0/0/0/0/][The Lone Traveller]] series. That is exactly the kind of thing i'm looking for.

Any and all replies welcome!

Starts off in HP universe before travelling through Silent Hill, DCU, RWBY, Halo, Alice in Wonderland, Tomb Raider, Hellsing, John Wick and several others that I cant recall off the top of my head

** Linkffn(The Granger Principle)

Ron centric, Hermione is the brains behind the portal, and Harry's also there. As are Ginny, Luna, Sirius, Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and the Luna from the other dimension.

Pro tip: Never put two Lunas with the same personality but very different skills in the same room unless you want chaos.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

  Our choices define us. When Harry and his closest friends are transported to an alternate dimension, thirty years after the war's end, and forced to face the results of what would have been if only they had chosen differently, he will discover just how true this is. Features H/G, H/Hr, H/DG. Not multi.

** [[http://slashcity.org/rushlight/hp/pendulum.htm][The Pendulum of Choice]] by Rushlight. Note that there are various relationships, all (I think) slash. Includes Harry/Snape, Harry/Lucius, Harry/Draco, possibly others that I'm not remembering.

Although there is one chapter that says "Coming soon" that was never posted (if it was ever written), I want to emphasize that this is a complete fic. The last chapter and epilogue wrap up the storyline. Because it is a dimension-hopping story, there could have been any number of "stops" between the beginning and the conclusion.
