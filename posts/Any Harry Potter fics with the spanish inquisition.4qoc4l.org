Where Witches and Wizards are being hunted down and burned alive? I'd love it if Harry was behind the whole thing, but I'd take any.


** Aw, and here I thought it was a Monty Python reference.

*** Harry was looking at Cedric's corpse, horrified, when he was distracted by a familiar voice shouting, "Nobody expects Voldemort's resurrection!". As he turned around, he found himself pinned to a tombstone by Wormtail. "I've actually been wondering why it didn't happen last year" he muttered,"Should have guessed it was your incompetence".

"Shut up! The Dark Lord will rise again, and you will play your part. Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken... No, wait that comes later. lets not cut you yet."

Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son. blood of the enemy, forcibly taken...no no wait... Flesh of the servant, willingly given, you will revive your master... on second thought it may be better to start over"

"You need some help there Wormtail?"

"Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son."

He dropped the bone into the potion.

"Flesh of the servant, willingly given, you will revive your master."

Wormtail lopped off his hand and let it drop into the potion

"Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your foe!"

As Wormtail came towards Harry, Harry, had a rather stupid idea. It was his only idea, so he decided to go ahead with it. "You can have my blood! I willingly give it you, all of it! I'll even jump into the cauldron!" Wormtail stopped in his tracks, looking confused.

"Maybe you could start over with another enemy of Voldemort? Unfortunate that you already killed Cedric though. You have no idea how to finish this Ritual now, do you? "

I don't know how to end this either, first time I've ever written anything.

**** You should end it with the bunny monster mauling everyone! With the chaos of the fight between Riddle and Potter, the monster would have awakened!

** Kudos for originality.

Every time I think I've seen it all, someone comes along and proves me wrong.

Crap, now I want to read a story like that, too.

** I don't know any off the top of my head, but I am working on a story that has an inquisition that hunts down witches and wizards and anything magical. They use enchanted items made by their leader, who thinks he is the Chosen of God, because his talents manifested in a time of dire need and he thought it to be a miracle. So he's essentially a zealot who hunts down heathens, without realizing that his own powers are magical and not faith-based.

** I'm curious as to how you could ever make a muggle be threatening to a wizard, let alone a muggle from the 15th century.

  /"Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty-seven times in various disguises."/

The Wizarding world doesn't take the muggles seriously at all, the only believable fear I've come across is in HPMOR and Quirrells fear of a nuclear war.

One muggle repelling charm and they'd never even know you where there.
