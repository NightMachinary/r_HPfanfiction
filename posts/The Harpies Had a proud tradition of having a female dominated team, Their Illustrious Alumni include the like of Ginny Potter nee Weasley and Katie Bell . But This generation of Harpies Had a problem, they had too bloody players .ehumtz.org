Lily Luna Potter-Chaser

Victoria Weasley-Keeper

Molly Weasley- Chaser

Lucy Weasley- Chaser

Rose Weasley-Beater

Roxanne Weasley -Beater

Dominique Weasley- Seeker

There were so many gingers on the field, They might as well be the bloody Cannons.


** At least one of them is confirmed not ginger, and we can easily assume Dominique and Roxanne aren't. Also, Rose is a chaser, and her last name is Granger-Weasley. Victoire seems very disinterested in Quidditch.

But if you ignore all that...I'm guessing they'd give everyone a numbered jersey!

** I'd assume that Victoria and Dominique aren't gingers because of their mom.

Roxanne also might not be ginger, because of Angelina.

We don't know if Molly and Lucy have red hair, they could have taken after their mom as well.

But yeah, if all the female Weasley's, and Harry's daughter, ended up in one Quidditch team or something, that'd be crazy. That's to say, if they all even took the same job.

That'd be a pretty funny oneshot parody type of idea, I'd like to see that.
