Where he realizes that the tournament is a good way of stepping away from being the boy who lived and having his own accomplishments. Or is just really competitive. I will also takes fics where he doesn't tell Cedric about the dragons as a way to get back at him for the way the hufflepuffs have been treating him. No slash no bashing


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7469856/1/Hallowed]] - there is no BWL in this world but Harry realizes that if he wants to stand out and succeed, he needs to win the tournament. However, he voluntarily joins in 6th year. I recommend this story as well for an engaging plot and awesome fights.

** I like this request; I hadn't thought about it but now that you've mentioned it I do love the concept, especially Harry not helping Cedric out.
