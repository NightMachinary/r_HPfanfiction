Started rereading linkffn(The Crow: Phoenix Rising) only to come across the scenes where the goblins are super helpful and griphook is a shaman. I fucking hate stories that make goblins helpful if you're either nice to them or properly mean to them.


** Angry Harry and the Seven and Three to Backstep. Good stories but after reading them three times each I realized how cliche they were.

Ignorance is bliss.

** Less to do with cliche, and more my preferences, but the first fanfiction I ever read was Pet Project, a Snape/Hermione pairing, and I thought it was pretty damn good. And it is a well written story, but now I wouldn't look twice at it because it's a Snape pairing.

** Nightmares of Future Past. It was probably the first fic I read and I went back and reread it recently and there's a lot of stuff in that are considered cliche in fanfic now; fitness regiments, Snape being super evil, magic super trunk, friendly goblins, slight pureblood aristocracy, magical cores. I know it was started before DH came out so at the time those things could have been novel. Saying that I still look forward to it being updated just because I want to know how it ends.

** Faultlines by Pinky Brown- I LOVED this fic. Then a few months ago I decided to reread it and it just made my skin crawl.

One of my biggest pet peeves in HP fanfic is the idea that Ron is Hermione's lapdog and is a mess without her. This fic is just one big "Look how pathetic Ron is without Hermione." fap fest. I can't believe I once thought of this as a top ten fav.

** Too many to list; I was, and remain, a huge H/HR shipper, and unfortunately, in the Golden Age of fanfiction, that came part and parcel with a whole lot of Ron, Ginny, and sometimes Dumbledore bashing. That used to be something I could handle, but the longer I've been a part of the fandom the less I can abide it. Nowadays, if the writer isn't adroit enough to handle the pairing without ruining the other characters, it's not worth my time.

** I'm not a big fan of slash or any of the main "light side" characters having pairings with Draco/Snape/Voldemort but otherwise I'm very easy going with my choices. My well for shitty fics is nearly limitless. I've seen many fics that were hated on here and I've enjoyed reading them.

** Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm, linkffn(6892925)

Good emotional story, I liked the story when I read it few years ago. Few months ago, I read it again, couldn't like it anymore. This story has stuffs that I dislike - more specifically James bashing & nice Snape & a truly insufferable Hermione. Another thing to add, the story has nice Malfoy's & Sirius in Slytherin. Though it's not my preferred choice, I have no problem with Snape & Malfoy's being nice but when these come with a jerk James, I seriously dislike these two things together.

**** Whatever universe is, I really really dislike the idea of having a story both jerk James & nice Snale-Malfoy's. I understand it's AU & you can write nice Snape-Malfoy's without making James jerk. As soon as James became jerk, it basically means confirmation of how Snape represented James over the seven books rather than looking any good virtue of James - it doesn't matter which universe it is.

(In this story) Harry's comments on AU James' son is basically Snape's word from canon universe how he viewed James/views Harry. James & his son' characterization in AU is based on canon Snape's word. And that's what I dislike it most.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
