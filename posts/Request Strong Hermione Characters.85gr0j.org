I am looking for stories with good plot, writing, character development, and if possible Completed. I would also like if Hermione was the main character or plays a large role. A few of my favs are from ShayaLonnie's works, Six Pomegranate Seeds, Escape, and Lady Archimedes. I am hoping to read more stories similar in story robustness but enjoy some crack fics too.

Of course, the Hermione in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436), is adorably dark.

***** I don't think Dumbledore has a coherent moral philosophy (since most people don't), but he had put his act-utilitarian "Greater Good" thinking behind him over 50 years prior to the start of canon. In fact, some of the most fair criticism he receives from the fandom is that he was not proactive and ruthless enough against Voldemort and Death Eaters.

The most act-utilitarian character in canon would probably be Hermione.

****** Yeah canon hermione is definitely act utilitarian with a bit of rule utilitarian mixed in (e.g. antislavery regardless of circumstance)

It might be pretty funny to see what she would do if she turned into a Kantian :)

  Hermione makes new friends at Hogwarts -- and one lifelong enemy -- with her newfound love for proper skin and hair care. The wizarding world will be changed forever! A silly idea turned serious, and dedicated to those who skim read the title of my fic "Hermione Granger, Demonologist" a bit too fast. Hermione POV, humour, no pairings, complete.
