** My question is -- what's the point of having her be a Parselmouth if you're going to make it otherwise canon-compliant? The problem with making things canon-compliant aside from Hermione's lineage is that parseltongue, canonically, is just some shoddy magical trait that does basically nothing except say you're somehow connected to Slytherin.

I mean sure, she'll get some respect from Slytherins, and maybe she'll be called a mudblood less, but canonically, there is no evidence of it ever being used for magic, spells, etc., and canon compliance means canonically compliant magic, so it's just another useless skill. Being related to Slytherin also isn't that big of a deal, because if she isn't related to the Gaunts then she's probably from some squib or other, and squibs aren't exactly respected.

If Slytherin had any particularly interesting vaults, contraband, gold, etc., you can bet Tom Riddle would have emptied it ages ago, and considering that he spent years travelling and was a bona fide genius with powerful purebloods on his side, I think any of Slytherin's secrets -- if he had any to begin with -- would, logically, have been found and taken as well.

*** What it does is /it lets you talk to snakes/, dammit, and that's interesting! The hows and whys of how she got it (including whether she's related to Salazar Slytherin at all) are irrelevant to what I want to do with it. Essentially, my baseline reasoning was "Mrs SPEW + Ability to see snakes as a sentient species when everybody treats them as animals = Hijinks". Also, while Riddle may have taken any secret tomes or whatever from the Chamber, remember the events of Second Year haven't happened yet so the Basilisk is still there for her to find.

**** But no, it really isn't. Harry had the ability for the entire series, and there's only /one/ big bad magical snakey at Hogwarts, and that's the basilisk, and then it's dead and he just uses it to spy on what Voldemort says to his snake. Voldemort had the ability, and he just uses it to intimidate his followers and open the chamber; we see him doing nothing else with this apparently impressive hereditary skill. The Gaunts, inbred as they were, would probably have found something to do with it if it was actually useful, considering they've spent generations denigrating to hissing at each other in a hovel, but there's nothing mentioned on it.

It's just a magical language with incredibly limited use if you adhere to canon, and I really don't see how you can base the main premise off Hermione basically just being born with a language with incredibly limited uses. If you want to go into "wow, funny hijinks" for it, then sure, it'll be funny for one or two chapters, tops; maybe it'll be a decent reoccurring joke if you can do it well. But that's about it.

And the Basilisk is there for her to happen upon but, logically, I would like to state that there is an /incredibly, ridiculously/ low chance of Hermione finding it so soon; once again, Riddle was a genius and it took him most of the way through his schooling before he found it, and it's not exactly like there's a large number of snakes that'll lead Hermione directly to the basilisk, is there? Besides, even if Salazar is her ancestor, she's going into the wizarding world with a mostly muggleborn mindset; if she sees a snake on a tap, her first instinct probably won't be "oh, I should talk to that tap!", it'd be "well, that's a fancy tap, I guess".

Uhm, what about /chatting with Nagini/? I reiterate my point. /It lets you talk to snakes/. Which is awesome. Because unless you follow that weird "Parseltongue /makes/ the snake smarter for the duration of your chat with it" theory, snakes in the HP universe are considerably more intelligent than their real-life counterparts. They're people, no less so than Elves or Goblins.

Hmmm... I was under the impression Riddle didn't start /looking/ for the Chamber until he discovered his true parentage, and thus the assertion it took him 'most of his schooling' may not be that accurate, though I see your point.

****** Yes, he chats with Nagini, but does that have any /functional/ purpose other than being cool or intimidating? Not really. Maybe you could use snakes as spies, I guess, but that's really about it -- and if you're setting it up in Hogwarts, without knowledge of the Chamber & therefore the pipe system, having a bunch of random snakes slithering down corridors is pretty suspect when it's not even one of the allowed pets. It's fine if you think it's /awesome/, but is just 'awesomeness' really going to last as the center-most plot point?

The thing is, you can't compare them with actual magical races, because even if the snakes /are naturally smarter/ to the point of holding some conversation, they have no real canonical culture; they're just snakes. Even if they can talk, they're still just snakes that talk about snakey things (probably general animal things like food, warmth, laying eggs), unlike goblins, centaurs, etc., that have /magic/ and culture & all sorts of interesting things. Sure, you can /teach/ them other things (like, I doubt a newly born basilisk will instinctually try to kill all muggleborns), but that's about it. I can't think of an interesting plot where you would actually, constantly use Parseltongue. Maybe if you raise a bunch of dangerous magical snakes? But there's nowhere that you can actually /go/ to do that without the Chamber or the Room, and she probably won't find either in her first few years, and you don't seem to be going there in your story, so.

And on the subject of Riddle and the Chamber -- I think I worded that badly, sorry; I had that impression too, but I still think he would find the Chamber in less time than Hermione would (after they both started searching). It would take a pretty long time to find one small snake tap in a female bathroom as a boy. Mind you, he probably doesn't discover his heritage immediately, either, so he has a few years to get used to the idea of a magic school being /magical/, and he hates his /normal/ orphanage, so he's probably more willing to accept strange wizardy things like talking taps and talking snake figurines, because it makes him special. In fact, having a super special heritage would make him the most special, so he'd even be willing to follow uncertain legends and rumours about the Chamber, which according to most people, doesn't exist.

Hermione, on the other hand, is a pretty proud muggleborn -- we see that in her SPEW campaigns and things like that. She's used to the muggle world, grows up there, and if she's not very socially well-adjusted, then she's at least not abused/generally neglected, canonically. The bathroom is abandoned and often flooded by then -- there's no reason for her to frequent it at all before she brews the polyjuice in 2nd year, when she is /specifically/ searching for a hidden place to brew. As I mentioned before, she's muggleborn, so she probably won't think of talking taps. If she hears about the Chamber, but every source she believes in (teachers, books, etc.) all basically talk about it as a legend, then she's probably not going to try and find it (and especially not in her first year). So yeah, bad odds.

Honestly, aside from thinking that it's a parlour trick and generally unsustainable (and will probably lead to a canon rehash) if you just make Parseltongue the main plot point, my main issue is probably with how you're trying to keep it canon-compliant, when even most of the things (Hermione finding the Chamber before the book's y2 fiasco) you've tried to explain won't make sense if you keep characters decently in character and therefore canon-compliant (aside from the parseltongue).

Taking a moment to reaffirm my side in that old debate: I interpret the letter's "you can bring a cat OR a toad OR an owl" as saying "if you have one on this list you can't bring either of the other two", but not at all forbidding you from bringing a dog or a rat (hello Scabbers) or a flamingo or whatever the hell you want (as long as it's not an XXXXX creature, Hagrid, please keep up).

When I mean canon-compliant, I mean everything not /affected/ by the point of departure will not /contradict/ the books. That is not to say that 1) I am not going to worldbuild /additional info/ about snakes that doesn't /contradict/ what is seen in canon, and 2) that Hermione's personality has not changed as a direct result of growing up with Parseltongue. Having always had this "special talent", Hermione is more accepting of magic; and as I foreshadowed in the first chapter, her disappointment with muggle herpetological books compared to her own Parselmouth ventures have led her to be a little less prone to taking the "accepted opinion" as gospel, though she's still an avid reader.

******** Ron, however, is the only student with a unique pet we know of in the series, and there's no signs that any Slytherins have snakes -- Crookshanks runs around the Gryffindor common room, but when the trio gets into the /Slytherin/ common room via polyjuice, there's no sign of any snakes. I honestly think Ron is the exception and not the rule, particularly because rats are generally small and useless and not dangerous; people probably wouldn't care. I doubt snakes would be included in the list unless you brought a particularly small, non-threatening, non-magical, and non-toxic one (which isn't exactly Nagini-level in terms of interesting). Slytherin's also got a pretty bad reputation after the war, so more snakes probably...wouldn't be very advisable.

And that's fine, I guess, but books about animals still don't equate to talking furniture. I mean, it's one thing to find out that maybe a doctor diagnosed you wrong (and did the equivalent to your talking pet), but another to jump to the realisation that suddenly, it's not just your snakes that can talk, but if your bathroom sink has an extra motif it can talk and also shapeshift and lead to secret underground rooms.

Keep in mind that though he tries to avoid it, Harry does talk to some snakes throughout the book -- and considering how snakes listen to parselmouths quite a bit, and we never see any evidence of a canonical snake world (not even through Voldemort), worldbuilding a snake world, while interesting, would not be canon-compliant.

I point you towards /Parselbrat/'s excellent snake worldbuilding which never contradicts canon (about snakes) as far as I can tell. Anyway, what snakes are you talking about that Harry talked to? There's:

- The Brazilian Boa Constrictor. Brief, mostly non-verbal chat in which the boa barely has time to formulate his motivation before plot happens and he escapes.

- The Basilisk. In point of fact Harry never talked to her for some reason --- he does hear the whispers in the pipe but not a word goes between them whatsoever in the climax.

- Nagini. The only time they really talk is when Nagini is disguised (...?) as Bathilda Bagshot, which would not at all be the right moment to discuss snake customs even if she /wanted/ to, which I find unlikely.

- That snake in the Duelling Club scene. All it does is obey Harry's command not to attack, before it is vanished/teleported-out by Snape. Heck, it doesn't even get the chance to /say/ anything.

I'd hardly find the lack of allusions to snake society in those instances jarring evidence that no such thing could exist in canon. Even the Voldemort argument is patchy (So he'd lecture Harry about snake traditions... /when/, exactly? I'm not sure he's even aware Harry's a Parselmouth before at least Fourth Year. And besides, Voldemort is so entitled about his Slytherin heritage I'm dubious that he would give away any nugget of information he may have on Parseltongue and serpents, especially not to his blood-traitor of a sworn enemy.)

********** To be clear, I meant through Voldemort as in through his mental connection with him -- iirc, Harry eavesdropped on him a few times and probably heard him hissing with Nagini?

And while there might not be information that /explicitly/ says that a magical society of magical snakes doesn't exist, the fact that /nobody ever mentions it/ is kind of telling. Goblins have wars, magical buildings, and treaties. Hermione reads a lot, and knows that Harry is a parselmouth past y2. So does Dumbledore. In researching how to defeat Voldemort, I really doubt that they wouldn't have brought it up if there was an actual, documented snake society; Voldemort is known for his pride in his Slytherin heritage, so Dumbledore/Hermione//someone/ on their side would probably have mentioned it if it actually existed, and when they're looking for any possible clues as to where he's hidden his horcruxes, I don't think that a full-blown society would have been glossed over.

************ Right, I just skimmed a few chapters of Parselbrat -- I hadn't read it before -- and I'm... well, I can see how it'd work there. However, your story's first chapter already has her going on the train -- and there's not exactly a lot of snakes to find at Hogwarts if you follow the rules, so it's not really practical unless you're planning to spend loads and loads of time on flashbacks. You mentioned her being less willing to follow accepted opinions, but from the title, she's still going to be a /Gryffindor/ -- the most commonly accepted "best" house. I read your chapter, and the only way that she seems less willing to .. follow what others say, I guess, is when she's patronizing them.

(A bit offtopic from my original issue with the snake thing, but I don't see why not following accepted opinions would make her patronize /an expert/ in a /new world/ where things are /magical/, but would still result in her being sorted into Gryffindor and somehow makes her more likable to Ron, even though she's still a know-it-all?)

Edit:

I hope I'm not being too offensive; I just really don't see the point/reasoning behind making Hermione a parselmouth in a canon-compliant world.

She's not an /expert/, she just has a more open mind than in canon. Moreover, Gryffindor certainly isn't the house of conformist sticklers for the rules and accepted opinion --- that would be Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff. I'd say it's extremely Gryffindor to have an independant streak, judging from the amount of pranksters who end up there. The fact that Hermione is now more independant only adds on to the reasons the Hat placed her in Gryffindor in canon (namely her drive to make the world a better place --- see SPEW --- and general willingness to go out of her way to do good), which are closer to her core personality and thus were not really affected by the Parseltongue.

Ollivander is weird even for a wizard, and not a little silly at times, especially when he's trying to be cryptic and mysterious. Hermione patronizing him about the wands was a way of bursting his bubble of magical ominousness (while simultaneously, but only secondarily, showcasing another facet of Hermione's character: the Gryffindor /daring/ that took so long to come out in Canon!Hermione, who I'm sure wouldn't have dared to go against Ollivander at first even if he'd been speaking /utter/ nonsense).
