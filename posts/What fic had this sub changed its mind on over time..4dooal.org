For example I feel The Firebird Trilogy is seen differently now it's complete as is Dumbledores Army and the Year Of Darkness.


** I remember that people recommended Harry Crow back in early 2015.

*** I think it has a lot do do with new readers to the fandom, where they get recommended what fanfic vets know to be a bad story, but since they are new to the fandom, they don't know that yet. They fall in love with the first fic they read (Harry Crow in some cases), they stay in that mindset, and just read similar stories without really branching out. Some people never move on past it (like the people who found MoR as one of their first fics), some stay around for a year and look back and realize how bad their taste in fanfics really was.

As for the OP, I'm not sure if people are really changing their mind on the Firebird Trilogy or the Year of Darkness, but I don't really know what people thought of them a year ago. I know a year ago I thought they were very meh, and I haven't changed on that stance... One observation on a fic I do have is that it looks like some people are finally coming around to realize that The Lie I've Lived isn't actually any good. It's taken years, but it's happening.

When it was still being updated The Firebird Trilogy was pretty well praised on here, most notably for being a Harem fic in an interesting AU which didn't fall into standard Harem tropes. The opinion changed as the story unfolded.

Year of Darkness was the go to 7th year fic for years and has recently been supplanted by one from Ginny's POV.

Totally agree about The Lie I've Lived.

*** The first few chapters weren't totally terribad, were they? It deceives you. It lures you in. Then it strikes.

**** I remember even the first few chapters to be filled with typical robst rethorics, so I was very wary of it from the start.

I read until the scene with Harry coming to Hogwarts, then I noped out of there. Thats around the beginning of chapter 3, if you're wondering.

***** I just re-read Chapter 1 and nothing offended me too much. Chapter 2, though, raised a red flag at how Harry was dressed "like a muggle", just one from a different century, apparently, because the Goblins, I guess, are completely incapable of researching modern muggle culture.

****** Don't be racist! Haven't you read chapter 1? Goblins are superior in every way compared to the barbarism practiced by /yuk/ wizards. There is probably a perfectly good explanation for his attire, you ignorant bigot.
