:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where it has specific dialogue. Hermione is talking to Tom or something (I'm pretty sure it's a time travel fic) and she thinks something along the lines "of course he's uptight about being on time. This is the same man who gave Harry a time-limit/ deadline for his own death". She then thinks about how Harry had only a few hours to come to terms with his own death and thinks "Poor Harry. She should do something nice for him when she gets back (maybe give him a hug)" or something along those lines. Does anyone know the fic I am talking about?
