Fics that you often don't suggest, the ones that may be unpopular because they carry a stigma.


** Over the past couple of years I've seen people debate/warn about these fics multiple times:

- "0800-Rent-A-Hero" by brainthief - This fic has a bad reputation because the author stopped posting updates after demanding that his readers pay him to keep working on it.

- "Diagnosis" by MaidenMotherCrone - This fic straight up copies scenes and dialogue from Greys Anatomy without any credit given. Most of her readers mistakenly assume that she made up every scene and line from her own creativity, when in reality she's just slapping different names on someone else's work. Judging by comments on her fics, that kind of plagiarism is a regular tactic of hers.

- "The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles" by samvelg - The writer was accused of paraphrasing scenes and ideas from other fanfic authors without the courtesy of giving credit. The response when called out on it was rather (edit) petty.

***** The thing is, "Blindness" doesn't actually contain any explicit depictions of sex. The only two people mentioned as having sex in the fic were two 17 year olds: boyfriend and girlfriend who later got maried. The scene faded to black before they got much further than kissing. Seventeen is the age of majority in the world that JKR wrote, so that depiction is actualy fairly common and uncontroversial in the Harry Potter fandom, not to mention it's standard fare in published books, movies, TV shows, etc.

The only reason a mod (briefly) put it on the banned list was that one person had spoken up claiming it was super breaking the rules, but in retrospect it seems likely that person was trolling. The mod took that claim at face value without bothering to read further or look at the wider context, and that's how the whole drama of the banned fics list was set off. If you read through the related threads that popped up at that time you'll see that, while many people agreed with the 'no underage depictions' rule as it refers to /actual/ pedophilia, the majority opinion was that "Blindness" clearly did not belong on the list.

** I'm reading the Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs right now, thanks to seeing it mentioned as controversial in a post a few days ago. The central plot seems to share a lot in common with Dune, blended very interestingly with the world of witchcraft and wizardry. But it involves a lot of rape/non-consent, much of it with underage characters, so I can totally understand why many people would be vehemently against it. But it is a very interesting read and a novel take on HP fanfiction, IMO.

Which is what fanfiction is for and sometimes you just need that one fic where you can turn your brain off and just enjoy reading everything go right for a bit.

Harry having a special-snowflake wand is one of those tropes that is extremely common in indy!Harry or dark!Harry fics when the author cares more about wish fullfillment than consistent worldbuilding.

In terms of a controversial Harmony? [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series][May I recommend this?]]) It's an early 2000s AU that ultimately chickens out into canon ships. Much darker tone than the books from POA onwards. /s

********** Aside from the Trolley Witch bit, the Cursed Child has pretty much the exact tone as the books (raucous and hilarious adventure) and the central premise of time turners is entirely consistent with Hermione's description of what can go wrong from POA.

In contrast, the movies have completely the wrong tone, continually demonstrate things that sit weirdly with book canon (e.g. wandless magic) and, of course, make it look like time turners create stable time loops... which, if true, renders Hermione's warnings pointless.

I might add that the blatant queerbaiting with Albus and Scorpius is the exact sort of tone deaf attitude to social issues that Rowling's Twitter account is famous for... so I guess that's pretty authentic too.

Of course, the Trolley Witch is a pretty big deal. And Harry's scar hurting is also whack. But, on the whole, the movies are a much bigger deviation from the books.
