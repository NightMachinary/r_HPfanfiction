I read this fic years ago and have tried searching for it multiple times but haven't been able to find it.

If I remember it correctly, Snape performs a spell that keeps Harry alive even though he's been kidnapped by Voldemort and subjected to his multiple attempts at killing him. From what I remember, he tries to stab him and puts him in a room that has a very low temperature because he thinks that he'll be able to kill him through muggle means.

From what I remember it was very well written so if you know the title or have a link to that story it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!


** Never heard of it myself, but this might help. Good luck!
