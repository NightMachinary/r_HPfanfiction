Hi all.

As the above states, I am looking for those types of fics.

Ideally, they should have Lily or Sirius (or both if both are around) teaching Harry as he grows up. I'm interested to see how different Harry could end up with these influences in his life growing up.

Cheers.

  A pre-Hogwarts tale that will be the first of eight books retelling the tale of Harry Potter. An exploration of the Many World's theory where changing one thing changes everything and at the same time changes nothing. HPMD sets the stage for a different Harry as he embarks on the journey of a lifetime. Rated M for language and later content.

** Lily survived, although Petunia and Vernon take care of Harry (and aren't cruel to him like in canon). Incomplete, but well written, interesting story.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

** The 'Stealing Harry' verse springs to mind - it follows Harry being raised by Sirius (and Remus, they're a couple as well) from a young age to his Third Year.

#+begin_quote
  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.
