So. I've been thinking about this for quite some time now, and wanted to know if there's some fics about the subject out there: what the heck is the deal with Hermione's parents in canon?

We see them once in CoS, IIRC, and then nada. Nothing. Zero. I mean, come on? We get real good glimpses into Harry's and Ron's families, so I don't understand why poor Hermione never seems to want to talk about hers. She spends most of the summer holidays at the Weasley's and has no compunction about erasing their memories when I'm sure she could've done something else, amongst other things.

Were her parents abusive? Did they not accept magic? Did she, with her "superior intellect" thought them stupid and ignored them? Were they just not there? Did she invent them? I don't know. There could be a number of explanations (including the most obvious one for canon, I know: Rowling simply didn't think they were important to the overall plot) and I'm curious to read fics that explore this.

I've read linkffn(Sympathetic Properties), where her mum has some condition (Asperger's? I forget) and her dad is basically a clown (a lovable one, yes, but Hermione generally thinks of him as a grown child) and linkffn(Moments in love by Gandalf's Beard) where she runs away in third year bc her parents hate/are afraid of the magical world and want to pull her from Hogwarts.

Just as an afterthought, I'm a diehard H/Hr shipper.

thanks for the help! x


** I always wondered about her parents and upbringing too.

From the way she acts I think you can tell Hermione, like Harry, never had any friends and was bullied.

Honestly like I think for JKR, like you say, they just weren't important enough to the plot (I mean, we don't even know their names!). From what I gather I think they are nice parents but nervous of the wizarding world (like when we see them with the Weasleys in Diagon Alley). I don't think Hermione tells them half of what goes off in school. They'd probably feel some kind of disconnect from Hermione as, as much as they might want to be, they could never be fully involved in the wizarding world. ANyway, these are just my ideas I'm waffling on about :P

But sticking around in this thread as I'd like to read fics with Hermione's background too, and I also love H/Hr!

*** I agree with you. They weren't very relevant to the plot. I imagine they were very nervous about the magical world and didn't know what to do with Hermione since she was gone most of the year. They probably felt as if they had grown apart from her, but also wanted to make sure she would fit in at her new world, especially since she had trouble making friends when she was younger.

*** Out of curiosity, why do you get the sense that both Harry and Hermione act like they were significantly bullied pre-Hogwarts? A lot of people get the sense that they do, but I've always thought that Harry, in particular, seemed oddly unaffected by his upbringing, while early-canon Hermione is lonely because she has trouble empathizing with and relating with her age-cohort --- as many studious, precocious children do --- but if anything, she's socially /overconfident/ most of the time, which is not exactly a symptom of bullying.

Now, Neville --- definitely. But Harry and Hermione --- what are you seeing that I am not?

**** I think people react different to bullying. Neville, for instance, became shy and thought himself worthless. Harry preferred the "I have no idea of what you're talking about" method, where he did not like to talk about his relatives, Harry Hunting or his lack of friends pre-Hogwarts. Hermione tried to boost her self-esteem by being a "know-it-all", as it were (tho she often became upset by Ron and Draco's taunts, especially in the early books).

Of course, that's just my opinion and headcanon. I identify with Hermione being bullied in primary school bc I was and acted similar - kids would be mean and I would usually respond by either trying to beat the crap out of them or excelling in my grades (it doesn't make sense, I know haha)

***** Thanks for the explanation. I take your point but, I think that this is a bit of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_sharpshooter_fallacy][Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy]].

Basically, if different people react differently to a history of being bullied to the point that /any/ behavior pattern can be explained by bullying, then can /any/ behavior pattern be evidence of a history of being bullied?

After all, one can make an equally strong case that Draco was bullied horribly pre-Hogwarts, so he only sees the world in terms of bullies and victims, and so he bullies others horribly to keep himself from being victimized. Ditto Ron, and pretty much any character in their age cohort with any sort of development.

*** It was honestly the best move. Everything going on with the Order without Dumbledore was a bit of a clusterfuck. I mean, if you're getting key ideas for your extraction of the most important person on your side of the conflict to a safe location from /Mundungus Fletcher/, shit ain't right. This way has two prime pluses that override all cons.

1. Death Eaters are shit with the Muggle World, and this way they would never be able to tract them down when they're under fake names the Grangers truly believe to be their own through completely Muggle methods, and probably computerized records (airports and whatnot in the late 90s kept records digitally, right? I was a young boy back then).

2. If shit hit the fan and Hermione died, her parents wouldn't know the grief of having a dead child.

*** oh no, I do think she cared about them. I just think she could've asked for permission instead of going behind their backs (if they already knew so much, it would show them she respected their opinions and whishes). Maybe she could've asked them to volunteer in some sort of doctors without borders program. Or take a sabbatical in Australia (highly doubt the DEs would go looking in muggle Aussie). Or something else. IDK.

** I think that fics that do interesting things with Hermione's parents tend to occur on the intersection of three sets:

- Fics that are at least 50% about Hermione, for obvious reasons.
- Fics that are not primarily romance, because her parents, when they show up in romance fics, tend to show up caricaturishly in the "meet the boyfriend" context.
- Fics that are Hogwarts-era, because Hermione leaves the nest after that.

Very few fics belong to all three sets.

I think linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) does something interesting things with them, by setting up a tension between the Slytherin!Hermione's Muggle home, where she is safe and loved unconditionally, but feels weak and foreign, and Hogwarts, where she must secure her belongings and intimidate others to stay safe, fight for every scrap of respect she gets, but feels at home and empowered; and how she and her parents navigate that tension, behaving like loving and supportive /and forgiving/, but also worried parents of a teenager who is drifting away from them.

linkffn(The Arithmancer by WhiteSquirrel) also deals with Hermione's parents and their worries about the dangerous life she is living at Hogwarts --- with their even transferring her to Beauxbatons at one point.

But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** Well, there's one shit one I don't remember the name of where Harry and Hermione elope and run off in which Hermione's parents care more about appearances than about Hermione as a person, really. Don't bother reading it, terrible Mugglewank with the Queen in charge of the Magical Britain.

It comes up as a relatively minor plot point in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) where Hermione was an unplanned child, and her mother took only the minimum maternity leave, and she was basically raised by a nanny.

There's one I recall that I also don't remember the name of where Hermione's parents are apparently alcoholics. Can't remember the quality at all.

That's all I really remember. I'm not a big H/Hr man, so I don't read a ton of it.

** It's a snipped in script form that I had posted before, but here's my headcanon about how the conversation in DH went down, being charitable to both Hermione and her parents:

*Hermione:* ... and that's why you need to go somewhere far away from there --- ideally Australia. I've Charmed these forged papers to appear real to any Muggle that examines them.

*Parents:* Thank you so much. But, there are only two sets of documents here.

*Hermione:* Mum, dad, I have to stay. Ha- I can't tell you the details, but it's our only chance to stop Voldemort.

*Parents:* If you're staying, we're staying.

*Hermione:* But you can't! They'll go after you to get to me. I can't protect you!

*Parents:* Yes, and you might hate us for it, but if taking ourselves hostage is the only way to make you leave with us to safety, then we will do it.

*Hermione:* Mum, Dad, I'm sorry...

*Parents:* We are sorry too, but...

*Hermione:* No, not about that. /STUPEFY!/ /STUPEFY!/ So sorry... /CONFABULUS!/ /CONFABULUS!/

I recall reading some chem prof in my early days in the fandom, though I don't remember that fic. However, I don't like the idea of Moody butting in on what is, I think, one of her character-defining moments: Hermione should have enough of a drive to Do What Must Be Done to come up with and execute the plan without him, even if she has to cry herself to sleep afterwards.

  Collection of Straightforward!Harmony vignettes and scenes-no multi-ships. It will largely follow canon plot-points beginning in First Year they will not be random ideas-they will all be occurring within the same ongoing storyline.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.
