Looking for a good long story with Harry, that has a decent amount of Smut and doesn't dance around the subject of sex. No male slash involving Harry please. Multi/Harem are ok, no xovers. Thanks!


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor by cloneserpents)

Incidentally also up there as favourite comedy.

This, imo, is the best one. Too bad not completed and hasn't been updated in awhile, but 40 chapters are enough to keep you entertained.

Mostly I'm taken in with the setting and the set of rules that the author created (or re-created to be exact. There's another story with the same name by another author. That one was bad).

  It started with a surprising proposals from an unexpected source, but that was only the beginning. Soon, Harry finds himself dealing with forces beyond his imagination and dreams, and ultimately finds that the world is not what he believed it to be.

  Lily uses a dark ritual to protect her son which has long term ramifications for him. Not that he's complaining about the perks of the matter. Harry/Multi, obviously. Very dark and may offend delicate sensibilities. More information inside. Reposted after accidental deletion. Don't ask even though someone end up will doing so.

*** His is not the only valid opinion, and others have joined the list since then.

I don't get why folks think that prior responses are searchable, because they're not. Reddit is a cafe environment; those having a conversation now aren't aware of any conversations that were had before they entered the room.

**** Except prior threads /are/ searchable. There's a search box on the main hpfanfic page. If you are viewing with the app or a mobile version, you can click the search icon there too. It's pretty simple. A quick search solely for the word "smut" returned dozens of results.

If requesters would search old threads, they could find dozens of excellent links. Also, the wiki is tremendously underutilized by the sub in general.
