** It's not Elder Scrolls based, but in the Denarian Trilogy Dumbledore teaches Harry a power which operates in a similar way (known as /Words/). Here's the excerpt of us witnessing Dumbledore using one for the first time:

#+begin_quote
  [Voldemort] raised his arms and gestured at Dumbledore grandly. Shadows whipped up around him until a gigantic mass of darkness rose into the air, sucking in all the light from the fireplaces and causing the entire room to dim into darkness.

  "Very impressive, Tom," Dumbledore said amidst the darkness. Golden light surged around him, highlighting his weathered features and long, wizard's hat. "However, I am afraid that I am familiar with the magic you wield. All modesty aside, it will not be enough to defeat me.'

  "We shall see," Voldemort spat.

  He brandished his wand at Dumbledore and the gigantic mass of shadow surged forward, forming into something vaguely resembling a dragon's head. Dumbledore didn't move until the darkness was right above him. Then, he simply raised his wand and spoke out three words. The entire room stilled for a moment, as if the words themselves were gathering everything up for themselves, and then they boomed out as if Dumbledore had roared them into a megaphone. Small pieces of debris around the wizened sorcerer were crushed by the mere sound of this voice and Voldemort gasped as the gigantic shadow was reduced to nothingness, torn asunder by a mere voice. Dumbledore twisted his wand at Voldemort and spoke another Word. Although his voice was clear, nobody listening in could actually understand what it was that the former Headmaster had said.

  Whatever it was, it was powerful. The force of the Word shot at the Dark Lord, crushing the ground and distorting the air. Voldemort crossed his arms over his chest and, with a flare of his crimson eyes, gathered the darkness around him once more. Shadow and Word met in a deafening roar of conflict as the word stripped away the shadow and slammed into Voldemort. The Dark Lord was thrown backwards, tumbling and twisting as he bounced along the ground. He arose several yards away, his eyes furious.

  "The Psalm of Ar'uck'shei," Voldemort murmured thoughtfully. He gathered himself, staring at Dumbledore with grudging respect. "You impress me, old man. That is very ancient lore."

  Harry wasn't as defenceless as people wanted to believe; on his first visit to Diagon Alley he discovers something that changes him in more ways than one and unleashes a power far beyond that of magic. Those who wish to do him harm must beware, for the Dragonborn comes.

  A small Voice calls from the Throat of the World, and the Dragonborn comes. One person can shape the world, but two can change the realms forever.
