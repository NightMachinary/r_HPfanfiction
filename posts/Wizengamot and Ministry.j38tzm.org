I was doing some research and looked up the Wizengamot on the HP lexicon website.

I'm convinced the Wizengamot is more of high court than a legislature as most people seem to assume. And the laws are written by the numerous departments and enforced by the Ministry.

If that's the case, then how is the Minister of Magic removed from his position if people want him out? It is implied that the Minister is elected for 7 years on Pottermore, but they are many cases in which the Minister has been forced out in some way

It would make sense if the Wizengamot was a legislature and they had the power to remove the Minister, but it isn't.


** The ICW can censure and summon ministers. I assume that while the minister might be able to create laws and appoint department heads, there are still mechanisms to force his removal and limits to the law that he can create. If the ICW has authority over the minister, I assume there are internal checks on the minister. Just because the minister can create laws does not mean there are no checks and balances.

And the wizengamot likely does serve as a legislature. It seems that legislative responsibility is split between the ministry and the wizengamot. For example, the ratification of the statute of secrecy was under the purview of the wizengamot.

** I imagine just a vote of the Department Heads.
