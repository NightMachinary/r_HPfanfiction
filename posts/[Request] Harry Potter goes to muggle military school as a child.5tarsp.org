** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Iron Lady) has Harry raised by an SAS major and trained to be a hero for the muggles. Later on its looking like he'll end up training with the SAS and at hogwarts to basically be a dark wizard killer. Don't know about pairings, at this point they're aren't really any as Harry's just 11.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. When the SAS begins their investigation, they stumble upon an abused Harry Potter. Determined to raise a hero who will champion both the magical and mundane worlds, Harry is taken into a loving home. Eleven years later, he is unleashed on Hogwarts.

** linkffn(what we're fighting for)

Not muggle, but has a Harry that was raised by Sirius and co. as a child soldier. Takes place I think in 6th year when Harry comes to Hogwarts and begins fighting against Voldemort in earnest. HP/HG.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.
