How do you view/write minor characters like Daphne Greengrass, Lisa Turpin, Anthony Goldstein, Marlene McKinnon, Emmeline Vance ect extra?

Everyone has their own personal headcanons on characters and I was just wondering what they were.


** Ever since reading linkffn(Whatever Happened to Bromance?) I can't view McLaggen as anything other than a frat-bro.

As Daphne Greengrass doesn't have a single line of dialogue in canon, I like to think think of her as one of those people who are quiet and reserved in public, but open, lively, sarcastic, etc. when in private with their best friend (in this case, Tracey Davis).

For some reason, I always view Tracey Davis and Astoria Greengrass as bubbly people with lively personalities. Can't help it.

I view Narcissa Malfoy as someone who doesn't really give a shit about Voldemort or his movement. Only her family. If she has to kill an innocent to save her husband or son, she'll do it, but that's it. She gives a shit about Lucius, Draco, and living a comfortable lifestyle.

Susan Bones has big breasts.

** I view Tracey Davis as someone who has a more deadpanned delivery when she speaks, to the point where you aren't too sure if she's joking or serious.

While Daphne is more sarcastic, unafraid of saying what she thinks, although when she's around adults she's perfectly polite and quiet.

Astoria I see as more quiet/reserved, but once she gets to know you she's more open and carefree.

Blaise I see as charming and sophisticated, someone who likes to be around a group of people.

Theodore Nott on the other hand is quiet but can be rather snarky at times; and doesn't say much, but when he feels comfortable can be rather deep about things.

Anthony I see as hardworking, someone that doesn't like the idea of giving up. He's a jokester, but not in the prank making sense, more in the making everyone feel happy sort of sense, being able to draw someone out of their shell.

Padma is the opposite of Parvati. While Parvati is lively, and talkative Padma is quiet, and can be pretty shy if she's not around that person a whole lot.

Susan is charming and very nice to people, she'll talk about things she likes while trying to get someone to talk to her. She's helpful, always wanting to help students who are having trouble.

Hannah is incredibly shy, just as shy as Neville is. She stammers when she speaks, which she does grow out of. She's not very talkative but she means well.

Marlene much like Susan is incredibly nice person, she in my headcanon had a huge crush on Sirius Black. She was friends with Lily Evans, and in my headcanon became a Healer at St. Mungos.

Emmeline is very outgoing, loving to party and have fun, but she will at times want to be by herself without others every now and then. I often see her older then James and Lily, likely around Molly and Arthur's age or even Fabian and Gideon's age. (I have Fabian and Gideon as older brothers to Molly, I know some people have them as younger).

I often have Emmeline and Fabian together as a couple before the war.

Narcissa loves her family and would do anything for them. In my headcanon Rodolphus Lestrange had a crush on Narcissa, but her family ended up doing an arranged marriage with Lucius Malfoy; who she does love in her own quiet way. But it's her son that she loves and would do anything for.

** As someone who went to high school in a predominantly modern jewish neighborhood (Upper West Side, NYC), every time I think of Anthony Goldstein I think of this friend I had (who actually looks a lot like how Anthony is supposed to look). Basically a super liberal-thinking, very into Jewish culture and events (attends Hebrew school, a lot of his friends are Jewish), metrosexual by the time he was 13/14, ballet-dancing/theater kid, knack in politics and debate.

Marlene McKinnon is super Scottish with the accent to match, even uses words like bairn etc. Comes from a family of aurors. I always remember how they went after her entire family, and I don't see why they'd do that unless all of them were actively opposed to Voldemort in some way. They could also be politicians, but I always kind of reserved that for the Bones family.

Emmeline Vance was a BAMF. This is 100%, there is no way she was such a key member to the Order of the Phoenix if she wasn't. I always thought she was a handful of years older than Harry's parents, but still played with James on the Gryffindor team. Definitely a Chaser, could see her being super fast and aggressive. Has a sort of pub-personality (Idk if that's a thing) but basically after a game would like to crack a cold one with the team (not into huge parties). I always had her as a POC in my head, but in the movie she was depicted as white (this is probably because I associate last name Vance with actor Courtney B Vance, who is Black)

*** My person headcanon for Emmiline Vance, since she's not listed as an Auror, is that she was great at Defense, but Neville at Potions.

** Lavender Brown---for me, she survives the attack against Greyback but she has scars. I'd like to think that she has been always been vain about her appearance so she becomes ashamed of the scars for a long time.

Never liked that. Most background characters are pretty much blank slates for me. Their personalities are added in the story, then when I finish/get bored off the story, 9 times out of 10 I just don't really think about them.

** Marlene McKinnon was the 'Molly Weasley' of the original Order. Dunno why, always viewed her that way. I like Molly though, so I like Marlene, I guess?

*** I have a minor headcanon that Florean is a huge supporter of ghost rights, and even though he would love the job as history professor he feels like Binns is one of the few ghosts who is actually employed and treated well enough, so whenever someone petitions him to take over the role he turns it down.

** I'm pairing Marlene with Caradoc Dearborn for a fanfic universe I'm thinking up. I see her as kind of a proto-Ginny in that she's a redhead,and a proto-Hermione in that she's /really/ brainy. She's friends with all four Marauders,and briefly went out with Sirius.

I've also written out a headcanon for Alicia Spinnet (who ends up with Fred in this timeline). I see her as the brainiest of the Chaser Trio (w/Angelina being the really athletic one and Katie being the fun,outgoing one). She comes from a halfblood family mostly famous for a Hufflepuff who taught Arithmancy at Hogwarts for /60 years/ (1740-1800).

In both timelines I'm working on, Tracey is a blithe-spirit type of person. She comes from a pureblood family that's not really racist (in fact,if any Davis openly expresses an anti-Muggle/Muggleborn opinion they're automatically disowned). She ends up with Kevin Entwhistle.

Susan and Ernie always end up together in my works,because I loved them in DAYD.
