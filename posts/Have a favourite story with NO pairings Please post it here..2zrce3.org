I got through Harry the Hufflepuff and its sequels awhile back, thought it was a fun read and wanted to see if this subreddit could recommend any other stories that don't bother getting into the romance aspect of HP. The search function wasn't much help so I'm betting you guys have some good ones stored away.

No HPMor recs, please. Already tried it and it's just not for me. Any length or rating is fine, but I'd prefer completed fics with no bashing.

Thanks in advance!

  Freaky connections aside, does anyone else think it strange that Harry survived a Killing Curse with little more damage than a scar? Well, what if he hadn't come through so unscathed? And what if the other damage was more mental than physical?

  There have always been certain unwritten rules at Hogwarts. Gryffindors are not friendly to Slytherins. Nobody learns anything in History of Magic. And nothing much ever happens to Theodore Wilkes Nott, apart from bullied by his own housemates, overshadowed by his clever friend Blaise, and ignored by everybody else. What happens when unwritten rules start to change?

**** Good choice, it's a great fic.

I keep a .doc file of most fics I read, complete with summaries, links, main characters and pairings (if any), so it's always easy for me to find one's to rec to people. I like being helpful. :)
