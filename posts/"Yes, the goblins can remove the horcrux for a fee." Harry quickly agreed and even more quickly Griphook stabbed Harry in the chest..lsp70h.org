** Snipped from a work in progress of mine. 'Terrible Things'

​

Harry's gone and found Helpful Goblins (TM) who've agreed to get rid of the Dursley problem. And detected mail redirection. The manager says Harry can call him Ragnarok.

Two goblins with swords have come into the office.

...

“Oh we'll be billing whoever redirected your mail.” said Ragnarok.

“Could I get some compensation too?” asked Harry hopefully.

Ragnarok sniffed “They grow up so quickly” he said. “We'll see what we can get.” he continued.

The taller goblin with a sword left, sniggering, carrying the crystal with the mail-redirection captured inside it.

The second goblin coughed “Human, you want an inheritance test?”

“Oh yes” said Harry.

The goblin took out a scroll of parchment and put it on the desk.

“Now, we'll need to take a blood sample to do this” said the shorter goblin.

Harry started rolling up a sleeve.

The goblin stopped him “Oh not the arm” it said, and pulled their sword out of it's sword holder-thing.

Harry looked at the sword for a second, before the goblin stabbed him in the chest with it.

Harry woke up lying on the floor. He grabbed his chest and found a hole in his shirt, but no blood, and he didn't feel a hole in his chest. He remembered very clearly the way the sword had cut into him, and gone out his back.

He sat up.

The second goblin, the stabby one, had left. Harry stood up and sat in the chair.

“Ah you're awake” said Ragnarok.

“He stabbed me” complained Harry.

“A blood sample.” said Ragnarok, pointing at the unrolled scroll on the desk, covered in dark brown writing. The colour of dried blood, as Harry knew rather well.

“You're a very fortunate human” said Ragnarok “You're the heir to the house of Black, the current Lord has made you his Heir. They are rich, if you wondered.”

“Where's this Lord Black?”

“In Azkaban prison for murder” said Ragnarok.

“Oh” said Harry a bit of a conversation-killer of a reason.

“You have an allowance from his lordship. Enough for you to engage in conspicuous consumption”

“Conspicu what?”

“You can spend many many galleons to look rich” said Ragnarok.

“Why make me his Heir?” asked Harry.

“The Lord was a very close family friend before his incarceration” said Ragnarok.

“Oh, lucky me” said Harry.

“You have some... concerning magical issues” said Ragnarok.

“What?”

“Some families do not let Heirs inherit unless they're magically powerful enough” explained Ragnarok. “So we did a magical strength test.”

“Oh, am I strong?”

“No, but your magic is bound. It makes you magically weaker.”

“Oh. Will I be able to.. do magic?”

“You currently have a power measurement of one hundred thaums. Quite normal for a wizard.” said Ragnarok.

“Oh, aren't I bound up?”

“Yes, we're organising an unbinding right now. Should be ... ah there they are” said Raganorok, and Harry turned around the see three goblin wizards coming in, wearing golden swords. Harry swallowed.

“So, if you'd just stand up, we can get your magic unbound” said Ragnarok.

“They're going to stab me, aren't they” said Harry glumly.

“A coincidence.” said Ragnarok, smiling toothily.

And the way the Horcrux gets removed, well... the cure is worse than the disease. Not technically by the "Helpful Goblins." But it was very reminiscnet

*** I'd love it if sometime in the future, Harry encounters a seemingly insurmountable problem, until he realized the solution, sighing, take off his shirt (because it's his favorite shirt) and the nearby Helpful Goblins^{TM} just nonchalantly stab him. Bonus point if other wizards around don't understand what's happening.

**** Oh no. Terrible Things is Much worse than that.

I'ts a cruel take on Harry as voldemort's equal.

He gets a superpower... sort of. But

Harry, after a few days of quiet at Privet drive, got a letter from St Mungos.

/'Mister Harry Potter,/

/We have found a temporary remedy for your... infection. It will not cure you, but will give some relief for probably a day./

/Take not more than one pill a day./

/Dalziel McGinty, Head of magical creature mishaps'/

Harry looked at the suspiciously muggle blister pack of pills that came from St Mungos.

He read the label “Wormex 180, for larger dogs”

Harry took one with water and waited.

About five minutes later, he rushed to the toilet.

After painful diarrhoea and blood, Harry screamed. After he'd stopped screaming, an ostrich-sized green, veined egg landed with a splot in the toilet.

Harry looked down, and cried some more.

Gingerly, he went to the shower and washed himself.

Ten minutes later, wearing gloves and a facemask he'd found in the back shed, he gingerly got the egg out of the loo, washed it off under the tap and put it in an old biscuit tin, then taped it shut.

He glared at the toilet, and it flushed itself. Harry was amazed. And sore and disgusted, but amazed.

He took his magic wand and waved it. A massive shower of sparks filled the room.

Harry looked at his wand. It smoked gently. That didn't seem right.

Harry took the train back to London and went back to see Olivander.

“My wand was smoking” said Harry.

“You can't do magic outside of school, young man” said Olivander, taking the wand.

He looked at the the wand carefully, then threw it in the bin “Burnt out” he said.

*** The horcrux isn't a tumor. Hell in canon the only way to remove it was for Harry to die the goblins having some secret method of detecting and removing it is all fanon.

***** A Horcrux isn't separate from the object, it /is/ the object, in the same way your body is you, not just a vase. A Horcrux emulates the way a soul inhabits a body, but with an inanimate object. That's why the only way to remove the soul shard is to destroy the object beyond repair, "killing" it.

*** Eh, he only said he was going to remove the Horcrux, technically with Harry dead the fragment of soul would be going to the limbo while (depending on the moment) he would go to the afterlife, so it would be removed both from his body, his soul and the living world as a whole.
