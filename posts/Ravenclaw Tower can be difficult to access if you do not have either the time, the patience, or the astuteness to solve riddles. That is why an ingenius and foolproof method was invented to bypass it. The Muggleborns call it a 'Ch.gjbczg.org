Create a series of weird or innocuous behaviours for Ravenclaw students to enact before vocalizing a stupid pass-phrase.

For example: Students must request a new riddle five times in a row, retreat by fifteen steps, return to the doorknocker, jump once, and then state: "Simon Says The Password is 'Password'."


** "Sudo open door"

** The cheatcode was actually Salazar playing a prank on Godric.
