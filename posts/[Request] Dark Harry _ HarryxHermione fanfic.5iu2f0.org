looking for either dark harry / or romance harry x hermione fanfics, would be nice if it would happen on hogwarts.


** /Broken Chains/, linkffn(7718942): typical Darth Marrs fic with tons of sex and violence, but reasonably well written. Luna later joined.

/Ruthless/, linkffn(10493620): Theo Nott later joined.

**** I know. I like it even better than /Broken Chains/.

However, the Trio doesn't feel dark at all in this one. Maybe they will show their brutal side in future chapters, but right now they are happy playing the hero and savior of oppressed humans.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.

*** Broken Chains is easily DM's best story. I've been reading his other stuff recently and nothing compares to it. It's gripping, full of thrills, the violence actually serves the plot and the pacing is masterfully done. I like the sequel less but it's still in the set up stage.

** It's not really H/Hr, but the "golden" trio goes dark for noble reasons. Not romance, but very close relations.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Right? I think once it starts getting to the actual "war" chapters, we'll see it get darker.
