So following another [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cd8lml/the_dementor_on_the_train_in_3rd_year_eats_harrys/][prompt]] someone gave me an idea.

Harry discovers multiple things:

1. To make a Philosopher Stone, you need to use living souls

2. When a Dementor kisses someone he takes the soul and store it indefinitely not allowing it to pass on in death properly (like the Deah God from Naruto)

He then plans (for whatever reason you want) to make a Philosopher Stone in himself (he would *be* the "Stone" (like in FMA)) out of Dementors not to sacrifice innocent souls. When using the stone the energy is taken from the souls; this will in the end kill them but also allow them to die (a mercy in his eyes). He can't die as long as other souls are taken instead of his and he can also power spells or ritual needing souls with the Stone as long as he finds a soul fulfilling the requirement of the ritual. He can talk to the souls and learn from them (some are old and and not all are guilty as some were taken before the Dementors were used in Azkaban. If a soul has an soul attached ability he can harness it for himself (like Parseltongue).

Non important info, the way the Stone is made is the reason why the Flamel never made another or disclosed how it was made. That is also the reason why Dumbledore decided to destroy it (having found out how it was made when apprenticing under Flamel).


** Could I borrow this idea? I had a similar solution for trying to cure the Maledictus but I've never seen FMA so it's slightly different than yours

*** Ahah of course. It's a prompt after all. I would love to see fic like this. Do share your fic though.

And if you want to see FMA, look into "Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood" which is the best anime version which follows the manga properly.

**** Not that the OG FMA anime is bad. Brotherhood is superior.

There's also some OVAs and Movies.
