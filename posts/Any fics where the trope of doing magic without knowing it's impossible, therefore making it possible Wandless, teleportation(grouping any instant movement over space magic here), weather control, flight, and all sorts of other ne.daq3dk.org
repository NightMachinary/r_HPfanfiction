I only ask that the story has reached at least fourth year, or AU equivelant. Don't want to get my hopes up on a 200k+ story that hasn't even made it past first year.

Thanks,\\

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

** I haven't been able to find it again but I remember reading a fic where the magicical world has m-mail, and its been proven that it is impossible to send a spell through m-mail. Of course Harry doesn't know its impossible, so as a project he decides to try it and succeeds.

The teachers decide to not teach him any of magical theory that states that some result is impossible and he proceeds to violate most of the known magical laws.

Very much an overpowered Harry, but it was an amusing story.

The thing I didn't want to get into here was political debate, especially SUCH a hot topic... Do you want to get into gun control too? abortion? gay rights? globalism vs nationalism? Or do you want to discuss which one sect of christianity is the right one with everyone else on this planet being sinners going to hell? You are the one that went into politics and such here.
