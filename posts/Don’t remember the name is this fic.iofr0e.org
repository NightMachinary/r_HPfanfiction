:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I remember that in this fanfic, Sirius comes back from the veil. I want to say that Harry was abused by the Dursley's as well but I'm not for sure. The main scene I remember is Hermione, Ginny, Ron, and the Twins (I think) all start crying because Sirius came back. Sirius looks to Harry like “what do I do?” And then Harry starts crying too and everyone in surprised because they're not used to him crying. Does anyone know what scene this is from? I know it's not Broken Dreams (I just reread it thinking it was lol) Any help is greatly appreciated 🙂
