Having grown up in a Puritan colony and having survived the horrors of the Salem Witch Trials, Agatha is remarkably sensitive to things she considers threats to the magical community. She also has a certain empathy with magical children, having been one herself. Therefore, when she sees (or perhaps even "Sees", in the divination sense) the Dursleys mistreating a wizard boy, her intervention is swift and leaves the Dursleys in no doubt about what happens when you piss off an uber old witch with more power than patience.

Even if you didn't go with the usual Dumbledore bashing some people would, she'd still really lay into Dumbledore for leaving him in such a home. :)
