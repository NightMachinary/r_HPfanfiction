I have certain tropes I love like Veela fics (guilty pleasure of mine) Time Travel Fics, Neville is Boy-Who-Lived, Harry travels to another world, Harry was born a girl, Harry has a brother/sister/twin, Harry is sorted into Slytherin or another House other then Gryffindor, ect extra.

Are there any stories that take these tropes and others and twists them around? Breathing new life into them? Maybe some twists and turns that aren't so obvious as well?

Just want something new and interesting into these tropes that isn't really done in most of these stories/tropes.

Any rating is fine. If a multi-chapter would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione just because I can't stand those pairings, but if it's written well enough and believably enough I'll allow it.

Would rather not have any character bashing, unless they do something different with it because I tend to hate character bashing.


** For time travel fics there's Wastelands of Time Linkffn(4068153)

Linkffn(Canis Major by amidtheflowers)

For Fem Harry definitely Linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) this has time travel as well.

Harry sorted in another house Linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff by BajaB)

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  Curses. Dark curses, rather, weren't very fun at all, and certainly not when Hermione keeps waking up in a different decade because of one. At least the company wasn't half bad. Oneshot.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
