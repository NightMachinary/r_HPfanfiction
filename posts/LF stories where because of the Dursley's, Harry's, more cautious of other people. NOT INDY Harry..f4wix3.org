I'm not looking for overpowered or super intelligent Harry, I normally stay away from those on principle. I'm just looking for a Harry that is more cautious or unsure around people, maybe until they prove themselves to him.

I'm not looking for bashing either, if it's characters disliking or hating each other in a way that makes sense that's fine, but a author going out of their way to bash a character is usually a no go.

No political kids, adults is fine, kids no.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be on ANY Site

Harry doesn't have to be the main character but can be.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if well written it can be unfinished.

A Very Slytherin Harry by geoffaree is one of my favorites! He's a lot quieter/more cautious/traumatized by the Dursleys and it affects his choices and friendships

  Slytherin Trio. Deaf Harry. No ridiculous modification of beloved character behavior to turn them into evil monsters. Because fuck that shit.Ron is a Slytherin and he is perfect. Because for some reason Slytherin Harry fics tend to demonise Ron and I am not about that shit.
