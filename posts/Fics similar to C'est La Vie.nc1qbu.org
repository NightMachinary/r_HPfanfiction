Title says it all.

Just finished the fic in a single afternoon and cannot recommend it enough.

We stan Fanon Luna.

Edit: Since I've made the error in assuming that everyone has read this fic /(Which you really should)/ C'est La Vie is basically Harry who got/traveled to an AU where Harry isn't the BWL and its Neville, and the old Harry (now named Hadrian to keep consistency) makes friends with everyone and breaks down social norms and its cute.

Yeah I'm basically looking for similar fics to whats above.


** This damn fic left me feeling so empty because idk what other fic could fill the hole that was left by it. I have re read it at least 10 times (probably even more tbh) at this point.

Sadly don't rlly know any other fic like that, the only one I can think of are probably like linkao3(princeps) by lomonaaeren. Still trying to find more fic like this tho!

  Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.

Uff I've read that at least ten times and I just cannot- It was on ff.net first and then Cywcross deleted it off there and I was horrified because even if it hadn't been complete, at least I could read it (I didn't use a03 at that point for some stupid reason haha). Now, well... Imma follow this post because yes please.

  Getting drunk is not as fun as Harry thought it would be.But then again, a lot of the adult things he thought would be fun...just aren't.Maybe it's because he's been through literal hell, but most days he prefers teaching the first to fourth years defense classes. Until McGonagall can find another teacher, she swears, but he's not so sure she's trying that hard. He keeps finding books and an assortment of teaching materials, and a paper that he's pretty sure had been a test for Newts Defense.

  Magic is an eco-system, and the magical world has been culling magical people and creatures for generations. It has finally gone too far - and the collective consequences are finally being felt. When magic starts disappearing, crumbling quietly in post-war Britain, it causes a cascade effect across the wizarding world. Not a single magical child has been born in almost a decade.Twenty-three-year-old Harry Potter discovers this when the wards of Diagon Alley literally come crashing down on top of him. So ends the life of the Boy-Who-Lived. Yet again, he returns to the station between life and death.With a new chance in a new world, Harry - now eleven-year-old Harry Fleamont - is given a chance to figure out how to save his dying world. In a new world that seems much more perfect in every sense of the word, Harry is faced with a growing threat from a much more dangerous Voldemort, and the reality that jumping universes just makes vulnerable and poor wizards who just want to eat a regular meal and afford to buy a pair of Merlin-damned socks.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

*** You were probably asking the op, but I couldn't resist telling you about it

The fic is basically a dimension travel that's also a bit of time travel? Because technically post war Harry goes to another dimension where he's in his 4th year and the fic just basically follow along his adventures with the other people there on trying to overcome a lot of different things

And this is not like official or anything but the fic does have this trope that I like where everybody just kinda adores/respect/ loves Harry (platonic tho, I don't think there's gonna be any romance). It also has charismatic and confident Harry

***** For me, definitely. Tho I did sneak a peek a few chapter ahead to raise my motivation at first

The first 2 chapter are pretty much introduction to both the Harry of that world (cause as u can see, it's def not the canon universe) and the bwl Neville world. And then ch 3 we definitely started getting more familiar with the character there and especially Orion backstory.

But at the end, it just kinda comes down to what you would like. It's def not action packed and it's also pretty close to canon, especially because the author was intending for the story to be until 7th year and start diverging from canon either at 7 or 6 year, so it's def not there yet. So the 4th year is pretty much canon retelling, with some different stuff added in and more character and relationship building. But I am a sucker for platonic relationships and this fic just ticks all of my boxes.
