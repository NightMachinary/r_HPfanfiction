As someone who hasn't yet had to deal with the pain of losing a parent (yet alone at such a young age), I'm not going to claim that Harry's desire to stay away from his family is unrealistic... but it's awfully demoralizing.

Are there any stories out there where he actually tries to enjoy his renewed familial ties?

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** I'm not entirely sure if you could count it, but A Black Commedy is a very, very good humor fic where Harry is flung across dimensions. He sort of tries to reconnect with his family, and all scenes with all the potters are amusing... Linkffn(3401052)

  Harry won the war. It's a couple months afterwards, and unexpectedly, he's quite literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago and the Potter family's still fighting a war with a Dark Lord whose ruling over the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry just really doesn't want in.

**** Nice, leme know how you like it. It's one of my very favorite fics, I felt the writing to be some of the most like Rowling's of all the fics I've read.

***** I loved the writing, up until the reveal. It took me a moment to not stop, but thankfully I kept on because it turned out okay in the end. I have to agree, the writing was very Rowling-like. I'll likely read it again one day.

****** Yeah man, I think that too. The reveal kinda makes it less relevant to this question, but the very end in particular, I did not like. I've seen similar endings in fics, but I find them to be unnecessary to say the least.

Still, it's hardly enough to keep it out of my list of favorite fics or to keep me from suggesting it.
