:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The main part I remember of this fic is that Harry was kidnapped by Lucius. When he got away he couldn't/wouldn't talk until a dementor attack at the burrow. I want to say he is kissed by a dementor but his patronus saves him. After he wakes up from that he starts talking again. Does anyone know this fic? Thank you :)
