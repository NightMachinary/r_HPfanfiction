Are there any fics where 1) Harry either goes to a different dimension or 2) has copies of himself from different dimensions come to his dimension. I am looking for a story with multiple different Harrys coming together to fight something really powerful. Might not exist, but I thought I would throw it out there. Thanks.


** Not all of this fits your requirements perfectly, unfortunately - I can't think of anything at the moment that does.

"Dimension Hopping for Beginners", linkffn(2829366), has a version of Harry that goes to a bunch of dimensions and helps other Harrys there. The things fought might not be particularly powerful, though.

"On A Pale Horse", linkffn(10685852), has a MOD!Harry being summoned to a normal Harry's dimension.

"Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly", linkffn(11913447), has Harry going back as Lockhart and helping the younger Harry do/fight stuff.

"The Many Harry Potters of Little Hangleton", linkffn(10339852), is a series of shorts on multiple different versions of Harry.

The Lone Traveller stuff by dunelos, e.g. linkffn(12184104) "Lone Traveller: Professor of Defense" has him travelling to different dimensions, but I don't know if there's one that has him helping himself in those dimensions, because I haven't read most of them.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** Kurinoone has a trilogy of fics with the last part being her AU Harry spending a year swapped/interacting with Canon Harry.

Links will include the first part, and the third part that fills your request. For what it's worth I really recommend the trilogy.)
