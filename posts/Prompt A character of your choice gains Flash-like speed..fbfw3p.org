Anyone. You pick. But whoever it is gets hit by lightning-charged chemicals(or potions), and gains speed equal to that of The Flash.

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.
