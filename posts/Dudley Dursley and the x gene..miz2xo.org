Dudley Dursley develops mutant powers when he turns 18 and is invited to join Xavier's School for gifted youngsters. The nature of his powers and the effect this will have on his family is up you. (Also have there been any stories like this? I've seen ones where he develops magical powers or his children do, but never this. Would love to read it)


** Harry tapped his wand against the table. "So, you have powers too."

Dudley shrugged. "Yep."

"And you go to a special school to learn how to use your powers."

"Yep."

"Any moving staircases?"

"No."

"Monsters in the sewers or on the grounds?"

"Yeah, but they turned out to be unlucky mutants with communications problems."

"Dark Lords out to kill you?"

"No, just some speciesists who want to recruit us so we can wage war on the humans. They're normally okay with us saying no though."

"... Right. Any, uh, fighting against bad guys, solving deadly mysteries and some such?"

"No, the teachers handle that stuff."

"The teachers?"

"Yeah. They moonlight as superheroes."

"Huh... Any evil defence teachers?"

"... Before my time I think."

"Cool. What about classes?"

"Oh, best in the world. Our curriculum is literally the best and the support we get is superhuman. I even got a special diet program for free as part of my scholarship."

"... Fucking Hell Dudley. Do they take prophecised saviours who've dealt with their Dark Lord or is it just mutants?"

"I'll ask Professor X next time I see him."

"Please do. I want to finish my education before I join the Aurors."

**** Thank you kind stranger!

And for the Gold, you get a bonus:

"Dudley!" Harry panted as he ran away from the still-melting mech chasing him. "You fucking liar!"

"Now Harry, technically I didn't lie-"

"Bullshit!"

"You just didn't ask!" Dudley retorted as he shifted out of the way of the Sentinel's laser beams.

"What, 'do you have problems with giant robots every now and then Dudley-pookims?' was a thing I was supposed to ask about you bastard? You just wait until I tell Petunia about this!"

"Wait, Harry-"

"Don't you Harry me!" Harry shouted as he blew a Sentinel out of the sky. "I caught endless amounts of trouble with your mom once your girlfriend spilled the beans about my time in the Wizarding World, you think I'm letting you off the hook for this?"

"I'll get you on the Blackbird VTOL if you don't talk about it!" Dudley exclaimed as he jumped over a fallen wall and drop-kicked a black-clad going on the face.

"We're evacuating on that thing, remember? What else you got?" He asked as he swept his wand across his chest, banishing the troops waiting to ambush them into the lake.

"Ummm-wait, how about I get Ginny enrolled?" Dudley said brightly.

"Dudley, what part of 'letting my traumatised war veteran fiancee live in close proximity to the X-Men' sounds like a good idea to that mush you call a brain?"

"Well, what part doesn't?" Dudley retorted, kicking a soggy soldier in the gonads as he ran past.

The two ran into the Mansion in an awkward silence as explosions and gunfire rattled around them. "Damnit Dudley." Harry groaned as the alohomara overrode the lockdown and let them into the basement area before sealing itself shut.

"We got a deal?" Dudley asked as the two descended the emergency staircase, the occasional government goon floating past in a panic.

"...Fine."

"Awesome!"

"But I'm still telling her how you sneaking off to get Twinkies set off Magneto though. See how you like sleeping in the cupboard this time."

"I thought he was a cosplayer! You know me and wedgies Harry!"

"And if you let me pluck out that memory for general distribution, I will expand the cupboard when you end up in there. Deal?"

"... Yeah sure, you rotter."

"Brilliant." Harry said before knocking on the door to the launchpad. "Hey, spandex people from the planet tasteless! Let us in already, we've got terrorists to catch and coverups to foil!"

"Oh god, it's the cousins." Logan muttered loudly enough for the two to hear. "Scott, the crazies are here! It's your turn to deal with them!"

"Fuck you it isn't!"

****** I don't, but it can be... Having a bunch of trigger-happy wizards acting as the X Men's unofficial B team sounds like the kind of fun post-Hogwarts docs rarely get to explore.

"Look Harry, a Merman!"

"That's a Grindylow Dudders. Means we're way off course."

"What, really? How can you tell?"

"Mermaids are uglier."

"Don't say that in front of Aquaman."

"Already did."

"Is that why we've had a school of sharks following us around since passing the Bahamas?"

"... Maybe..."
