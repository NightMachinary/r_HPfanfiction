** Erm... [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20004682][I just wrote a fic regarding Draco being sorted into Gryffindor]], but he's the first one in his family line to do so. Not exactly your prompt, but kinda?

*** Eh, not every well connected asshole is a bigot. McLaggen is probably a less popular, more abrasive version of James Potter. I'd love to see more McLaggen in fan fiction.

**** That's true.

Vlad-the-inhaler has some fics.

I don't particularly like McLaggen. He's abrasive and rude. But I agree he can't be classified as a bigot. Still, he's got the general personality type of Malfoy. He's actually got my sympathy for getting confunded out of the keeper spot by Hermione.

Here's some more McLaggen fics.
