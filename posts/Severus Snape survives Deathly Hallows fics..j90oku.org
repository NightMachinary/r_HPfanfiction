Snape centric fictions.

Written on any platform.

Language must be English.

Any genre, except romance, please.

Any rating.

No Severus/Harry, Hermione/Severus or even Severus/OC.

Fics where Snape survives the events of Deathly Hallows. He tries to make a life for himself.

Fanfic like Birds of A Feather (Severus bonds with Fawkes and sails across the world on Knight Boat.)

#+begin_quote
  Severus was raised Roman Catholic by his mother. As he laid dying in the Shrieking Shack, he portkeys to Father Patrick McKinney's for his Last Rites. Can Patrick keep his friend alive? Can Severus claim Sanctuary if he does survive? Will the British Ministry of Magic accept the claim?
