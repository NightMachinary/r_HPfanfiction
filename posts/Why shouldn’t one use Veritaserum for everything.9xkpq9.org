I really don't feel comfortable with the idea that a court case could just be determined by a truth serum. Truth is very circumstantial, and that's not even including the mental state of the suspect being less than ideal in some cases, annulling the credibility of their account of events.

Scenario that could present a problem, for example; Man commits homicide during complicated circumstances. The murderer however convinces another person that it was their fault, and they believe it. This person feels remorse and turns himself in. They apply the serum and case closed. - problematic.

Additionally, in some fics, the solution is used as a “duh, why don't you just use this and get it over with?” Like, it's just too easy, isn't it? It's too convenient. I get that it's a thing, and that it makes sense, but I want to hear some objections to this.

So my question/request is; why should veritaserum NOT be allowed at all times to solve every crime or problem? Wouldn't it have serious social implications - mental and behavioral ones?

I want to brainstorm this, as I'm unhappy with allowing a plot hole like “why didn't they just use veritaserum” to stand in the way of the plot.

Edit: Wouldn't demanding the use of pensieve present a similar issue?

****** TL/DR YMMV on your perspective of the Wizarding World. Below is mine, and why I feel it is a useful writing tool.

Fair enough, and quite a bit of that comes down to taste in writing, and what you define as reasonable. Do you mean that you want it to be internally consistent? If so, I'd hesitate to apply that to the world as JKR described it. Do you mean applies to modern sensibilities? If so, I don't think that the world as JKR shows it to be, fits that either.

I personally tend to look at it socially as something similar to the "Old South", where the racism was expected, but only the worst actually felt that it was worth fighting for. That said, "everyone" probably knew or was related to someone who was an extremist.

Your mileage may vary, but this is fairly consistent with the world as JKR shows it, where open racism seems to be expect in some social circles. Look at the Weasley's. On the first train ride, Ron mentions that he has a relative that's a muggle but then says something along the lines of "but we don't talk about him much." Even with the Weasleys, the bastion of muggle lovers, there's that underlying, expected racism.

This is incredibly useful as an author because it gives multiple levels of conflict. Social conflict is obvious (and gives a good moral high ground to the reader), but if you want to play with political conflict, there's a ripe field to play with. One of my favorite ways I've seen this leveraged is when it becomes personal, and a victory for the good guys hurts someone you know, because they were on the other side. JKR hinted a bit a this with the Bellatrix/Andromeda relationship, but that was mostly overshadowed by Harry realizing that this really was a civil war.

Edit: grammar, and added the TL/DR

One of my favorite authors I'm currently following that's doing this is Doghead Thirteen/Cal over on the Caer_Azkaban Yahoo Group, with his "The Scourge from the North". In one scene, Pansy Parkinson, who has been forced into a betrothal with Harry, hears that Hermoine has been marked to be kidnapped. She passes a note on to the Auror's as a way to ingratiate herself to Harry. In a later scene, she's talking with her dorm mates, and find that one of their brothers was arrested in the sting operation that saved Hermione.

If you start there though, why stop there? Why wouldn't all the baddies use "Avada Kedavra" in every single fight? It is instant death with no counter.

At some point Rowling stated that she regrets introducing the killing curse because now she had to think up reasons why the Death Eaters wouldn't use it all the time, a good example of this is in the fight over the prophecy in the ministry when they wanted to retrieve it and were anxious about destroying it.

I think it would be the same case with Veritaserum, just that Rowling hasn't given it as much thought. It's a device to allow for easy interrogations and to pose a threat to the extra loyal protagonists who would never snitch on their homies.

My own headcanon is that it requires pure, unalloyed intent to kill, which very few people can summon up even in a fight for their lives. Armies spend a lot of time and money trying to train that reluctance out of their recruits with a success rate considerably below 100%. You're in a fight, are you going to cast a spell that might fizzle because your intent isn't purely lethal or an explosion curse that you know is going to work and will do damage even if you miss?

***** He says it takes power when he's talking about the Killing Curse, Bellatrix Lestrange says you have to /mean/ the Cruciatus.

When Barty says 'power' though I think you have to hear it in the voice of a homicidal nutter: the difference between /him/ and the collection of cardboard cut-outs in front of him is that he isn't weakened by mere humanity, he either is one of those born without human reluctance to kill or he's strengthened - read 'desensetised' - himself against that particular aversion. He's a Dark Wizard, to him the inability to kill is a weakness and therefore lack of power.

I'm influenced here by my view of HPVerse magical power as being a multidimensional thing; being unable to get a Killing Curse off but able to pump out a massive Patronus is only inconsistent if you assume they're both running off the same RPG-style 'stat' (take the standard scoffing about magical cores as read here) when in fact they're coming from different parts of the wizard (and a much more mentally well-adjusted wizard than one who's able to kill at the drop of a hat).

****** I really like that way of looking at it. Something that stuck with me from the HPMOR fic is the killing curse required wanting a person dead, which usually came about through hatred. The "next level" Killing Curse (which I didn't really like but whatever) required complete indifference, and that I did like. Tying magic ability to not only current state of mind or things you can achieve with practice or meditation, but also to the entire emotional/moral /person/. There are very few people that can have that kind of indifference all the time, but maybe enough emotional exhaustion/trauma could drive an otherwise good person to the mental state required for it.

I'm a sucker for things that let you explore character, and a magic system that makes that emotional state tangible is just really cool.

I'm not going to go so far as to say JKR /wrote/ it that way, but it certainly seems to me that she didn't write anything /inconsistent/ with it, and it does fit with the kind of thing you run into if you look in to the history of magic as it has been believed in throughout the ages, when it hasn't been purely about summoning spirits and what-have-you and ordering them to do your bidding.

I want to believe that in battles of a magnitude of a world war, there would be hundreds if not thousands fighting. Spells that cause mass destruction seem more reliable.

**** That ascribes more passion to the spell then I consider appropriate. It runs counter to the way we see it used, it's effects on the human body and those who wield it.

The Killing Curse makes the most sense as a spell of uncommon callousness. You couple a total disregard for human life with murderous selfishness.

In this paradigm bodies are left perfectly intact because to cast the killing curse, you can't care about your target or take more then a momentary satisfaction at actual act of killing.

Most people can't really get this zen about murder which leaves practical reasons for the spell to be rare and the wielders appropriately reviled. (Requiring a specific and unnatural kind of intent.)

****** I'd argue that, in canon at least, there doesn't seem to be any adverse effects to the souls of the victims, as we see James, Lily, and Dumbledore all seemingly well in the afterlife in DH. Also, I don't recall the Killing Curse actually ripping out the victim's soul in canon, I'm pretty sure that's fanon. Otherwise I'd imagine they'd end up like victims of the Dementor's Kiss, not dead. Though since it did kill Voldenort's Horcrux there's some logic to it, and JKR isn't the best at continuity.

Edit: Also, Sirius mentions death being painless, but he did die via going through the Veil. James and Lily probably wouldn't have tried to scare Harry but they never mentioned the KC being painful. And Harry didn't feel pain when he got hit by it. Could be because he was protected from actually dying, though.

**** This is a good point. Until after WW2 when new training technics were developed to help rewrite the brains of soldiers to make killing easier, armies typically only saw about a 10% rate of infantry actually shooting each other. Troops in armor, artillery, aircraft, and automatic weapons where more likely. The more removed an individual was from the front line, or the more shared responsibility there was for killing the more likely the soldier was to commit the act.

This is on both sides of battle lines throughout history. Since then much work has been done to overcome this reluctence.

So in Magical Britian I can definitely see it being a case of casting the AK being extremely difficult for most people to muster. Any spell that has the potential for lethality really. For this reason I can understand the Trio's reluctance to use harmful spells, they aren't socio or psyco -paths.

For people interested in this the book On Killing by Dave Grossman makes for an interesting read.

It's absolutely cartoonish to think that. Yes, they're bad people, many of them enjoy hurting others, but it wouldn't fit anywhere but a child's book to have them all be so dominated by that that they wouldn't use the killing curse when it was the best option.

Even in canon, when the Death Eaters are allowed by Rowling to use the killing curse because the plot doesn't demand more varied and exciting magic, the Death Eaters use it. Bellatrix, arguably the second most sadistically crazy of the Death Eaters behind Voldemort, even uses it to kill Sirius when she knows she doesn't have the ability or the time to to torture him.

Many of them would probably try to give a more horrible death to the people they're killing when they have the option, such as when they've captured someone, but in realistic scenario almost all of them are going to use whatever will work best when they're on an important mission and a specific outcome is needed. Raiding a muggle village, sure, they'll do what they like. Trying to get the prophecy which will help Voldemort's war effort, the killing curse is going to come out if they're capable of using it.

** The right to remain silent so as to avoid self-incrimination is part of law in the UK. I think the US too. I'm not a solicitor/barrister and have never studied the reasoning behind this but I assume it exists for good reason. From what we have seen of veritaserum, especially in fanon is that it doesn't just make what you say the truth but it makes you say it. You don't have the option to say nothing.

Other more pragmatic reasons not to use it range from, cost of the potion, potential unreliability. If you rely on the potion too much, does it damage other areas of the investigation? How many people are licensed to make the potion in the country? Do people know in advance which brewer will be used for which trial? Where is the potion kept? If the potion is as good as it seems then is it trusted too much by everyone?

The wizarding world has shown at times that its not overly ethical but bribery and other offences are also rampant, at least under Fudge. I suspect had Crouch been minister instead there would have been a lot less donations by Malfoy. Fudge would never have supported a potion that could make him reveal all the questionable things he did. Self-preservation is a real thing. While we don't know exactly how the legal system of the Wizarding world works, I imagine Fudge has some input on the laws that get suggested and passed.

** I am of the opinion that veritaserum is a terrible, over powered plot device that causes more problems in canon than it solves. I learnt a sharp lesson by ommiting it in one of my fics only to have every Tom, Dick and Harry raging about it in reviews. It really wound me up because there are lots of times in canon it could have been used to speed things along too, but it's more or less forgotten about after GOF.

The most obvious comparison is a lie detector test. If my viewing of trash tv means anything, these are sometimes used in the US, but would never be considered as reliable evidence in the UK. It's literally only used on the Jeremy Kyle show. If you take it like that, even if veritaserum is twice as accurate as a lie detector test, if there's any chance it could be wrong you are still faced with reasonable doubt so you're back at square one. I would even say it could muddy the waters.

In addition, in terms of a legal setting I suppose you could argue that people have bodily autonomy and you can't forcibly drug them. I think if someone was well prepared and new it was coming they could probably fight it off or find ways around it too.

You could also suggest that the option is difficult or slow to create - though I would expect if it was so useful the ministry would have a good stock.

It looks like less of a problem if you've passed Law of Evidence at any half-way decent law school. Eyewitness testimony and confession evidence are /massively/ problematic even if you can guarantee the honesty of the witness, and questioning so as to elicit relevant, probative and decisive evidence from even the most cooperative witness is a fine art and not one easily taught nor capable of being learnt by everyone.

(I have a little more difficulty believing that the wizarding world, with its frankly banana-republic standards of criminal justice, has actually reasoned through the policy and forensic problems with drug-induced guaranteed honesty to determine that it's not worth the expense because it would produce the mother of all CSI Effects in tribunals of fact without improving the quality of evidence all that much.)

From a forensic point of view, the killer app would be pensieves, if there was some way of easily detecting fabrication in memories (which we know is possible, Slughorn does it, although Dumbledore says it's sloppily done so it may be possible to do it undetectably). Examination-in-chief by playing the witness's memories where the court can watch them would he a /huge/ time-saver, leaving cross-examination to attack the witness's credibility, competence and any failures to corroborate (because two memories of the same event will be at least subtly different) before putting the defence case as to /interpretation/ of what was seen to the witness.

***** Well, even getting a confession would require a long and involved session with carefully-constructed questioning. Interrogation is a skill you have to learn, even if you can trust the subject's honesty a little more because there's a chance the potion is working.

They get a confession out of Barty because he's absolutely in the right frame of mind to brag about what he's done: if he'd been resisting he could have held out for hours and hours with honest, truthful and utterly misleading answers, answers couched in metaphor, answers phrased to sound like he's managing to lie under the influence. The answer to the Veritaserum problem is that you have to get unreasonably lucky to get useful intelligence with the first dose and you still can't entirely trust it.

Edit to add: On further reflection, Barty being madder than a hatfull of arseholes (not legally insane, he knew /exactly/ what he was doing) almost certainly helped this along. Rational people don't boast about this sort of thing, even if they think what they did was necessary and right, they at least know it's /illegal/ and has /consequences/.

(Me, I'd be more inclined to use Gregory's Unctious Unction as my interrogation drug of choice, with Veritaserum purely as a backup if there weren't any unfortunate potion interactions. People will unburden themselves hugely to a trusted friend, after all, and building rapport with the subject is often cited as /the/ key skill in successful interrogation. Plus, you can obliviate your subject and interrogate him again several times: without memory of previous evasions even the most intractable subject is going to jigsaw his way around the truth over repeated questioning.)

** I can imagine a few reasons both for technical, and practical reasons. You've pretty much hit the nail on its head in your post already:

Veritaserum only lets its drinker tell the truth as they know it. Under these circumstances the questions need to be precise:

Let's imagine Sirius right after the entire Pettigrew affair happened. He gets truth serum and his question is: ‘Are you responsible for the deaths of the Potters'

This is a yes from him because he considers himself guilty and he wakes up in jail with no recourse.

Technical issues aside, there are many ethical concerns in this sort of issue, and lawmakers would probably be wary of widely using it. The ministry decides whether veritaserum should be used and in canon we rarely see them use it. Furthermore with curses like the imperius, obliviation charms and confundus the truth is just not enough because it's subjective to the potion's consumer.

Now as a writer you can also introduce a bunch of made up reasons. Maybe it can be subverted, maybe the user keeps his ability to make phrase his response as long as the question allows wiggle room:

Did you recently kill a muggle?

No I didn't. (‘But I did kill 10 muggles 10 days ago' remains unspoken because to the serum user 10 days aren't recent)

Essentially, veritaserum is usefull but not in every case and whoever asks the questions must be trained to do so in the most efficient and direct way possible. So combined with the potion's difficulty to create, cost, and lack of reliability alongside the peoples' wariness to use it, Veritaserum isn't a wildly used potion.

** I've had lots of fun coming up with suitable sounding nerfs to OP stuff before putting it into my fanfic notes. For Veritaserum some ideas I had that I haven't seen mentioned here yet are that it can be toxic with repeated use or when too much is used. This would also make Umbridge's use of it on children /even more/ reprehensible than it already is.

Another thing that bothers me is the quantity analogue to power creep. Items get introduced as rare and powerful, then slowly become more common as the fic goes on. Veritaserum is meant to be incredibly difficult to brew, so I see the stocks of it at any one time being very low. I see Snape as being one of the top 3 potioneers in the country, and it takes him a long time to brew a relatively small amount of the stuff.

(Before anyone talks about mass production, I've nerfed that too. I see potions as a specialised form of ritual, essentially. Difficult potions need a certain state of mind, and a certain ritualistic value of meaning to the ingredients. The difficulty of the potion would increase with the amount being brewed, making potions such as Veritaserum impossible to produce in large quantities.)

I weirdly get more fun from nerfing seemingly OP canon powers than using them in loophole-exploiting power grabs.

​

*EDIT* Just saw your addendum about Pensieves. My headcanon is that the Hogwarts one is OP, but that in general they are not. The Headmaster's one clearly has some kind of time magic or divination magic linked to the memory magic. I think standard pensieves only deal with the memory. That means that a viewer gets a motion-sickness inducing perspective which is only as good as the memory of the person who gave it. This would also explain why Slughorn thought he could just edit the memory and pass it off - maybe such shenanigans would not have been as obvious in a standard pensieve.

** My favorite explanation of why Veritaserum isn't used for everything was in the fic Benefits of Old Laws, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/17/Benefits-of-old-laws][chapter 17]].

In that fic, asking someone under veritaserum any questions that were too ambiguous/complex might damage the person's mind and body. Their mind would struggle to answer "honestly" but an honest answer would be too lengthy and in some cases contradictory, thus they get caught in a loop of compulsion with the potion punishing them for not answering but them being unable to answer. For this reason, veritaserum use is restricted to trails with a rigid format in which:

- The person dosed with the potion must agree to the questions to be asked before hand, thus reducing the risk of complex/contradictory question that might damage their mind

- Only a designated person is allowed to ask questions while the veritaserum is in effect, thus reducing the risk that the person under the potion would be abused by harmful questions

- A medical professional is standing by ready to administer the antidote immediately if the person under the potion appears to be mentally struggling. This safeguards the answerer's health.

#+begin_quote
  Before the healer could manage to administer the antidote, another witch, with her high pitched voice, asked a dangerous question.

  "What are your political goals? What is your agenda?" She sounded gleeful. And Marvolo wondered if she was aware that these kinds of questions could easily kill someone, as there was no simple factual answer to these questions. The potion had been designed to get facts out of people, simple, clearly well-defined facts. Asking questions about beliefs, morals, or philosophy got into conflict with the need to answer in short sentences and answer the truth. If the mind was conflicted about what "truth" was, the strain could cause heart attacks or a stroke.

Every bit of magic that can alter your subjective truth can alter the results of veritaserum. So it is only effective in immediate cases, where the suspect had no chance of preparing against it and there is reasonable doubt they are incapable of wandless and potion-less magic like Occlumency.

Furthermore I think that the cases we see were highly irregular. We have Dumbledore use it on Crouch Jr., and maybe he could point to Death Eater related legislature. We also have Umbridge who behaves in extremely irregular ways due to being backed by a delusional and paranoid Minister.

Sure. I don't think it is ethical to force the accused to incriminate themselves. For them the use of Veritaserum should be entirely voluntary and only pre-approved questions should be asked if they agree to Veritaserum questioning.

Witnesses don't have a similar right and they can legally be compelled to take Veritaserum (unless they'd incriminate themselves).

***** My point is that adding veritaserum to the mix would actually make it /worse/, not better. Examining a witness whose mental processes are altered from normal against a time limit is necessarily harder than doing it without the drug in his system. That doesn't simply add to the probability of a cockup, it /multiplies/ it.

And, bluntly, even if you can trust the answers to be a hundred per cent honest - for whatever value thereof the potion imposes, which we only see in canon for a complete looney bragging about what he'd done - the quality of the evidence you get is only as good as the questions you ask. And cases that you can open and shut with "was it you what done it, then?" are rare in the extreme. Witnesses are typically on the stand for two or more three-hour sessions for any case more weighty than traffic court and for serious trials they can be up there being questioned for days at a time. You're either keeping them potioned the whole time /or/ you're questioning them against the clock.

So, using veritaserum in trials adds to the expense - it's supposed to be difficult and rare stuff - puts counsel under extra pressure and thus increases the prospect of mistakes, mentally alters the witness /AND/ there are known counters to it? It's not looking like it's all that helpful, let alone value for money.

That's even assuming that the wizarding courts permit a defendant to give evidence in his own defence at all - /that/ is a development from considerably after the wizarding world seceded. Late 19th century, as I recall.

******* ... you've never actually had to question a witness, have you?

** You can just throw in some world building with it. My take...

Voldemort created a magical virus during the first war (Proof? Literally nothing but how prodigious he was). That virus has affected a lot of people. What was the point? His arrogance to frame muggle-born that they are corrupting magic itself. One of it's (accidental) side effect is that Veritaserum becomes lethal to those affected, even in small doses.

Ministry found out about it but cannot research or treat on it openly without causing mass hysteria. Which is why Veritaserum exists but most cases don't use them on purpose.
