I've seen some people write in fanfics that the Muggle:wizard ratio is something like 1000 Muggles for one wizard, while others say there are one million witches and wizards globally. Considering the first ratio would put the wizarding global population to something around seven million in the 1990s, what is your opinion? I personally think it is between five to six million in the 1990s, closer to the former than the latter. People say that wizarding population is stagnant because of Contraceptive Charms, and I agree with that, but there is still the question of when they were invented. They could have very well have been first used in the Medieval times just like during the nineteenth century, those two scenarios would greatly change the outcomes of this. You also have to take into consideration the wars that wizards were part of following the unknown invention of those Charms.

So, any thoughts? You can headcanon as much as you want, here.


** Considering the numbers of roughly 0.1% of the population then Britain's wizarding population in 1991 would be 57 440 000 /100/10=57 440

Doing this with world population would be 5 375 000

While I did once think that the 0.1% was a legitimate thing, it apparently isn't [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wizarding_world#Behind_the_scenes]], but it is a number that I would say I'd rather work with as it's small enough that you could reasonably manage tho think it'd go unnoticed but still large enough that one could have fun with it instead of counting heads everytime something happened.

If one were to take Rowlings 3K at face value then Wizarding Britain would be at the cusp of a demographical disaster. 1K is apparently students so not too bad yet. But considering the amounts that died throughout the books and it seems like the population would be down 500 people by the end of it. That might not seem like much, but 3000/500 is 1 in 6 dead

** First off it is difficult to estimate because of how inconsistent and horrible JKR is with numbers.

However we are led to believe that Hogwarts is the only magical school in UK. Considering that it has roughly 300-400 students (40 in Harry's year * 7 + round up a bit). Secondly wizards have only a single purely magical village, which is not even a town and a single proper shopping street in London. While I am sure there are magical corners, nooks and crannies all over the place, it is still telling.

11 to 17 year old are about 9% of the total population (in UK), however due to longevity of magicals we can probably halve that. With that in mind - about *10 thousand witches and wizards in UK* does sound realistic. UK muggle population is about 66 million. Hence the ratio is more likely to be 1:6600. Bringing global population (7 billion muggles) to *roughly 1 million witches and wizards globally*.

Add to that various other magical races (goblins, centaurs, hags, house elves, ...) who don't attend Hogwarts. However all these races appear to be a minority themselves.

We don't know if ratios are the same everywhere or if they remain constant over time. Considering entire Europe seems to be served by only three schools (that we know of at least).

** I generally prefer a magical Britain with a population of around 20,000 to 30,000. That's a number that feels like a good middle of the ground compromise, in light of the nature of the economy, government and schooling we see.

If we say Britain's population is 1% of the global population then we're looking at 2 - 3 million wizards globally. That feels quite high - intuitively, if you were to ask me the global wizarding population without having me think of it in relation to Britain, I'd probably say around 750,000 feels about right.

Unfortunately I don't think there's any way to achieve that figure while maintaining a reasonable figure for the British magical population - not unless you say that magic is unequally distributed, with Britain having a much higher concentration of magical people than the global average. Not only is that contrary to word of god, it's also the kind of thing that would require a very good worldbuilding behind it, and I think any worldbuilding along those lines (e.g. leylines) would go against the nature and tone of the worldbuilding we see in canon.

In any event, I see the wizarding population as largely fixed and *not* a ratio of the Muggle population. I imagine there's approximately the same number of wizards in the world in 1990 than there was in 1590. In the Muggle world, the single greatest driver of population growth has been the delay between the decline of infant mortality and the decline of birth rates. But magical infant mortality has always likely been very low, meaning that wizards probably went through that demographic adjustment long, long ago.

*** Hmm, doesn't the existence of half-bloods and (especially) Muggleborns throw that idea out? While there don't seem to be a stated abundance of them (though purebloods are seemingly the minority, if I correctly recall Ron saying this), it seems like that would cause the population to generally increase beyond 16th century population levels pretty quickly. Only the US, as far as we know, had something like Rappaport's Law, or the UK with out and out government sanctioned repression of Muggleborns.

**** Of the wizards we know of in Harry's year, 3 out of 34 are said to be Muggleborn (excluding Dean Thomas, who is wrongly identified as Muggleborn).

While we don't have anything like a complete list, this is the best information we have, and would suggest Muggleborns are below 10% of the wizarding population.

If the number of Muggleborns was a ratio of the Muggle population, you'd expect that by the 1990s (after massive Muggle population growth), they would have swarmed the wizarding world.

***** It doesn't really matter if it's a specific ratio of the muggle population at all. As long as the wizarding population not a closed system - which it's not - then the population will tend to increase over time, barring the issues I mentioned. It's not just Muggleborns, half-bloods from partnerships with Muggles factor into this. As Ron said, if it weren't for this group, wizards would have died out already.

**** I think that depends on which word-of-god you choose to go with regarding the origin of 'muggleborns'.

At one point, JKR said that the wizarding gene is dominant, which would mean that all 'muggleborns' are in fact by-blows of wizards. If that were the case, then the rate of muggleborn appearance would not follow the rate of muggle population growth.

But at other points JKR has made statements that would only make sense if the magical gene were recessive. So all in all, it seems to be up to personal preference which world-building you choose to build off of.

***** When JKR says "the wizarding gene is dominant", I don't think she's speaking in technical biological terms. She basically means that it is a strongly heritable characteristic and therefore squibs are rare.

***** This is why I prefer to think of magic arising in humans not being reliant on a single gene, but a combination of multiple genes, compounded by epigenetic factors.
