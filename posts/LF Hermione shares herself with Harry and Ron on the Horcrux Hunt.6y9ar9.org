Wow, i honestly didnt know how to write the Title. What i want to know is, if there are Fics with the Trio on the Horcrux Hunt or Alternate Universe or them travel through the Country or leaving/escaping it (because Voldemort Won the War). Harry lost Ginny (not matter how, as far as he isnt available to reach her) and grieves. Hermione and Ron are as close as in the Canon, maybe closer and sleep or comfort each other. At some Point, Hermione asks Ron, that she wants to share herself with Harry. because she is worried about him. Ron can be glad to help his Friend with it or tolerate it. Thats said, Hermione offers herself to Harry. It can be just for one time or permanently. So, the Fic will have serious Story content (Dark, Grief, hurt/comfort), but the Sex would be succint, since its for distraction and comfort. The Fic should have just R/Hr and H/Hr, not a Threesome or slash, although i would be open for that, but my intent would be Hetero ones.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), has something very similar. The Trio got together during the Horcrux Hunt and stayed this way after the War. Ginny wasn't dead though.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.
