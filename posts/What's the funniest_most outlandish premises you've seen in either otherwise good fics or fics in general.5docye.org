For me it would probably be a fic I don't remember the name of, where Neville's animagus form was an oak tree. I enjoyed the story, but it was such a hilariously "what?!" thing.


** It gets ragged on terribly, but in linkffn(methods of rationality) early on during the trip Diagon Alley the scene with Draco, Lucius, and McGonagall I find hilariously absurd. I laughed out loud when I first read it and have gone back just to read that scene.

*** It has some really great scenes. Helga Hufflepuffs Chamber of Hard Work is one that I want to see a fic based around.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** Well, there's “The Worst Muggles Imaginable” where the premise is that [[/spoiler][the Dursleys are satanists (or at least something close) and quite deranged ones at that]].

Then there's “Force Sensitive”, where the premise is that [[/spoiler][Harry gets into his head that he is a Jedi, and later that he is force sensitive, and that people who think it to be magic are misguided and/or Sith]].

** Is the Neville / Oak Tree animagus from linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2529586/1/Broken-Mind-Fractured-Soul]]) or its sequel linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3345078/1/Shadows-Within-the-Light]])? If so, do you have a chapter?

*** It might be? If it is it's from BMFS, I never read the sequel. I think Harry had multiple animagus forms too, which fits with the whole MPD thing. But I don't know where in the fic it happened, sorry.
