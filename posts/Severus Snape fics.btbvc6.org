I'm looking for some Snape romance fics. Preferably not Snape x Lily.


** All of these are Severus/Hermione

linkffn(An Unwritten Future) has time travel.

linkffn(Sin & Vice) The first half is amazing, but I didn't like the second half as much.

linkffn(Chasing the Sun) Lots of action and horcrux destroying

linkffn(Post Tenebras Lux) Post-Hogwarts and my personal favorite.

  Still struggling with the aftermath of the war, Hermione decides to leave everything behind to go find herself. She travels further than she could have ever imagined without going anywhere at all. Along the way, she discovers someone she mistakenly thought she'd known... AU, M.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive.

** I just went through my list of favorites (all Snape-centric of course) and found the romance ones, some of which I haven't read in a while so I can't guarantee they are necessarily all good; also not all are het:

SS/OFC: linkffn(Neighbours by Leliha)

SS/HG, The romance takes a while to set it and it's not a pairing I'm fond of but the fic is wonderful: [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/Lost_and_Found.htm][Lost and Found]]

SS/MM: linkffn(The First Cut is the Deepest by Lillibet426)

SS/OMC, not all romance-focused Snape is married, this is part of a series and I don't think this is the first story in it : linkao3(Outrage by puppy_on_crack), That Dreaded Puppy Story is a oneshot of a funny moment of their relationship

  Sequel to Rage. Fourth year is finally over and Harry can relax. Things are starting to look up, right until they aren't.

** Here are some you may like!

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13272754/1/For-the-Guilty][For the Guilty]] (Snape/OC)

Nagini had failed to take his life in the shack. By some miracle, Severus had survived, only to be faced with another trial, another dark wizard. The problem this time, is not everything is what it appears to be.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12302061/1/Speaking-in-Tongues][Speaking in Tongues]] (Snape/OC)

A trader on the edge of the wizarding world is about to turn Snape's world upside down.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5906606/1/A-Second-Chance-For-Happiness][A Second Chance For Happiness]] (Snape/Ginny --- and it's a shocking pairing, or at least it was for me lol --- but the story is ridiculous good)

Ten years after Voldemort's demise, Severus Snape, thought by all to be dead, lives out his days in solitude. Ginny Potter, meanwhile, juggles a high-profile career, three children and a workaholic husband. What happens to change their lives forever?

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12452050/1/Non-Omnis-Moriar][Non Omnis Moriar]] (Snape/Hermione)

Having survived the Battle of Hogwarts, Severus returns to his position as Potions Master, no more than a shadow of his former self. Hermione is determined to help him, but how can either of them make peace with a past that refuses to let them go?

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13175009/1/Of-Blacks-and-Boarhounds][Of Blacks and Boarhounds]] (Snape/OC - and it's bloody hilarious. Makes me nearly die of laughter often.)

An American muggle from the year 2022 ends up in a pub in England in 1992, and meets Severus Snape. Somehow she knows everything about him, and he is determined to find out why.

  In Worm you might gain phenomenal powers on your worst day. Snape snapped after the werewolf incident and triggered with Path to Victory, the power that tells you the steps necessary to attain any goal. Follow Severus as tackles his troubles, and the Wizarding World's, with the help of a nigh omniscient voice whispering pretty things to him in the back of his mind.
