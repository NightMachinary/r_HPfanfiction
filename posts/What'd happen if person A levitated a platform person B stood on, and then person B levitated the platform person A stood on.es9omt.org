Levitation allows you to apply a force to an object (move it up) without an equal and opposite force being applied to you (breaking Newton's 3rd law). So what would happen if two people tried to levitate each other? Would both hover at the same height? Would both accelerate up due to the forces applied to both? Would it be controllable? If both platforms had bubble charms around them with life support, would they be able to reach the moon? Would moon rocks be useful as a potion ingredient?


** No way to answer this accurately. The question assumes that a Levitation Charm is a Levitation Charm is a Levitation Charm, but that's not really the case. It's documented in canon that Levitation Charms vary WILDLY in length, force and duration, depending not only on the skill and effort of the caster, but also on the weight and mass of the object.

What WOULD happen is that one platform would fly higher than the other, and the other one would fall down sooner. Reaching the Moon would not be possible, since nobody could make a Levitation Charm last for that long or go that high.

** I think the problem here is you are trying to approach conceptual magic from the perspective of science or even hard magic systems. In HP, magic is more fluid in what its capabilities are, or rather limited by the magical ability of the caster.

The answer is yes and no. If one person cast levicorpus, and the hanging person cast levicorpus, both would still be hanging in the air, regardless of the physics of the situation. Depending on the spell(s) cast, magic alters, bends or breaks reality or state to one degree or another. As an example, Rowling herself has stated that Voldemort's flight ability isn't something extraordinary that he invented, merely that he has the talent to actually maintain and cast the Flight Charm on himself that exists on brooms.

Bubble head charms are, as stated, only around the head, so this is somewhat redundant. Besides, whether the charm merely converts the ambient matter to breathable air or creates the air is not actually known. And that is not even getting into the actual problems that are created by the extraordinary temperature fluctuations and de-pressurization the human body wouldn't be able to withstand even in near Earth orbit.

You can rephrase all of this as why can't wizards apparate to the moon, and the answers still more or less come down to the limitations of capabilities. Even Voldemort could only apparate a certain distance and needed to fly over the English Channel.

Yes, no, maybe? Potions appear to be just as much about the ingredients and wizard's magic as it is about the belief/value of particular ingredients. Or more simply, it only works because they believe it will work.

** From what I understand, you can change the height that an object is floating at, and it does not move to stay in the same relative place to you when you move. Lateral levitation is done with locomotor mortis.

*** Not sure what spell you're thinking of, but Locomotor Mortis is the Leg-Locker Curse. Lateral levitation is definitely possible though as Professor Flick "made Neville's toad zoom around the classroom."

**** Ah yes, quite righr. The locomotion spell is just "locomotor [object]"

** In the Battle of Seven Potters Harry levitates the motorbike's sidecar he himself is at the time. So clearly it is possible to levitate yourself or at least something that supports your weight. Which is quite strange considering no one ever uses that immensely useful power again. Wizards could just float in the air and propel themselves with Aguamenti. But in canon magic powers are used only when they fit the plot. The plot comes first, it is not the outcome of the characters' personalities, interests, or sensible deliberation.

In Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (Ch. 107) it is said: "No wizard may levitate themselves, or any object supporting their own weight; it is like trying to lift yourself up by your own bootstraps." I think that is something that should be canon.

*** Harry levitating himself in that situation doesn't make sense because the entire point of Voldemort flying without a broom is that it's supposed to be impossible, yet Harry does the same thing right there. I think he just supplied more magic to the built-in enchantments.
