  It was a loud crack that awoke Petunia and Vernon Dursley in the middle of the night. As soon as she had instinctively opened her eyes and turned around to see what caused such ruckus, an ear-piercing skriek escaped her mouth.

  In front of the conjugal bed stood a tall old man, dressed in the most hideously colored robes she ever had the displeasure to see. Fear crept into her and her husband's minds then, because such clothes and sudden apparition could only mean one thing : the man was one of /them./

  More unnerving was the bright smile on the wizard's face, and the fact that he apparently craddled a baby in his left arm.

  Vernon's fury finaly outscaled his fear, and he clumsily got up from the bed, red-faced and looking to be on the verge of poping a vein. As he opened his mouth to yell at the intruded however, the man switly held a finger in front of Vernon's lips and shushed him, still arboring his god forsaken ravished smile.

  "- Mr and Mrs Dursley, I have come tonight to leave this child in your care, congratulations !" He said as if he were bestowing upon them a great honor, and dropped the baby on their bed.

  It was Petunia who got out first of the striken silence that hit both of them.

  "- What ?" She eloquantly managed to let out, mouth still agape.

  "- Indeed, this is Neville Longbottom, his parent died tonight so you will raise him. It is for the Greater Good ™ you see." He said with a flat tone, as if whatever he was saying was so obvious that it was barely worth explaining it at all.

  The old, and she decided batshit crazy, man started to head toward the bedroom's door, despite having teleported right in from of her he seemed intent to get out of here by foot. In a merrier tone, he added :

  "- And if you send him to orphanage, I shall be very crossed, he must stay here to get a healthy dose of parental neglect. Feed him at least every other day still, I need him functionnal after all !"

  As he was about to exit the room, he suddenly came to a halt and turned around.

  "Oh, how rude of me, I nearly forgot." He said as he was rummaging elbow-deep in a pocket far too small to allow it, before pulling something out and offering it in their direction, palm open.

  "Sherbet Lemon ? Veritaserum free I promise."

Damn it feels weird writing more than a few sentences in english.

A self-aware fic with manipulative Dumbledore must be fun to read tho, there's potential.

** The dursleys place him in an orphanage, because Neville isn't related by blood to Harry's mom, making him a stranger.

Additionally, there is no blood protection, as that was conferred through the blood connection as well, making Dumbledore a massive idiot.

The world falls because you wanted to bash Dumbledore, feeding into the fanon characterisation, making him cruel, heartless and an idiot.

*** I'm sorry, I believe that your description of Fumbleduck IS canon: It's exactly how I saw him from the opening pages of the character's introduction! Rowling can 'hand-wave' dismiss, explain, minimize, and excuse the MOB all she wants, but her character's *actions* spoke much louder than her attempt to force the readers (sheeple) to believe he was a "martyred 'hero'"!

"If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and acts like a duck..." I don't *care* if it MOOS like a cow; it's still a DUCK! Or as Frodo observed, 'He looked fair but felt foul!' Hell, I spent the entire time, while reading the 1st 5 books and skimming the 6th (all I could stomach!), wondering when HE would be revealed as the TRUE 'big bad'!

As far as I'm concerned, Rowling managed to write one of the most evil, manipulative, and conniving characters this 58-year old, voracious biblioholic (former Children & Teen's Literature reviewer for my local Public Library) has *ever* read!

Even when I read the occasional "Good Dumbles" story, I still find myself watching his 'oft-hand' for the knife! ;D

***** This board is called */HPFANFICTION/* *not* 'HPff for those enamored of canon only'. ;D

I was a precocious reader and was regularly *sent* to the local library as early as 4-years old, alone, to get me out of my mother's sight. I was in heaven! Though I was fascinated with science and non-fiction (biographies and "You Are There" books), I fell in love with Eleanor Estes' "The Witch Family" and mythologies translated for children.

I became enthralled with Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke, and Sci-Fi at 7 and was "graduated" to the adult library (with librarian supervision) at age 8 and became a Reviewer for "Children's and Youth's Fiction" at 10. It was also at 10 that I began working through a Youth Employment agency, run by the YMCA, earning my own money. Thus I could afford my 1st subscription to "Analog: Science Fiction, Fact, & Fantasy".

"Anne of Green Gables", the "Little House" books, and Louisa May Alcott became some of my dearest friends. I traveled to "Oz", "Narnia", and into "Alice's" worlds; all before I turned 12! At 12, my English teacher introduced us to "The Worm Ouroboros", Tolkien and McCaffrey, among others.

I've been a life-long, proud biblioholic with my only prejudice being poorly-written and/or blatantly derivative books without attribution... ;D

Therefore, at the age of 43, I felt more than ready to discover what all the hoopla was about over a 1st-time author that I'd never heard of. I finally got my chance in 2005 when my husband's nephew moved in with us and brought his collection of the 1st five HP books.

I was uneasy when this old, obvious Gandalf-like person was walking down the street putting out street lights, but when, during the conversation with McGonagall, he proceeded to dismiss all of her concerns and objections and then left a 15-month old *toddler* on a doorstep, in *November* with naught but a blanket and a letter without even attempting to *ring the fricking doorbell*!!!

#1, Unless one's child is handicapped in some way, a 15-month old is *walking*! My sons walked at 9 & 10-1/2 months, respectively.\\
#2, October & November are COLD in the UK and there's no mention of putting a 'warming charm' on the child, is there!?\\
#3, Dumbledore is flippant and dismissive of McGonagall's objections which made me immediately suspicious of his motives...\\
#4, The story got no better; what with the abusive nature of this little boy's home life and the complete change his character underwent from when he is introduced--smart and a seemingly, slightly cynical about his situation, who reads his books as soon as he got them! But he turns into a lackadaisical, mediocre student who's willing to follow slacker-Ron's lead and decides to just get angry at Snape's (albeit unjustified) snipes instead of attempting to prove him wrong!

I was more than horrified, I was appalled the further and more books I read, to discover that this writer's callous and cavalier attitude towards *child abuse* continued on through ALL FIVE BOOKS!! I'd kept reading thinking "It's got to get better! Someone's GOT to smarten up!!" But no, nobody does a thing!!

Sometime about that time, I read that Rowling stated that she'd been made to */"tone down the abuse"/* by her publishers!

Well, after *skimming* the 6th book that I bought for my nephew as a present, I was done and wanted no more to do with them!

I was more than content to put these books out of my mind and dismiss them as the overly hyped fare (ala Snake Oil) and sold to naive children and a nearly illiterate generation brought up on video games, toy advertising masquerading as 'cartoons', and a subpar literary education. But I accidentally began reading a ff in one of the fandoms that I followed, that suddenly introduced the 'Harry Potter' story, but with a HUGE difference: This writer *cared* and so I began to see that there possibly were writers out there who *hadn't* drank the 'Rowling kool-aid' and wonder of wonders, they wrote a thousand times *better* than Rowling!!

I cautiously began looking through the summaries of other HPffs and found a LOT of stories that diverged from canon and a lot of writers who were just as disgusted by the books as I was! I've been an HPff fanatic ever since! ;D

I'd say that CANON (such bs, the woman wrote an overly hyped, hugely derivative, and poorly conceived FANFICTION that spawned a BILLION dollar industry, how's that for hutzpah!? :p) is what drove 90% of us into HPfanfiction in the 1st place!

I am a Mega HPFF fan, but not because of Rowling; in spite of her!

** As crack, this could be hilarious. The Dursleys aren't hateful as much as deeply confused to begin with. It's not the child of Petunia's estranged and deeply resented sister - it's some random baby! Why?!

Augusta Longbottom is still alive. She sweeps in like the Wrath of God to pick up her only remaining family from this family of Muggles. Baby Dudley loves her hat.

The Potters are still in hiding. Harry grows up to be just like James.
