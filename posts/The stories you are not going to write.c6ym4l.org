Do you have those stories as well? The ones you already mapped in your mind, you know the plot, maybe even some specific scenes and even the end, you even have a plan how to get there.

But you don't think you will ever write them.

Maybe they are too long, or you don't like the genre or don't think you would be able to write it in a satisfying way, maybe your style is too goofy for the story or you don't think you can write the humor the story needs.

​

​

Mine is a story where the first war starts later and Lily started to date Snape, but with the movement taking up steam later and her never really being head over heel in love with him, it just felt fine and save to date her best friend, things start to change when Snape starts to plan their marriage and life together without really asking for her opinion and a meeting with old friends she lost contact with over her dating him and James Potter being hired at her place of work to take over her job once she is married. First, she is afraid that he would ask her out again, but he doesn't. She wants to know why and he tells her that he is no longer interested because she isn't like the girl he knew from school, only looking the same, but without fire and a backbone.

This made her reflect on her life and she starts to realize that she does have less in common with Snape than she thought and less in love than she tried to convince herself, she then is emancipating herself from him and rediscover herself and what she wants. Lily is going to join the resistance and Order again, even knowing that Snape is consociating with the other side, breaking up with him and starting anew on her own when he tries to pressure her back in. The story would end not with James and Lily dating, but them openly flirting and James saying something like she should be careful and that she becomes more and more like a girl he knew from school and had a huge crush on and could one day feel tempted to ask her out. And she answers that maybe when she feels like such a person again she would like to say yes than, but first wants to get to know that girl first herself again.

​

I don't think I will ever write this story, because I don't like to spend so much time with a character like Snape, nevermind the shitstorm I would have to face in the comments.

​

Now, what are your never going to be written stories? And why?


** This is just too big, too many OC/Next Gen characters and I don't think I'd do it justice. It revisits and questions the idea that if everyone had just ignored the Harry vs Voldemort prophecy then would have it still mattered? Can you just walk away or are prophecies self-fulfilling.

So the basic idea is that Harry is 60 years old and head auror. His children are all grown up and married, and starting to have children of their own. Then one day Hugo Weasley, who works as an unspeakable, tells him there's a prophecy about his granddaughter and a unnamed dark lord. Harry and Hugo destroy the prophecy and agree to never speak about it to protect her. Harry refuses to let her childhood be ruined by a prophecy the way his was. But the prophecy and news of a dark lord eats at Harry as there's been increasing reports of dark activity. He wants to stop this dark lord before he even becomes a threat. So Harry runs for Minister of Magic to try to change the wizarding world and becomes more and more extreme in his methods. Essentially becoming a dictator/ dark lord himself. Eventually the granddaughter grows up and is the one to ultimately defeat him (fulfilling the prophecy he was trying to avoid).

** The Triwizard Tournament comes to Hogwarts in the Marauder era. Lily is selected as champion. Her Muggle born status makes the whole thing so politically combustible that Voldemort wants her dead without any prophecy or baby. She doesn't want protection from James or Severus--- she has no use for any posturing from either of them and just wants to win. But then comes the final task...

I wouldn't write it because I struggle to find a voice for Lily and because it would have to be epic-length and I don't want the time commitment.

** I have several ideas that have been (possibly permanently) relegated to the back burner, including a Marauder era fic where Lily and Severus are gender swapped; a Kingsmen-inspired Muggle AU; a fic where Vernon dies of a heart attack, and Petunia returns to Cokeworth and ends up with Snape; and an AU where Hermione is discovered to be Bellatrix's daughter and helps bring down the war from the inside.

I've seen a fic with almost this exact premise, except that rather than returning to Cokeworth to seek him out, she seeks out Snape via Diagon Alley, using Harry to help her locate it and asking Tom to reach out to him.

** A WBWL-ish fic that starts during the Triwizard Tournament, with both Harry (a Slytherin) and his twin sister Daisy (a Gryffindor) getting selected as champions (instead of Cedric for one of them). But the whole thing is Voldemort rigging it so that /both/ twins end up in the graveyard for his resurrection, because absolutely no one is sure which is the actual Twin Who Lived and he wants to be thorough with his resurrection.

I just have nothing actually concrete about it other than this skeleton of a plot, and the fact that Daisy and Harry actively remained close siblings/friends despite the house differences.

** It's an AU where Harry aquires a snowglobe from Dumbledore as a Christmas gift, unaware that it's a magical snowglobe (duh). He Hope's to spent the holidays with the Weasley's, Hermione, Sirius and Lupin but his Hope's are dashed. Dumbledore wants him to stay in the castle for protection. Naturally, hes angry and stomps to his dorm, flops on his bed and wishes he wasnt the boy who lived.

He wakes up and I couldn't decide if I was going to have his parents alive, maybe have a sibling (s) or have him live with the Dursleys but they'd be nice idk. And anyway Neville is the BWL in this dimension , muggleborns are unaware of their magical abilities and half bloods are either living normal lives or, if they resist, are slaves to pure bloods.

Harry and his new group of friends (not OC's) have to find a way to defeat Voldemort and get back to his own timeline

I have no plans of writing it but my friend might if they get the time

** I've done this with roughly every fic I've ever thought of writing. Though I rarely have them properly outlined.

I've had a lot of ideas related to D&D which would include a lot of spells from D&D, and in some places would make use of D&D characters (sort of, not really a crossover.)

The first idea was focused on a magical prodigy who would basically be a more modern HP world version of a character I played once and her family. The point would be to explore magic and it's limits through the eyes of someone who is good at magic and wildly enthusicatic about learning it. The fic would also likely include lots of wand lore. I had planned to have two seperate plots that would intersect in areas, while having the canon plot non existant or happening in the background. I stopped writing this fic because OCs often feel self-indulgent. What's more, I had trouble justifying the presence of the OCs when there are canon characters that would have worked. Even if i don't like Hermione that much she fits the magical prodigy thing quite well, and one of the other OCs would have likely been a professor and McGonagall and Snape can more or less fil her role.

Another fic I don't think I'll ever write is a Fem!Harry fic where Voldemort died in 1981 and Fem!Harry has to deal with fame she doesn't feel she's earned. It would be about her quest to earn fame or else to find her own way in life despite her unwanted fame, a sort of coming of age story. I had planned a mentor character who would be a championship duelist. There are multiple slight variations to this fic I thought up, but in the end I stopped writing all of these variations for the same reason: I'm not that good of a writer, I haven't done many action scenes, but they just aren't something I'm good at. One variation of this fic included a still living Voldemort, but there was another problem, how to make a competent mentor who cares about fem!Harry's well being without making them solve all the problems.

I also had fic where I was planning on having a Harry or Fem!Harry who was sharing a body with the soul of a long-dead ancestor who would guide him/her and had guided other of their direct decendants over the years as needed. I ultimately stopped writing the fic because it reminded me too much of another fic I had read and it just didn't feel natural to write.

The most recent idea I have is for a Harry or Fem!Harry (for whatever reason) has to get a new wand and ends up finding a truely sentient wand. I haven't writen any scenes of this yet.

All in all I have a lot of fics I will probably never write and a lot of it comes down to being overwhelmed by all the things I need to do in order to write a fic, and, my complete lack of confidence in my own writing except when it comes to characterization and to a lesser extent, dialoge.

(Also, I have not properly proofread this post, so there are probably lots of errors, but I'm also being lazy.)

** I'm a bit lazy to type the whole ideas, but I have a few summaries of stuff I'll never write. Most very AU.

1. "No one dares to question the right and power of Lord Voldemort to rule over the world, and if anyone ever had the temptation do it, they did not survive to tell the tale. That was what Harry Potter believed in, but after his parents's death, the idea of killing an immortal man goes from being a distant utopic dream to a life goal."

- I do have some of this planned, but it would take a lot of time to write, and I don't want to comit to it.

2. "Had they ever been brave? Tracey found she couldn't answer the question. It depended on one's concept of bravery. Either way, she would take the taint of cowardice in their lives over death and oblivion any day."

- A Harry/Tracey story in which both of them end up on Voldemort's side. I have a few ideas of where it would go, and knowing myself, this would be a tragedy.

1. (Kinda cheesy with so many biblical references, but I like it. I would probably change this summary if I were to actually go ahead with the idea.) "He was Judas, and he was Cain. And she was Eve, staring at the blood pooling at her feet - killing the snake had been a necessity."

- Which is basically the twin trope, but with Lily killing Harry after he betrays his brother (the real BWL). I may end up actually writing this as a one-shot.

** I don't really like writing, but my current 'fic idea' basket has a few ideas:

​

1. Ron Development: Ron makes a wish on the Goblet of Fire for Harry's fame and finds himself reliving Harry's life

2. Ron Development: Ron gets stuck in a time loop and thus puts himself out there to be a hero and gets trounced)

3. Muggle Umbridge: Unable to get his minion appointed due to politics, Lucius gets a Muggle 'school consultant' appointed, as something all sides can agree on would be helpful. Of course, he just wants to frustrate Dumbledore. The consultant goes to fix a ton of things about Hogwarts, putting in an anti-harrassment system, making the teachers write out Syllabus's, abolishing the collective punishment point system, etc. He would be genuinely horrified by the state of education in the wizarding world, and consider Hogwarts more of a fancy prison than a school.

4. Muggleborn Parents Revolt: The wizarding world is built on wide-area hex's that slowly make muggleborn parents forget about them when they are away, to make the kids being able to detach from their old world easier. Somehow one of the parents figures it out (Vacationing outside of the area of effect when an important message comes in?) and goes on a warpath.

5. Ron uses a dark magic loyalty potion on himself after the 4th year as a way to make it up to Harry, but it is really a potion to bind new wives to the house they are marrying into, and he ends up Genderbent. (This story would, ironically, be mostly about Hermione XD)

1 and 2 I don't really have plotted out, but I have a complete story idea for the last three. However, the last one will almost certainly never be written, because if I was to write something, the other four all sound so much more interesting.

** If you had written this 3 years ago, you'd probably get flamed into oblivion by /both/ Snily and Jily fans for opposite reasons. Nowdays, people aren't nearly as bad in comments. Sounds like an interesting story, even if I wouldn't read it myself.

I have various small ideas that I am unsure what to do with (and which I don't even think are very good ideas), such as a Marauder-era SI prompted by a prompt I saw on this subreddit a while back (most are set in the "canon" era), and a SS re-do where the re-doing part fails and he ends up sharing body and mind with James -- ultimately setting up the canon timeline. In addition to this, I've also had a more complete idea in mind for some time that I'm unlikely to write (because so far I'm still wary of contributing to fanfiction myself, not because of the story itself). It's a universe where someone (in my head it's usually Unspeakable Hermione Granger) does something "unimportant" (plot-unrelated) in the past and inadvertedly messes up the scene of Snape's Worst Memory. Ultimately it prevents Snape from becoming a Death Eater, and thus he is unable to serve as the catalyst to create a Boy Who Lived. As a result, Voldemort ultimately wins the war.

There are 3 different parts to this:

1: The altered past -- developing the consequences as a story starting from Snape's Worst Memory, probably having Severus as protagonist. How does things change now that he was accidentally prevented from destroying his friendship with Lily, while knowing full well what he was about to do in hindsight.

2: Hermione, now back in the future, is met with a very different future from the one she came from. Why? She is unaware of exactly /what/ she did, only that she did /something/ (she is aware of the scene from post-death exoneration in her own future, but not to the point of it being immediately obvious to her what happened). By the time she figures out what happened, she is unable to easily just go back to the Ministry and undo the mistake, and has to involve herself with a resistance group (is the Order still around?) to get things going.

3: Now able to once again travel back to the past to fix her mistake, does she simply undo the damage? Can she? Is she willing to let the consequences of the "original" war stay (dead Marauders, unhappy/dead Severus, tortured Longbottoms, etc). Unfortunately, there's already countless "HG in the past" stories and I don't know how it would realistically be any different.

** I have this fic idea where Harry is illiterate. His homework, when it is turned in, is badly copied sections from the textbook, his letters aren't formed properly and he hides his inability to read from everyone. Hermione doesn't realise because it's so far out of her experience that she just doesn't see it. Ron is blamed as the reason Harry's work is so bad, but he is somewhat aware of Harry's illiteracy and suggests other activities to keep Harry happy. Harry also gets angry and defensive if anyone asks him to read. He only does homework in front of people and just copies the shape of the letters from the book. His illiteracy is due to the Dursley's never reading to him and him being kept from learning at school (whether coz he's too busy thinking about ways to run away or because he hasn't gone to school idk).

My other idea is that Harry is in foster care with a nice family. The family is visited by Hagrid or Dumbledore after the letters are sent to the Durselys by mistake. A particular scene I had in mind was Harry being really upset after a letter from home, one of his foster siblings (around 6 years old) is going to live with their parents again. He explains to his friends about his siblings and how the transient nature of foster care affects his family, who are a good foster family. I dropped this idea after realising how many ocs there would be.

** I've got one or two backburner'd right now while I do nothing with Figure in Gray. One where the Basilisk actually has long term effects on Harry after the Chamber, and another for LOTR if I remember right. I think I also have a plot bunny for an Undead!Harry wandering around my notes somewhere. With Voldemort's fear of death being so great, I could totally see him killing an enemy and then somehow binding them into their corpse so they both experience death and can't pass to the next great adventure. That kind of dick move just has his signature all over it really.

** I started writing a vampire Harry fic, where he was turned after the battle (he left England for awhile and was attacked) usually you develop a bond with your maker, but his maker couldnt fully bond with him because he had already had a part of Tom's soul in him. he doesnt lust for blood (hello Twilight) but lusts for sex. When he returns to England the den of vampires host parties, one of which several Holyhead Harpies go to (inc Ginny Weasley, a girl Harry had liked since his sixth year. Her scent drives him wild and she has always liked him. She wants to help him get away from his maker, who is jealous of Ginny's connection to Harry, for she has felt Harry's power and wants total control of him. Ginny agrees to let his maker turn her too, but intends to kill her before she can turn her. (she also cant be fully turned because she was possessed by Tom) she kills the maker but nearly dies, Harry turns her himself to save her, and they live an endless life together.

** Am I late? I think I'm late.

Anyways: Susan Bones as the GWL, with Ernie and Hannah as her Trio. I won't write it (or, if I did, I'd never publish it) since I feel like a lot of canon would end up being reused.

I also have the idea of a sort-of Buddy Cop thing with Fay Dunbar: Auror. Postwar, possibly with Harry either being a mentor or a partner. The major case would be the rise of the potentially gruesome Carrow sisters.

I'd also like to write about Ilvermorny, but I don't have any specific ideas for /that/.

** Ok maybe I will write it but ive never written anything this long so maybe not.

So it started when I realized that Voldemort made his first horcrux when London was being bombed in WW2 and his orphanage was in London and Dumbledore said no to his request to stay in school. Not wanting to do die in a place you hate surrounded by people you hate who also hate you is a strong incentive.

I played with the time line a bit so most of Riddles desires to be dark lord came after this point not before not that he wasnt a dick or a bigot. And i made the idea of horcruxes. That by creating it you corrupt the piece of soul remaining in your body. Which means that Riddles soul and all his Horcruxes are tainted except his first one.

The diary is used to bring him back but instead of quickly draining and killing the victim he does it slowly over time and his victim has plenty of time to recuperate and he doesnt die. The victim in this case isnt Ginny but Bill Weasely because the Malfoy mannor got raided a few years earlier in this story and Bill got the diary at age 19 before going to Egypt.

Without the dark magic to taint his soul half it can heal and form a full soul from that half making Tom his own person who isnt Voldemort but could have been under different circumstances. While he doesnt have the best views on muggles and muggleborns from the start its a better one than he used to due to the knowledge he learns about the muggle world and their advancements both in the diary and after he comes out. He later joins the fight to stop Voldemorts because he rejects what he in one life became. Even if they started with the same beliefs they now no longer had the same experiences. The lack of Horcruxes have him think differently too. However he is still deeply suspicipus of Dumbledore doesnt trust him and said distrust helps cause inner issues in the Order.

Dumbledore isnt evil but he is morally ambiguous and Tom considers him an antagonist sometimes justifiably sometimes not. Major focus on his friendship with Bill.

** I'm writing a Snily (almost 500k and counting) and I have survived through the (Tumblr) shitstorm of hate comments. It's not so bad anymore now that Tumblr is finally dying off. Writing a longfic is a pain in the ass and I'm happy that my summer break has started so I can round up the story for good. I'm horribly biased, but writing about Snape is always a good thing in my books (whether he get to be with Lily or not).

There has been another story circling around in my mind that I've been dying to write, but I know that in order for it to work it'll have to be even longer than the story I'm currently writing. It's basically an ultimate crossover of my favourite fandoms. It involves the HP universe, the MCU universe, Narnia, Doctor Who and Middle Earth. The problem that I'm facing (and I've seen this in a lot of crossover stories) is that a lot of characters end up meeting, and then there's no storyline whatsoever. Being able to create a consistent story line with so many characters involved is going to be a bitch, but it's not impossible. Maybe, some day, I'll end up writing it - but for now I know that the idea is going to be stored onto a pile of 'things-to-do' on my mental shelf and hope it won't collect too much dust along the way.

** One fic I had an idea for is a crossover fic in which Adrian Raven (from El Goonish Shive) takes over the position of defence teacher in fifth year. He quickly becomes very frustrated at how backwards Europe's understanding of magic is compared to America's. (ie, everyone can use magic, but only qizards can use /every/ form of magic. Raven has to explain this to the class several times). I didn't really flesh out the idea all that much, and since I'm already working on two fics, I haven't really had time to flesh out this one.
