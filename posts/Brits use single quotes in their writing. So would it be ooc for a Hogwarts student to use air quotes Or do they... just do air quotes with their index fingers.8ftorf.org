#+TITLE: Brits use single quotes in their writing. So would it be ooc for a Hogwarts student to use air quotes? Or do they... just do air quotes with their index fingers?

** We do use double quotes (in newspapers for example) and also do air quotes with two fingers, we're really not so different after all!

This is some pretty intense brit-picking... as long as authors don't refer to Hogwarts as "high school" and avoid any awkward pants/trousers situation I'm usually already impressed with any non-British authors.

I'm confused now. How can you even draw comparisons for this? Age-wise Hogwarts starts way before high school age, to begin with, so that there are people doing this is just baffling ...

***** Well, that's useful info. Although it is higher in the USA and I would have thought that the British writers would know better than to call it that and thus it's the American writers who do this ... apparently not.

Humanity, you have failed us again ...

****** I do have a few friends from different parts of the UK who call it high school, but the majority of people don't use this term. It's primary school, secondary school and sixth firm college, although I wouldn't say that Hogwarts even needs any if these terms applied to it.

******* Yeah I called mine high school because it was in the name. But there was a school next door that we all referred to as the secondary school, and when it comes to fics I would err on the side of caution.

*** My main-gripe with non-British authors is when they take the brit-picking too far. Not everyone says 'cuppa', and it certainly doesn't belong in a 3rd person narrative outside of direct quotes, imo. I was living in England for quite some time without hearing anyone say 'cuppa' even once. (I was, however, confused by people saying 'tea' about dinner, which honestly still confounds me...)

**** "Crikey, mate, I'm right chuffed with this cuppa."

See also: Seamus getting turned into a walking, talking, making-my-ears-bleed-annoying Irish stereotype.

And in case you were only exposed to one side of the tea/dinner/lunch/supper debate, this is controversial even within Britain and leads to many great arguments between friends. ðŸ˜Š

***** I generally don't mind fanfic where it's in dialogue, but there should be differentiation between characters. It's almost as if people don't recognize the plethora of dialects, sociolects, etc. that Britain holds.

I lived in the North where everyone seemed pretty agreed on tea for dinner, love as a nickname for just about anyone, and nobody seemed to say cuppa (they just said "would you like some tea", meaning I was never sure if they were offering me food or beverage).

And yes, the extreme Irishness of Seamus, as well as the extreme Scottishness of McGonnagall is so exaggerated at times that I just stop reading, or skip their dialogue.

** Most people just change the tone of their speech to imply stuff. Emphasis and stress on different bits of the sentence can change the meaning.
