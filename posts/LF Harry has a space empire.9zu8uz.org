  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.

** My favorite. Set in the future, a seemingly immortal Harry Potter builds a space fleet of magicals to explore the vast space. He is bonded (read: married) to a Vulcan OC, they will have children. It has fluff, innuendos, mentioning of sex and politics.

  Exiled for three centuries on a barren rock, Harry's saved by the crew of the Enterprise D. He makes it to the colony world his people planned to go to and finds they're just as insular as ever though Hermione and his friends set them on a better course. Their nuclear option, though, left Harry with no escape. A prophecy is once again in play and he's the Chosen One. Again.

  During the final battle Harry is hit with a luck spell... but who exactly got lucky? Harry finds himself in the future fighting a new war when all he wants to do is have a nice and easy life. So he decides to have fun instead.

**** I dont /think/ so?

The author is mostly good at describing the different species' physicality, but you might struggle a bit. Consider a quick google search for images if you're feeling lost.

Edit: But it probably won't be as much fun. Some missions and events will seem somewhat silly to you, when the author is adressing something strange about the /game's/ story

** There's loads of stories that qualify, but two of my favorites which haven't been mentioned previously are:

"Browncoat, Green Eyes" linkffn(2857962) by nonjon - No doubt the one completed HP/SciFi crossover I remember most fondly and I should probably re-read it at some point. Harry is a wizard out of time and without a home, since humanity kind of destroyed Earth. One day he appears in the canon-Firefly/Serenity setting and the chaos spreads from there on his way to discovering what happened to the magical world.

"The Havoc side of the Force" linkffn(8501689) and the companion fic "The Unsuspecting side of the Force" linkffn(8594589) by Tsu Doh Nimh put Harry into the Star Wars galaxy at the time of Episode I. His arrival soon pushes canon off the rails, but it's a hell of a ride. Sadly updates are slow lately.

I think "Harry Potter and The Chance at a New Life" linkffn(12790836) by kossboss deserves a mention too. It's a decent HP/Stargate crossover where space empires are a big deal, since the galaxy is full of slaver false Gods and Harry has to live among them. What's one more on that list, you say? The story has its problems and is currently on hiatus, but I enjoy it as a bit of a guilty pleasure fic like some others

One such example is the already mentioned HP/Marvel crossover by Vimesenthusiast. Said author also has a HP/Star Wars crossover that might fit your request, although I don't think I've read more than a couple of chapters. Many other writers (such as plums, kathryn518 or RhysThornberry to name just a few) have written (or rather, are writing/have abandoned) stories along similar premises, all of which can be traced back to a long abandoned, rewritten and once more abandoned story by bluminous8.
