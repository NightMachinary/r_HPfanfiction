The Mirror of Erised shows you your heart's desire. So, how long would you stuck in front of it?


** My heart's desire?

To prove my worth. To bring honor to my family. To get accepted into MIT. To be the top student at MIT. To be the person people think of in the next generation as someone who revolutionized technology. To have people want to be friends with me and not the other way around.

How long would I be stuck there and turn my back against all my dreams?

Three hours after I realize I'm hungry and might miss dinner.

/but I will come back/

*** I think that the real question is, are you living the life that's taking you to your dreams or is sitting in front of a mirror more real? When you're chasing your dreams, life is real and worth living. Otherwise dreaming in front of a piece of glass is the choice a lot of people make.

Thanks for sharing, btw. Awesome dreams! Go get ‚Äòem!

******* However you want to take it is up to you - after all, I am just somebody at a keyboard potentially thousands of miles away. The reason I said that was because I lived for honour and reputation and hated my life. I found a lot more interest and excitement in my life when I let go of it. I'm not advising going and living your life to to the other extreme, but find something you are passionate about and pursue it. If your honour and reputation are what you live for, you may not find it living - only existing.

** I mean, I feel like my heart's desire is to never run out of fun/cool stuff to do.

I would probably just check the mirror every so often for inspiration, ya know? whenever life feels like its getting slow - boom, lets go hang-glider jousting

** Realistically, merely seeing your heart's desire is not really enough to keep you stuck in front of a mirror for untold amounts of time (until you waste away). The mirror appears to have some additional magic to it where it not only shows you your heart's desire, but also makes you believe that somehow the mirror holds the key to achieving it - that if you only keep looking, you will somehow realise your dream.

*** It might also have to do with the person watching it, and what their heart's desire is/how attainable it is. Harry has an overwhelming desire to know his family and the Mirror is virtually the only way to, but Ron's to stand apart from his brothers is vastly more attainable and so the Mirror is less enchanting.

** I cannot tell you truly what my heart's desire is. I never looked deep enough into myself to find out.

I'd honestly be terrified and simultaneously compelled to see what is in there for me.

How long would I look in that mirror? Probably until I die. My fear is that my true heart's desire is something I cannot attain, thus I will stay in front of the mirror looking at what I want but cannot have.

*** I think everyone's true desires are attainable - acceptance, love, companionship, etc. We're all wired to want those things and they are the things that fulfil us. Self-reflection to find out who you truly are is a deep rabbit hole...

** I wouldn't be stuck in front of it for very long. My heart's current desire is to meet a decent and kind woman, and marry her. But I can't do that if I'm standing in front of a mirror that shows me a fantasy of it. :) It's like watching TV or writing fanfiction. :)

** It's probably love. I don't really know how long I'd remain. It'd be tough.

The thing about true love is that it wouldn't be true love if it were selfish, and as such I think the mirror would tell me to get up and get some food, and that it'll still be there for me when I stand up, even if I never sit on front of it again.
