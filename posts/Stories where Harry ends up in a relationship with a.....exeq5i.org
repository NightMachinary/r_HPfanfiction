Muggle-born, Half-blood, or muggle?

I've read 1 where he's dating the muggle girl from the beginning of Half-Blood Prince and I've been wanting to see more relationships that aren't Gary marrying his best friends sister.


** With a Muggleborn: most H/Hr fics obviously

With a half-blood: most Harry/Snape and Harry/Tom Riddle or Voldemort fics should qualify

With a Muggle:

*** Grow Young with Me is great. Hope it starts updating soon.

I have mixed feelings for Emperor, much of which is to do with Harry being an OP super weapon one chapter, and barely above average the next. Also drama for the sake of drama at certain points. Even so, the first few arcs are worth the read.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

For real, that pairing makes up a good percentage of the fandom already. Though they might have meant a Muggleborn that connected to their Muggle roots better (by 4th year Hermione called technology a replacement for magic, and by the summer after 6th she had little qualms about sending her parents away).

Behind Blue Eyes is a personal favourite. Be warned, it's very, very angsty. Literally everyone is miserable and dour and trying desperately to be hopeful because their lives suck. It does break up the angst with hopeful moments and laughing-at-the-darkness moments though, so you don't have to gird your loins too much to face it.

He's dating a Muggle in this one, who is a surprisingly well-done OC with semi-Chav, semi-Emo vibes to her.
