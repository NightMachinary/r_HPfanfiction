I can't bring myself to hate anything that is Harry-centric!


** Kind of a double whammy but lordship's and a wife per line cliches. As long as it's reasonable 2 or 3 houses max. The reason for the limit is that some law could be used to limit 1 person from having to much influence directly on the legislature. While Lily was Lady Potter for example maybe James didn't have time to get a lady prevell. (The Black family potentially also through Sirius)

** I absolutely love Ginnymort! Also I'm against OP!Harry, but I absolutely adore non-magic powers. There's a really good fic where Ron's cousin is Wally West, and he becomes a speedster.

What's Ginnymort? Is it like a fic where Ginny is evil, or a fic about Ginny's POV in Chamber of Secrets?

**** Ginnymort is a pretty wide trope. It's basically anything where Ginny remains influenced by Tom after CoS. I've seen a few where she dies and Tom replaces her, but usually it's more of a meld thing where she ends up with a healthy mixture of both of their personalities and motivations.

** Bashing and manipulative Dumbledore.

As long as its not taken to the extreme and the bashed characters actually behave as human beings with an IQ over 10.

Sometimes, low intelligence levels are funny, and I read those when I need a good laugh, and other times, they just annoy me. I know how you feel. :)

I know a lot of people hate it but it's an absolute favorite of mine and I'm kinda disappointed that there seems to be a lot less than when I first started reading fanfiction

** As much as it pains me to admit it, angsty darkgrey Dumbledore and Ron bashing lord Hadrian stories. Well, sometimes at least. Plus Slytherin!Harry is fun as well. You have to dose them pretty hard to avoid turning your brains into a splurge but yeah, they are a guilty pleasure

What I find myself really guilty about those types fics is that sometimes, they're the exact same fanfiction, just rewritten? But I love them too much to care!

** I'll probably be downvoted to hell for this, but I really don't like Hermione, so I like Hermione critical or bashing fics, but most of them also bash Ron, who I love, so there are very few fics to find that fulfill both of those things

*** I mean I agree with you in a sense. I like the Hermione is in canon, a good character with multiple flaws and foibles but I hate how protective Fandom and fanon are of her, and how she gets inflated to stupid proportions, as some sort of God Queen. I would also like to see Ron in a more positive light, after all I believe he is definitely the most â€˜heroic' after protagonist Harry.
