Thinking about it, it just doesn't make sense to me that most of the Death Eaters and their ilk wouldn't also be racists, homophobes, and misogynists. In the real world, people that are bigoted in one way tend to be bigoted in a lot of ways - a racist is also likely to be a nativist, anti-Semite, homophobe, Islamophobe, and probably misogynist as well. Anybody that's inclined to "Other" people isn't going to stop at a single category.

I'm sure that this lack in canon is largely due to Rowling not wanting to dilute her focus or touch on anything even remotely controversial, but it does come across as a bit unbelievable in hindsight.

** This is Dolores Umbridge erasure.

Voldemort was able to take advantage of werewolves and giants because they were bitter about being ostracized. Madam Maxime lies and has a negative reaction to being called 'a half giantess.' You have a werewolf registry and Remus flees in DH when Scimgeour comes calling.

The Weasleys are the 'trash' of the wizarding world because they are poor.

**** The Blacks, Fudge, and Slughorn to name a few. You could even make the case that the Prewetts distanced themselves.

Being blood-traitors and muggle lovers could have had something to do with it, but it doesn't seem like anyone was getting kicked out of the family for marrying a Potter (or a Prewett).

***** The Blacks blew Cedrella off the tapestry cause she married a blood traitor, not because she married a povo. Perhaps the Potters did not have a Blood Traitor reputation when Dorea was kicking about.

I don't recall Fudge or Slughorn mocking their wealth either, but I could be wrong.

Like, there's plenty of people who dislike the Weasleys for other reasons., but I'm talking specifically about wealth discrimination.

****** A blood-traitor is a pureblood who sympathizes and/or associates with muggles. The Potters were blood traitors. As were the Prewetts and Longbottoms. We know that the Potters and Prewetts were upper middle/upper class. However, the Weasleys were poor, which is the difference between Lucretia, Callidora, and Dorea marrying who they did vs Cedrella.

Why would Fudge and Slughorn outright mock Arthur/the Weasleys in front of Harry Potter? It was only that Ginny hexed Zacharias that got Sluggy's attention. The vast majority of the Slug Club were wealthy and connected students.

*** Even Umbitch is never shown dumping on Lee, Dean, Angelina, Alicia, Padma, Parvati, Cho, Su Li, or Kingsley for their ethnicity. Nobody in canon is shown to be LGBTQ+ and so there's obviously no bigotry shown towards that demographic either. Ditto for religion. Overall women seem to be treated at least as equally as in modern society, though obviously we don't see their pay slips or know what their male superiors/coworkers say and do out of the public eye.

So all we see is anti-muggle, blood-purism, human-centrism, and classism. For the kind of bigot that goes so far as to engage in organized violence and/or organize an act of genocide, that's a pretty paltry list. IRL bigots of that level of extremity tend to go all-in and "other" pretty much everybody that's not just like themselves.

***** By and large they tend to use their religion as an excuse to say/do/believe what they already wanted to. Sure, some are indoctrinated to believe "God/Jesus/Allah/Whoever wants you to hate X", but that's mostly kids; by the time they grow up, they're likely to either internalize the ideology and all its supposed justifications or recognize it as the crock of shit that it actually is. What people get out of their religion depends mostly on what they put in and what they're looking for.

** I don't know if it's the portrayal of racism in media or the divide in modern society between progressives and everyone else that makes people view it this way. But racists aren't necessarily one-dimensional haters of everyone different. One can absolutely be a racist without being a homophobe or a misogynist.

And racism can be insidious. I'd actually argue that it's more often insidious than overt. The most outwardly normal people can be horrible racists, and you would never know from a casual interaction.

*** Okay, I phrased things in an unclear fashion: The most active and overt racists - whether it's black pointy-hooded robes and silver masks, white pointy-hooded robes and white masks, or swastikas and stars-and-bars with tiki torches - tend to be very particular about who falls under the heading of "us" or "real people". Sure, they probably have one distinction that they focus on most heavily, but they don't tend to restrict themselves to just that focus.

Also, the misogyny of bigots tends to be less overt than their other facets: If you actually look at the kind of stuff they say to themselves, each other, and outsiders, you discover that sex and/or reproduction are frequently the linchpin of their issues. Most of the most active, vitriolic, and violent bigots are male, and they often have a lot to say about how these [insert epithet here] are stealing and/or raping women. They're of the delusional belief that they themselves are highly desirable, and so obviously the reason that they're not getting the sex they're entitled to is because it's being denied them by others, not because they're the human equivalent of what I'd scrape off my shoes would scrape off its shoes. It certainly can't be because women have agency and bodily autonomy. Also, since they're so desirable it's obvious that gay men will harass and/or assault them if given the chance, because that's what such bigots would do to attractive women if they could.
