I can't remember what story it was, but I remember Lucius ends up dating and I think eventually marries petunia after they both end up divorced at some point? Petunia might have taken up breeding owls, and I think a TV was charmed to work in her house after she moved into a more magical building, but those might be me mixing up other fics with the one I'm looking for.
