:END:
I've been looking for this fic for awhile. Essentially, Harry goes back in time to the Marauder's Era and falls for Remus. Harry goes back to the present at one point I believe but he definitely ends up in the past again and married to Remus. At one point, someone tried to kill Remus with silver. Pretty sure this is a series actually.
