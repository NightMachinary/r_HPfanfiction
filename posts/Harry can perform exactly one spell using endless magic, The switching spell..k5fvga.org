His use of the spell is unique as he can swap anything with something else.

1. Malfoy spends his Hogwarts years constantly having his swapped with a sausages Crabb always carries with him for snacks.

2. When he is nearly thrown of his broom during his first Quidditch match he simple swaps himself with Snape to save his life.

3. When the Dursleys try to hurt him he swaps them with a walrus and a giraffe who he keeps as house pets. Nobody noticed anything different with the Dursleys.

What other ways can Harry use his only but versatile ability?

** in the graveyard, when Tom is spamming killing curses, he keeps switching places with death eaters so they die, or he can switch Snape with Peter during 3rd year and 4th year never comes up, switch fawkes in 2nd year with a rooster, switch himself and Dumbledore in 1st year or in 5th year switch a pebble with Sirius so he knows he's safe.

It's op af to use said ability, imagine how versatile it can become, you can switch EVERYTHING.

****** I am not a romance intense either. Though you cannot really leave it out in a teenage school series. It appears even in the background, and personally I think I need to work on my romance writing skills, so I have read some from time to time.

However, even in no romance series, OOC behavior like this kind of takes me out of a story. Even a good story can do that if suddenly Ron and Hermione start calling each other "love" the day after they got together.

******* True. PJO managed to become my favourite book series and I can be defensive of the main paring. Percabeth is great but other parings like Solangelo are incredibly rushed but people still obsess over it.

******** I think some aspects of the series after the original came out as forced or rushed. I mean Solangelo works, but it is just missing setting and background.

He dropped the ball by putting diverse characters like Beckendorf in the background in the first series, then he overcompensated in the next series.

I mean, Leo is cool, but some stuff doesn't feel as natural flowing as in original series
