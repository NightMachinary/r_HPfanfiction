Had a crackfic concept which fully dragged me out of my body and I need to expurgate it before things get worse.

It's third year. Snape is being pissy as usual when he visits his doctor, who tells him that he has Magic Cancer. It's incurable and he's going to die soon. This leads him to re-evaluate his life. He needs to sort his shit out, pay for his sins, and give money to Harry so he'll stop being so broke. Unfortunately, being a potions teacher doesn't pay well - hence his permanent fixation on getting the Defence Against the Dark Arts position. How's he going to make money? He's a potions professor with infinite access to supplies - time to team up with Goyle and sell drugs.

That's right. Snaping Bad.


** I misread and thought it was "Snape is confronted with his own morality". And thought there was gonna be some kind of leaf turning moment or intervention or something to make him somewhat redemption worthy.

But snaping bad is way, way better.

*** Harry's financial sitch is odd - he has huge piles of cash in the vault but also seems to be way broker than pretty much everybody but Ron? I think the vault is held in trust, so he can't actually spend any of it on anything except textbooks and lives in comparative misery. My man needs funds to move out

** I would have made Harry the Jesse equivalent, didn't get on at school but as they start to work together they form a sort of mutual respect. This could be set in an alt universe where Lily and James lived, maybe there was no Voldemort so Snape never joined the Death Eaters so him and Lily never had their falling out, he forced himself to be cordial with James when Lily started dating him, but he still held a torch for her.

With their friendship still intact and no threat of Voldemort, Lily and Snape could have started a Potions company, with James as a financial backer, making them not only the Mr and Mrs Pinkman equivalents, but also the Gretchen and Elliott ones too. Snape eventually leaves because he can't stand working with James, and also because Lily becoming pregnant with Harry is too much for him, he then takes up a position at Hogwarts as the Potions Master.

13 years later Snape is still teaching at Hogwarts and the Potions company has gone on to be incredibly successful, and to Snapes dismay supplies the ingredients he has to use in class. Harry is a bit like how Snape imagines him in canon, arrogant and stuck up, although if this fic is from Snapes POV it could be implied that this is a case of unreliable narrator and that's just how Snape is seeing him.

Then as you said in your pitch, Snape gets magical cancer, maybe related to a volatile ingredient from a magical animal he used back in the day. He then discovers Harry brewing some Magical drugs and decides to team up with him.

As for other equivalents, I imagine Ron takes the role of Skinny Pete while Neville can be Badger. I can't imagine Hermione plays that big a part in this story unless her personality is radically different. Unless you give Snape his own family I can't see there being equivalents for Skyler and Walt Jr. Hank could be Dumbledore or an Auror like Mad Eye or Kingsley. No idea about Saul, Mike, or Gus though.

Alternatively, if you didn't want it to be set in school you could have it after Harry has left. Have Snape be 40 so you've got the parallel with Walt turning 50. Harry could then have been cut off from his trust fund for being a disappointment to his parents, bringing him more in line with Jesse. He could be living in Privet Drive as he has nowhere else, Vernon could have died from a heart attack, Dudley's in jail as he never had the Dementor wake up call, and Petunia just decided to move than stay in an empty house.

Those are just some ideas I had.

** Teehee Snaping Bad. I've never heard the word expurgate before, but I like it!

Okay let's roll with this Snaping Bad Concept. I have no idea why he's giving money to Harry, but I've been brainstorming as to an in-universe reason for DADA position to pay more and here's what seems to be the obvious solution: it's the risk! Dumbledore has to put a whole lot of galleons on the table to get anyone to take the risk on a job that people whisper is cursed.

Also, can we make Voldemort into the Gus Fring of this story? Maybe the Leaky Cauldron can be Los Pollos Hermanos and Tom is actually Voldemort in disguise, running a pub and being an upstanding citizen while secretly running a wizarding drug cartel.

I think Goyle makes an excellent Jesse!

Now to find a role for Dumbledore... I'm thinking the DEA brother-in-law.

  Lily Evans doesn't marry James Potter.Severus Snape doesn't become a Death Eater. A loving relationship with his best friend is the happily ever after that Severus has always dreamt of - but he should've realised that a formidable magical couple will always attract attention from all the wrong quarters. With Lord Voldemort infiltrating an ineffectual government, Muggleborn rights eroded, and Lily unable to work, their lives are left in peril.Lily adores her supportive boyfriend, despite his streak of darkness, and in this terrifying new world, she knows his illegal potions are the only thing keeping them afloat - but the pressure of being a second-class citizen pushes her towards the only people who accept her: Severus' sworn enemies.Haunted by his Cokeworth past, Severus is determined not to let history repeat - but can he evade the rich promises of Lucius Malfoy, the lure of the Death Eaters, and the seductive call of the dark arts?
