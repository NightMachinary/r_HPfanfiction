Ok you guys were awesome when i was looking for a fic i couldn't find so i have another one.

All i can remember is this:

Harry was not Raised normally (ie Dursleys)

Harry did not attend Hogwarts (Italy i think?)

Harry knows/is friends with Blaise Z

Harry is a master of Blood Magic/Dark Art's

Pairing i think is Honks (Harry/Tonks)

Dumbledore brings him onboard to teach Dueling and Combat

Thats it off the top of my head, sadly my googlefu and attempts at filtering via character/searching FF.net have all failed. So I hope someone can help me.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3659524/1/A-Shadowed-Soul][A Shadowed Soul]] has Harry being abandoned by the Dursleys at a young ago, is schooled in Canada (I think)), is friends with Blaise and his Father, is a Blood Magic user, and is paired with Tonks, both of them being Metamorphs.
