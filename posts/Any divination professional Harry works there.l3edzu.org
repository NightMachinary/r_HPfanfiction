Is there any fics where the focus is in divination and its different braches? Harry could be teacher like in linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Heroy by brainthief) or maybe seer or phropeth or something like that. There could be different kind of divination, like in linkffn(Blood crest by Cauchy) where some necromancy is like divination but about dead people and Harry practices divination like tarot cards. Could be anything else related to divination. Main character could be anyone if there is lots of divination going around, but I prefer Harry. Any pairing is fine.


** linkao3(If Them's the Rules by MayMarlow)

Harry goes back in time to make sure Tom Riddle doesn't grow up to be a Dark Lord, he eventually works for a Seer as a “Witness” to basically account on historical events. This might not be what you are exactly looking for as it's more of a time travel fix it fic. It says that it's Harry/Tom but in the first 40ish chapters it's just a very nice family dynamic and I hope it stays that way.

  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
