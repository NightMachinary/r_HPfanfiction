There are a lot of different eras we see in the canon - the 90s for the Trio, the 70s for the previous generation, and then an earlier era for Riddle, McGonagall, Hagrid et cetera, and earlier still with Dumbledore.

Then, obviously, there's the the epoch of the Founders and any different time periods that might be embraced in an AU, so...

Are there any fics that strike you as being especially accurate to that era, really embracing the feel and the style and the fashion of it? Are there any fics written in an old-fashioned style to match the era they're set in, or fics that you think really hit the nail on the head when it comes to that era?

Please, hit me with your recs.


** I was just about to make a very similar request XD

These are a little AU, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1614796/Ell-Roche][Ell Roche]] has written numerous long one-shots that are all set in an old-fashioned style and every single one of these are seriously brilliant :D They're all romance-based though.

Aside from the above, here's a few more:

- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3669676/1/A-Hat-s-First-Time]]) Founder's Era one-shot
- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4539146/1/Do-virgins-taste-better]]) Founder's Era one-shot
- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2010083/1/S-is-for-Slytherin]]) Founder's Era - slash, interesting take of the Era
- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7319686/1/Old-Souls]]) Riddle's Era

  Professor Potter's second history lesson: Gryffindor was a perv and Slytherin wasn't much better. The third history lesson: don't mess with the Master. Class dismissed.

  Salazar Slytherin wasn't so much thrown to the lions as he was sacrificed to the unsleeping dragon. For the good of the school, of course. History is never so kind or as accurate as it ought to be.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
