I recently read a fic where Harry went to Durmstrang, and now I want to read more that include other magical schools.


** There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3771102/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Irish-Choice][Harry Potter and the Irish Choice]] which features Harry transferring from Hogwarts in his first year.

** One of the classics of this type is Miranda Flairgold's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]] and sequels. Over 500k words of story there with Harry at a school for assassins in Canada.

*** Can recommend this, I've probably read it 5+ times. It goes massively AU/OOC but it's amazing.
