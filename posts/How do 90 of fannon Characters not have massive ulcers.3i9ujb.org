It seems that so many fics out there involve the Characters always responding to things angrily, or yellig. I get it, sometimes anger can be a release. But goodness gracious sometimes it just feels like all of the HP characters should be dead of ulcers or other rage induced illnesses. Does anyone else feel this way or is it just the fics I read?


** It's not just you. All-caps can be VERY satisfying when done correctly. You have to be angry along with the character when he/she yells. Harry's breakdown in Dumbledore's office was so well done in my opinion.

Problem with all-caps, though: when done incorrectly, it's annoying and tiring. I once read a fanfiction where Harry started yelling five (relatively short) chapters into the story. Eeh, yeah, I'll pass. Threw me off the story completely.

** Did you read OotP? Because Harry was pretty angry there. I think it's a result of OotP that a lot of characters get categorized this way.

(Also, could you tag this as a discussion thread?)

** If i see shouted or screamed more than twice in a chapter in a non sequitur fashion, thats an immediate ctrl w. it shows immaturity in the writing if the author does not understand how actual conversation works. People do not shout out of nowhere for no reason with no buildup. They do not scream at someone for disagreeing. They hiss, they spit, they grind out, but they do not scream at Snape for being mean to them in the middle of their first class.

** I feel this way though, from what I've seen, it has a lot to do with the overuse of exclamation points. I see it all the time and it just comes off as shouting even though I can tell that's not necessarily what the author meant and if they did mean that then it's just bad writing.

Those things need to be used sparingly, writers. In most situations, using an adjective to describe the tone would have been far more appropriate.

***** You mean physiological stress, not physical. And ulcers are still an accepted psychosomatic condition in certain cases, as described in that article I linked. Stress has multiple effects on your body that are measurable, it should be so weird that those effects can harm you in the long run?
