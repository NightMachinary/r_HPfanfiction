** I'm not trying to be offensive, but these were all arguments for real-life American slavery. I remember reading history books and being so confused how slave-owners were so evil to use these arguments and deride abolitionists for trying to free slaves, but I think this sub really opened my eyes. People naturally don't like change, and will defend evil processes because they can't believe their status quo is inherently wrong. Anyway, psychology aside, these points are really flawed.

#+begin_quote
  the house elves don't think of it as slavery. Hell, they /need/ to be serving a family or they end up killing themselves or drowning themselves drunk in butterbeer like Winky.
#+end_quote

I would cite letters that former slaves wrote that implied they were miserable about being freed, percentages of slaves that stayed with their masters after being freed, or even state that there were less than thirty American slave rebellions (all having between 9 and 40 participants) in 300 years, but I suppose that's too on the nose. Instead, I'll talk about psychology. People have an inherent fear of the unknown. It's why kids hate the dark, for example. But at some point, most people get over that. It will take much longer for House Elves to get over their aversion to freedom, of course, but that doesn't mean they can never change at all.

#+begin_quote
  You can't just pass laws freeing house elves as Hermione wanted to straight away--house-elves have been enslaved for centuries and both wizards and house elves are used to that. The best way to start would be by passing laws against corporal punishment against house-elves, eventually getting to the point that if house-elves want to be freed, they should be freed automatically.
#+end_quote

Yes, because that was /exactly/ how real-life slaves were freed ^{/s}.

#+begin_quote
  eventually getting to the point that if house-elves want to be freed, they should be freed automatically.
#+end_quote

You do know that slaves do not know what they want, right? They're brainwashed and if we applied that to the real world, slavery would be pretty commonplace.

#+begin_quote
  There's also the fact that house-elves /aren't human/. Yes they're sentient beings, yes slavery's wrong, but you can't treat house-elves as humans. They have different needs than humans.

  Many fics compensate for the blatant slavery by making it so that many house-elves like being bonded with families either because they get a boon of magic to use or because they're just more powerful that way. There's also a lot of fics where house-elves need to be bonded or they'll slowly die or go insane
#+end_quote

At this point, I'm actually wondering if you used quotes from American slave owners to inspire your arguments. What evidence is there that they have different needs than humans? It's only your headcanon and fanfiction backing up that. You're trying to justify slavery by making excuses, instead of facing the actual problem: that slavery is happening, and no one in canon besides Hermione found it wrong.

Fanon. That's complete and utter fanon. Did Dobby look like he was dying to you? Winky didn't turn to alcohol because of some magical compulsion, she did it because she was unjustly disowned by a family she dearly loved and wanted to be a part in. People (who are not magically compelled) have done the same for less than what she had gone through.

#+begin_quote

Dobby wanted to be free, but he couldn't leave. He saw something wrong with it, but was institutionally bound that he couldn't do something about it. If you want an in-universe answer to why the Hogwarts House-elves are like that, then it's most likely that they have been brainwashed for centuries and have internalized the oppression.

#+begin_quote

Proof? What proof do you have that they have different needs from humans? And even if they do have different needs from humans, what proof do you have that freedom and autonomy are things they don't need as well.

Because Dobby wanted to leave but couldn't, and Kreacher wanted to serve someone different but couldn't. Those seem like pretty good instances of Elves wanting - /needing -/ freedom. Perhaps they are different from humans, but the need for freedom doesn't seem to be one of those differences.

#+begin_quote
  There's also a lot of */fics/* where house-elves need to be bonded or they'll slowly die or go insane, like Winky. That's just one way featuring why house-elves aren't human.

  (emphasis mine)
#+end_quote

Fanon. You already said that the /fics/ are the ones doing it. There is nothing in the actual books that actually support that. In fact, we have the opposite. Dobby was just fine and even thriving after 5 years of freedom.

#+begin_quote
  I don't see much of a problem with house-elves belonging to families so long as they're not abused and are treated decently.

Is an argument regurgitated from the[[https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/text-pro-slavery-argument-1832-thomas-dew][1800's pro-slavery arguments]].

Some relevant snippets:

#+begin_quote
  Is it not a fact, known to every man in the South, that the most /cruel masters/ are those who have been unaccustomed to slavery. It is well known that northern gentlemen who marry southern heiresses, are much severer masters than southern gentlemen.

​

#+begin_quote
  But is not this master sometimes kind and indulgent to his slaves? does he not mete out to them, for faithful service, the reward of his cordial approbation?
#+end_quote

The problem with SPEW is that it was slavery written by a real-life closet imperialist. No amount of in-universe explanations will change that fact. Rowling wrote that slavery was okay. She mocked the people who wanted to abolish the entire system. She /chose/ to include a multi-book arc that was all just slavery apologia, and you fell for it hook, line, and sinker.

The renewed slavery apologia is one of the worst things to have come out of Harry Potter.

*** - Fanon. That's complete and utter fanon. Did Dobby look like he was dying to you? Winky didn't turn to alcohol because of some magical compulsion, she did it because she was unjustly disowned by a family she dearly loved and wanted to be a part in. People (who are not magically compelled) have done the same for less than what she had gone through.
- Dobby wanted to be free, but he couldn't leave. He saw something wrong with it, but was institutionally bound that he couldn't do something about it. If you want an in-universe answer to why the Hogwarts House-elves are like that, then it's most likely that they have been brainwashed for centuries and have internalized the oppression.

I counteracted the "killing themselves" and "becoming drunks" part when I said that Dobby was a reasonably progressive elf who enjoyed being free and having a wage. This does not count toward all of the other house-elves who dislike being free. Look at how they reacted in Goblet of Fire when Dobby revealed that he was being paid (attached to this comment).

There's gotta be what? Fifty to a hundred house-elves in Hogwarts? None of them are abused but find it rude and embarrassing that Dobby's being paid. You brought up the "brainwashed" bit, but yeah, what else are they going to think? They've been raised to think that serving Hogwarts is their duty, /which it is/. I think slavery's wrong, but you can't just automatically change anything. The house-elves don't agree with it and you can't automatically change their mindset.

Winky believed herself to be a bad house-elf for being freed and disappointing and thus turned to alcohol. She did not like being free, did not see it as "unjust," and she missed her family. Look at how she scolded Dobby on badmouthing his previous masters. She believed him to be a bad house-elf for doing so.

And I mentioned in a different that the house-elves have been raised to think a certain way. Yes, it's wrong, how they've been conditioned, but you can't just change their mindset automatically. It takes time.

- Proof? What proof do you have that they have different needs from humans? And even if they do have different needs from humans, what proof do you have that freedom and autonomy are things they don't need as well.

Look at what I copied and pasted before. Dobby says that even if he likes being free, he likes work, as well. He even wanted less wage than what Dumbledore was offering because he prefers the work better than being paid. It may not be a need, specifically, but he still /likes/ work.

- "I don't see much of a problem with house-elves belonging to families so long as they're not abused and are treated decently." (me)
- Is an argument regurgitated from the [[https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/text-pro-slavery-argument-1832-thomas-dew][1800's pro-slavery arguments]].

Again, I'm bringing up the fact that house-elves aren't humans. Even if human slaves were treated decently, that doesn't mean I see it any less wrong. And what I mainly meant was that I don't see much wrong with house-elves belonging to families and being treated nicely /if they want to be bonded to a family/ or while Hermione and others work on elfish welfare. It's not going to be a fast process, and so long as house-elves don't mind belonging to a family and are treated nicely, I don't see a problem with it.

- The problem with SPEW is that it was slavery written by a real-life closet imperialist. No amount of in-universe explanations will change that fact. Rowling wrote that slavery was okay. She mocked the people who wanted to abolish the entire system. She /chose/ to include a multi-book arc that was all just slavery apologia, and you fell for it hook, line, and sinker.
- The renewed slavery apologia is one of the worst things to have come out of Harry Potter.

I completely agree that house-elves shouldn't have been added to Harry Potter. What was wrong with adding brownies or something similar.

On the other hand, I personally feel that the problem with SPEW was that Hermione wanted house-elves to be freed /immediately/ and I don't recall her taking any of the house-elves' feelings into account, other than Dobby, who's a complete anomaly.

**** Our difference is that you are viewing the SPEW and House-elves from an in-universe perspective and trying to make sense of it in a world that was explicitly written where only the most radical found it wrong.

Of course there a hundred and one reasons of why the elves should remain in slavery in-world. The author wrote it that way. The author built that world with the idea that house-elf slavery was perfectly fine and acceptable. They are after all inhuman.

On the other hand, I'm viewing this situation with an out-of-universe perspective in mind. A real person wrote those elves as wanting to be enslaved. She wrote the one elf who want to be free as someone the rest of their kind look on as crazy. She made other characters laugh and mock at the one activist who wanted them to be free. She made that /not a single/ /elf/ wanted the help.

A real woman from a country with a long and horrific history of slavery wrote that. The situation of the elves parallel the situation of real-life historic slavery to just ignore the implications of the thing she wrote or the excuses for said slavery she built into her world.

That the slaves are not human, that the slaves like being enslaved, that the ones fighting for freedom have lost their minds, that slavery is fine for as long as the masters are kind are all /historic/ arguments for slavery.

Rowling built a world where those arguments made sense and demonized the character who said that it was wrong. You argued all of the above, and if I argue with you from an in-universe perspective, I will have to concede you are right. Because she built a world where all of those things are true.

And I refuse to do that. I find no value in arguing about whether the house-elves in-world are slaves. In that universe, they are and it is fine that they are. It is reprehensible.

I'm leaving this thread now. This argument is making me sick.

***** Sorry, I've come to this really late but I'm gonna chip in. You're absolutely right that there's no moral way that anyone can defend slavery, even under the guise of house elves in fiction and I don't agree with the OP at all - the way fanon justifies it is gross. But where I think you're wrong is this assessment of canon:

#+begin_quote
  A real person wrote those elves as wanting to be enslaved. She wrote the one elf who want to be free as someone the rest of their kind look on as crazy. She made other characters laugh and mock at the one activist who wanted them to be free. She made that not a single elf wanted the help.
#+end_quote

I don't think that's actually what her intentions were at all. Rowling isn't perfect, but she is a known left winger - she's a member of the UK Labour Party or at least was until very recently. I don't believe anyone who would class themselves as a socialist would write slavery apologism. Additionally, she has been very clear about how Hermione is, in many ways, a bit of an author avatar, therefore it's fair to assume that a lot of Hermione's opinions are in fact /JKs opinions./ So just to pick this paragraph apart:

-1 She didn't "write the elves as wanting to be enslaved." We get to know three house elves well. Two (Dobby and Kreacher) do not want to serve their masters and find ways around doing so. The third, Winky, is massively unhappy at being free but that is because she loves Crouch and Crouch Jr and feels responsible for their welfare. She's unhappy because of the /unfair dismissal and the rejection./ Its about the personal, not the political. So two thirds of the "elf stories" are about how they want to make their own choices, and all three show humans treating elves badly - and we are always meant to sympathise with the elves. Even Kreacher gets his redemption.

-2 She did make the other elves uncomfortable with Dobby's behaviour, granted. But we as the readers aren't meant to side with the other elves - we are meant to agree with Dobby. I think Rowling makes it beyond clear that the Hogwarts elves are displaying false consciousness, or at the very least it's a mild allegory for the social phenomena where members of an oppressed or enslaved class don't want the more radical elements of that class to "rock the boat" because they think or worry that they'll all end up being disadvantaged or punished. Whereas we know from history that someone has to be the first to rock the boat, and they often end up spoken of as heroes once the liberation is achieved. We are supposed to see Dobby as progressive, ahead of his time, and morally correct in his demands and ideas.

-3 She made other characters laugh at Hermione - not quite. This might be long so I'm sorry in advance!

She only really made /Ron/ laugh at Hermione. Harry and the others were relatively indifferent or just parroted what wizarding society teaches about elves. Now, Ron is, at his heart, a traditionalist. Not in the same way as the Malfoys, but he is. He's never known anything but the Wizarding world. His parents keep him very sheltered. The Weasleys in general are traditional- Fred and George also say that the elves like to work- but there's one point where Ron says about how Molly wishes she could afford an elf. For the Weasleys, house elf ownership is /aspirational./ They've bought into the lie. It's not their fault- they are, as a family, wildly sheltered and naive, so of course they buy into the social norms of their culture.

They probably had never really met an elf - other than the Hogwarts ones who seem happy enough because they work for Dumbledore and he's a decent person. So it probably doesn't occur to them that just because the elves are happy it doesn't make it right. The Weasleys are not particularly radical people - they only join the Order because of their connection to Harry, they weren't members the first time, and they're small c conservative people who deep down want a quiet life.

The other person who tells Hermione to let it go and that elves like to work is Hagrid - again, not an independent thinker. He repeats what he's told, and the society he lives in constantly gives the message "elves like to work" so of course that's what he repeats.

Going back to Ron - the point when Hermione realises that they could be together is the point when he talks about helping the elves to evacuate before the battle - when he finally sees them as sentient beings who have the right to a choice. Ron comes round to the SPEW way of thinking and is /rewarded with the woman he loves returning his affection./ There's a clear "moral of the story" there, which is that by the end of their story arc, both Harry and Ron have seen that Hermione is right.

Harry - he always cares about elves, he literally freed Dobby. He just doesn't think a badge campaign by a few teenagers is the way forward, plus his head is up his arse for the majority of GoF. BUT the point where he makes some real progress in the fight against Voldemort and tracking down the Horcruxes is when he gets Regulus's story and is able to find the locket. And how does he get this? By following Hermione's advice and /treating Kreacher respectfully./ Again, a clear moral there about respecting sentient beings and a big fat dose of "Hermione was right about elves."

Final point on this bit: Dumbledore- the great moral centre of the stories, the man we are all meant to look up to and love even despite his faults, potentially the most powerful man in the wizarding world- employs house elves with nowhere else to go. He offers Dobby even more money than he wants. He takes in Winky even when she's incapable of doing any work due to her addiction. He acts within the available power to him to make house elves lives better and is absolutely prepared to employ rather than enslave. He also says this:

/"That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children's tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped.”/

He understands that elves have a magic of their own and that their "loyalty and innocence" shouldn't be taken for granted or abused the way eg Voldemort and the Malfoys do. In short, he, like Hermione, views them as independent people.

-4 She made it that not a single elf wanted the help. Dobby, anyone? The house elf we know best, the character we all think of when someone says "house elf" absolutely wanted to be free, and kicked ass with his freedom. She even has Harry write "A Free Elf" on his grave. That's his epitaph, that he was free. It was indicated on his grave that he was a free elf, and why do we put things on graves or on plaques or on statues? So people remember them and remember how important those things were. Dobby's desire for freedom is his strength, it is why he can help Harry in a way that others can't. It's a strong message that loyalty by choice is stronger and more powerful than enforced loyalty, and that people (or any sentient being) should always be free to choose.

So yeah, I don't think Rowling built a world where slavery is "fine." She built a world where slavery is accepted by the majority, sure. But it's so very clear that the reader is not meant to agree with the majority. We're meant to think Dobby has a point and it's the other elves that are mad to not see it. We're meant to think Ron is an idiot for mocking Hermione- firstly because it's rude and bullying behaviour but also because a irl modern day reader can recognise what Ron can't, which is that slavery of sentient beings is wrong. And we cheer for Ron when he finally recognises this, it's a sign of his growth and maturity as a person. She built a world where those who respect house elves come out on top. Think for a minute how many characters were actually fucked over by their poor treatment of elves. Malfoy obviously. Crouch, when you consider that Winkys presence could have given away his whole "secret invisible death eater son" thing. /Sirius,/ for god's sake. Hermione chastises him for his treatment of Kreacher, he chooses to ignore her and Kreacher eventually engineers the circumstances that lead to his death. And if he hadn't died, Hermione would have given him a big fat "I told you so." We know she would, and she'd have been right. I think Dumbledore even comments to Harry that Sirius's inability to value Kreacher was his downfall.

So yeah. Nowhere out of fanon do you get the argument that "they like it" presented as an uncritical fact. The reader is meant to, through Hermione's actions and the consequences dished out for treatment of elves (good to those kind to them, bad to those not) critically examine how the wizarding world is wrong on this issue.

**** Here's the quotation from the book, I didn't have enough room:

#+begin_quote
  “Dobby has travelled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to find work!” Dobby squeaked. “But Dobby hasn't found work, sir, because Dobby wants paying now!” The house-elves all around the kitchen, who had been listening and watching with interest, all looked away at these words, as though Dobby had said something rude and embarrassing.

  ..."Dobby likes work, but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid, Harry Potter. Dobby likes being free!”

  The Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging away from Dobby, as though he were carrying something contagious. Winky, however, remained where she was, though there was a definite increase in the volume of her crying.

  “And then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky, and finds out Winky has been freed too, sir!” said Dobby delightedly.

  At this, Winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay facedown on the flagged stone floor, beating her tiny fists upon it and positively screaming with misery.

  ... “And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, sir, if Dobby wants paying! And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month!”

  “That's not very much!” Hermione shouted indignantly from the floor, over Winky's continued screaming and fist-beating.

  “Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends off,” said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening, “but Dobby beat him down, miss. Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he isn't wanting too much, miss, he likes work better.”

  “And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you, Winky?” Hermione asked kindly.

  If she had thought this would cheer up Winky, she was wildly mistaken. Winky did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious.

  “Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting paid!” she squeaked. “Winky is not sunk so low as that! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed!”

  “Ashamed?” said Hermione blankly. “But --- Winky, come on! It's Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed, not you! You didn't do anything wrong, he was really horrible to you ---”

  But at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat, flattening her ears so that she couldn't hear a word, and screeched, “You is not insulting my master, miss! You is not insulting Mr. Crouch! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard, miss! Mr. Crouch is right to sack bad Winky!”

  “Winky is having trouble adjusting, Harry Potter,” squeaked Dobby confidentially. “Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr. Crouch anymore; she is allowed to speak her mind now, but she won't do it.”

  “Can't house-elves speak their minds about their masters, then?” Harry asked.

  “Oh no, sir, no,” said Dobby, looking suddenly serious. “'Tis part of the house-elf's enslavement, sir. We keeps their secrets and our silence, sir. We upholds the family's honor, and we never speaks ill of them --- though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he does not insist upon this. Professor Dumbledore said we is free to --- to ---”

  Dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry closer. Harry bent forward. Dobby whispered, “He said we is free to call him a --- a barmy old codger if we likes, sir!”

  Dobby gave a frightened sort of giggle.

  “But Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter,” he said, talking normally again, and shaking his head so that his ears flapped. “Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore very much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him.”

  “But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now?” Harry asked him, grinning.

  A slightly fearful look came into Dobby's immense eyes. “Dobby --- Dobby could,” he said doubtfully. He squared his small shoulders. “Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were --- were --- /bad Dark wizards/!”

  Dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror-struck by his own daring --- then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard, squealing, “/Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby/!”

  Harry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the table.

  “Thank you, Harry Potter, thank you,” said Dobby breathlessly, rubbing his head.

  “You just need a bit of practice,” Harry said.

  “Practice!” squealed Winky furiously. “You is ought to be ashamed of yourself, Dobby, talking that way about your masters!”

  “They isn't my masters anymore, Winky!” said Dobby defiantly. “Dobby doesn't care what they think anymore!”

  “Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby!” moaned Winky, tears leaking down her face once more. “My poor Mr. Crouch, what is he doing without Winky? He is needing me, he is needing my help! I is looking after the Crouches all my life, and my mother is doing it before me, and my grandmother is doing it before her... oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was freed? Oh the shame, the shame!”

  She buried her face in her skirt again and bawled.

  “Winky,” said Hermione firmly, “I'm quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you. We've seen him, you know ---”

  “You is seeing my master?” said Winky breathlessly, raising her tearstained face out of her skirt once more and goggling at Hermione.

Your interpretation of the text is certainly valid, but it is not the only valid interpretation. There is also nothing in the text that contradicts the idea that elves want to serve and are generally perfectly happy with their status (abused elves like Dobby being the exception, but no one is arguing that the abuse is okay). And so OP's interpretation of the text is also completely valid.

You cannot just assume that intelligent nonhuman creatures think the same way that humans do and want and need the same thi gs that humans do.

False consciousness is a term used---primarily by Marxist sociologists---to describe ways in which material, ideological, and institutional processes are said to mislead members of the proletariat and other class actors within capitalist societies, concealing the exploitation intrinsic to the social relations between classes. Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) used the term "false consciousness" in an 1893 letter to Franz Mehring to address the scenario where a subordinate class willfully embodies the ideology of the ruling class. Engels dubs this consciousness "false" because the class is asserting itself towards goals that do not benefit it. "Consciousness", in this context, reflects a class's ability to politically identify and assert its will.

*** I'm not saying keep it that way, I'm just saying that you have to slowly build up to freeing them and getting them used to the idea. Even then, all of the older house-elves would be actively against it while the younger ones wouldn't, just as it is with older vs younger people and clothes and traditions and stuff.

It'll be traumatic if you just automatically rip all of these elves away from their families (which is the way they see it as). Just look at Winky! She drowned herself in butterbeer because she was so depressed at being freed and not being able to care for her Master and Young Master anymore. Dobby was a relatively progressive house-elf in which he liked being free and getting paid. The other house-elves, for example, were disgusted with the idea of being free and getting compensated for work other than food and board.

I know that it's a mental thing that the house-elves think it's alright to be treated that way, the same way some abused kids think it's normal and okay for being the way they were treated, but you can't just change everything straight away. They'll have breakdowns and they'll be confused.

Like, say you're a house-elf and you've been serving this family for decades. You've become attached to your Master, Mistress, and their children. You've come to love them as your own family and children, and you know them very well and would hate to part from them. They treat you well, they feed you, and you even have your own room. And then this person in the wizard government says that you've got to be free! That you're not allowed to be with your family anymore! That it's illegal for you to live with your family! That you can no longer be with them for the sake of being with them, and if your Master can't or doesn't want to give you wage, then you being with them is illegal and you'll be taken away.

You'd be devastated, heartbroken, and you'll be pissed at the human government for taking you away from your family. You'll be sad and angry that you're being paid when you /don't want to be paid/, because then it's employer and employee, not being a part of the family.

Yeah, slavery's wrong. I know this but think of it from their perspective. House-elves aren't human but they have feelings, too.

**** I think your heart is in the right place, but I am not sure, you go in the right direction. What about this plan of action:

- Ask Hermione to do actual research (it is weird, that she would have hard time to do that); yes, even if library material is crap, and house-elves could be brainwashed, it is still worthy to ask them.

- One of my suspicions is that house-elves actually are not humans, so their psychology can work different way. What if they are truly more like intelligent animals (no offence meant, something like talking animals in Narnia)? When you push your dog of many years on the streets, does it mean you have liberated him or did you abandon him instead?

- Whatever the false consciousness, the first thing which you can probably agree even with enslaved house-elves is that torture of other house-elves is something to be avoided (even if he cannot admit his own master tortures him, he can agree that torturing others is wrong). So, point your campaign at least for now towards abandoning cruelty towards them. Be more in line with The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals than The Pennsylvania Abolition Society (or William Wilberforce; it is strange that Hermione never mentioned him, although it had to be her wet dream to follow in his steps).

Because all it takes for them to be treated horribly is one single change in ownership. That's one of the horrors of slavery people often forget. It's not just the physical abuse that happens - it's the threat of such abuse, and worse.

All it takes to be separated from your family forever is one decision of your owner. Who would dare to resist - or even frown where the master might see them - when they are mere property? Sure, they might be treated well right now, almost part of the family - but what if that changes? What if the master thinks they can't be trusted? That they aren't happy to serve?

"Oh, yes, all those elves are so happy to be slaves" - of course they are. If they aren't happy, if they don't shun Dobby, they might be sold to a cruel master. Or otherwise punished. Everyone knows what happens to bad elves, after all.

"But they wouldn't lie to Harry Potter, would they?" Sure, they'll tell Harry - or anyone, especially Hermione - that they aren't happy - and the kid goes and tells the Headmaster, and then they'll be known as a bad elf, and if the Headmaster changes, they'll be still known as a bad elf.

"But Hermione wouldn't tell anyone if you tell her" - sure. Until someone makes her say. Or she slips up and betrays them without meaning to. Or another elf betrays them to prove that they are a good elf who would never want to be free or cover for bad elves.

The idea that you could trust slaves to tell you how they really feel about slavery is bullshit while they are slaves. Especially if you're a kid without any power at all to protect them, much less set them free.

Dobby is an exception not because he wants to be free but because he dares to tell others.

So... This presents the biggest problem, how are the elves to communicate? The rare elf wants to be free, I find out as their master, I tell them specifically to not communicate or signal to anyone in any way that the want to be free. Indistinguishable from an elf that does not want to be free.

The lack of freedoms and choices are, for sapient beings, inherently harmful. That's why prison is the main punishment in society- limiting someone's freedom is the most damaging way to hurt them. The pain of a beating or smacking goes away, but the removal of freedom has psychological consequences. It's why slavery of other sapient beings is pretty much universally frowned upon. However, irl the only sapient beings who exist are humans. In the Wizarding World, there are many. It doesn't make it morally ok to enslave any of those groups.

"Most people wouldn't beat their slaves" isn't an argument for slavery being okay. It's an argument that humans think they should be praised for doing the bare fucking minimum in terms of being a decent person.

See, I massively disagree with this assesment of what she was trying to convey with Hermione and elves. I have always interpreted the books as Hermione was right. Wizarding culture is resistant to change, very conservative and traditional. They needed someone like Hermione to put a rocket up their arses.

There's a couple of quite clear "morals of the story" where the message is clearly "Hermione was right about elves." Ron, the ringleader of the "SPEW mockery", finally comes round to seeing elves as individuals who deserve choice, and that is the point where, not only does Hermione fall properly in love with him, but the reader sees his final character development and maturity. Additionally, Sirius dies because he continued to treat Kreacher like crap- if he hadn't physically booted him out of the room whilst yelling at him, no loophole would have been created by which Kreacher was able to plot with Bellatrix and Narcissa. Hermione told Sirius to be kind to Kreacher, he ignored her. It was his downfall.

I went into this whole thing in more detail further up if you CBA!

I agree that JKR creates a society that accepts slavery. I reject the interpretation that she provides justification. Describing something is not condoning it, and it was always clear to me, even as a child, that /Hermione is right on this issue/ and that was meant to be the message of the sub plots around elves.

I agree that this was probably what JKR was thinking, esp w/ Hermione being her "self-insert" character. And I can see that she was headed that way, she just massively missed the mark for me. Ron /does/ come around, but he just says something like "we don't want any more elves dying for us like Dobby." That's like, bare minimum for being a moral person in my book. And Harry also does take her advice about being nice to Kreacher, but it's framed more as "see? Sirius was mean to Kreacher, so Kreacher killed him. Harry is nice to Kreacher, so Kreacher helps him and is happy to serve him," which just rubs me the entirely wrong way. Just be nice to your slaves! I'm an American in the South, I can see where this is going. Why634 above is right on the money.

JKR just started off on the wrong foot with me and there was no way to recover. She went out of her way to include slavery, where the brownies myth does not go that way. Brownies have agency, and they can leave a household if they're disrespected, even tear shit up before they leave. But JKR turned it into slavery, then made her world justify it by saying the elves liked being enslaved, /then/ made every sympathetic character except for Hermione be positive to neutral on the subject, */then/* made Hermione's abolitionist actions look like "radical SJW" stuff through the eyes of every other sympathetic character. I did read your comment above, and I like your analysis of how each character came to their conclusions on house elves. But in the end, none of them wanted to free the elves. Molly wanted a slave. Dumbledore owned slaves. He paid a couple employees, but he owned way more. In no way do I think JKR condones slavery, but that denouncement didn't come across for me in the books. If even /one/ other character had come around to agreeing that house elves needed to be free (preferably Harry vis a vis Kreacher), then I could look at this plot line a lot more favorably. I could see it as Hermione putting a rocket up the wizarding world's ass, and after the last chapter (epilogue? what epilogue?) she would go on to fulfill her life's work of helping oppressed peoples. But as it stands, it looks like Hermione is the Lone Sane Woman in a hellscape of a society where no one will ever actually agree with abolishing slavery, because why would they? The rules of the books they're in say slavery is a-okay.

See, again I'm not quite sure that's right. I don't think the rules of the books say slavery is ok - the moral of the books is very much the opposite of that. The rules of the society depicted in the books say that, but we are meant to think that that society is wrong.

Hermione is indeed the Only Sane Woman here (tbh I think Dumbledore agrees with her but his age and understanding of when to pick his battles is telling) - but she's so clearly SANE where everyone else is utterly mad on this one that I can't get my head around why everyone thinks there's any kind of apologies for slavery in the books. The reader is meant to side with the radical..

  Molly wanted a slave.

Oh man this is always number two on my list of "reasons Molly Weasley sucks." See also her attitude to Fleur (for being foreign and part veela), her behaviour towards Hermione in GoF, the way she treats Sirius in his own home... She's not respectful of other /humans/ let alone elves. Of course she wouldn't think twice about owning a sapient being! People seem to come away with the idea that the Weasleys were this radical family because they got dragged into the Order via their friendship with Harry and it's just not the case. The first scene we meet Ron he basically says how ashamed the family is of their squib relative. Arthur is meant to be the Ministry's leading expert on Muggles but he doesn't even know how to say "electricity." That's like, idk, being the British governments expert on the United States and not knowing how the electoral college works or something. The Weasleys are a product of an insular, traditional, bigoted society and it shows. Nice people, but not radicals and not particularly critical thinkers or comfortable outside of their own sphere.

** The main issue I see for houseelves being free ( and why I think the house elves were against Hermione's idea) was what happens after they are freed?

What are they allowed to do ? What will society allow them to do? Dobby was free fully free he could supposedly do anything he wanted but he chose to do the exact same job he was doing before only he got paid. So either the biggest desire he had was to be paid to continue to do the same work that he had a miserable time with before, or this is the only thing the Wizarding society lets him do. I think the latter more likely.

So if thats the case what happens if they are freed? Well they have to look for the same work again. And they may not be taken back. Hogwarts say is the best case scenario. There are many houseelves so they aren't overworked and they are treated well by their boss. If they are freed they risk having to work for a worse boss someone more like Lucius.

And they potentially loose their home ( in this case hogwarts). Let's say though Dumbledore now says ok I will pay all the houselves ill free them all then pay them all. Well he is probably paying them through the school. He maybe can use his own money for one houself. But all? He will likely have to pay them through the school. And now you have complaints why did the tuition bill go up we want to see a itemized list. And maybe there are many reasons why it could have but people zero in on house elves. Why are we paying for house elves ? He wouldn't be in the majority if he wanted to pay them .

If they refuse to pay house elves and the only way house elves can make it in society is serve wizards, then or course freedom starts to look scary. To truly free house elves there has to be more of a societal change in regards to them. Give them more options. Make paying them mandatory. Make sure they can't just get ignored by society. Once being free is a realistic option for them they probably will like it.

This is all hypothetical I don't know the actual reasons houseelves don't want to be freed. But before freeing them people should know why. That way the fears they have about being free can be handled. If you just free them before understanding why they see freedom as bad and working to change that sentiment you aren't being helpful. Hermione's goal was never flawed just her process imo.
