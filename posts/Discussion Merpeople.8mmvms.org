As far as I know, we only have a single named merperson in the entire series, and as a whole not a lot is said about them. What are they like? What sort of naming conventions or customs do they have?

Are there any fics that explore this facet of the wizarding world?

Do any of you have interesting headcanon or theories etc to share?


** The [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MermaidProblem][mermaid problem]] is indeed an age-old conundrum. Futurama had an original solution, however:

** My headcanon is that merpeople are basically just ordinary humans that ate Gillyweed on a regular basis for so long that the effects became permanent and now they can't actually get out of the water. Also a general headcanon is that magical creatures follow the rules of Lamarckian evolution, rather than Darwinian principles, so this sort of thing would have been a fairly common occurrence.

Why were they eating Gillyweed so often? Any number of economic reasons: clams, pearls, kelp, various fish eggs, even the ooze on the lake bottom would have been valuable commodities and maybe holding a bubblehead charm for that long is too strenuous for most magical fishermen to do.

*** Mine's not too far from that, but I presumed all the magical creatures /were/ just Lamarckian evolution; e.g. ancient wizards whose collective informal magic slowly mutated them into forms that better enabled their lifestyles. Elves became small and fleet-footed with an affinity for Apparition because they were a tribe that lived near predators, Goblins were cave-dwelling carvers, etc.

So in my view Merpeople would just have spontaneously become water-dwellers at some point in the Paleolithic because they were, indeed, a kin of divers and fishermen. It had however not occurred to me they might have taken too much Gillyweed, though it /is/ a funny idea, because Gillyweed /only/ makes you grow gills and flippers; it doesn't make you grow a fish-tail...

** I never really thought about it before, but it's something to think about.

- I guess I think of the Merfolk as more tolerant of wizards, and by extent humans in general, than centaurs or goblins are.

- The Chieftess made it clear to Dumbledore that Harry only was delayed in completing the Second Task because Harry wanted to make sure all four hostages were brought to safety. So this indicates that the Merfolk are capable of looking at the "small picture," while centaurs are more concerned with the "big picture."

- They're secretive and quick to take offense, but also more willing to compromise and reconsider.

- They hate Moaning Myrtle with a passion. And the Giant Squid, none of them like the Giant Squid.

- While they can only speak Mermish above the water, they're actually accomplished playwrights. They love art, as it gives them a sense of community.

- Their family ties provide a contrast to the cultish clan of centaurs who kill "traitors" without hesitation.

** I only have one tiny, nit-picking piece of headcanon.

They. Are. Called. Merfolk!

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** I don't find them interesting at all because they are neither useful allies nor difficult to take down (explosions are far more devastating under water). Their mobility on land is severely limited and unless you write a Subnautica crossover, they will be a gimmick at most.

That's not saying that writing important merefolk characters is impossible, but usually that has them important on a personal level (hurt/comfort, love interest) and not the fact that they are maritime humanoids.
