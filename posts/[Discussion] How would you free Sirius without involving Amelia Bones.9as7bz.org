** Harry is the Boy-Who-Lived, Minister Fudge is incredibly vain, simply phrase it as “he's never had a trial, if you give him one and he's guilty then you're seen to be serving justice; if he's innocent major bump in approval ratings from freeing an innocent man”

** There doesn't seem to be systematic checks and balances in the wizarding world. As the minister, Fudge has broad executive powers.

If the evidence is there (pettigrew), Fudge can have him released.

** At the end of POA, as long as Harry had Wormtail, there would be enough evidence to exonerate Sirius. Fudge was still trying to curry favor with BWL at that time, and Dumbledore was also vouching for Sirius (forget those fanon manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledore). Fudge could score lots of political brownie points by correcting a 'major mistake of the previous administration'.

Didn't Dumbledore fuck up the whole "everyone is entitled to due process" part of his job? Or at the very least, find out why his Private Army was betrayed?

**** Firstly we don't know if Dumbledore was even chief warlock at the time

Secondly there is no reason to think that his job involves making sure that everyone is entitled to "due process" or that what was done to Sirius wasn't perfectly legal in the Wizarding World.

In fantastic beasts the DMLE head was perfectly within his rights to order an execution without trial. And from what we see in OoTP, where a minor is summoned to before the Wizengamont and Fudge attempts to try him in absentia by changing the trial time at the last moment, we can assume that "due process" in Wizarding Britain is very different from the muggle world.

As to finding out why his Army was betrayed, while many people would want to find out why he did it, it's pretty normal to not want to see someone who did something so foul.

** Fake identity after he breaks out. Bribe some official in Muggle Eastern Europe to create some records, use them to apply for British Citizenship and use magic to speed up that process (compulsion charms on the forms or something like that).

If we are talking about "out of Azkaban", have Harry, a celebrity of national fame, make public announcements on that matter. Even if just a fraction of the people start asking questions, you have reached your goal because that should start a chain reaction.

** Logically, the most straight forward ways would be:

- Harry see Pettigrew on the Marauder's Map, either overreacts and jumps the gun or runs to McGonagall/Dumbledore (a lot like in canon actually). Of course Dumbledore would know the political and legal ramifications, so he would either need to be clever and find some technicality. Example, the fact that Ministry never held an open trial negates all legal declarations, forcing the Ministry to release him into someone's custody (lets say Lupin or something). Thats the way Dumbledore deals with them in OOTP: find the loopholes and tighten them on the bureaucrats necks.
- Some relative of the Blacks gets worried because Sirius is the heir and with his death their property/money would pass to other families or maybe be claimed by the goblins and Ministry. Prince of Slytherin actually did something sort of similar, though with different motivations. It also seems in line with the Blacks characterization: your lineage comes before anything else, and even a blood traitor can still breed for their noble house (yeah I know).

Most feasible ways involve some sort of powerhouse, either 1) Dumbledore (duh) 2) a member of the pureblood class or a conglomerate that wields not insignificant political acumen to put the screws to the Ministry or 3) some powerful OC (or Grindelwald, because why not) that comes out of nowhere and blindsides the Ministry folk. Point is, you need some counter-force to the Ministry.

What I would like to see though?

- Lupin gets his shit together and puts together a rag-tag team of former 70s Hogwarts students to break in "The Rock" style. I just need to figure out who will be Sean Connery...
- A full on assault on Azkaban to break down the prison. Dumbledore storms the place and lays low all the guards (Dumbledore: Despair is no threat to one carried on the wings of a phoenix/Let us see who is truly 'Demented'). Yeah.

** I would have harry (This being a "snarky" harry) tell Rita Skeeter to look into the events surrounding Sirius' imprisonment. I would have harry hint that it wasn't what it seems, and that fudge is covering up the mistakes of his predecessor. The bit about fudge purely being so Rita has a target for her, unique style. Rita takes care of the rest, digging up the info, getting it to the public, shaming the people in power to the point that, as fudge puts it, they have to "be seen doing something". That is how I would do it.

*OR*

Why did Fred and George never realize that Ron was always with someone named Peter along with Harry and Hermione and go tell a teacher. You think They'd look out for their younger brother more.

*** Peter's smell? Why should he recognize it? Do you mean that he should have stronger senses because he is a werewolf? If so, that's entirely fanon. As for Remus seeing Peter in Hagrid's hut, Remus was most probably focused on Harry whenever he checked the map, and Harry doesn't visit Hagrid every day.

** - Grab a Death Eater\\
- Give him Polyjuice to appear as Sirius
- Stage a duel between Harry and poly-Sirius in the middle of Hogsmeade, with the poly-Sirius Confunded or Imperiused to attack Harry
- Harry kills poly-Sirius - he won't change back into his own shape if the potion was still active when he died (reference: Mrs. Crouch dies in Azkaban while Polyjuiced as her son. No one sees her revert).
- Sirius can return to society as a different guy entirely. Harry will inherit all his stuff, so it won't be a huge sacrifice for Mr.... Pink.

EDIT: Slightly more complicated but more reliable version: immediately kill poly-Sirius, then stage the fight with Tonks acting in Sirius' stead, but when Harry hits 'Sirius' with the 'final blow', it's messy enough for them to pull a switch between her body and the poly-Sirius corpse.
