Really need to have gut wrenching moments to clean up my tear ducts. Give me long ass drama and angst that'll leave me crying, shriveled up from the unfairness of the world, and dead inside.

Please no harem. Slash/Femslash is welcome unless there's too much smut which would put me off too much. Actually, don't recommend anything that has too much smut. I need to be punched in the face, not have my libido running.

Of course, if you think a fic would literally punch me in the face more than it'll turn me off from the harem or smut, feel free to just recommend it.

Thanks.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** Linkffn(the pureblood princess)

To me is a top ten angst fic. If you decide you cannot abide by this Daphne then that is what it is and sticking with it probably wont pay off. But if you like her or can even just stand her than i think the angst is so worth it.

I really liked this Daphne so the fic consumed me, i couldnt stop, so i read the whole thing in one sitting. Then i wallowed in a hole for a few days.
