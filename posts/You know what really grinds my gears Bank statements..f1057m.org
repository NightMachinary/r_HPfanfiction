Specifically, fanfics where Dumbledore not giving Harry his goddamn banking paperwork when he was at the Dursley's is treated like some horrible crime. Who in the blue hell gives a child account reports? Please end this trope.


** There's not even any reason to think Gringotts would send out 'bank statements' to anyone, child or not. In canon, it's more like a bunch of underground safety deposit boxes where wizards store gold and valuables than an actual bank that intermediates between savers and borrowers.

Might just be the protection, since even Lucius Malfoy had his manor raided, and the stone was stored there for a while, but it's hard to believe that the Blacks would yield to the Ministry if they tried to raid, and if Voldemort could break in, so could Dumbledore so Horcruxes ought not to be stored there.

What exactly is "Mote" supposed to mean?

In it's modern form, a mote is literally just a spec of dust.

In it's archaic form, it means "may" or "might", both meant as synonyms to maybe, so it blatantly doesn't make sense to use this as any sort of oath, nevermind the butchering of using archaic English for a spell in a magic system that has generally been shown to use faux latin.

This makes no sense. It's called Gringotts Bank, not Gringotts Gold Storage. If it didn't provide banking services, it wouldn't be called a bank. Just because canon Harry never used services of the bank doesn't make it any less of a bank.

**** Banks didn't give interest on savings accounts for a very long time (mostly due to religious reasons) in the western world. It was started, for the most part, in the late 1800's. It is completely believable they didn't deal with this. Especially with people literally born in the 1800's still kicking around, and a super conservative system.

That said, no mention of religion one way or another, so who knows if usury limited it, or something else. However I would like to point out safety deposit boxes are a banking service. Which costs money, rather than gives.

I also wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if Gringotts gives loans, another banking service.

***** If we'd be going off of more historical banking practices, then Gringotts should be heavily focused around loans I'd say. Otherwise, if they're just a bunch of vaults, there's really no reason to call that a bank. It's not like wizards move around enough around the globe to want to have the convenience of letters of exchange or taking money out at a local goblin bank office, should that even exist.

And depending on how goblins are portrayed, I could easily see them keeping abreast of what's happening financially in the Muggle world, too. That's not a given - but I don't know if they'd just be happy stopping their banking services at 17th century ones when there's a lot more out there now.

Authors seem to forget that the conflict between Wizards and Goblins is not just because Wizards are not polite with Goblins. Goblins are racist assholes who hate Wizards, and remembering a specific Goblin will not make him devoted to you.\\
With this in mind, I just can't see Goblins do investment or loans. The only outcome I can see for a Wizard letting a Goblin use his money for investment is a smiling Goblin explaining him that, "sadly", they did some bad investment and so all his money is gone. And, since he doesn't have any money left, they closed his account and he should now leave before they throw him away. As for loan, they would just pray that a wizard can't pay back, so they have a reason to use violence on him.

He could've tried to intervene to make them treat Harry better. Heck, the fact that "a few days every summer vacation" is enough means that he could've easily arranged for Harry to go to some muggle boarding school starting at quite a young age and only go home on the weekends.

This would explain why Harry was never killed or kidnapped there, and why Harry says the Dursleys would only become accessible to Death Eaters /after/ the protection fell.

Another school would not only be outside this protection, but wouldn't have the protection that Hogwarts did. Well, the protection Hogwarts /should've/ had.

** Am I the only one who had to get those statements himself when I was a child?

I got some 500 bucks gifted at a religious celebration when I was ~10 and so my parents set up an account. I had to get statements every 3 months from a machine at the bank, and even though I did absolutely nothing with them other than put them into a folder, I still had those statements. I didn't even use a ATM card until seven years later, but the statements were a regular chore.

** In the UK, a special account can be opened for children from 11 years old. From 11 to 15 years old the account is very uptight and managed by the guardians and the child in second. From 16 years old the child become the first manager of the account. So with only that as Parameter Harry should receive a copy of his bank statements in the integral form from his entry in the magical word. But he should be aware of it before that, be it by his true guardians ( as the Dursleys are muggle it would fail to the one that has placed Harry in their custody Albus Dumbledore as legal guardian in the magical word or by some form of excerpt from the bank statements. For emancipation, the UK has in their criteria besides the common a limit of 14 years old below that emancipation is not open to debate before the Court. So Harry could attempt to be recognised as emancipated at 14 years old by the Courts or some others laws.

***** I don't see the relevance of that? Are you arguing Harry's paperwork should've gone to the Dursleys as his guardians? I'm actually not sure what happens if the account is set up by someone other than the child's parents; in Wizarding Britain, I could see statements not necessarily going to the child's guardian in that case either.

****** I'm saying that because your parents set up the account, have their names on the account, and handle all of it until they handed it over to you. Harry just inherited it, he has no parents to deal with it. Maybe Gringotts doesn't send things to Muggles, maybe they did and the Durselys saw Wizard and threw it out. Maybe complaining about bank statements, from a bank of all things, is idiotic.

** I don't think it's the bank account statements that are the problem. I mean what kid or person learning about their weath wouldn't first think but my life would have been easier if I had the money. Especially with the Dursleys never buying Harry new anything. The over the line is when Dumbledore withdraws money to fund the Order. Or when there was payments being made to Dursleys for the care of Harry.

** I think this is just part of Evil!Dumbledore.

I mean, there are valid arguments against utilitarian (if you think that's Dumbledore's approach) and paternalistic (if you read Dumbledore more like this) ethics but Dumbledore critiques usually aren't bothered with these positions. They're usually much more about taking every single thing Dumbledore's done and using it to show that he's a piece of shit. (And there may be other interpretations of Dumbledore, too. Mostly I think we're meant to see him as a good guy because Harry never thinks Dumbledore tried to harm him. That's most of the way to paternalism.)

That being said... people have very different relationships with money. I didn't have a bank account, for example, until I was 18 (well, technically, I think there was one earlier due to a compensation payout but we never saw any of that). Whereas, and I know it's fictional, I seem to recall the main character in Dark Places (an orphan) gets periodic updates throughout her childhood about a trust.

So, what I guess I'm saying is that if you were taking a very undeveloped critique of Dumbledore it may not seem /that/ weird to point out that Harry grew up thinking he was wholly dependent on the Dursleys. It's another thing that Dumbledore hid from Harry and therefore it must be a bad thing.

(I suppose there might be fics which really do use very radical ethical standards deliberately, I just doubt it. For one thing, it's hard to get people to disagree with the idea that "there's a time and a place for X". Once you accept that idea, and almost everyone does, then you don't accept the radical ethics of the kind I'm euphemistically are saying are "undeveloped".)

** I'm currently reading the cupboard series and I like how much more subtly it's done in that. No ridiculous bank statements with billions of galleons and 5 new head of house titles or acting like not being told is the worst thing in the world but still a Harry who finds out more about his money and meets a goblin account manager, and blames Dumbledore for leaving him at the Dursley's but not for keeping his banking secret.

Also it takes the usual ‘oh this trunk shop sells all these fancy trunks with flats in them, better buy one now as an 11 year old' trope and instead has a more sensible Harry who's like ‘okay I'll just get one with a bit of extra space for books and quidditch supplies'

**** Also warning that I've read more now and it does follow some of the gringotts related tropes (like Harry being friendly with goblins like no one else is) and the Dumbledore bashing gets worse but I still think the first ‘book' managed the gringotts stuff better than many fics, I haven't had to read through bank statements of basically unlimited money and Harry hasn't yet acquired any newfound titles.
