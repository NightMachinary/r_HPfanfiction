**** I liked it, vampires and werewolves and witches oh my.

And despite popular opinion you don't need to watch the Vampire Diaries to understand it

**** It's pretty good, but not incredible.

/Much/ better than The Vampire Diaries imo. It's spinoff, Legacies, is also good.

I don't think you need to watch The Vampire Diaries for either of those, though you'd likely be less attached to the characters than someone who had. Definitely watch The Originals and /then/ Legacies, though.

** A. The werewolf would never do that considering their endemic mistrust towards non-werewolves.

B. The healer would just have to call the Department for the Control of Magical Creatures to be there at the next appointment.

*** Well, in this particular case, the werewolf doesn't want to lose the baby, and doesn't want to risk her own life into the bargain.

**** Sure, but she'd be more likely to go to other werewolves who've probably also had babies, or at the very least an individual who's openly sympathetic to werewolves for a reference.
