#+TITLE: (No upvote or downvote) Can anyone tell me where Dumbledore goes “You must learn to forgive my boy/Harry” comes from? It seems like a common trope alongside pup, cub, my boy, etc, that appears in tons of stories.

** I never understood the "Dumbledore tries to forgive everyone" thing in basically every fanfic. I mean, if you want to bash him, go ahead. But at least make him a stone cold bitch, not a delusional idiot who tries to redeem all Death Eaters and even Voldemort.

I mean, did everyone forget that Harry was the one who almost sympathized with a young Riddle while Dumbledore was like "nah fuck that guy"? I mean, the dude made a power play on a fucking eleven year old Riddle just because the literal kid gave off creepy vibes.

When Snape came to him for help, he berated the guy, made him beg, and only agreed to not attack him because of the patronus thing. Which can be interpreted as "Oh true love, Snape was a good guy, actually." or "Dumbledore has legit issues when it comes to love. Considering that the only person he ever loved caused his sister's death and then went on to help out the fucking Nazis, it's understandable that his view is kinda fucked up. Seeing a fascist who was obsessed with/loved one of the people his ideology deems less than human, it's not surprising that it touched a nerve with him." And I think the latter is much more interesting than "the abusive nazi is an angel because he wants to fuck the filthy mudblood". Either way, it doesn't justify Dumbledore's portrayal in fanfic.

Oh and how can we forget, this is the same dude who set up a fucking death trap for a bunch of eleven year olds. He legit placed a kid in a household where he knew he would at best be neglected, and didn't give a fuck no matter how much the kid clearly hated it. Everything Harry went through both at the Dursleys and Hogwarts, prepared him to sacrifice his own life, which was Albus' plan all along. Suspicious as fuck. And also cold as fuck.

Albus Dumbledore is not a demented old men who tries to put nazis in pretty dresses and excuse all their crimes. He is a cold motherfucker who is not afraid to send children and teens to their death if it means taking down the bad guy.

** Fanon, I think, but it could have something to do with Harry learning of Snape's actions and Dumbledore's reaction to it in The Seer Overheard in HBP. I haven't read that chapter as a whole in so long, so I don't know the particulars. I just remember how much I hate it.

Dumbledore himself likes to forgive and keep faith. I don't think he ever required Harry to do it.

Edit: my boy, in addition to Harry being skinny and short as a 1st-3rd yr, aren't fanon tropes. Some variation of my boy is said by a few characters a number of times, including Dumbledore.
