The Weasleys are supposed to be a big extended family of lots of blokes yeah? Why aren't there at least two or three Weasley cousins also at Hogwarts? I could easily see them in DA, and at the final battle too.

So, if anyone knows of any stories with extra Weasleys at Hogwarts, or wants to write one, I'd love to see it.

Preferably not crack, but I'll read that.


** Probably be an AU where everyone didn't die horribly ten years ago :/

*** No, we do see Weasley cousins in Bill and Fleur's wedding who weren't there before and who were never seen again.

**** The fanfic explanation is that Arthur is the youngest of all his brothers. And perhaps all his nephews or nieces have her to have children.

***** All his brothers, sure, but what about his cousins? Coming from a huge family, I've got about a hundred second cousins, and their ages are all over the place.

** There was one lovely story about Bill wandering through the Middle East looking for some enchanted city in (I think) Syria or somewhere there. Unfortunately, I cannot find it at the moment.

** Can't think of any fics, but it could be that the cousins are just older. They had a lot of kids and the cousins could easily be Bill and Charlie's age. When there's that much of a gap in ages in a big family there's a lot of people you don't even remember exist.

** We don't know that there aren't. We don't know the names of all the students at Hogwarts. I can believe there are some Slytherin Weasleys trying to avoid being associated with the poor blood-traitors.

*** We'd have heard about the other Weasleys though. Even if in the common room, or in DA. But I cant see slytherin weasleys. Ron in some crack shit, yes. But not as a group.

**** “We” in canon pretty much just means Harry, and he's not particularly observant. I can totally believe that Arthur has some blood-purist brothers with pureblood Slytherin kids who look down on their poverty-stricken blood traitor cousins. Why not?
