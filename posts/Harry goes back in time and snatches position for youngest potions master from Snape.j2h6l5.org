He goes back in time as a Peverell and makes his name as the youngest ever potion master in Europe which originally belonged to Snape and also takes the position of potions master in Hogwarts after Slughorn retires. He brought in a bunch of inventions like an amulet that reacts to the dark mark, a delivery box inspired from the vanishing cabinet which becomes a huge hit and he also gets a number of potion ingredients sellers, supplier and makers under his new company and with the delivery system makes huge profits. Despite his indirect efforts he can't prevent Voldemort from killing his parents and Frank but his actions keep Alice alive and Sirius and Marlene adopt Harry raise him as their own son. He later publishes all the potions he found in the books of the purebloods he had acquired in the future through conquest. He is also famed as a sadist when he punishes students with laps around the ground which would be increased if they couldn't answer. Also one of the prewett brothers ends up as minister of magic. (Yeah I'm not good at summaries)

  Wizard lack common sense. Hermione had declared that in their first year at Hogwarts. Well, even after the war, with Voldemort dead, wizards refused to change the things that were important to prevent events that led to the war in the first place to repeat themselves. Time for Harry to make sure, at the right time and place, to teach them.
