** Canonically, the reason why Hagrid can't just let Buckbeak loose is that it will be assumed he was complicit in the creature's escape. Buckbeak is able to be saved because Harry and Hermione help him escape while Hagrid is in the Minister's presence, after the Minister has seen Buckbeak chained up. In short: Hagrid needs a strong alibi.

** To quote one of my favourite fics:

#+begin_quote
  "Good heavens!" a portly witch screamed, dropping her shopping bags in horror. "It's Sirius Black! And Harry Potter!"

  "Harry Potter? Where?" Harry looked around frantically. "I don't see him anywhere!"

  "Oh," the witch flushed in embarrassment. "For a second I thought... you look just like him!"

  "Nonsense," Harry said pompously. "Harry Potter wears glasses. I don't have any glasses on, so obviously I'm not Harry Potter."

  "Exactly," Sirius said from beside him. "See, I may look like Sirius Black from a distance, but Sirius Black doesn't wear glasses, does he? Since I'm wearing glasses, I'm obviously not Sirius Black."

  "Of course, of course," the witch said quickly. "I'm so sorry, gentlemen! I don't know what came over me to make such a silly mistake."
