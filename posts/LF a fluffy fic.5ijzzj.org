I read enough action for now, so I'm looking for a fanfiction that completly focuses on the relationships between characters (while beeing kinda fluffy). It can include smut, I don't really care. Not the biggest fan of slash, but if it's well written I would read it too.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
