The thingy tells most

But i'll give some more info and also ONLY MY OPINION

-pairing Haphne or Harmony (my opinion for the best pairing. Doesn't have to be yours)

- animagus form

I don't care who is bashed as long as it is made decently

Not just like

Haarry mah boy yu mast go back to ur family teh blood warsd keep u safe, it's for the greater good harryy. Said Dumbledore

the blood wards weren't even made right lol. And then Harry waves his hands and the dumb door has died

No. That is just carp so please atleast decent bashing

ALL OF THE ABOVE IS STILL MY OPINION. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE YOURS

Thanks if you do actually recommend something.


** linkffn(paid in blood) ? I'm not sure what exactly you are looking for so I'm just gonna throw that out there

  After decades of an empty life and wars that claimed all he ever held dear, the greatest dark lord in living memory and his most loyal servant are finally ready to challenge fate and once again bring down their vengeance upon their enemies. AU, extended universe, Time-Travel, bashing and HAPHNE.

** linkffn(THe Mind Arts; Gothic by Brennus; Harry Potter et al and the Keystone Council)

All have pretty smart Harry's, and Keystone has 2 really smart ones (it has 5 total different Harry's there)

They're also really good fics. No pairings in Keystone yet.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
