  “Hang on!” barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter. “You didn't tell us where that maniac's escaped from! What use is that? Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!”
#+end_quote

Does anyone know a story (preferably one-shot) where Vernon and other muggles actually ring up the police or news studio or et-cetera to ask just /where/ Sirius Black escaped from? Presumably one that snowballs when (for example) discrepancies in muggle police records and court records relating to Sirius are found?


** Based on plot requirements, ALL characters were dumbed down in the story, although adults were generally the ones holding the idiot ball.

If the good guys had been slightly more competent and less negligent, we would have had *Petrification Proliferation* instead.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.
