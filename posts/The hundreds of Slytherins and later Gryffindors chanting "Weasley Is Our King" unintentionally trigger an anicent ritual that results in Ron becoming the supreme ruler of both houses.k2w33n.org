** At once hundreds of students, mostly Gryffindor's and Slytherins but most of Hogwarts in fact including many representatives of the sacred 28 were cheering the same phrase "Weasley is our king".

You see despite being supposedly a list of the families of the purest blood, the sacred 28 was more a political list, hence Harry's grandfather Henry Potter being excluded for his extreme position that wizards should be engageing in muggle hunting as it was a cruel and unnecessary sport. In addition there was the inclusion of the Ollivander's, despite Garrick Ollivander having a muggle born mother and having been prior to the finalization of the list, equally the Malfoy's had several half bloods in their family tree taking the pragmatic view they would rather marry talented halfbloods than condemn themselves to obscurity with inbreeding, of course given the current political situation Lucius Malfoy would strenously deny this if challenged. The Weasley's themselves had only been included due to more recent marriages with the Blacks and the authors own desire to not offend the Blacks for while purebloods the Weasley's suffered from the same delusions as Henry Potter, ie that muggles were people too.

The sacred 28 were now considered an anacronism now, a list of names for pride but who had little power. But that was not the original intention of Cantankerous Nott, he wished for the sacred 28, the true purebloods to rule and through long forgotten oaths these families still held some power over Magical Britian though they largely remained ignorant of it.

Except the grandson of Cantankerous Nott, who was only rumoured to have compiled the list, this rumour though was true and Theodore Nott could not believe what he was seeing.

The entire school chanting "Weasley is our king" meaning Ron Weasley, the idiot in his class who never paid attention and hung around with Harry Potter. He did some quick maths, Gaunt and Crouch were both extinct, Prewetts too, as there was no male line those that existed with Prewett blood were all Weasleys, another two of the sacred 28 confined to Azkaban for lift and thus excluded from voting that discounted the Blacks and the Lestranges, as both brothers and the wife were sent to Azkaban for life, the fact they had escaped likely wouldn't affect much. That made the sacred 28 the sacred 23 and there were representatives of many families at Hogwarts,

Hannah Abbott, Milicant Bulstrode, the Carrow twins, Eustance Fawley, Daphne and Astoria Greengrass, Nevilla Longbottom, Ernie Macmilliam, Draco Malfoy, Pansy Parkinson, Professor Slughorn, Ginny Weasley. That was 11. 12 would be needed to be a majority, one more member of a sacred 28 family to cheer Weasley is our king and Ronald Weasley would be King of magical Britian. Knowing this Theodore Nott should have kept his mouth shut.

Unfortunately, or fortunately given your point of view, Theo Nott was not too keen on being a death eater, he had been all for blood purity, until he saw his father crawling on his belly to kiss the robes of that twisted creature, this was their dark lord? He prefered the dark ways but not at any price. So Theodore Nott, despite thinking Ronald Weasley was moron, at least knew he was a well intentioned moron and raised his voice and loudly proclaimed "Weasley is our King".

And that is how the sixth son of Arthur and Molly Weasley, who was used to being compared to his high acheiving elder brothers and his extremely famous best friend, became King of Magical Britain.

/I don't have any more for this really might be tempted to make it a fic when I'm done with nano though. I like to think Ron would have turned out to be a pretty good King eventually though (but lets be real Hermione would have done most of the work). I made him King of magical Britain not just Hogwarts because I think its funnier./

**** I've recently got back into fanfic (mostly HP and FMA though I'm writing some Supernatural and Good omens stuff too).

I'll put this in my drafts folder and hopefully get to it at some point in December (my workload is going to be super busy this month so by the time I'm done I might be too tired and it might have to be January). If it gets anywhere I'll post a link.
