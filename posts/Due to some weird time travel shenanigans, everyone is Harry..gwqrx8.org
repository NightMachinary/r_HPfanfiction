** I've actually wondered this myself. Due to a quirk of fate, the universe finds itself seriously lacking in souls. In fact, there is only one left, the MOD.

While the gods can roll back the universe to an earlier point, they cant restore the destroyed souls to the people who possessed them. However, they copy souls and shove them into new bodies all the time.

So, HPs soul gets copied billions of times, until everyone on earth is Harry.

While they may not have his memories, they all have his morals. World piece ensues.
