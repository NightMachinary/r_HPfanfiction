** Yes, by god yes. Especially if it's like, Sirius and Harry. I can imagine it now, "Harry, it's time to cook." Yeah, that'd be cool. Wait, no, Snape and Harry. Or Dumbledore and Harry. But this Harry is addicted to something. And it's not sex.

*** Whom have we seen secretly brewing brewing potions they weren't supposed to in the last place one should brew complex potions? Hint: the name begins with "H" and ends with "ermione".

It should definitely be Hermione, who is trying to live a double life in which she is a respectable member of society, and Harry, who's more of a streetwise wheeler-and-dealer.

***** He's the main character only in canon and even then only because Voldemort chose him to be the main character and so the whole setting is written around him. For a fanfic that, at least on its face, has nothing to do with Voldemort, Harry's just another somewhat impulsive, academically above-average bloke bound for the Quiddich league. Hermione, on the other hand, is intrinsically driven to excel, to scheme, to change the world whether the world wants it or not, and has a ruthless streak a mile wide.

A Harry-centric fic without Voldemort and related prophecy either has to rewrite Harry's personality and talents from scratch or create some other set of extrinsic circumstances to effectively force him to be the protagonist. Hermione, on the other hand, would make plenty of trouble in any setting without extrinsic pressure.

****** ... It doesn't matter. What you're talking about, that is. You'd have to rewrite Hermorgorermione's personality, too. She's not a drug dealer/cooker. All in all, it's whoever the author chooses. Sure, Hemanermione is smart, but her parents are dentists. You'd have to change them to change her, along with changing her peers and other things. Harry, on the other hand, would be easier. Just up the abuse from the Durshits, have Sirius-eerieus find Harpy (who ran away from the Fursleys) and, like, have a situation where they both see how much money they can make from meth (selling to fuggles and wizards) and they learn meth, then make meths. E-z.

******* Sure it matters. Whereas you do need to change Harry (by making Dursleys worse) or give him a sane-yet-mischevious Sirius, there's no need to change Hermione or her upbringing. If Hermione can be convinced that the cause is just, there is basically no rule or moral principle she won't break.

In this case, just give her a reason to need to make a lot of money in a few months quickly, and make sure that it's for a very good cause. Her dentist parents are a plus, not a minus: she'd grow up overhearing a lot about break-in attempts at the practice and other drug-seeking behavior.

Or, Sort her into Ravenclaw or Slytherin, and have her discover that with their academic hypercompetitiveness, use and abuse of mind-enhancing potions is ubiquitous; and as the best in her year in Potions, people keep asking her to help them with that. At first, she does it as a favor. Then, something happens and she really needs the money...

And that's without even taking her out of Hogwarts.

******** But it doesn't, because it's an AU. And also, break-ins don't happen often at every single dentistry in the world. Besides, it all depends on how the story works. This is a fun debate and it can go either way, but it all depends on the author. And the voices in the author's head. Oh, and they could, like, sell meth and then sell stuff that reverses the effects of meth. Something like that.

********* There are AUs, and then there are AUs. [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6i0ab8/how_many_deviations_from_canon_before_you_consider_a_fic_youre_reading_a_ba/dj2nllh?context=3][I wrote a whole philosophical post on it earlier.]]. The short of it, consistency with canon in fanfics is a bit like realism in "original" stories: if you break it, there needs to be a good reason for it.

Break-ins don't happen very often, but drug-seeking behavior certainly does, and it doesn't have to be at their practices for them to talk about it.

*** Yeah, a little bit. But it's not the main thing. And it's not meth, it's opium (or heroin. You can make different drugs from poppies).
