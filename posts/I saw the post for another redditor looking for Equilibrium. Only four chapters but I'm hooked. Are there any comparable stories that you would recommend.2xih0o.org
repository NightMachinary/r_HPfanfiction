#+TITLE: I saw the post for another redditor looking for Equilibrium. Only four chapters but I'm hooked. Are there any comparable stories that you would recommend?

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1883784/chapters/4058439][Equilibrium]] link for those interested, the premise being the characters are normal, everyday people with jobs and lives in the real world and spend a large portion of their time playing a virtual reality game.

***** Well equilibrium is unbeta'd according to her profile so it isn't on ffnet. Some of the ficts she has on AO3 are on ffnet but only after they have properly edited. Not a bad plan, tbh.
