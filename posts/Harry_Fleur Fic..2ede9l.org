Im looking for some Harry/Fleur fics that are complete and over 100k words long. If it has a sequel the sequel needs to be finished or having been updated in the past month (not abandoned at all.) Please don't post unfinished or abandoned fics.

fledge's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1139268/1/The-Secret-Diary-of-Fleur-Delacour-aged-16-34][The Secret Diary]] (the first notable story of this pairing)

Perspicacity wrote one that's complete but under 90k words, so not linking it.

*** Fair warning: sequels to Wastelands of Time and The Secret Diary (and Pers's fic) aren't complete, so you may wish to avoid them. Also, jbern didn't start the sequel promised for TLIL.

**** Fair warning: I started the sequel to my fic, posted six or so chapters, and got spammed with loads of negative reviews, several bordering on the psychotic, convincing me that my time was better spent elsewhere. I actually have a complete, 112k word sequel, but won't be posting it. I put a synopsis in my author notes if anyone cares.

***** It's quite odd, that nearly every great fanfiction author that I've read(with the exception of Commander Argus) stops writing fanfiction because of loonies threatening them and trying to track the author down. I'd almost say that it was all coordinated so only bad writers keep posting, but that would be assuming that crazy people are capable of working together.

****** The first draft was complete and I had made it through five chapters (including prologue) of revising and posting them. It takes me about as long to revise and polish a chapter as it does to write the first draft. There was a lot of work left to polish the remainder, time that I was convinced was better spent writing something else instead.

**** Just an FYI, if anyone's interested. Joe actually recently posted part of a new chapter for Heartlands of Time (Wastelands sequel) in the DLP WbA section. I doubt it'll ever actually be completed, but there's a tiny bit more if anyone's interested.

*** For those who don't mind that the story isn't 100K words (or that the sequel isn't posted), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger_and_Rose/][Dagger and Rose]] is Perspicacity's Harry/Fleur story.

*** WoT is pretty... surreal I guess would be the best word for it, in my opinion. I got three chapters in before I remembered having read it once, and since then I've not gotten enough sleep to properly read through it completely again, because it's too confusing. I read two whole chapters and none of it stuck >_<.

Also, I second your description of kb0's story.
