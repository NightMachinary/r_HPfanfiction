Basically looking for fics where two or three superpowerful magical e.g. Voldiemort harry and dumbledore are treated less as powerful wizards and more like sentient tactical nukes.


** Usually those fics end up tropey af like: Harry's aura flared, creating winds at the speed of mach 2. All the boys felt their biggest fears as they looked into his green powerful scary green powerful eyes which generated fear in their hearts and all the females felt horny BECAUSE IT WAS A FACT THAT ALL POWERFUL WIZARDS GET HARAMS! Daphne Greengrass felt her Imperious that her father placed on her as a baby fall off as she rushed to Harry to thank him by KISSING HIM on THE LIPs. Fleur Delacours aura was neutralised by the Mach 2 winds. Sorry if this was a little rude. I'm just trying to be funny. I'm not even kidding about the cliche tropes though. Have you read: ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4079609/1/]]) Harry Potter and The Marriage Contracts? Epic abuse of tropes.

*** Yeah, I think I found that one once and gave up after chapter 1 if that, was hoping there might be some semi serious tales on it, I mean I don't mind some tropes as long as they at least take a little time to set up and get rolling

***** Yeah I actually really like this story, the tropes just make it funny for me. Doesn't really seem like the author takes the story very serious and that's fpr the better. Although towards the end it got a lot more serieus, it still felt like a parody mostly.

*** The only possible negatives I can see are that it's a WBWL story (for those who aren't into that) and that Harry is consistently referred to as Hadrian. Once you get past that it's pretty excellent.

**** This fic has a pretty decent explanation given by the author as to why they refer to him as Hadrian though. Also, the Wbwl hasn't really come into play(Like everybody finding out) we just know the effects of him being neglected as a kid by the Potters, and although that is kind of a trope, the way this author played it is unique and probably the best I've seen anybody do it.

** Read: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13365454/27/]] One of the best if not THE best fics with a powerful MC. It is a relatively new Fic, and therefore it still hasn't reached a lot of people, but it is worth every minute. The best part: it has a "nearly finished" prequel and multiple sequels planned (not abandoned thank the gods).
