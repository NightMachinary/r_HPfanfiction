  It was on the tip of Pansy's tongue to tell Weasley to beat it, that she was not so far fallen that she'd shag the likes of him, but, then, she began to think seriously about what sleeping with Weasley would mean. Soon enough, he would sober up, come to his senses, realize what he had done, and then... Pansy grinned in anticipation for what he would promise for her silence.

*** It is, unfortunately, and fairly early in the story too, which was probably why I didn't bookmark it. Anyway, the other user was kind enough to link it so I'm good now.
