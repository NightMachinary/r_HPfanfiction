the third option has the snek friend being part of Harry, somewhere between "Borg collective of two" and "mind-meld bond as in Pern or inheritance"

**** I'm still trying to figure out a way to unbreak TT. If I can't, they just won't exist in my AU. Time travel will be impossible, except perhaps at a non-refundable cost so terrible that it comes up it will be dismissed out of hand (as "deploy doomsday weapon [tp supernova the sun or something] to stop Big bad" will be a better option).

****** I as a child broke them via munchkining within minutes of them being introduced.

My primary characters are... intelligent and creative and well-read enough that it is beyond suspension of disbelief that none of them are abusing the hell out of time travel.

Even if restricted to "already happened stable time loops", all deaths are meaningless, all that has to be done is purposely destroy all allied dead bodies without inspecting them, then TT later under invisibility, swap the not-dead body for a good-enough-to-pass-your-purposely-half-assed-inspection-you-already-did-in-your-past replica, and drop it off somewhere to hide until after you leave for the past.

Also, multiple parties TT against each other makes for a massive writing/planning headache I'd rather avoid.

******** I'm not JKR, I don't just write things.

I'm writing a universe that has a nice and self-consistent magical laws of physics.

If bad things happen to wizards who try to mess with time, I need a mechanism to make that happen.

I'd much rather nip it in the bud while I'm playing God with the history of the universe than do a handwave in the plot.

********** I base this on the sequence of events in book 3 - where information passed to the time-travelers about what they would do (although not in detail), after which they went back in time to be the other side of the loop that had already happened.

Timeline looks like this (for this example, let's call the victim Fred and the time-traveler Harry. numbers in order indicate what everyone else sees, letters indicate from time-traveler's perspective in his personal timeline. list in order it is written is what happens from POV of the universe:

D) Harry arrives in his past, is invisible

E) Harry conjures thing that looks like corpse of Fred.

1) Death Eater fires AK at Fred.

F) Harry stuns Fred, Switches Fred with conjured corpse.

2) Witnesses see AK hit something that looks exactly like Fred.

G) Harry flees battle with Fred, returns to time he traveled back from (at least by waiting around).

A) After the battle, Harry finds what, on visual inspection, is the corpse of Fred.

B) Harry destroys or Vanishes the body of Fred, in a way that does not give any information as to if it was real or not.

C) Harry time-travels back to before Fred is hit by AK

H) Harry and living Fred arrive.

Alternatively, at point F Harry could conjure something to block the AK very close to Fred's body, simultaneously stun him so he appears dead, then rennervate him after returning to future (if this strategy is SOP, then the first thing one would do to a corpse is attempt a rennervation).

Had at some point someone checked that the corpse was real or not, this loop could not be started (at least not without there being a way to fake that observation).

Comparing to book 3 - suppose Harry had witnessed Sirius being Kissed prior to traveling back. Then he would have either a) failed to save Sirius or b) found some way for whatever he saw to appear to his past self to happen without it actually having the consequence he is trying to prevent.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.
