***** It's fanart for the fanfic "[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-friends-like-these-altpower-taylor-worm.312205/][With Friends Like These]]" in the Worm fandom. It's premise is that instead of bugs, Taylor triggers with the ability to control the endbringers. It's a pretty great fic so far if a little glacial in its update speed.

** This would be so fucking epic. All of Harry's childhood bullies suddenly trip at the most inopportune moments. Hedwig flaps her wings, and Voldemort dies. The end.

*** Nah , Voldemort accidentally does something that causes the enstablishing of a Muggleborn Utopia , becomes powerless and has to witness it all unfolding before his eyes.

This is Ziz's style.

** So you're exposing magical Britain to Simurgh...Hedmurgh...would she be anything other than the antagonist? The Simurgh is no ones friend, and really not even it's own entity. It would mean that people would start randomly going nuts causing mass devastation. Worse than the imperious, because their is no coming back once Simurgh has taken hold. Any old Mr. Joe Wizard might be going about his day, then suddenly enact a detailed plan to destroy those closest to him and then cause untold havoc in the muggle world until he's finally put down. Maybe a short oneshot with wizardkind scrambling to find out the source of the mayhem, ending with Hedwig soaring over the wasteland that was Britain.

*** I think he's more referring to the fanon ziz, which a lot of the fandom identify with as an epic troll, rather than canon ziz, who goes around reading and breaking the minds of entire cities.

**** Ok, more of a winged Loki or Mr Gazoo versus the uncaring destroyer From /Worm/ then. Still, I think the canon Simurgh more interesting. Personally I can't stomach crack!fic and that's what fanon ziz-Hedwig sounds like.

** There was one were Blasto made a Simurgh / Phoenix hybrid.

i don't quite remember the name , it's the one where taylor triggered with standard HP magic.

note : But it was a Worm/HP cross not an HP/Worm cross.

** Can we make this (or another) a general HP/Worm crossover thread? I don't think that there are enough decent fics crossing the two over that something as specific as Hedwig being Simurgh is likely to yield anything.

*** I'd rather gouge my eyes out than read a story I wrote. When I write stories they're /really/ bad.

Edit: I can do dialogue well though. Maybe I could just write it like a script or something.
