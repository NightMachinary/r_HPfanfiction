While vacationing in Scotland, a muggle teacher from the US manages to wander into Hogwarts, bypassing the muggle-repelling charms entirely in his obsessive search for FAIRY GODPARENTS! /spasms/

Basically Mr. Crocker from Fairly Odd Parents wanders into Hogwarts and they can't seem to get rid of him. Memory charms don't do anything because he's crazy enough to keep getting through the protections around the school unintentionally, believing he has found evidence of FAIRIES! Crack, obviously.
