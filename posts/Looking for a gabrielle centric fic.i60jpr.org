:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fanfic quite some time back that revolved around Gabrielle. It featured her time at school after Fleur graduated. Gabrielle was portrayed as mischievous having Fred and George as her role models. If I also recall she was on the verge or was expelled from Beaubaxtons. Hopefully this community can help me jog my memory.


** God, I hope I have the name of this right... I think linkffn(the little Veela that could) is Gabi centric? Been a long time since I read this and I honestly don't think I finished it, but it comes up from time to time on here and it's the only one I can think of that may fit your request.

Apologies if my memory has let me down.

*** Not not this one, though I found this interesting as well. The thing I remember most clearly about the fic I'm trying to recall is that it occurred AFTER the triwizard tourney and Harry potter definitely didn't 'die' to save Gabrielle
