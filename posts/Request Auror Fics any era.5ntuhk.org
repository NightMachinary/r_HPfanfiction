Hi everyone,

I'm reading HP fanfiction for a year everyday and I'm on a bit of an Auror kick lately and wanted to know if [[/r/hpfanfiction]] had any recommendation. I mostly stick to canon complaint and fics that use characters as Aurors that makes sense. For example Susan Bones and Dennis Creevy make sense, but Ginny and Romilda Vane don't make sense. I'm not necessarily looking Harry/Detective/Spy or Harry centric fics but fanfics having to do with the Aurors and DMLE in general. Longer chaptered fanfics are appreciated.

I have read Northumbrian's Tales of the Battle, Aurors and Schoolgirls, Muggle Liaison Team Series, and everything else linkffn(Tales of the Battle) linkffn(Aurors and Schoolgirls) linkffn(MLT: Muggle Liaison Team)

FloreatCastellum's The Aurors linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors]])

Ron El Greco linkffn(Ron El Greco)

I read some other one shots but they weren't every memorable


** "Murder Most Horrid", linkffn(10099028), is a surprisingly good crime/mystery fic with Bellatrix as an auror/detective. It's a Voldemort free AU, and bad guys are of course also different.

"Harry Potter and the Nameless Man", linkffn(9537818), has Ginny as an auror trainee. Harry never went to Hogwarts and the two met way after the War.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** Just out of curiosity why do Susan and Dennis make sense but not Ginny? From what we know about Romilda, which is not much, I agree. Is it because in canon she became a quidditch player? Or do you not think she could realistically be an auror? What makes Dennis a good auror? I have my own idea but like to hear your thoughts.

*** I can't speak for the OP but I could see not-dead-Colin (and Dennis if Dennis takes after him) going into law enforcement because he's idealistic and thinks in big picture- he photographs everything that catches his eye and excites him not specific things- but also enjoys recording details of big pictures. I could see Colin working crime scenes easily a la CSI. Susan comes from a family where at least one person has been in law enforcement for quite some time and is good enough and cares about the work enough to become the DMLE director, and so regardless of personality she's more likely to be an Auror than her classmates just because she has more and better information about the career than non-Auror families. (Being an Auror/cop is an intimidating career choice, and it's easier to think that you have the chops for it if you know a lot about it.)

I've always seen Ginny as more interested in individuals than overarching ideals. When Harry leaves her, she accepts it because she knows him and knows that he's going no matter what she says, not because it's first and foremost the right thing to do to oppose Voldemort. She mocks Luna until Ginny gets to know her through the DA and then she becomes a fierce advocate for Luna. Ginny's fairly people-first, ideals-second (as opposed to Hermione's ideals-first, people-second), so Ginny wouldn't go into the Aurors on principle alone. Something would need to happen to someone that she cared for and Ginny would need to think that becoming an Auror, working under the Ministry and handling paperwork as well as criminals, was the best way to handle that situation to push her into that career. (Fred's death isn't going to do it... the Aurors were a corrupt organization then, not a helpful one. Anybody joining the Aurors right after Voldemort's death will be dealing with internal corruption first, helping people second. I could see Ginny keeping on as a freedom fighter in the Order after Fred's death, but the Aurors would need to prove their worth to her first, or people she cares for would need to become Aurors first and then appeal to her.)

Tl;dr: you'd have to write additional plot to get canon!Ginny to join the Aurors, whereas canon!Susan and carbon-copy-Colin!Dennis have a reasonable pathway to Auror careers already.

*** I wrote a detailed reply that was basically what [[/u/mergirl007]] wrote.

I will add that Dennis, as a muggleborn character post-war might want to make wizarding society better for future muggleborns. He might join Harry's anti-corruption sweep of the Ministry to align it with his idealistic views of a pureblood prejudice free Ministry. Dennis could also join the Aurors/DMLE to find Colin's murder or bring justice to other Death Eater victims and their families. He could also alternatively do all this outside the law as a vigilante.

I agree with mergirl007 on Susan and that her family's name recognition would help her later with career advancement and influence. And the Amelia Bones family connection might push her towards being an Auror.

With Ginny I sort of thought of her that way. But canon and Ginny growing out of the hero worshiper phase, for me make her less likely to follow Harry. She would more likely want to strike out on her own in the world after being the youngest child of a large family than follow Harry around. The following Harry to the Aurors plot thread I think is reserved for Ron and eventually he becomes disappointed with the realities of being an Auror and joins the Joke Shop. I have read a few fics that use a Civil Defense group of DA members after the war to get Ginny some Auror experience to then realize she carries to much bias and prejudice to be a Auror.

** Just out of curiosity why do Susan and Dennis make sense but not Ginny? From what we know about Romilda, which is not much, I agree. Is it because in canon she became a quidditch player? Or do you not think she could realistically be an auror? What makes Dennis a good auror? I have my own idea but like to hear your thoughts.

  To avoid the unjust prosecution of his friends in the days following the end of the war, Harry Potter signed a magical contract in blood. Years later, Harry struggles with the balance of his latest Auror case involving a wizard ritualistically murdering Muggles, periodic contract renewals, and both the developing and deteriorating relationships with those closest to him. HP/NT.
