Some of the best fics I've read were recommendations I'd previously skipped over due to a (in my eyes) bad summary. So I figured people could get opinions in their summaries here. Make one up if you don't have one yet. Here's mine:

#+begin_quote
  Mirrors rule over all. There was a reason Albus Dumbledore felt the mirror of Erised was the appropriate final trap for a Dark Lord. Unfortunately, he failed to factor in a young boy perfectly suited to be drawn into the trap himself.

** Yes please, I urgently need this as I hate my summary for linkffn(The Colour of Everything, Vol 1 by FloreatCastellum)

I really hate writing summaries, so this probably isn't worth much but I quite like yours. The only thing I would say is (idk if it's clear from the title) I think it should mention who the boy is - whether it's harry or an OC or someone else makes a big difference.

#+begin_quote
  For Remus Lupin, fresh from school and emboldened by the support of his friends, the Order of the Phoenix offers a thrilling adventure and a sense of purpose, yet the dark ascent of Lord Voldemort would bring him close to losing everything... The first volume in a canon compliant account of Remus Lupin's life, from Hogwarts onwards.

**** how about a more proactive voice instead of the passive one you've got now?

When newly-graduated Remus Lupin joins the Order of the Phoenix with his best friends, he expects [___*/]. Instead, he finds [/*____].

Summaries are more interesting when they're describing someone doing/learning something instead of describing a static situation.

Edit: also! The 'volume 1' is pretty weird unless this is in the format of Remus writing his memoirs. It's kind of presumptuous for Remus to assume that he'll be around long enough to write a second volume, especially as he's fighting a war, unless this is a retrospective fic, which I didn't get the impression it was. It feels like a mismatch between the story and the format tbh.

I somehow feel the need to add a bit more info to it as well, but I really think it might be best to just stick to the basics.

Because really, Hermione isn't truly 'getting away' from the war so much as she is managing to take a sabbatical of sorts in a place the war hasn't touched. She'd be there to pull herself back together and learn more about the other kind of magic/herself after some devastating losses.

*** It's pretty vague. I'm deducing from the Sirimione pairing that she was sent back to the initial rise of Voldemort? You may want to add specific details to make the summary more interesting. What battle is all but lost? The battle against Voldemort? The battle against the house elf revolution? The battle against muggle environmental degradation? What war is brewing? The same war or a different one?

Is the Strands of Time something from a crossover, because it sounds like it comes from, idk, the Prince of Persia fandom. Also, since the Strands of Time mention comes AFTER it's stated that Hermione went back in time (and presumably changed the Strands), use the past tense not the future tense. It should be 'The Strands of Time HAVE BEEN rewoven' (by Hermione's actions).

if the sands of time refers to the sands of a time turner, please just say that. It's vague enough right now that it could mean anything, like a battle in a magical desert or something else.

It's an interesting premise but the summary presents far too little concrete information to draw people in. Readers shouldn't have to puzzle out everything happening in your summary by the explanatory tags. (it is good you added them, though, the summary would be incomprehensible otherwise.)

** - When Hermione looked through the attic of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, she did expect to find dark magic, forbidden rituals and terrible spells. But the darkness rarely tells its secrets, and so Hermione is caught in a whirlwind of black magics, with a demon inside her head and a Mistress hailing from the House of Black.

- Voldemort had not only sent his Death Eaters to the Ministry, but vampires as well. Hermione and Harry fall to them and find themselves in new, undead lives. While Harry struggles to remain human, Hermione becomes what was believed dead long ago. She becomes a Countess, an heir to Dracula. Unfortunatly, there are no books on that.

- In one moment, the earth burned and they all required just one thing. Survival. So the Room provided. Two-Hundred years later, a group of six wizards and witches come back to reality and find a world destroyed. A letter leads them to Salem where they must fight once again to survive.

It's not like Harry knew, at that point, that having the brother wand would give him a degree of protection against Voldemort, so getting a new one shouldn't change anything for him until the graveyard, at which point he would just die.

I just went and read the first chapter (assuming I got the right story; I copy-pasted the summary into google) and I think you're right about the disconnect. As I said, I expected adventure, but what I got was a lot of talking and not a lot happening. You tell us Harry's life is busy and chaotic, but what we see is some slow-paced domesticity, a relaxed trip into work on what appeared to be a day off, and an early finish to have drinks with his brother-in-law. It generated some interest in the missing artefact, and some curiosity as to whether what's going on with Hermione is just postpartum depression or something more, but there's none of the urgency and excitement that I was expecting.

Edit: also, who the fuck is phantom? is this a crossover? If it's a crossover, add that to the summary at the end. If phantom's an OC just put Hedwig/OC, the mystery of phantom's identity is distracting from the part you want readers to focus on.

Edit edit: you can drop spy/military/action/thriller down to spy thriller. Having all of those is redundant and makes it sound like a super serious military wank story. End it with an exclamation point and add some humor and pizzazz to your summary. "A canon-compliant spy thriller starring HEDWIG, muggle secret agent extraordinaire!" is funnier and more energizing. (Sorry for the edits, the more I look at your summary, the more things bug me about it. The first sentence is bland too.)

** I'm always up for suggestions. Here's mine. I'm honestly not a huge fan of it.

In 1991, a single Hogwarts acceptance letter sat on Minerva McGonagall's desk with no address. Harry Potter, Location Unknown. Five years later, he is finally found. But he's not what the world had hoped for.

*** It's not an unusual premise, so giving us a few details about who Harry turned into is necessary. I don't know anything about the fic- is it felon Harry? Dark Harry? Scientist Harry? All of these will appeal to different segments of the HP crowd, and leaving out any details means that you're not appealing to any of them. Try editing your last sentence to 'But a [insert-Harry's-unique-selling-point-here] is not what the wizarding world had hoped for.'

Essentially, your fic is a Bertie Botts jellybean right now. I have no idea what I'm getting, and I don't want to put it in my mouth and find out it's earwax.

**** Lol that is a really good analogy. I've been puzzling over what you said for a while, but I just can't think of a short way to describe my Harry... Well, I can think of lots of ways, but none of them are accurate. It would be like handing you a bubblegum jellybean, but you eat it and find out it's cinnamon, and I'm all "Well there are cinnamon bubblegums." if that makes sense. So I have a feeling I'm just going to need to re-work the whole thing. Granted, I wrote the description when I only had the first chapter written, so now that I have the whole story plotted out, I'm sure I can come up with something better lol.

** /"What if Harry had 13 marriage contracts? What if Harry was the heir to Merlin, Arthur, the Founders and the house of Black? Dumbledore won't know what hit him! AD, MW, PW, RW, GW, SS, DM, LM!Bashing. Harry!Harem. Parseltoungue!Harry. Genius!Harry. Powerful-but-will-fall-to-Pettigrew-stunner!Harry"/

Pretty much applies to every fic ever these days.
