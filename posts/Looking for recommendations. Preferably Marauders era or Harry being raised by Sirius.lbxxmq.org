Any recommendations would be appreciated. Really looking for 6th/7th year at hogwarts for the Marauders and carries into the Order/First War. The longer the better. Would prefer if they're finished but beggars can't be choosers. Thanks!

  What if Sirius didn't spend twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.
