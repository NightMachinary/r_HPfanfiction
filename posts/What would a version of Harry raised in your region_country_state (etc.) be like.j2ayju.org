Of course, there are numerous variables to consider, beyond where he is raised, e.g. schooling and (adoptive) parents. And nature can play a large part in characterization. Still, we can make some educated guesses.

Therefore, what would a version of Harry raised in your country/city/state (etc.) be like -- your birthplace and where you are now, if different? How would the new Harry impact events, for better or worse? What would canon characters think about him, and vice versa?

For example, I'd imagine that a Harry raised in Brooklyn would differ greatly from one raised in Seoul. And that's assuming that his upbringing is similar, i.e. abusive.


** The Dursleys' mania for normality could be hilarious if moved from the suburbs to skid road.

But as a Murican, the biggest difference would be Harry going to Ilvermorny instead of Hogwarts.

** Harry Potter raised here in a hardcore unionist part of Northern Ireland could be interesting. Feuding with Seamus, painting paramilitary murals on the walls, asking the house elves for tatiebread with breakfast, feuding with Seamus, hanging flags everywhere, kneecapping Death Eaters, feuding with Seamus...

** North India(the plains, not the mountains) : Dudley and his gang listen to panjabi rap.

Vernon is a property dealer or something.

Neighbors catch harry talking to a cobra under a Peepal tree in a temple, and then its on the news in typical news-that-runs-at-2-pm-with-flashy-transitions-and-conspiracy-theories style. People start worshipping harry as a god. Go WILD

** Probably a lot of guns, and parseltongue might a bit more useful than in GB.

** He'd either be high or just an average kid. Might like hiking, beer, snowboarding/skiing/winter sports.

** French here, assuming he is raised the same (neglected by his guardians, bullied by their child and unaware of Magic, I don't think he would change much.

Sure he would probably hate Scotland at first because of the cold (especially if he grew up in the South of France), and Treacle Tart would clearly not be his favourite meal because he would have been exposed to proper food, but the 2 cultures are not so different that it would completely change his character.

Oh yeah, and he would probably get along very well with the Beauxbatons students in GoF. Just soing a Brits bothering to learn the best language in the world should make most of them happy.
