:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So the fic starts off in the future with Harry and his son Albus. I forgot most of it but the basis is that Albus is a natural born arithmancer and becomes a dark lord. Harry goes out to confront him and pulls out the elder wand. The elder wand's presence is too powerful and breaks Albus.

Anyone knows what fic that is?


** Maybe linkffn(Catharsis by nuhuh)? Been awhile since I read it though.

  Post DH. Harry could never have known Albus-Severus was the herald of the new dark age. He watched as his youngest child came to be known as the Dark Son. Now Harry goes back in time to save his family and his son from the dark path.

** My first reaction to the title was: how can you look for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] and not find it?

*** Oh oops my bad. It's just that I only remember the word Arithmancer from the fic so I thought might as well shove it in the title

**** No problem, you clarified it enough in the text (but I can't help you, sorry). It was I who was being unnecessarily pedantic (but nevertheless amused).
