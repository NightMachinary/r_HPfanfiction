:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I cannot find this one fic again. It's where Harry is snapes biological son and there is a curse passed down through the prince family that Snape doesn't know about as he didn't get it. I remember Harry running through the walkways from a “dementor” at one point and I'm pretty sure he knew Snape was his dad first? I've been thinking about this fic nonstop for a week

  AU of HBP. Harry found out that he was Snape's son two years ago, and he's carefully concealed it. But now Snape is his Defense teacher, and Draco Malfoy is up to something, and Dumbledore is dying, and the final battle is coming up, and everything is getting very, very complicated.
