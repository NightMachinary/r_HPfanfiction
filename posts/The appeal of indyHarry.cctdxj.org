People who read indy!Harry and magically powerful Harry fics what is their appeal? What draws you to them? What is it about them that makes them enjoyable to you?


** Same reason people like characters like Tony Stark I guess; I enjoy stories about exceptional people who get shit done. If I wanted to read about a mediocre, everyday schmuck I'd just write a diary.

*** I see.

Would you find it interesting if it was an indy fem Harry?

Edit: I apologize I didnt mean for my question to come across wrong. I was just curious.

**** Lol it's totally fine, sorry if I sounded defensive there, that's just how I talk.

Regarding your question, well I don't know, to be honest. Is the indy!fem!Harry going to be an interesting, three dimensional character, or a simple power fantasy? Because I enjoy both, don't get me wrong, but all a simple power fantasy is good for is self-inserting, and I can't really self-insert into the shoes of a person I simply do not identify with (such as a person with a different gender) without doing some crazy mental gymnastics.

** I mainly read them when I am in the mood to "watch" people get things done as [[https://www.reddit.com/user/VCXXXXX][u/VCXXXXX]] says. Also, I didn't /love/ HPB or DH and felt like Harry's hands were tied by all the adults around him. I understand why Rowling made the choices she did, but I'm just not sure if the last two books will age as well as the rest of the series. Personally, I like Powerful Harry that has minimal bashing and is really him just coming into his own and making his own decisions because he wants not to let his past traumas control him.
