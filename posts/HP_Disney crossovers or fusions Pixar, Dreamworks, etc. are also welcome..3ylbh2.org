So, recently I've gone on an animated movie craze.

Some favorites I've re-watched in the last week or so: How To Train Your Dragon, Wreck-It Ralph, The Lion King, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Tangled, Anastasia, Fantastic Mr. Fox

Any length, but epic fics are especially appreciated. No harem fics, please. Explicit fics are fine (if well written, of course).


** I've got nothing specific to recommend, but I can point you to the list of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-How-to-Train-Your-Dragon-Crossovers/224/6524/][HP x How to Train your Dragon fics on fanfiction.net]]
