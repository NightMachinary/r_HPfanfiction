The rest of the Wizarding World tend to shy away from the dark, dingy alley and for good reason. To them, they don't want to be tainted by the ‚Äòdregs of society' but to those who may not fit the ‚Äòideal witch or wizard as dictated by society', it's a home. Aside from your petty thieves, Knockturn Alley plays home to creatures that would otherwise be turned away from society, such as werewolves, vampires, hags and many other dark affiliated person(s) or those who may be below the poverty line or disowned by their family, and they've come to rely on each other.

Deep down, past all of the shady dealings and free but secretive use of Dark Magic, they all hold resentment towards Wizarding Britain and the MoM as a whole for essentially dumping them as far from ‚Äòpolite society' as possible to keep up their ‚Äòimage'.

(I guess I just want to see more mentions of Knockturn and see it get explored more in fanfics. I right now am plotting a story where an OC raised in Knockturn rallies up the citizens and they formally march to the Ministry demanding change)


** I have really wanted to write like a ‚ÄúTales from Knockturn Alley‚Äù short story collection. I actually have like three ideas for it outlined, like short interconnected stories. I am really excited about it and really the only constraint is time to write. There is so much that can be done with this.

  "The poor alleys," Rispah said tartly, "You can say it like it is. The Lower alleys are the wizarding underground. Home to the seedy parts of life no one likes to talk about. Everyone says it's naught but criminals and tramps, and everyone's silently grateful the disgraceful community is content to remain separate from the Wizarding whole for the most part. Aye, there's beggin and thievin and the like, make no mistake, but there's so much /more/." Rispah's face was alight with passion, and in it Harry could see a thousand stories she would probably never understand. "There's /life/ in these alleys, lad. There's folk who spend their lives without two galleons to rub together and are /happy/ despite it. This world, our world, is a place beyond blood and money, though there's plenty of the former spilt for the latter at times. It's about community, and family, and working and singing next to anyone who's got a ready smile and an open mind."

  Harry stared up at the lady, this scarlet bird with such a lovely song, and thought that she would never understand life half as well as Rispah did.

  Solom put a hand gently on Rispah's shoulder, "That was lovely, lass, but it don't really explain much about the way we work." Rispah smiled and gestured for Solom to get on with it then. "The truth of the matter is, the Lower Alleys and most folk in it don't really answer to any authority you've heard of. The Ministry and the Wizengamot have nothing to do with us---ashamed and in denial, they are---and we have as little as possible to do with them. Back before the Ministry and all that political nonsense we have nowadays, Wizarding Britain, like the rest of the civilized world, was ruled by a King. There was wizarding nobility, of course, who eventually became watered down into the most ancient and noble family houses you'd hear of today---the Malfoy's and the Bones', the Black's and the Goldentower's. With me so far?"

** *Harry Potter gets smart and takes control - the goblet* - linkffn(13309790)

This fic has Light and Darke ways to do magic. Light is impersonal, you tell it what to do and it just "is". Darke has it alive and full of emotion. Since the Ministry is "Light", Darke is illegal. In this fic the people who congregate in Knockturn Alley mostly practice the Darke, which is illegal.

It's not the main focus of the fic, but it comes back. The Darke culture does get explored pretty heavily.

  Harry's name comes out of the goblet and he's had enough, he's sick of pretending to be stupid and constantly fighting against the whole world. It's time to step up. This is a long and a slow build though, spanning most of the fourth year. There will be no over night changes, trauma recovery takes time, months. He's not going to wake up and start ass kicking the next day.
