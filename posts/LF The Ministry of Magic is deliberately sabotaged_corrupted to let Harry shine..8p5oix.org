Just something I thought of last night; the vast majority of the plot of the books, relies on the Ministry being cruel and incompetent. Letting dozens of Death Eaters bribe their way free, failing to establish Sirius's guilt beyond 'he was at the crime scene', refusing to investigate Cedric Diggory's death, creating educational degrees with impunity to interfere at Hogwarts, Umbridge outright attempting an assassination...

But the thing is, if the Ministry weren't incompetent and corrupt, Harry would be much less integral to saving the wizarding world; Harry's job would probably be over after surviving the Little Hangleton graveyard and giving his testimony. Heck, if Peter Pettigrew were apprehended and Barty Crouch Jr. never sprung from a more humane Azkaban, Harry might be done after the basilisk in 2nd year. 1st year if they investigate Dobby's warning and that Quirrell had two heads.

But then, that's really the thing; for the first five books, the Ministry needs to be bad guys, because if they weren't then Harry wouldn't be the star. So with that in mind...are there any fics where by whatever means, the Ministry is being deliberately sabotaged, cursed, or whatnot, so that Harry Potter will be the hero of the Wizarding World?

Well, it was better before, but Lucius Malfoy definitely made it worse through his bribes. Basically, Dumbledore got his ass kicked by Voldemort during the War and by Lucius Malfoy during the peace. Those facts showed his political and military leaderships.

** You are right though: if the Ministry of Mismanagement...Magic wasn't so incompetent Harry would be far less important. I suspect Rowling made them incompetent for that exact reason.

But I am going to be somewhat controversial and play the devils advocate here. We have an outsider's perspective on the events of the books. More importantly, so do all the students at Hogwarts including Harry, Ron and Hermione. They have no idea what the last war was actually like to live through, and unlike the second war it lasted for 10-11 years. In fact, I think either Sirius or Remus makes exactly that case to Harry that you need to put yourselves in the position of people who lived through it to understand what it means to them that Voldemort came back. Harry has more difficulty understanding or relating to this than any other character in the story: his life has been inextricably tied up with Voldemort since before his birth. For him, the war never really ended.Someone has probably mentioned this before, but there are a number of parallels of Cornelius Fudge with Neville Chamberlin, the British Prime Minister from 1937 to 1940, and to a lesser degree his predecessor Stanley Baldwin. Fudge and Chamberlin essentially did everything they could to avoid jumping into war, despite obvious evidence of aggressive moves on the part of the Germans/Death Eaters. But the cold hard truth is that both Britain and the Ministry of Magic were militarily, financially, and probably psychologically unprepared for a war. Chamberlin differs, in that his obfuscation was partly an attempt to buy time and build up there forces. The parallel works even better too, because war was only declared when some impossible to ignore event occurred, and the British now HAD to fight (Voldemort is in the Atrium fighting in person, the Nazis invaded Poland).

Hell, you could even think of the first wizarding war as a parallel to the Great War or the 1st World War, after which no one really was willing to accept another war with the Germans, even when the signs became glaringly obvious. The truth seems to be that defeating even a /reasonably/ powerful wizard/witch is incredibly difficult, given the number of possibilities magic grants for asymmetric warfare, subterfuge, and escape. That's not even getting into how much of an anomaly Voldemort is in terms of ability either.

On that note, I would love to read a story about how Fudge knew that Voldemort returned, or believed it at least, but knew the Ministry was not prepared to jump into the fire and fight again immediately. Thus he used the temporary truce of sorts to build up the Ministry's resources (hoarding funding, identifying potential spies or moles, quietly isolating bad apples in the ministry) in preparation for the declaration of war in the future.

Well in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), Fudge threw in his lot with Voldemort by selling out Muggleborns. Umbridge mainly went after Hermione instead of Harry, and had all 5th year Muggleborns fail their OWLs and thrown out of Hogwarts, so Hermione went over the edge. [[/spoiler][Fudge would later turn around, but only after his Ministry forces were chewed up by both sides and Dumbledore put immense pressure on him.]]

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

**** Yeah, I've read it. Starfox is kinda hit or miss with me (loved The Dark Lord Never Died for instance), but Divided and Entwined wasn't exactly what I mean. I sort of hope that Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) continues with its portrayal of Fudge: he does most of what he does in canon due to the reality of the situation (ex. sends the dementors to Hogwarts because if they don't have enough prisoners in Azkaban, their treaty with the dementors is off and they will have free range of Britain). That is more what I would like to see. Actually, now that I think about it Scrimgeour is sort of like Churchill: elected after Fudge during war time, a more hard line war-footing style leader, with greater cynicism toward ideologically opposed individuals (like Dumbledore). That's sort of how he is in PoS too, though we will have to see further.

Starfox generally changes a fair amount of the world in his stories, but his characterizations of most of the characters seem similar from fic to fic (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, even Fudge) and really only are different when something in the story occurs to change them. That's fine, but sometimes I like to see something different. He's a good writer, but a lot of his material feels a bit too repetitive, though he gets significant kudos for finishing his work in my opinion.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** The ministry being corrupt kept Voldemort working small time.

If the ministry were competent Voldemort would still be immortal. Instead of blowing time on small schemes he would have to build an army capable of taking on a nation. Instead of being what amounts to a terrorist he would be WW3.

Corrupt ministry basically entrapped Voldemort.

** I don't find the portrayal of the Ministry to be all that unbelievable tbh, but maybe I'm just cynical. The Educational Decrees are the only thing that push my suspension of disbelief in this department, but they showcase Umbridge so very well in the book (and are hilarious in the film) so I didn't really mind.

*** I can't help but believe that the reason Rowling made the ministry doubt the whole thing was to not actually have to display the actual war.

In OotP, the real villain seems to be the corrupt Ministry, and overturning them at the end is the consolation prize victory Harry gets (he has one in books 3-6, ex. "Sirius is still on the run, but now Harry has some kind of pseudo-parent/uncle watching out for him"). So of course they do all these things, they are the bad guys within that book. In the next book, the bad guy is essentially Draco Malfoy, and by proxy Snape (thus defeating/getting rid of them is sort of the overarching goal).
