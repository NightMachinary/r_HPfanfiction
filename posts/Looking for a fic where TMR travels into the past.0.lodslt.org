We have all types of time travel stories, but I don't remember ever reading one where TMR travels into the past of any timeline and turns the tables. Together with Harry sure, but not solely himself.

** One that I've been reading that fits this, except it takes place after Voldemort dies, is Carpe Noctem by LeEspionage. Voldemort ends up in young Tom Riddle's body, so there aren't two versions of himself running around. He still has all his memories of being Voldemort and is determined to do things better with the knowledge he has. It's really entertaining and rather funny at times despite not being a crack fic. Also, in a way, Voldemort sort of befriends Dumbledore? Not really, but they have an interesting relationship anyway because Dumbledore quickly realizes that Tom is very different and has Dark Lord energy.

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

  Fanfiction has sent nearly everyone back to 'fix' things except for the Dark Lord. So this is very AU and the 'fates' or whoever decide that Tom should have a try at it. To Voldemort's dismay he must try to save both the wizarding world and the muggle one as well. Don't really know what pairings I'll try for this time, the characters will likely let me know.
