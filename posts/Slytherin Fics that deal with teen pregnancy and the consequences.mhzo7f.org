:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic where Millicent got pregnant with a Theo Notts baby during their last year in hogwarts and he friends help her hide it.

Are there any similar fics?


** There's a fic, "Surprise Child" by Harry50, where Millicent Bulstrode drops out of Hogwarts after she gets pregnant a result of abusing her Inquisitorial Squad position to arrange for Harry Potter to take her virginity in 5th year. The story's mainly after a timeskip, though, when Harry encounters her and their kid in the muggle world (her parents disowned her and she's kind of unemployable in the wizarding world) so I don't know how well it fits what you're looking for.
