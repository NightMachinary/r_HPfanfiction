It's a long story but I don't remember much. Harry is a really good fighter and a bunch of Slytherins ambush him outside and after defeating all of them he banishes draco from the black family.

Anyone remember this one?


** I remember him breaking bones and I think he breaks dracos ribs and it was outside in the courtyard

** Could it be Whispers in the Night by Jean11089?

He basically stomps most of the junior death eaters in this fix using one spell and physically demolishes them

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.
