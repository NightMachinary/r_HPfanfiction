Hi, does anyone have any good complete fanfics to recommend? I like fics where Snape has some sort of deeming quality ie no Evil!Snape. I also enjoy a good parody and have read many that have been recommended on this sub-reddit. Otherwise just a story with a good story line and please not too fluffy.

Many Many thanks

** This is quite short but very funny. Basically, after the end of canon Snape's ghost haunts Harry and Ginny, which influences how they name their children. linkffn(The Wendell that Wasn't).

Also, linkffn(3673824). I won't give too much away, but the first chapter is Snape-centric. It's useful, but not necessary, to be slightly familiar with some of Sir Terry Pratchett's Diskworld books, but it's by no means a crossover.

** you've presumably read snape chronicles

i like the snape in methods of rationality, mostly because he receives the power bump i always felt he should have. unfortunately for your question he's a tangential character, but it's the closest portrayal i've found to how i imagine snape. sort of dumbledore's man who gets things done, with gray morals and no emotions.

snape is actually the worst-written main character in all of fanfiction i think. such a shame

Mhm. A huge part of it is that people still can't really decide anything about him, so his portrayals just end up trying to cram him into tropes. Which is unfortunate, because I think he's one of the most interesting characters in the series, with a lot of fanfiction potential, that nobody explores in ways I agree with.

I tend to find even serious Sirius is poorly written. But I welcome any recs to contradict my opinion that Sirius is written far worse than Snape, on average.

but with snape i meant that even among the .000001 percent of fanfiction i would ever touch, otherwise decent authors still get snape wrong. see above link, the story about snape going back in time to raise harry. read the first chapter... nothing about that character is written well or accurately. and the overall quality isn't great but it's good enough for fanfiction, so i hoped for a better personalization. but snape is too hard.
