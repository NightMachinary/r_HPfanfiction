I only recently started reading fanfictions, but I found a few I really liked. Two of them got right up close to the end of their stories, but never were completed (at least not on fanfiction.net), but in both cases is seems the author might have finished them elsewhere.

The first is called Yellow Submarine, by Deadwoodpecker who states she completed the story, but posted the end on her livejournal instead. The story is fairly old (2009) and the livejournal account has since been deleted.

The second is called Against the Odds, and is by Bones365. The author mentioned they just needed to add the epilogue and they would be done, only they never did apparently.

I don't have much hope for the second one, because I think they may have just stopped writing, but the first I feel was completed at one point and I just can't find it anywhere. Any help or insight would really be appreciated.


** This if off topic a bit...

Download FanFictionDownloader (google will find it) - get into a habit of grabbing any fanfic that catches your eye for your personal archive.

Fanfics sometimes get deleted off the web before one had time to read them - authors may change their minds, or sometimes run afoul of censorship policies or get into a drama war with fans or other authors... Stuff like that sometimes result in fics going offline suddenly.

*** Yeah that's a good idea, I was thinking of doing something similar, but more tedious (lots of copying and pasting) so I'll look into that.

*** It's a good idea to have backups as well if you're the author, as it's not uncommon for badly behaving readers to campaign to take down stories. I've lost a few stories this way myself: once, when I blocked an abusive reviewer, who then got his revenge; once when a non-fanfiction-friendly author asked that all fanfiction of his stories be removed from the site; a final time, when a plagiarist copied a story verbatim, posted the story as his own, and then petitioned the administrators to remove mine as being in violation of the site's ToS.

The last one still gets my ire up.

** Welcome to the fandom. I envy you your virgin eyes.

Unfortunately, unfinished stories are one of the perils of fanfiction and great, completed stories are the exception, not the rule. Some of the most famous, ambitious, and influential stories in the fandom (e.g., S'TarKan's Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past, Full Pensieve's Harry Potter and the Years of Rebellion) are incomplete and unlikely to ever be finished (not by the original authors, at any rate). If this bothers you, it's best to check from the start that a story is complete.

Probably the best bet with Ella's (Deadwoodpecker's) story would be to just contact her directly through PM and ask politely whether you can join her LJ to read the ending to Socks. I've followed her from the beginning and can say she took a break from writing and posting on fanfiction.net over the last couple of years. I know that in the past she had a very active LiveJournal (I used to be a member back in the day, when I was writing more myself, but have not kept up). The good news is that she has posted two updates to her other story [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4774670/1/Socks][Socks]] in the last couple of weeks, so it looks like she's back to writing and posting. This bodes well for seeing her other unfinished stories through to completion.

Incidentally, according to the note tacked to the end of her [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/56/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose]] story, she also apparently has a Facebook page to which you could subscribe and (one hopes) interact with the author.

*** Thanks, that's good advice. I know most end up incomplete, the only reason I asked with these two is that, especially in the case of Yellow Submarine, it seemed they were finished after all and I just couldn't find them.

I tried to find her livejournal account and I think it may have been deleted, but I'll look for her facebook page too and send her a pm. Thanks again for the help.
