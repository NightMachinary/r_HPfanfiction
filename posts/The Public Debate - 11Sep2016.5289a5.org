* Topic: Albus Dumbledore should have accepted to become Minister for Magic when offered.

** I have no idea how to answer this question.

If Albus had accepted the Minister for Magic post, then he wouldn't *be* Dumbledore. As [[/u/Taure]] has said in an [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/50ykma/i_think_its_time_that_we_have_a_character/d780pny][excellent post]]:

#+begin_quote
  On the one hand, [Dumbledore] does not trust himself with power. He hates Grindelwald's philosophy of the Greater Good and would rather remove himself completely from all political concerns.

  [...]

  On the other hand, despite his attempts to avoid it, he inevitably ends up holding a huge amount of power, by virtue of his intelligence and magical skill.
#+end_quote

If canon Albus had in any way sought - or accepted - real political power, then he would be no better than the manipulative punching bag so often appearing in independent!Harry fics.

This question is like asking what Harry Potter would be like if he'd never developed a sense of curiosity or how Hermione might act if she was thoroughly uninterested in distinguishing herself academically. Some aspects of a character can't be separated from the name.

Edit: after some thought, put me in the AGAINST category

** Yes, he probably should have stood to be Minister for Magic. It would have to be an electoral victory of course, you can't just be "given" the role of leader in a free and democratic society.

I am aware of the theory underpinning Dumbledore's resistance to positions of "power" but lets not forget that we're talking about "Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, O.M. (First Class), Grand Sorcerer, Supreme Mugwamp of the International Confederation of Wizards, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Leader of the Order of the Phoenix, wielder of the Elder Wand."

The point i'm trying to make is that he is clearly the authority figure for the wizarding world.

If he thinks that Voldemort will return, which i think it's safe to say he has a fair suspicion, he should have taken the role of Minister if only to push through the training of more aurors and to be in a position to promote a strong wizard/muggle collaboration to avoid or at least prevent the spread of the bigotry that is so rife in the stories.

He also could have done more to bring known Death Eaters, after the war, to justice rather than see them all walk having bribed senior ministry officials. I am always left with the impression that Dumbledore believes in the rule of law. He is compassionate yes, but enforces rules on what is and isn't allowed. Any Minister, of any department would not cross the Albus Dumbledore that won the war against Gindelwall nor the one that Voldemort feared.

He could have made the position of Minister "great again" to steal a line from Donald Trump but instead doomed it to become a farce.

EDIT: I'm IN FAVOUR.

** This question can be taken a few ways. On the surface, should he have taken this job? This could be in addition to or instead of his other positions. Hopefully it's illegal to be the Chief Warlock and Minister of Magic. Also, it seems like it would involve too many responsibilities to be paired with being headmaster.

The other way to take this question is a bit more metaphorically. Should Dumbledore have taken a more active role in shaping Wizarding Britain?

I argue that he should have, regardless of what position he decided to do it from. He was obviously burnt on the idea of actively shaping the world by his experience with Grindlewald. With him in the roles he has chosen Voldemort made his rise mostly unoppposed, bribes are accepted in the highest offices of government, people are sentenced without trials, a minister largely viewed as both weak and incompetent regularly violates the ministry's laws and civil liberties. Even in Hogwarts things aren't great. A quarter of student population is consigned to the opposition and little is done to make them feel welcome or make inroads towards school unity. The potential for propaganda in History of Magic is thoroughly wasted in keeping Binns on.

Frankly there is too much wrong with Wizarding Britain for Dumbledore to keep the status quo. I get that he had a bad experience in his youth, but ignoring the systemic problems cannot be forgiven.

Dumbledore should have become minister and done all he could to fix the broken system. Or he could have actually used his position at Hogwarts to build an effective propaganda machine to mobilize the youth to start addressing the serious problems of government.

** In Favor.

Disregarding Dumbledore's tendency to 'manipulate' people for the greater good, he literally would have all the power he could have to accomplish plenty of the things he set out to do in the Order of the Phoenix far more conveniently.

Also had he accepted to become the Minister for Magic, Dumbledore would most likely have been able to deal better with his fear of his power-hungry tendencies (considering how useful it is to be humbled by such a fear, he really would have had little problem dealing with the position really) when kept in check and being constantly placed in the spotlight for his actions (or lack of it) and be accounted for by many of his adversaries and old friends and would have been capable enough to not let death eaters get away, or hell, even have subdued Dark Lord 2.0 far better than in cannon.

Honestly, he's the most capable, hell, most likely /only/ capable person to be the Minister for Magic in the wizarding world especially after that stunt he did in defeating Grindelwald but he refuses it because he /doesn't trust himself with holding power/. Which is ridiculous as he's already considered as the strongest wizard alive and literally holds a whole damn large amount of power by himself and the personal political connections he holds. Had he accepted, he would have had access to an entire army of forces and political power to build a far better world than when he did being Hogwart's headmaster.

** Against.

Albus Dumbledore was an ineffective leader. Full stop. He was the Headmaster at Hogwarts, the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW, and the leader of the Order of the Phoenix. He did not have a positive effect on any of them. He also was a control freak who showed poor judgment and surrounded himself with people who wouldn't question him.

As the Headmaster of Hogwarts, Dumbledore is directly responsible for all the awful things that happened while he was there. The Philosopher's Stone, the basilisk, the bullying, and the poor staffing choices. And let's not forget that Dumbledore was fully aware of Malfoy's attempts to murder him, but he let Ron Weasley and Katie Bell barely avoid death without stopping the person responsible. I don't care if you're trying to save him, attempted murder is attempted murder. In the end, because he was unwilling to step in and solve the problem he put an entire school full of children at risk. He let Bellatrix Lestrange into Hogwarts in an attempt to save Draco Malfoy. What if she found a half dozen kids out of bed and killed them? How many lives would have been acceptable for him to risk and lose in the name of trying to save somebody who didn't deserve it?

We know very little about the ICW except that it seems to be the magical equivalent to the United Nations and Albus Dumbledore was the head of it. Now I would like to ask, where were all the Spanish Aurors while Voldemort was blatantly attack muggles and demolishing the statute of secrecy? Or the French? The Americans? The Germans, Italians, Egyptians, Japanese, Chinese, Australians? There is a whole world of magical users and not one single country sent any help to Magical Britain. How ineffective must he have been in that role that he couldn't get any country to recognize the threat that Voldemort was to not just magical Britain, but the entirety of the magical world?

I will readily admit that Dumbledore can not control the actions of the Wizengamot as a whole. He can not make people vote his way or understand his point of view, but that doesn't change the fact that a body led by Dumbledore passed horrible laws that discriminated against a variety of magical beings. It also doesn't explain how a trial was given to the Lestranges or Karkaroff or how Lucius Malfoy was given one and found innocent, clearly due to corruption within the ministry, but he never managed to give a trial to Sirius Black? You're talking about a man thought to be Voldemort's right hand, his greatest spy, yet there was no trial, not even a questioning to find out what he knew? And the Chief Warlock let it happen?

Let's talk about the Order of the Phoenix. A vigilante group that was, at best, excruciatingly ineffective during the second war. They provided no assistance whatsoever to Harry who needed all the help he could get against Voldemort. They sat outside and guarded his home under an invisibility cloak but he was still mistreated, some would argue abused by his relatives, and still attacked by dementors on their watch. Their guarding of the prophecy did more harm than good. One member ended up in prison, another nearly died, and the Death Eaters still managed to lay a trap for Harry Potter to lure him to the Department of Mysteries. If they were really interested in protecting the contents of the prophecy, they could have moved it. There was absolutely no way that Dumbledore could have believed that Snape was the best choice to teach him occlumency, another project the Order of the Phoenix took on that did more harm than good. At the end of the day, the Order was responsible for helping capture the Death Eaters at the Department of Mysteries, though I hardly think you can call it a success seeing as it only happened because the Order failed miserably at protecting the prophecy from Death Eaters, teaching Harry occlumency, or providing him any kind of useful information that would have let him know that he was heading into a trap. It also ended up with Sirius dying and all the Death Eaters being out of prison within a few months. In fact, I'd argue that the most successful thing the Order did was the radio show that happened after Dumbledore died.

Listed above are several examples of Dumbledore failing in roles of leadership and now I'll give a few specific reasons why he fails in those roles. First, Albus Dumbledore is exceptionally arrogant. He isn't overtly arrogant the same way that Draco is, but you can tell by the way he acts that Dumbledore believes himself to be so superior to those around him that he wouldn't possibly need their help. Exactly how arrogant must one be to hunt the horcruxes of Voldemort alone? How arrogant must one be to think he can effective lead an international body, a judicial/legislative body, a school, and a vigilante group at the same time and be effective in any of the roles, much less all of them?

Dumbledore surrounds himself with yes men. How many times did you see anybody stand up to him and tell him that he was wrong? Sirius, who spent 12 years in Azkaban and was desperately protective of his godson, and Snape, who had literally nothing left to lose, were the only two who ever disagreed with him. To be an effective leader you need to surround yourself with people who aren't afraid to tell you that you're making a mistake. Instead he has McGonagall and Lupin and the Weasleys who couldn't dream of presenting an opposing view to him.

Dumbledore hordes information and continuously makes it harder for people around him to do their job. He handcuffs the teachers at his school by allowing Slytherins to be get away with as much as attempted murder without suffering any consequences. He hid information about horcruxes from everybody except Harry Potter and at the end of the day left the fate of magical Britain in the hands of three teenagers. How much better off would everybody have been if Moody or Shacklebolt or Tonks were involved in the horcrux hunt with the skills they brought to the table as aurors? Would Dumbledore be alive if he had brought one of them to the Gaunt shack?

Those who followed and agreed with Dumbledore were losing the first war badly and were saved only by a fluke. Fourteen years later, they all but lost the war. Why would you ever want to put such an ineffective leader in charge of the magical government of Britain. Dumbledore would have caused far more problems than the solved.

** AGAINST

Now to be fair, I have to start off by pointing out that I don't think he should of been headmaster either. I see him as more of a Flamel character. That is to say... doing his own research, occasionally dipping his hand into the candy jar and offering advice or assistance to the wizarding world and individuals.

I feel as if his views, goals, and ideas have been far too warped by his life experiences (successes and failures) to serve as a good headmaster OR minister of magic. In terms of the MoM position, he would be far too meddlesome and controlling over some things, and way to passive about others. He would likely push the ministry in his own personal directions and lack the ability to separate his personal ideals, thoughts, and passions, from the true needs of the job. He is not exactly a true leader, despite his popularity in the wizarding world.

Now to be fair, he likely would of been the best option for the MoM position in a ministry in a time of war, simply because he would be a strong figurehead and inspire confidence. Not to mention at such a time, the Ministry would be heavily focused on certain goals. But in peace I can see him ending up causing more trouble then good as the Minister.

** Against.

While Dumbledore is arguably the most powerful force of Good in the Wizarding World, there is a reason why he refuses the position of Minister multiple times. He has more power to shape the world where he is, and his current positions will last longer.

If Dumbledore were to accept the position of Minister he would hold the seat for a single election cycle, maybe two. Fudge keeps in power because the corrupt system wants him there. How long would a Good person stay in power if those with the money didn't want him there?

Whether through a shift in public opinion because of how liberal Dumbledore is, or through a smear campaign funded by the Malfoys, Dumbledore would not last long as the Minister. Since being the Minister would likely pull him away from his other jobs, or so the conversations he has with Harry in the book imply, after his term he would be without any power base to fight the Dark elements of society. By ceding the position he is able to solidify the power he has, curbing the worst effects of the Wizengamot and shaping the future through the students of Hogwarts.
