** It's a decent story so far. Ben reading it since it came out. Let's see if it survives the curse of Gamer-Stories.

** Lots of passages copied from Methods of Rationality and then altered to fit in. For example, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11950816/6/Harry-Potter-the-Game][chapter 6]]:

#+begin_quote
  And she told him of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the Dark Lord, Voldemort.

  "Voldemort?" Harry whispered. It should have been funny, but it wasn't. The name burned with a cold feeling and a ruthless diamond clarity. A chill swept over Harry and his mana fluctuated in sync with the very magic that saturated the air of the pub even as he pronounced the word. It seemed as if the age old adage that names have power was truer than most thought it to be.

  The Dark Lord had raged upon wizarding Britain, tearing and rending at the fabric of their everyday lives. Other countries had wrung their hands but hesitated to intervene, whether out of apathetic selfishness or simple fear, for whichever was first among them to oppose the Dark Lord, their peace would be the next target of his terror. No one really knew what his true motives were, though his followers claimed it to be blood's purity, so that's what the world believed.

  And she told him of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the Dark Lord, Voldemort.

  "Voldemort?" Harry whispered. It should have been funny, but it wasn't. The name burned with a cold feeling, ruthlessness, diamond clarity, a hammer of pure titanium descending upon an anvil of yielding flesh. A chill swept over Harry even as he pronounced the word, and he resolved then and there to use safer terms like You-Know-Who.

  The Dark Lord had raged upon wizarding Britain like a wilding wolf, tearing and rending at the fabric of their everyday lives. Other countries had wrung their hands but hesitated to intervene, whether out of apathetic selfishness or simple fear, for whichever was first among them to oppose the Dark Lord, their peace would be the next target of his terror.
