**** Well Francis is like the bill weasley , he's a trouble maker who stands up for what's right and ends up in gryffindore because he's not afraid of standing up for others or being a martyr.He doesn't apply himself unless the topic interests him and his grades are just average as a result. He is too headstrong and stand-offish to even be considered for prefect but in his seventh year Dumbledore makes him head boy because he sees signs of his natural leadership skills and adaptability , after graduation he then leaves the country to do a bunch of odd jobs to get away from his controlling mother , but eventually settles down to a bland ministry desk job which he loves but hides from his mother to be able to send howlers back and forth. He becomes a department head of a medium sized department at some point but never climbs higher due to no desire to have more responsibility than necessary.

**** Yeah good point. I was thinking Ravenclaw because he's super creative being a prodigy musician, but Slytherin would work too.
