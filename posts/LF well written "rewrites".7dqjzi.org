I'm fairly new to the Harry Potter fan fiction game specifically, and this fandom has so many fics over so many different platforms I'm finding it hard to find fics I like with my usual perusal methods I have for other fandoms.

Primarily, I'm looking for stuff that bears resemblance to The Arithmancer, Accidental Animagus, RiddellLee's Only a Boy, the Laocoons children series, and to a lesser extent methods of rationality and Harry crow. Picking up either from where book one starts or even before, adding something to the base of the story that changes canon as it goes forward.

However, if you have recommendations of well written fics that are /complete/ (the rewrites don't need to be complete, most of them aren't, which is sad, but it's a lot of work to write epics that size) of any pairing, any situation, any anything as long as it's exceptional in your eyes, send it along too. I've got a lot of time and two very hungry eyes.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

** How do you feel about time travel? Neither of these are that, but time travel is present in a lot of rewrites.

linkffn(2866740)

Grey Maiden series has Harry raised by a morally questionable witch, which results in him being sorted into Slytherin and much more Harry vs. The World than anything else. Author loses steam and quits after book IV, but not a bad read.

linkffn(6919395)

The Changeling is a fic where you have to accept the premise (canon!Ginny sorted Slytherin) and everything that follows after that is extremely good. No spoilers, but Changeling Ginny might be my favorite of the fandom. Complete, with a complete sequel.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** FWIW, these fics are sometimes referred to as Alternative Universe (AU) stories (or if you want to get more specific, For Want of a Nail stories), so you can check out past threads on this subreddit with AU in the title for more suggestions.

Surprised no one's mentioned linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) before. AU with a Slytherin Harry, but the author takes a ton of tropes from those types of stories and provides solid, in-universe reasons for why they exist. Well written, interesting, and still updating at a sporadic pace.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
