I'm looking for a particular Dramione story where Hermione and Draco have a year-long potions assignment that they are forced to work on together, and they create a potion to heal scars left by Dark magic. I believe Hermione is Head Girl but Draco isn't Head Boy, and I think I remember it being a fic where they return for an 8th year of schooling. I can't remember everything about it, but I do recall a scene where they are testing the potion on Draco's back in her common room, and they're keeping a log where they check the difference in the scars every 15 minutes.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: I also remembered that at the end, Hermione buys Draco his first healer's robes, as the potions project was vital for his acceptance into the healer training program.


** Oh holy crap, I remember reading this one. Chiming in, in hope that someone has an answer.

*** I've been looking for it for a while now, because I've had it stuck in my head and I want to reread it, but I can't remember a thing about the title.

**** I can't remember either! But the last Dramione fanfic I read was far too long ago so I can't be any help in the matter. It just sounds like something I've come across before that I would like to reread.

Actually, do you have any Dramione recommendations?

***** I usually have written list, but I misplaced it recently. Off the top of my head, /Turncoat/ by eliyaze is a fic I tend to recommend a lot if you want a long, war fic. /Aurelian/ (can't remember the author) has a great original after-Voldy plot. If you're looking for a fun, shorter fic, /Dragon Hide/ by JDPhoenix is one that I've read recently. And /The Request/ by redhead414 is a good Dramione fic if you're looking for a more adult-aged, family problems kind of plot. (I just realized I listed a bunch. Sorry, I've been on a Dramione streak lately.)
