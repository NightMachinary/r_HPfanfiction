Hello all :)

​

Here are the story facts from what I remember lol:

​

1. If I remember correctly, I think it is a do-over (I think)
2. Harry goes to the Ministry, and finds one of Voldemorts hidden DE's named Green (convinces him to take him to Azkaban)
3. He visits Sirius in Azkaban, and gets him a trial. (I believe he (Harry) finds out about some Potter lawyers from the Goblins - Mights be blending another story here ;) )
4. Harry steals the Philosophers stone, and gifts it to Voldemort later on - through Green. (He also proves he can't die, by having Green AK him - in a room at the Leaky) - (Green later on shows the memory to Voldemort - with Harry's permission)
5. Harry is studying Necromancy - at the instruction of Death himself, and is coming up with a better ritual for 4th year. (He discovers a physical response - much later on that he is very much embarrassed about - like most teenagers are ;) )
6. Harry and Voldemort eventually get into a relationship together in the story, and rule together - I can not remember Harry's name in front of the DE's.

​

I am really hoping this is enough information for someone to help me find this one. :) I also believe this one can be found on [[https://FF.Net][FF.Net]]. but if there is a link to it on AO3 I would take that also ;)

  What if that night in Godric's Hollow went differently? What if Harry did die? What if Death stepped in and made a deal with the Savior of the Wizarding World? How different would Harry's life be after that deal? (Or, Harry makes a deal with Death and in exchange gains something Voldemort has fought his entire life for. Immortality. And a strange friendship with Death) (Harry/Tom)

*** No you are not the only one to notice the trend.

And it is due, mainly in my opinion, to them being the bad boy, and Voldemort is the Ultimate in the Bad Boy category. Despite the major age gap.

When I first got into HP Fanfic, I avoided slash fics, with m/m relationships like they would give me the plague. Then I accidentally read one, mainly because it was miss marked in the summary, and relationship area ;) but from then on I was hooked. I mean I still do read the normal f/m categories when the mood hits me.

I do have my favorites in those after all, lol. But m/m is the mood I have been in lately, and for 2 enemies to get together, and Harry to help his enemy, it just gets my depressed mood to be batter. Thats mainly why I read them. ;)

I do really enjoy Fem!Harry fanfics more, especially when he is paired with a character that is hardly used, (ex:Cedric) because who could turn away from a Yummy Cedric. But those stories are so hard to find, and most are abandoned. :(

I would take requests in that department (Fem!Harry w/other Characters such as Cedric, Marcus Flint, Neville, etc. especially well written)

**** Do you think most of those writers are female? The whole "lover reforming the bad boy" seems like something more appealing to women, even without the "gay factor", lol.

And yeah, I also stay away from those stories like the plague, especially since it seems they tend to be written much worse for some reason.

Although, not gonna lie, a guilty pleasure for a little while was fem!Voldemort/Harry and, weirdly enough, fem!Harry/Harry. Don't ask about the latter, because I don't know why lol.

*** One reason might be the number of options: the obvious non-canon folks to pair Harry with are Hermione and Ron, and certainly a lot of het fics pair him with Hermione, but a lot of people don't like Ron/don't think they would suit. So people have to go further afield, and Harry just doesn't interact much with that many people. In his own age group, the ones he has the most to do with are the Weasleys, Neville, Malfoy, or Cedric. If you are a slash writer and you don't want to hook him up with them, you're probably looking at adults.

Relatedly, it also seem like there is less emphasis on OCs or might-as-well-be OCs on slash fandom. Het fic has a lot of shipping Harry with people who basically have to be created from whole cloth because they were maybe mentioned a few times (Daphne Greengrass), and if you're willing to go with characters who have a name and maybe a line or two, you have a lot more same-age options. I see less of that in slash; though it is still a thing, it's rarer.

Finally, there are some people who like shipping people who would never get together in canon, even to the point of shipping folks who hate each other and are trying to kill each other. While Harry/Malfoy fics are of course a thing, most of Harry's real antagonists are adults. (And that's not just limited to slash, of course...there is a surprising amount of Hermione/Snape out there, too.)

**** Eh, not to tread on your toes, but that rationale seems like a bit of a stretch to me, because Harry doesn't interact particularly much with Snape either - and if cannon interactions are what we're looking at (since why would it be important otherwise?) - then those interactions would not help, as they're overwhelmingly negative.

The "not enough options" seems like an even worse justification of this, since by that logic, Harry doesn't have many hetero pairings either. And it's just flat out weird to say, "well, there's not that many X options in cannon, better pair him with a (pedophile?) adult 3x his age". You get what I'm saying?

I actually like snarky Snape in some fics, but I hate how Rowling made him an iredeemable asshole then tried to throw in some BS redemption arc... It make him seem even more creepy, to be honest.

***** Well, he does have quite a few interactions with Snape throughout the series, but yes, almost entirely negative. That said, if you like rival/enemy pairings, that might make it more appealing.

And I think it's less any of the individual reasons I gave but a combination, as you're right that they are weak in isolation but there is a lot of crossover.

For example, you're right that there aren't a ton of hetero pairings that make sense for Harry either. In fact, I'd say there are even fewer het options comparatively, since basically the only female characters he has any substantial and/or meaningful interactions with are Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Molly, Cho, Fleur, McGonagall, and Bellatrix (and even some of those are very slight); there are a lot more guys he interacts with in canon, both students and adults.

But I've seen a lot more hetero fics that are like “fuck it, I know he never talked to this person in canon but imma hook them up” in a way that I think is a lot rarer in slashfic (compare the combined percentage of Harry/Daphne and Harry/Tracey in hetfic to the combined percentage of Harry/Blaise and Harry/Theo in slashfic, and while they're both a fairly small percentage of their group the former is comparatively larger, even though they're basically the same “non-Malfoy-affiliated Slytherin who has no actual character and never actively goes after Harry” setup). If you're willing to do that, then your options are a lot less limited (since at that point you're basically creating an OC, which a some folks don't love).

But yeah, that is part of the problem with Harry having such a small social group of his own age but a large group of adult protectors/enemies. I imagine if there were more female Death Eaters we'd see a lot more of the Harry/adult on the het side too (and there is a decent amount of Harry/Bellatrix and some Harry/Narcissa out there as-is), but the DE do kind of seem to be a sausage-fest.

And really, any time you have a canon where your main characters are kids who are largely interacting with adults and you have any kind of shipping whatsoever, you are going to end up with kid/adult fic as well as adult/adult and kid/kid (not that the last is that much better); that is just how romance fic for this kind of fandom works. I think HP just tends to have fewer developed fellow kid characters and more developed adult characters than some fandoms of that kind, hence tilting even more in that direction.
