** Yea I think the canon age difference (7 years, so 14/21) is most awkward at this time period. Kinda an uncanny valley, a bit to close to some real life situations for most.

I recall one with a time traveling Harry going back and saving sirius that was paired with tonks? Second year I think? Eh, wasn't good enough to make my save list.

Edit: actually, aren't some of the bodyguard fics (where tonks deaged herself to pose as a schoolgirl and protect Harry) set in GoF? Bodacious maybe? Or are all those 5th year?

*** Given that wizards can live for over a century, I get the feeling that a 7 year age difference wouldn't be strange at all in the Wizarding World.

*** A vast majority of the Honks fics start in 4th year, yeah. But Harry is mature for his age and Tonks is immature and a woman, so it's fine /s

**** I'm not sure what you're talking about. There are certainly some Honks fics that start on fourth year, but the vast majority of the ones I've seen either start in fifth year, with them hooking up while Tonks is guarding Harry, or in sixth year, when they both need some comfort after Sirius dies.

** There's the R series with a de-aged Tonks, but if you mean canon world with ages as is I doubt it as she'd be 22 years old.
