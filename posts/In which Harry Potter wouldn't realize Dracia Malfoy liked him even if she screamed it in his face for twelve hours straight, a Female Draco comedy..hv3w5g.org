Harry Potter is kinda an idiot when it comes to love.

which makes sense, considering how he was raised.

Dracia Malfoy is unfortunately madly in love with him (well, as madly in love as a girl her age can be), but due to her upper crust upbringing and not wanting to be mocked by her fellow Slytherins she tries to be subtle.

With all the above information, it's rather obvious that her attempts at flirtation fly so far above Harry's head that they may as well be spaceships.

Can Dracia get her message through Harry's thick skull without completely destroying her reputation?

Or will Harry's oblivious nature and Hermione's attempts to protect Harry's Purity drive her stark raving mad?

"DAMN YOU POTTER! HOW DARE YOU BE IMMUNE TO MY FEMININE WILES!" Dracia screams to the heavens in the Dungeons.

"She knows we can all hear her, right?" Asked Crabbe.

"If you wanna ask her and get hexed into oblivion be my guest" replied Goyle.


** It's a great opportunity to involve Crabbe and Goyle more. Ron, Hermione and the suffering Slytherin boys would bicker and fight for a bit before finding an odd camaraderie.

Then in second year, they start organizing the betting pool.

** Dracia had been screaming that she liked Harry, to his face, for the last seven hours (ever since breakfast). It was beginning to become a tad concerning. Harry looked at Hermione and Ron quizzically and held up a small sign which read, /Do you think she's been cursed? I mean she's a terrible person, but that's GOT to damage your throat./

It wasn't really Harry's fault. Someone yelling at you for most of your day tends to have two main consequences: firstly, a headache, and secondly a disinclination to believe such ardent protestations.

**** I feel like the name of a genderbent character should be reminiscent of the original name. Which is why if I had to pick a fem!Harry name, it would be Holly.

The constellation tradition makes that troublesome for Draco though. Delphinus is the best fit that I'm aware of, but that's not all that close and it's kinda tainted by Delphini's existence

But then, the tradition is from the Black family, not the Malfoys, IIRC. It wouldn't be unreasonable to chuck it.

** 11 year old Dracia tries to impress 11 year old Harry the only way she knows how - she panics and talks like her mother does. Harry, taking an immediate dislike to this apparently bigoted girl, humiliates her in front of the Great Hall when she makes it clear she likes him - and she decides he's to be her nemesis instead.

Dracia has never really felt the way her parents seem to about Muggleborns, but she's also not stupid enough to ever let them know that. It doesn't take her long to realise that at Hogwarts, things are more than a bit different to how her parents have made them seem. She and her friends Giselle Goyle and Victoria Crabbe soon realise that tying their fortunes to the old, conservative attitudes and a long-gone dark lord aren't going to get them very far in the world beyond their parents' drawing rooms, but know that their parents can never find out that their children have developed a network of favours and friendships encompassing halfbloods and Muggleborns in Slytherin and beyond. And neither can that dreadful, reckless, judgemental Potter.

Follow Dracia as she begins to invest in the people around her, and protect those investments from two-faced teachers, pretenders out to revive anti-Slytherin sentiment, escaped convicts, people who cheat at organised sporting events, even more dreadful teachers, and even herself before facing the worst enemy of all...

That stupid, stupid crush on Potter.

** Warning: density levels dangerously close to forming a black hole, puerile innuendos and that one old meme.

"No, you have to kind of push up at this degree--"

"I've tried that already, and it doesn't work!"

Harry Potter repressed the urge to scream. Ron and Hermione were great and loyal friends, and honestly more than he deserved, but he swore to Merlin, if the two didn't stop bloody arguing all the time...

"Well you clearly didn't do it right!"

"Why, I never--"

"That's it!" Harry declared, grabbing his book and things, "I'm leaving!"

His two friends immediately stopped arguing, stunned at his outburst. "...where are you going, mate?"

"I can't focus like this! So I'm going somewhere nice and quiet!" And with that, Harry swept past in blur.

By the time he had stormed out of the room, he had somewhat cooled off, and a part of Harry felt a bit bad for blowing up on his friends. It was almost enough to make him come back and apologize. Except that part shrivelled up and died when, upon nearing the door, he heard them continue screaming at each other.

"-- no, you can't just change the incantation like that and expect a spell to come out!"

"I'm telling you, Wanda Goubyrrh works perfectly fine!"

And so, Harry turned on his heels, feeling completely vindicated in his decision to leave. In doing so, he missed Ron's saying "Want to try that out?", and Hermione's subsequent blush. He also missed the rest of their screams, but that was more because they finally got around to putting up a silencing charm.

-------------------------------------------------------

Harry sat in a random abandoned classroom, glaring at the book before him so hard, that had he known the legendary Amaterasu spell, the book would already be burning. But maybe that wouldn't be so bad; if it were a bit singed, perhaps he could more easily convince it to impart him its wisdom?

"Overtaxing your brain, Scarhead?"

Harry startled, almost falling off the bench he was sitting on in surprise. He whirled around, only to see a highly arched eyebrow, pointing down towards a pair of large, ocean-like eyes that threatened to pull him in, and round, cherry-red lips that curved upwards in a way that made his stomach boil. How he hated that smirk.

"What do you want, Malfoy?" Harry ground out, while pushing back the bench without standing and subtly reaching for his wand. She seemed to be alone, so she probably wasn't going to try to curse him, but he wanted -- no, needed to hold his wand -- just in case. Just in case he got a chance to even the score -- he was by far a better duelist than her.

"Oh, nothing! I was just wandering by, minding my own business when I saw a little black pot thinking so hard it cracked, so naturally, I just had to stop by!" Dancia Malfoy's smile was dazzling -- so much so that Harry wondered if he was in danger of being blinded by her arrogance.

"I don't have time to deal with you today, Malfoy," replied Harry. Having solidly grasped his wand and maneuverered it under the table before the bench such that he was ready to whip it out in a moment's notice, he felt much better about his chances should the confrontation turn physical -- or, rather, magical.

“You, busy?” Malfoy crooned, before sitting down opposite of him and leaning over, her long, lustrous hair cascading down onto the table. Harry tried to slam the book close before she could get a good look -- it wasn't anything embarrassing, but since it was Malfoy being nosy, it was the principle of things -- and to no avail, it seemed, judging by the girl's smirk. Sometimes, Harry wandered if she smirked more than she breathed.

“Hah! You, Gryffindor's Golden Boy, are struggling with transfiguration?” Her eyes were narrowing in excitement, and her aristocratic features seemed even sharper in that moment. For a brief moment, he wondered if Malfoy was a cat animagus -- she treated him -- and everyone else, really -- haughtily and dismissively, and would come and go, occasionally stopping by to drop off questionable gifts -- just like Ms Figg's cats. But no, Professor McGonagall was a cat animagus, and she was one of his favourite people -- so Malfoy couldn't be a cat animagus. A voice in his head mused if it meant that she was a cat anthromagus.

“And if I am?” Transfiguration required thinking in terms of essence and accidents (as well as enough imagination and visualisation that made most promising students of transfiguration thoroughly enjoy parts of puberty); conjuration, though, he couldn't wrap his head around. Hermione likened it to quantum mechanics, but he understood /that/ even worse.

“Just wondering what your Head of House would say, that's all,” Malfoy smiled sweetly, looking to all the world as if butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.

Harry though, wasn't too bothered by that. “She would say, yet again, that though she regrets I failed to inherit my father's flair for the subject, I am my own person, and judging against the average student, I'm doing quite fine.”

Malfoy froze for a moment, clearly having expected him to react negatively. Harry mentally crowed in his head -- he was well on his way to even the score! But she gathered herself admirably quickly. “Still, Potter, struggling at conjuration? Some of your ancestors were practically pioneers in the field!”

“And yet I am my own person, not my ancestors.” Malfoy sat gaping, her mind unable to process the idea that someone could live with letting down their family legacy. 1-1!

“Bu-B-But you don't care about your family's legacy?”

“No.” Harry leaned back (on thin air -- it was mostly to tease Malfoy) nonchalantly. “I respect them for what they have achieved, but it does not mean I have to live my life exactly like them, nor that I will ignore their flaws and mistakes”, Harry said, further frying Malfoy's brain.

But as much as he delighted etching the sight of Malfoy's baffled face into his mind, from her impossibly wide eyes to her creasing forehead, to her round trembling lips that couldn't decide if they wanted to close or open, to her twitching ears (yet another quirk of hers that lay credence to his pet theory), to her silky strands of hair that seemed magnetic to his hands, Harry knew that he really did need to figure just what bloody Maester Meleth meant. So, he cleared his throat.

“Look Malfoy, as much as I enjoy the sight of you battered and defeated,” Malfoy gave a strangled choke to that, “I really do need to study. So if you could kindly b*gger off, I'd be much obliged.”

Several moments passed, yet Malfoy was still sitting there. Harry tapped his feet impatiently. “Come on, Malfoy, I haven't got all day!”

A few more moments passed. “Why did you come here anyways?”

Dancia muttered something incomprehensible while trying to hide her face in her arms.

“What was that?” Harry crossed his arms sternly, only to hear more inaudible muttering. “You know what? I'm out of here!”

And with that, Harry again swooped out of the room, in a manner that a part of Dancia's mind recognised as similar to Professor Snape's. And he didn't even close the door!

“Damn you, Scarhead!” echoed down the hall, making Harry walk even faster. Why oh why could he never get any peace and quiet?

Behind him, Malfoy's shoulders drooped as she quietly whispered “I just wanted to help him. Why do I always mess things up?”

//notes: the end is what happens when you turn on a random playlist that starts with upbeat, cheerful songs and ends with softer, more melancholic ones.

- on questionable gifts: i imagine that in situation when they were younger and less antagonistic, when Malfoy was bragging about the Abraxas that her Father owned, and Harry commenting that he'd like to try riding one someday, and the silly girl sends him a saddly for Christmas or something -- emblazoned with the Malfoy crest, of course; anyone who's played CKII with WoL will know what i meant. And no, Harry doesn't think that cat-fem!Draco is his pet; rather, he recalls that one cat his crazy neighbour had that treated him very disdainfully but occasionally brought him dead animals.

- Harry is closer to McGonnagall here in this AU.

- i know, like, nothing about quantum physics, aside from the fact that it treats boolean logic like a quaint notion. I would know, i'm treating canon magic like a quaint notion aswell :P . The idea was that transfiguration, is when you keep a part of an object (its essense) and convince the universe that everything else is an accident. Conjuration is more like retroactively making sure an object exists: it both does and doesn't, until it does.

The idea was that harry was good at transfiguration, but bad at conjuration, and the other way around for fem!Draco, which would represent their ways of thinking: transfiguration is a bit more rigid and better structured, while conjuration is all kinds of twisted and somewhat arbitrary if you don't understand all of its principles -- a bit like their morals, really. And the reverse is true for their thoughts on family legacy: fem!draco's thoughts on that are very traditional and stiffling, while harry's more chill about it. Now that i wrote this out, i realize that the metaphor wasn't quite as good as it sounded in my head, but meh; please message me if you manage to make that work

Anyway, this is about all i care to write at this moment. If anyone wants to continue this or just steal ideas from it, feel free; though let me know first so i can read your fic :D
