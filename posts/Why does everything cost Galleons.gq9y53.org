What I mean is - why don't authors use the other coins as well. Sure, for canon things like food or the paper they do, but everything else? It's somehow a round number of Galleons every time.

Oh, you want a book? That'll be two gold coins. Not one and seven, or one and three - two. Round two.

Fun.

Not! In the real world, prices are carefully calculated based on costs, and then the salesman adds as much profit as he can reasonably get away with, without looking like the greediest fellow this side of the Missisippi. Then, the prices are adjusted based on psychology - I'm sure you've all heard that 9,99$ sells better than 10$. That's because humans are basically monky and think less number = amazing deal.

In the magical world, similar things would happen, but not just as a copy of the muggle world (I'm tired of people copying muggle stuff and then slapping magic over it, btw. How is it possible to take Magic, the funnest thing since fiction itself, and attempt to fuse it with stockbrokering, the unfunnest thing since money?). Magical investments would be /wild/. Oh, you've invested in cheap, transfigured cauldrons? Someone managed to alchemize wood into iron and now your stock has crashed. Oh, you're investing in expensive potions ingredients? Auror Weasley led an auror bridgade and uncovered a ring to violently harvest materials. Now you're implicated.

And that's only investments. Based on what we know about the wizards' fondness for magical numbers, most prices would end in 7, 3 or 13, not the highest number before the coin flips into the larger denomination.

So maybe a book would sell better if it were 3 Galleons and 7 sickles, instead of just 3 Galleons?


** Ha! I was just thinking that while writing a fic, I actually had to pull up a table with the difference between Galleons, sickles, and knuts, and that should answer your question.

Wizarding currency is very weird in its equivalency from one to the other, not following a mathematical pattern, so unlike JK who had some "logical" prices on things, most authors just choose to use the Galleon as the basic currency, whereas in canon a Galleon is a lot of money for day-to-day use.

Many people base that on a Wand costing seven Galleons, that's a /lot/ of money, something like a 100-200 dollars or more when you think about a salary of 2000 dollars(ignore the exchange rate for a bit and think Ron had to use a second hand /broken/ wand) think of how a 1000 Galleons was considered a fortune more than enough to start up a business as it's only real capital, also enough money people were willing to risk their lives for it.

So Ron had a good reason to balk at Harry just casually dropping 30 Galleons to buy three Omniculars. Yeah, Canon Harry was more than a little loaded, JK never specified how much because she doesn't like constraining the plot with numbers, but he was supposed to be much better than the entirety of the Wesleys, even with Bill, Percy and Charlie included.

*** From what I could tell, the wizarding world has this weird mix of a post-scarcity economy and a third world one.

7 galleons is 35 pounds. The Triwizard cup might actually match up to some academic competitions with a prize of 5000 pounds.

**** Yeah, but the thing is this doesn't add up with the equivalence, for all we know, 100-200 galleons could be a monthly salary.

Now, I don't know about the UK costs for a small business but 5000 pounds doesn't sound like a lot of capital for it.

** Because most writers don't have an interest in getting into in depth economics. I have seen a couple do it, but most just want to move past it to get to the interesting part of the story.

I will tell you that with my DnD group, we refuse to use anything besides gold coins even though there is an easy Base 10 conversion to other currencies. We even had one game where the DM tried to introduce different cities having different types of currency but the whole party refused and insisted on knowing the gold coin value of all currencies and then just noting that amount. Refusing to deal with the complicated wizarding currency as a writer is much the same mindset. "This isn't what I'm here for, it isn't interesting, it isn't fun, and I'm going to streamline it to the bare necessities so I can move past it to the interesting parts."

*** you don't even have to meticulously calculate everything. just add 2 sickles or 5 knuts to it. i can understand in dnd you might wanna keep it simple since you have to keep track of your money, but in a fanfiction there is no narrative difference between 2 galleons 4 knuts and just 2 galleons. it just makes it more believable and adds flavour.

**** Well, my approach is to just not state any prices. Leave it blurry in the background and then no one is thinking about it. If I specify numbers for anything, I feel the need to calculate it because I know someone will and if the math doesn't make sense there will be at least one person who's immersion is broken.

what would they calculate? for example they can not know how much more valuable a self-cleaning cauldron is than a non self-cleaning one. a self-cleaning charm does not exist in the real world so any attempt at pricing they might have would be just as fictitious as yours.

****** I'm more concerned about forgetting the conversion from knuts, sickles, and galleons and winding up with something stupid when I'm just throwing random numbers at a fic. Maybe it is because I'm the sort of person to get thrown out of a fic if I catch math that doesn't make sense, but it is something I get paranoid about as a writer. If I /ever/ state any number in a fic, you can bet I have done at least some basic math to make sure it adds up properly.

Maybe I'm just a nerd. I've drawn Punnett squares and calculated allele frequencies for my smut before, so I might just have a different way of approaching fiction than the average person.

******** I have a tendency to dive into worldbuilding with my smut. That includes figuring out how common certain traits would be in a given population. In part to ensure that whatever assemblage of phenotypes I'm presenting in a fantasy race is actually sustainable given Hardy--Weinberg equilibrium (they would be in any naturally evolved species, but would not necessarily be so in an artificial species). Also in part to ensure that inheritance is depicted accurately for any children that show up (I often include them if only to showcase the genotype/phenotype relationships I have come up with).

Note that this still applies even if you assume some form of non-Mendelian inheritance such as epigenetics (magically influenced or otherwise) or when certain genotype combinations are infertile resulting in no phenotype. As an example from Harry Potter, some writers theorize that the child of a Veela is a Veela regardless of who the father is. I'm not going to touch that without trying to figure out how their reproduction functions at a cellular and genetic level and the resulting implications on what the rules for their inheritance would be. It could be something simple like the gene for Veela experiencing Complete Dominance and a Veela womb spontaneously aborting any embryo that does not have it, but it could also be more complicated. I've been contemplating Mendelian inheritance through the magical core and have genetic data be encoded in the magical core itself. This would open the door for making some traits haploid, some diploid, some triploid, and even some hexadecaploid if I wanted to all within a single species that would still be diploid in their DNA. It would also open the door for Lamarckian inheritance or somethign similar. Probably with the presence of a certain phenotype rewriting the genotype and making inheritance non-Mendelian. It can't happen IRL (that we know of), but the fun of writing in a fantasy setting is bending what is possible.

For a non-HP fanfiction example, I had fun exploring what would happen upon pairing an Asari with a Saiyan. Both are alien species that have shown an ability to reproduce with humans but have the offspring of such a union be recognizable as a member of their own species more so than a human. In canon, children of an Asari/Human pair (Asari/anything sentient really) are referred to as Asari and explicitly stated to be indistinguishable from pure bred Asari. Meanwhile, children of a Saiyan/Human pair are referred to as half-Saiyan but I have been unable to note any traits which differ from regular Saiyans (except some minor details of how hair behaves). While the former is more explicitly described in canon, I have had to form a headcanon for how the latter works by extrapolating from what little details are provided between fight scenes.

My conclusion is that Saiyans have some sort of epigenetic method of taking traits from species they hybridize with while ensuring that their own phenotypes are not diluted. It would match the canon theme of Saiyans having very little in the way of weaknesses and growing more powerful no matter what kind of situation they are thrown in. This just extrapolates it to a population level and has the process continue through generations rather than working solely at an individual level. It would also explain why Human/Saiyan hybrids seem to have an easier time reaching high levels of power than either pure bred Humans or Saiyans.

Combining those, it would seem obvious that an Asari/Saiyan pair would not only be able to reproduce, but would most likely produce a child that would be immediately recognizable as /both/ an Asari and a Saiyan by anyone familiar with either species who did not already know such a pairing had taken place. The result was that when I went to write a Liara/Vegeta ship, the ship itself consisted of some ship teasing early in the fic and waving my hand and going "they hooked up during the time skip". However, before going to describing their child I worked up several Punnett squares for both species to establish what the norms would be for allele frequencies of certain traits would be, how those traits would most likely manifest in each individual, and which ones would be present in their child. That was more important to me than trying to write an actual sex scene.

For non-fanfiction, I have a setting where dragons and dwarves are the same species as well as another where elves, humans, and orcs are all the same species (might end up just making them different regions of the same world). For both, I have had to play around with Punnett squares a bunch to figure out how to tie which phenotypes to which genotypes to ensure a stable population that made use of such a wide range of phenotypes while still being genetically stable in a way that made sense from an evolutionary standpoint. The dragons/dwarves was easy, but the elf/human/orc one got complicated. I ended up adjusting things like how fertility rates and libido levels were tied to certain phenotypes and was using Punnett squares to track the information and calculate appearances of multiple gene phenotypes. Of course, this is all stuff that has to happen before I would even start to try and make individual characters let alone write stories with them.

*TL;DR:* I might have a population genetics fetish. I'm not sure I can do smut without at least referencing children. Fantasy writing quickly turns into a genetics Sci-Fi in my hands and if you haven't guessed at this point I'm a biologist IRL so I go deep.

** Because of the wonky calculations. Instead of say £1.99, we have 1 Galleon, 16 sickles, 28 knuts. Just rounding up makes things less wonky for the author. 17 Sickles in a Galleon and 29 Knuts in a Sickle, or 493 Knuts in a Galleon if you were saving up your pennies, the numbers are really obnoxiously wonky, and if you want to do world building of costs, rounding is FAR easier.

** Does Harry Potter have taxes?

Because I feel like the world doesn't and so everything would be pretty round to avoid the 3 gallons 5 sickles and 12 knuts.

I use gallons as a base line for expensive things and go from there. That bottle of unicorn horn is 200 galleons. That book is 8 sickles. And that candy is 5 knuts.

** Much easier to remember the wand costs seven Galleons, the paper is like a Knut or something? I mean, sometimes it's easier to give the bigger bill and get change back (you probably don't give exact change for every transaction). No one wants to hear he bought candy, handed over a Galleon, and got 17 Sickles, 36 Knuts back in change. It's already dumb enough that they carry around what must be bags of Galleons, Sickles and Knuts - just carry the Galleon instead.

Quoting out the price of every transaction in the stories is already an unneccary filler detail.

*** It would be so much easier to have transfer slips (like a version of a check/cheque) that a merchant could send to Gringotts to have them transfer the correct number of galleons/sickles/knuts from one account to another (likely with a transfer fee somewhere along the line). Gringotts seems to be the only bank in Wizarding Britain, so it would make sense.

You're not the first to wonder about that. I wrote a one shot with the goblins realizing that they would run out of galleons, since everyone used them instead of sickles and knuts. It's humor, but relevant I think.

** I've read a few fics where the authors use galleons/sickles/knuts prices (like the old British pounds/shillings/pence or £sd prices), but it's pretty rare. Really, I think it comes down to that being more work so most authors don't bother.

Not to mention that when JKR decided that 50 pounds to the galleon was too much, she took it all the way down to 5 pounds per galleon, making the Weasleys absolutely destitute in Chamber of Secrets, having less than 10 pounds in their bank account.

[[/u/Choice_Caterpillar][u/Choice_Caterpillar]] did a search of the canon books and converted everything into knuts to show the relative prices of everything in canon. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fjinil/articlea_crazily_comprehensive_canon_exploration/]]
