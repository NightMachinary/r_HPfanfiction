Hey Guys

I am once again looking for another Fic. This time i am looking for fanfics where Harry and Friends go to war in some kind of way. The important bit is that with War i mean WAR not the "little" battles that we know from the harry potter franchise. Whom they fight against i dont really care about. be it Voldemort with a real army, a Host of Demons or Maybe a time skip to the years 1938-1945 in a war against non-Magicals.

we can have harry and friends or just harry fighting in this war.

if Dumbledore has a role to play in the fic i would appreciate it if we dont suddenly have a misguided or evil Dumbledore, although if he in the beginning has a problem with the killing for his own pacifistic reasons thats fine by me.

​

Bonus Points if in the stories Grindelwald and his Army or Riddle and his Munchers get recruited for the "Greater Good" to fight alongside Harry in the Battle(s)

​

Kudos to all of you!!


** I've written several stories centred on such a war. You might like "Divided and Entwined" and "Reformed, Returned and Really Trying", though others also feature a rather bloody war.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  We've been fighting this war for a long time. Muggles, they call us. They struck first. England fell. Then France. Spain. Italy. It took us ten years of tactical withdrawals and air strikes to stop their advance. Now it was our turn to push back.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
