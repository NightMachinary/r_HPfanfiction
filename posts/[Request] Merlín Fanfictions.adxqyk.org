Ok, recently I read a story called “The Past Isn't Set In Stone”linkffn(11574914), and part of the plot was about the famous wizard Merlín and I quite liked it, so I was looking for something with Merlín's story adapted to the wizarding world as we know it ( I don't mind AU) I haven't seen Merlin, the BBC show, so I would like to understand what's happening if it's a crossover, if that's posible.


** This crossover is good. You don't need to know much about the TV series. A quick browse of the episode summaries and you're set.

Merlin has fulfilled his destiny. Albion is alive and beautiful, and magic is no longer feared in the land. But nothing ever lasts. Memories gone, and in his ten-year-old form once more, he's traveled over a thousand years in the future. Now he has a new destiny: he has to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, hide the fact he the Merlin and Defeat a Dark Lord that's messing with magic he knows nothing about.

** linkffn(Only a Boy).

There is no Harry Potter in this fic. Merlin, the warlock (I'm guessing the guy from Merlin itself, not the random dude Rowling popped in her series) is transported to 1991 in the body of a 11 year old. There's also some other stuff that makes his thought processes more like an 11 year old (not completely, but you know what I mean). He's as powerful as you expect, but he's a child and has those child-like moments.
