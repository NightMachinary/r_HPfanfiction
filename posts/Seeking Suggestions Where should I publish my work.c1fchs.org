** The websites that I know as most commonly used are AO3 (Archive of Our Own) and FFN (FanFiction.net), so I would recommend those. I'm not sure if this is completely obvious to you or not, so I am sorry if these suggestions are. Good luck!

*** Thank you! We've been out of the game for a while so we're not sure what's still popular/what's not, so your suggestions are definitely helpful!

** ffn and ao3 are the two biggest, yeah. I post my works on both, and recommend others do the same. It helps reach a wider audience for those who would prefer one or the other
