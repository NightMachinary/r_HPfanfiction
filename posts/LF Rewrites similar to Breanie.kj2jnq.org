I have read both A different Beginning and am currently reading A Second Chance by Breanie. Are there any fix's that have similar premises, while not quite going down the soul-bound and prophecy route that The Beginning stories dived into. Also with a Draco redemption arc if possible. I'm guessing that it's unlikely since it would be a massive story but I thought I'll still try my luck. Would prefer Hinny but it's not a must.
