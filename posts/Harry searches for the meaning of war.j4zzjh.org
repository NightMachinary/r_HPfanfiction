I remember him asking the Dursley's, they said it's complete domination or something along those lines. He then sends out owls to ask his friends, and then while at the park Voldemort, in disguise, tells him a story about a guy who wished for a war. The guy kept trying and failing to start a war against this village, it turned out that he had been monkeys pawed and the war he wished for was given in the form of his challenge of will against the village.

If anyone can help me find this that would be great, I can't find it in my list and it's not going to leave my head until I've reread it.
