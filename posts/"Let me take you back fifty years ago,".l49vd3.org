said Tom Riddle's diary before transporting Harry Potter to June 13th of 1943.

(ie what would happen if the diary didn't only show Harry Tom's memories but actually took him back in time. What will Harry do? Will Hagrid still bear the brunt of Tom's crimes? Will Harry travel back to his own time or will he make the past his present and change the course of history?)


** That's a good prompt idea! I hope some readers here know about fanfictions that has this idea since I personally don't know any. Heck, I don't even really know any fics where a Student Harry goes back in time to when Tom Riddle was attending the school.

*** Welcome to Hogwarts 1949 is similar to this, but the marauder‘s map, not the diary, takes Harry back. It‘s a WIP and not updated in a long while, but what is there is really worth a read.

*** Another similar story is LinkFfn(thousands of reasons to smile by brightsidetolife). Harry chooses to go back in time to help save everyone and goes to Tom's orphanage. A little problem, trouble is bound to follow him wherever whenever he goes starting with the Potters want to adopt him amongst other things.

** I haven't read CoS in a long time but iirc Tom was convincing enough that even Harry suspected Hagrid for a while. It took him a lot to build up the courage to actually go to Hagrid and talk about it (and when he went, Hagrid prompted Harry and Ron to go ask Aragog).

** There's quite a few of these actually! Most are tomarry though so if you don't like that ship you're probably out of luck
