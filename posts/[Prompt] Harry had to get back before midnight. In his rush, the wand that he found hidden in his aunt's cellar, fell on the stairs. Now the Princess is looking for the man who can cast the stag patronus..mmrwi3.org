Just a little Cinderella inspired Harry Potter one shot. The Princess can be whoever you want; Hermione, Ginny, Fluer, it could even be Draco if you want.

I've been thinking of doing Disney inspired one shots.

** You know, this could be hilarious if it were Fleur.

The kicker, though?

Yeah, it was a mistake. Like many blokes, he'd been, ah, "charmed" by the Princess.

Upon going to the Ball though, meeting her and dancing with her, he was pretty much turned off by her snobbishness/haughtiness (let's face it: Fleur was a bit snobby when she was first introduced in GoF, though we know she's actually pretty nice to those she likes).

Unfortunately for him though, she quickly became taken with him.

The Midnight Thing? Perfect excuse for him to GTFO in addition to fable's reason of the magic wearing off.

Unfortunately, one distinct feature was caught by her -- it could be his eyes, his scar, or something more "out there", like an aura imprint under the disguising magic used to hide his identity.

Yeah, he's pretty much shitting his robes when a search begins door-to-door.

** Hogwarts introduces a new tradition, the masquerade ball, to promote inter-house unity. On Ball Night, each of the four common rooms is open to the public student body and plays host to a ball, but anyone can go to any ball. Ball Night lasts all evening on a Saturday, giving people plenty of time to run a circuit if they want. Many people stay in their own common room, which is expected to happen, but about a third of the student body spends the evening wandering around between the four parties being thrown. The idea is to broaden the student's horizons via anonymity, and in the week leading up to the ball, the faculty teach various charms, potions, and other spells that can be used on a disguise or on a person wearing a disguise to make them unidentifiable to people observing them. So the efficacy of a student's disguise is entirely in their own hands. It's a learning experience.

The Slytherin Ball is taken by storm by a clever, witty, insightful young man, who charmed all the women and ingratiated himself in with the men of the house. He wore a simple silver domino mask that only covered the top part of his face around his eyes, but because of the strong enchantments he had placed on it, no one recognized him. He managed to charm and entertain the entire house, even the upper years, but vanished before midnight when the ball ended. Now the hunt is on as people quietly want answers: who was that tall, dark, clever student that seemed to fit so well with Slytherin, and why wasn't he sorted into Slytherin in the first place? The quiet but serious search for the stranger dubbed "Cinderella Man" has begun.

Optional: Harry actually visited all the houses and nobody recognized him, but everyone wants to know who he was because they found Harry's unrestrained and 'anonymous' personality enthralling. Even his own housemates do not realize it was him, because he told everyone he would be spending the evening in his dorm catching up on homework. This is plausible, since he is hardly the only person who ditched the ball, and he is known to be somewhat reclusive, with few friends. However, as a twist, two students DO know the truth: the Weasley twins, who had borrowed the map back from Harry for a period of time for some shenanigans of their own. They had the map open and were having fun using it to "cheat" the ball and identify everyone who stopped by to visit the Gryffindor party, and with the map open, they happened to spot Harry sneaking out of the dorm under the invisibility cloak. Following his progress on the map out of curiosity, the twins put two-and-two together on the day after, and realize that ickle Harrykins must be the mysterious Cinderella Man that has the gossipers and socialites of the castle in an uproar. What do they intend to do with that information? Cause chaos, obviously.

**** I mean, that could actually work. She would just need to cast her patronus and have it hang around by her ankles while she drags the dementor. As a bonus, the dementor can be straining at the end of the rope trying to get away the entire time. Fudge managed to drag a dementor around with him anyway and that one wasn't even restrained.

She manages it through sheer stubbornness. Either that, or she used the dementor as a test subject for her bat-bogey hex and now it's terrified of her.

  The story of how one Harry Potter was whisked away from a life of drudgery, pain, and neglect by the Princess Ginevra (but call her Ginny) with the help of Hermione, Daphne, and Harry's Fairy Dogfather. If only he could bring himself to actually believe it was true and that he deserved it.
