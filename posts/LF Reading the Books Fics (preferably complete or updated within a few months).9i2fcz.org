** /Under a Watchful Eye/ is the best of the lot, in my opinion, though it hasn't been updated in a while (I don't think it's abandoned) and there /might/ be a Harry/Charlie pairing in the future (just kind of implied; no slash yet at all, and none warned for.) linkffn(10917272)

/A Dramatic Reading/ is, if I recall correctly, only done with the first book. It's complete, and not bad. I don't think there's any relationships. linkffn(12324284). I think another author was doing a sequel with CoS, but I don't think it went very far.

Indeed. It's linkffn(A Sensational Story), and it sort of updates once in a blue moon with no warning then slithers back into non-being for another few months.

  A character reads the books story heavy on Sirius and Harry. THERE IS NO ACTUAL RECITATION OF THE BOOKS!

  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** There was one called Pensieve Films, but the author deleted it. Shame because it was good.
