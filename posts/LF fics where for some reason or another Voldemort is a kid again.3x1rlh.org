Reincarnation, Time travel, whatever. Doesn't matter as long as it's not slash. I'd prefer ones where he ends up going to Hogwarts. Some of the one's I've read so far are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6031176/1/Tied-for-Last][Tied for Last]] (the only Tom/Hermione ship I've ever enjoyed reading, mostly because it's a really fucked up relationship they have going), Seventh Horcrux, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9904603/1/Phantasy][Phantasy]] and Althered Destinies.

  Voldemort uses a time spell to keep The Boy Who Lived from killing him. In his weak state, it backfires. Enter 1991. An amnesiac 10 year old Dark Lord is signed up for Hogwarts, and can't seem to figure out why a certain green eyed hoodlum is their hero.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
