I just finished 0-800-rent-a-hero which has Harry as a Divinations teacher and I find I like the concept of Harry teaching quite a lot. He did well with the DA after all. So any FFs that have Harry giving classes of some kind, in Hogwarts or elswhere, during canon or elsewhen, in his dimension or not, would be appreciated.

Thank you


** I don't have a recommendation but i finished Rent-A-Hero literally two minutes ago and i need to rant about the author not updating after that last chapter. I was really looking forward to Tonks' reaction... :(

I truly hope the fic isn't abandoned because i have never read anything that made Divination look so cool; not to mention that Harry/Tonks is awesome and i need more of it.

*** I also loved how the author named the chapters. It's always the hardest part for me but I got a real laugh out of that one. And yeah, I loved how they made divination into an actual branch of magic not just this "You need the talent or you'll never do anything worthwhile in this course" thing they did in canon. Why would they even teach it if that was the case?

** For the longest time I mused about a series where Harry opens a foster house and takes in some war orphans and is somewhere between a teacher and a parent to them, including the children of people that once tried to kill him.

edit: oh, and technically, my Darkness!Harry story will have Harry teaching his friends some spells, an expanded DA, and his Darklings things because of how their minds work, he has to teach them how do to the things he wants them to be able to do. They can't just summon a gun because he wants them to, they have to know how a gun works which means Harry has to know first.

** Try linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero). In it Harry gets unwillingly transported to another dimension and ends up teaching divination. How he teaches it is pretty interesting and the author really did a good job reimagining divination in a way where it's useful to Harry.
