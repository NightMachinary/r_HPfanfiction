** The pairing is "tease the reader with a large cast of potential love interests but never commit to any one of them". Seriously, as the fic goes on it gets very bogged down with keeping all the potential love interests in rotation.

*** Yeah that's about the only thing I don't like about the story, the love interests. It really does bogg down the story at times and can make it a chore to read. The rest of the story is interesting and well done though.

** Note: I haven't read this story.

Comments seem to indicate Harry/Tonks is likely, perhaps Harry/Daphne. Not my cup of tea, but there you go.

*** I don't see how they would fit Tonks in there with how certain things turn out.

**** Ah, well, I wouldn't know! The possibility of those 2 ships disinterests me, so I don't feel like reading it. :)

**** Jumping on this, as people who were recently following Limpieza de Sangre linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre) can tell you, sometimes things are disappointing. Its the risk of being involved in any medium.

Would you not play video games or watch movies if you thought they might end a certain way, or that you could lose?

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

***** If I had known how the Mass Effect trilogy was going to end I wouldn't have played it. Sometimes spoilers save us wasting time on unsatisfying things, not all of us are into reading fiction for the surprise.

**** Well, it's unfinished and the pairing is a very small part of it.

A very small turd will still spoil your food. Honestly, a fic could win the Nobel prize for literature and one for peace and I still wouldn't touch it if it had a Snape, Malfoy or Voldemort pairing.
