So I recently finished an amazing fanfic and most of what I've read since then has just seemed lackluster in comparison. I'm looking for something that is Slytherin character based and has an element of politics involved if possible. Not picky on characters or pairings, but would like it to be pretty lengthy. At least 100k words or more. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!


** ... once again I am here to pitch linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) to the unsuspecting public ðŸ˜‹

A Slytherin portrait comes to life. Brother of Salazar Slytherin. Harry Potter goes missing. .... Things occur ðŸ˜‹.

This is the densest, most politic heavy, intriguing, twisted, scheming, Slytherin story ever written. It has a deep analysis of wizarding politics, laws, history. Magical lore, masteries, war mages, elemental magicians, blood magic, mind Magic, lands, titles, the bloody queen!!!

There's secret societies, hidden identities, spies upon spies. Theres a history of language, world languages, world cultures, forgetton history, how muggle history affected the world. Cold war, ww2. Wizarding wars. Founders. Ancient britain. Founding of Hogwarts and the insane language barriers.

Without even going into the forrest of family trees they've created for this 11 book, 1.5M word monster.

It's incredible. Absolutely incredible. I will never stop hyping it. People can fight me if they want to. I can't give you a summary because I'll spoil it but think of a thing and it's in here I promise ðŸ˜‹

** The Green Girl is a pretty good Slytherin fic. Hermione gets sorted into the serpents house, and the story ensues from her point of view. It presents the events of the War in a different manner. It diverges from canon (obviously) and is completed.

** This is one of the origins of all true Slytherin fanfic (sort of imo... but also sort of fact? One of the oldest Lucius/Narcissa fics out there):

linkffn(2078117)

Technically incomplete but still a solid ending

Also I recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1876930][Brilliant Difficulty]] by Basketofnovas for politics and world building.

** Didn't see this recommended anywhere Significant Digits : ([[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html]]) is a completed work with actual adults dealing with real world politics. Multiple factions and original antagonists. Note that this is an HPMOR sequel even if it can be read independently. Give it a chance independent of your opinions on HPMOR.
