** Expecto nerve gas! Basilisks need to breathe, and most poisonous gasses are denser than air and so sink. They also go through any closed door, as long as it's not air tight (which it can't be, or the basilisk would die from lack of oxygen), so you could just stick your wand into the top of the pipe and get gas conjuring.

Alternatively, pour concrete down the pipe. Doesn't matter if it's not the only air hole if the basilisk can't get out.

Or water, the chamber clearly isn't water tight. Fill it up and wait for it to drown.

Or, making it inhumanly hot or cold in there. Setting off some fiend fire and waiting seems like the easiest way to do that, though freezing would preserve any artifacts that may be down there, and of course preserve the carcass for ingredients. Also you could have a skating party in the chamber once the basilisk was dead.

Bombs would risk the structural integrity of the castle too much for my liking, and all involve quite sophisticated electronics these days anyway, so wouldn't work correctly. Same problem with anti-tank guns, laser cutting equipment, and other high tech stuff.

I'm not sure most animals would fit down the pipe, so no sending in an army of trolls to kill it. You could try take a leaf out of the troll killing book though, and use the old wingardium leviosa on the status of Slytherin and drop it on its head.

Or, you could use this as an opportunity to explore exactly why you shouldn't eat transfigured food. If you transfigured a huge pile of poison into a live cow, and then sent it in to be eaten, would it revert back at some point? Would it retain its poisonous nature even in cow form?

Could you send in an army of kittens to scratch it's eyes out?

**** If an IED is enough, even the old Soviet RPGs should be effective. Hell, at that point, a Panzerfaust from WWII could do the job. Reason being, most of what people think of as "RPGs" fire specialized warheads called high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT), which are shaped charges that force fragmented, hot metal into whatever it strikes at extremely high speeds. [[http://worldoftanks.eu/dcont/fb/imagesforarticles/antitank_rounds/kumulativnimlazanimacija.gif][This is the only animation of it I could find]].

It's been around a while, and once HEAT was advanced enough, some nations abandoned using thick armor altogether because of how irrelevant it was against HEAT. That's somewhat solved now with composite armor (whose details are classified, but involves special plastics and depleted uranium meshes) and ERA, but against a basilisk, even an oldschool HEAT round would be plenty powerful enough. It's just magic scales and flesh, it can't possibly be any more resilient than half a meter of steel.

** Use a duplicating charm until the chamber is so full of <random object you had in your pockets> that the basilisk is unable to move, until it is crushed/suffocated to death by the weight of innumerable <random object> pressing down on it.

Fill the chamber with water from the convenient nearby lake. Perhaps the chamber has waterproofing magic which could be sabotaged, otherwise... well, that shit's gonna be really damp being underneath a girl's bathroom, near a lake, god knows how far underground.

Speaking of... collapsing the chamber on top of it wouldn't seem super hard. I mean, Ron's backfiring wand caused enough rocks to fall to block the way back, so something a little louder (read: confringo, bombarda, etc) should do the trick. It really depends how well you'd rate the structural integrity of Hogwarts proper, which exists directly above the cave you just collapsed. My money is on the castle being mostly fine, but opinions probably vary.

Temperature control charms are, presumably, a thing. Snakes are ectotherms, by and large (dude, what is it using to keep itself warm down there?), so presumably it'd be quite vulnerable to spells that lower ambient temperature over time. If you got lucky, you could probably have it freeze to death peacefully while resting. I mean, unless it's actually warm blooded, which would make a lot more sense for a creature that lived a thousand odd years in a dank cave. One wonders what it ate, actually, though most fics assume it can get out into the Forbidden Forest...
