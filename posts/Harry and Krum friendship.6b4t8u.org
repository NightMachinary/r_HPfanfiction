Are there any fics where they are friends and both play big role in fic?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809][Harry Potter]] [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][and the Boy Who Lived]] - Non-BWL Harry attends Durmstrang. Fic focuses mostly on his magical research. I have some problem with how it often goes into "Harry is so awesome", but it's still a very good read. And of course, it's dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557311][The Magnate]] - Inspired by the above. Might not actually be dead despite last update being two years ago.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Voldemort's mastery of dark power was unrivaled in history. Grindelwald's legendary charisma came a hairsbreadth from bringing Europe to its knees. "Now, which one will it be for you, Mr. Potter?" Massive AU, Durmstrang Harry

** Hey, what a coincidence. Just finished reading [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope.]] Fundamentally Harry/Gabrielle. Despite not liking the actual basis for the fic very much, I still thought it was excellent, though perhaps dragged a little near the end. And, of course, all the problems with having a basically Gary Stu Harry and partner, but we're all used to that by now in fics.

Krum/Harry have a great friendship - not /too/ huge a role in the fic, but pretty interesting all the same.
