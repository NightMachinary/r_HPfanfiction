Former Ginny hater here. After my most recent HP canon re-read I began to appreciate her character more, though I still don't like the way JKR wrote the H/G relationship in HBP (IMO romantic pairings featuring Harry with any of the Weasleys feels a bit incestuous seeing as he's considered them his family since he was 11 years of age...I just can't bring myself to ship it). I'm looking for a story where Harry's relationship with Ginny is similar to that of his with Fred and George or any of Ron's other siblings. I liked Ginny's interactions with Harry in the library scene in OotP, so I'm looking for something like that. I'd prefer no character bashing.

*** I cannot recommend this one enough! I haven't finished it yet, but so far it's been beautiful. I think it might make my all-time favorites list.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.
