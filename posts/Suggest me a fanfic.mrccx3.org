I'm searching for a badass Harry fanfic where Harry's power levels are on par with Dumbledore and Voldemort. Like 'Godfather and Godson' by mark_ward. It does not need to be harem per se. But I prefer Harry and Hermione pairing


** This post should be a request, not a reccomendation.

** linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon) has Harry as a badass and it's hilarious to boot. The fight scenes are pretty great in this one and the Harry/Voldemort duel is kinda intense.
