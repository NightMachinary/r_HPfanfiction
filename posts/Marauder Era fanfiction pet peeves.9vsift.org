Yes, I know we have those three times a week but I don't often see Marauders' Era being mentioned often so I thought we could dedicate a thread to it.


** ”Remus is the smart one”

”Bookworm lily and teachers pet”

”Player sirius with a new girlfriend everyday”

Also having sirius end up with lilys best friend as a girlfriend is so fucking cliche in a jily story.

** - Remus has no particular fondness of chocolate. He only offers chocolate to Harry (and carries some on his person) in Third Year because of the Dementors.

- Remus does not have obvious scars on his face.

- Snape is neither just a victim of cruel bullying, nor a Draco-type bully in his own right whom the Marauders are right to fight off. The impression I have of Snape and the Marauders is that they were largely equivalent in the early days --- theirs was an escalating rivalry where each side kept upping the ante in retaliation of the previous side's prank. (The difference is that, due to the bad influence of his Housemates, Snape didn't stop when the ante reached "serious bodily harm" level, whereas the Marauders grew up and /did/.)

- Don't mix up generations. Narcissa, Lucius, the Weasleys, and the Marauders were all in different years. I'd rather have OCs than "the Marauders' classmates Filius Flitwick and Bellatrix Black", please.

- By the 1970's, Voldemort already looks nearly as snakelike as his modern self. Don't get confused by the common misconception that it was his 1994 resurrection which ensnaked him.

- Pettigrew was not a pushover exclusively made of cowardice and hidden cruelty, rolled up in a student-shaped form. Loathe as they may be to admit it in hindsight, Wormtail was a genuinely good friend to Sirius, Remus and James, whom they genuinely trusted and loved. And though not quite as talented as the other three, he was still an above-average wizard (though his lack of courage made him much more useless in dueling that one would expect from his grades).

- My final pet-peeve is a /lack/ of something which I sincerely hope your fic will at last fill: by the Marauder era, the Curse on the Defence Professorship was already established, though it had not been around for too long yet. Thus, each year should feature a new and colorful Defence Professor O.C. Also, as the curse had not been around long enough to deplenish the supply of competent candidates, you don't have to make them evil or incompetent.

**** Since he got more and more snakelike with every Horcrux, we can make an educated guess based on the dates when he made each one. And we can't be quite sure for 1970, but by the /late/ 1970's he should be about the same as in 1994 (the Death Eaters and even Cornelius Fudge recognize him at a glance post-resurrection, so if there are differences between that body and his 1981 one they must be minimal).

****** I don't think there's a canon quote establishing that but I'd say it's a given - if not exactly horcruxes, his appeareance is most likely the result of his experiments with the Dark Arts and possibly rituals he performed.

When we first meet Tom Riddle in CoS he's a handsome 16yr old. Then after the resurrection he is completely snake-like, barely resembling his teenage self. This quote from when Harry sees the memory of Tom going to Hogwarts to ask Dumbledore about the Defense position is also a clue:

#+begin_quote
  Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years before; they were not as snakelike, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become.
#+end_quote

By this time he has made a few horcruxes (can't remember how many, sorry) and his looks are completely different from his time at the school a few years before. As for him having reptilian features, I'm inclined to believe that it was more based on Tom's parseltongue ability or something like that, as we don't know what other people with horcruxes (such as Herpo the Foul) looked like...

By being very clever and very vindictive. And hey, I'm not saying the Marauders don't come off worse in an ethical calculation, /because/ they outnumbered him --- but my point is that they didn't just keep picking on a defenseless victim --- he fought back. (Who do you think the jinxes and curses in the Half-Blood Prince's Book were meant /for/?)

Again, perhaps the Marauders are still worse at the end of the day, but you have to admit that leaves you with a very different /dynamic/ than "the Marauders keep hurting poor Snape for no reason".

Okay, so as much a good friend as Sirius then. That's not the point. The point is that a bunch of fics constantly drop elephant-sized "hints" about Wormtail's true nature that make one wonder how on Earth the other three could have missed it for that many years. I'm not asking for him to be a saint as a kid, nor have the bestest friendship ever... but he /was/ their trusted friend, or it flings the entire Secret Keeper plotline into nonsensical territory.

As for his characterization, I guess it's possible to write him as already worthless and insufferable as a kid, but I'm against it. I think Pettigrew is much more interesting if he was a good, if flawed, person at the beginning, driven further and further into a vile and evil life by his one big flaw (his cowardice).

we see and hear what he was like as a kid. that's /my/ point. people that swing in the other direction ignore his entire personality. he's a sycophant, and kind of annoying. he's anxious, sniggering, simpering and shrill. these are all his personality traits. that doesn't make him a bad person, it does lay the groundwork for who he is as an adult.

While in practice the result may have been something you could describe as "Snape getting bullied", what I mean is that the Marauders probably didn't see it as them picking on him --- they saw it as them being Snape's nemeses, and fighting him was fair play because he fought them in return (and vice-versa).

(Nor indeed would Snape see it as him having been bullied. His pride wouldn't allow it, for one thing.)

I think it's an important bit of characterization, and it makes their later turnaround more believable.

*********** The Marauders were definitely worse than Snape (before Snape joined the Death Eaters, etc.), but Sirius didn't try and kill Snape (Snape's the only one who thinks Sirius tried to commit murder). It was a dumb, selfish, horrible act ---most likely an attempt to scare Snape into silence, since Snape had been stalking Remus and dropping huge hints that he knew Remus was a werewolf. But it wasn't premeditated murder and Snape still wants to ruin Remus's life, even though Remus had nothing to do with Sirius's actions, by exposing him which would have lead to having trouble getting a job, expelled, etc..

Tomgoes is also a serious Snape stan and often takes things out of context to make Snape look better and the Marauders look worse. Got quite mad at me when I said Snape was part of a hate group, and that made him objectively far worse than a teenager who bullied a fellow student who later grew up, even if Snape somewhat repented.

** - I think a lot of people get Remus wrong. Next to James and Sirius, he often comes across as humourless or even sometimes snide. Having a conscience shouldn't mean that Remus is always a kill joy. In the books he is really good humoured and subtly mischievous.\\
- Same goes for Lily really. I don't think Snape's Worst Memory should be used as a template for her typical behaviour. Slughorn describes her as charming and cheeky. So many people go for this narrative where James and Sirius are wacky, while Lily and Remus stand by rolling their eyes and I hate it. Lily and Remus are funny too, they just aren't obnoxious about it.\\
- I don't mind a bit of Snape bashing - lets face it, he was a pos as a kid. But I prefer it when fics acknowledge that James and Sirius really did go too far, and Lily genuinely liked him at one point and missed his friendship when it ended.\\
- I tend to read Jily fics, and so many of them will have an arc where James' or Lily's parents die (sometimes both separately) and it will be used as a plot device to bring the two closer as one comforts the other. Honestly, I've never seen this handled well. It always feels overly angsty, but in a shallow way? and then it's just dropped and not mentioned again after it stops being relevant to James and Lily's relationship. If you are writing a romantic comedy, just don't include the death of a parent. It doesn't work.\\
- fat jokes about Peter come across as tone deaf to me.\\
- I like remusxSirus, but imo if the story is canon compliant, their relationship only works if it's dysfunctional and angsty. I mean - Sirius ended up suspecting Remus of being the spy, and they both had a whole heap of issues. I just can't picture them in a healthy relationship together at that age.

** One of my pet peeves is when the Marauders are either angels or devils. They were popular and well liked---Hagrid, McGongall, etc. all still think fondly of them. They fought for the Order instead of succumbing to the Death Eaters or staying neutral, which was admirable, and even Peter did for a while before he turned to the Death Eaters. But they were assholes to Snape, four on one is never okay. Even if Snape fought back viciously (using a dark cutting curse on James when James is dangling up in the air) and tried to ruin Remus's life, by going at him with unfair numbers they were escalating the situation and they started a lot of the shit.

But fics always make it seem like they bullied everyone and were universally despised, even though when Snape is being a dick after Sirius dies and makes Harry go through the detention records it seems milder than the Weasley twins pranks---or they are prefect golden boys who never did any wrong.

TLDR: basically, a lot of fics lack nuance.

Fics where Dumbledore is some evil scheming harpy hell bent on getting his claws into them is kind of dumb, too. I don't think he should have recruited barely out of school kids to fight, but in wartime resistance fighters are often young and self-motivated.

Another pet peeve is Lily is perfect and Petunia is a monster. Adult Petunia is a monster, but there's an argument to be had that it was probably tough growing up with Lily and Lily didn't make it any easier. She was her parents favorite, more beautiful, more magical, went for the deep cut when they fought outside of the train station, and hung around with a boy who clearly thought Petunia was useless because she lacked magic and tried to drop a branch on her head.

Peter wasn't stupid and portraying him as some bumbling oaf is out of canon. Sirius is bitter AF, but Peter still managed to become a animangus at a young age, managed to brew a complex potion to bring Voldemort back in the graveyard, etc.

** - remus has no facial scars, or any conspicuous scars iirc

- lucius malfoy doesn't have long hair, or a cane. given draco's future hairline, he probably eventually had less hair than average. i don't think this is a minor point even- the malfoys are described as having slicked back hair. contrary to popular belief, short hair on wizards is the cultural, 'proper' norm, just like the real world. most wizards we see that have long hair are either an eccentric or rebel of some kind (the dumbledores, xeno, sirius, bill, snape). the malfoys are wizarding conservatives. that's how they should dress.

- the dynamic with the marauders and snape. they relentlessly bullied him, motivated in part by jealousy of his closeness to lily on james' part. remus disapproved, but didn't always make that known, out of cowardice. he did make them feel ashamed of themselves sometimes. snape /also/ retaliated, tried to get them expelled, and escalated the violence, as we see in SWM. though it's worth noting that we see him use sectumsempra after he thinks they tried to have him murdered

- remus had a sense of humour, he wasn't a wet blanket. /however/ that doesn't mean he was equivalent to james and sirius. he was still their moral compass, and still the most sensible out of all of them. james and sirius also hexed a lot of other students than snape. that's lily's whole problem with him. also i don't see why people sometimes characterise remus as 'the smart one'. james and sirius were the talent. i don't see remus being singled out for his abilities at all

- their dynamic with wormtail. either he's excluded, or he has a complete personality transplant. was he a part of the group? yes. he also openly hero worshipped james and sirius, who we see annoyed with him more than once in SWM. he's anxious, often berated by his professors. remus convinced the others to let him join out of pity. he's constantly described as sniggering, snivelling, etc.

- lily's personality. is she sweet? yes. does she defend and make excuses for snape? yes. she's also described as charming and cheeky, and has no problem standing up for herself- see how she reacts to petunia, james and snape

** - Always the same pairings. Either James/Lily or Lily/Snape and the occasional time traveller with Sirius, Lupin or Snape. Give me something creative, like Lily/Andromeda/Edward, Lily/Sirius, Harry/Lily or Lily/Luna's mother.

- Pranks. Funny the first time, boring the tenth time.

- Very Black/White worldviews. Especially when it's Snape centric the Marauders suddenly are just one step short of thugs.

- It's always about a group at Hogwarts . Either the Marauders or Snape, Regulus and sometimes Lucius. Give me some individual character interactions, not always 3/4 people. Give me something that happens after Hogwarts, where there's an actual civil war going on and not just a few brawls in the schoolyard.

- If Snape is a sympathetic character, you have often very odd interpretations of the canon material. Like Sirius attempting to murder Snape while that was endangerment and a broken Secrecy agreement at worst. And Snape's friends are suddenly nice people instead of the thugs which scare Lily.

- James and Lily die. Is it too much to ask for an original, happy ending for that family? Especially knowing what happens next (Dumbledore sends Harry to an abusive/tortuous home), this makes for a bitter aftertaste.

As you perhaps noticed, I am not a huge fan of Marauder era stories. Much like with Bellamione, I find the potential premise interesting, but have yet to find a story which I would actually enjoy.

** Edited to add. Britain = Muggle england, no ministry of magic. Wizarding britain= Magical areas under control of ministry of magic.

1970´s Britain was very different in 2010-> Britain, culturally and ethnically. For example, interracial LGBT couples did not casually snog each other publicly. In fact they did not advertise their relationship nor their sexual orientation.

There are other pairings than mudblood/death eater and/or slash. Be a one% and write about them.

What do you mean? As the term is usually understood, "canon compliance" just means the universe is not an AU. In that case I really don't see it. But perhaps you mean it in the rarer sense of “a fanfiction that could supposedly have happened in the canon timeline without affecting it”...? In which case I rather more see your point.
