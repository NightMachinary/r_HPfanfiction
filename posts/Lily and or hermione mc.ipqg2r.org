Can you guys recommend me longer fics where either hermione or lily are the main characters... boy/girl who lived gets boring

Alrdy read the arithmancer hermione series (can't for the life of me remember what its called)

100k+ preferred but if ur willing to vouch for the content I'll read anything!

Thanks


** Long Hermione centric fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]]: Written by the same author of the Arithmancer Series. Only 32k words, but it's exactly what I'd like to see in a Peggy Sue style time travel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]]: A 640k words long dark war epic. This Hermione forms her own guerrilla group after Year 5 and becomes a very effective killer of rank and file Death Eaters. But Harry and Ron are not slacking off either, as they will come into their roles later in the story.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] happens in a sci-fi universe with superpowers. It's complete with 660k words, goes through all 7 years, and mirrors canon events loosely, although the last year is significantly different. There are two sequels, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28614/DianeCastle+The+Secret+Return+of+Alex+Mack.htm#pt][The Secret Return of Alex Mack]]'s main character has true superpowers, and the Trio plays her supporting cast. [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-33141/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Swiss+Tournament.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Swiss Tournament]] continues with this Hermione Granger's adventure.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]]: She is adorably dark here. A great read for 50k words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]]: Another time travel, but the traveler is Harry and the story is mostly narrated from Hermione's POV.

  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world ruled by the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.

  James Potter went five years at Hogwarts without realizing Lily had a little sister. Hermione would have preferred if he never realized she existed. Now she's stuck, in Potter's circle of awareness, and maintaining the timeline. Not like he makes it easy, or something.
