Basically, instead of creating a horcrux, T.M. Riddle ends up getting trapped in the diary.


** The whole story would be very different with no Voldemort walking around. There would just be this diary lying on the floor of the girls' washroom next to Tom's corpse, I guess. Who would find it? Young Minerva McGonagall?

  A sixteen year old shouldn't try to make a Horcrux. No matter how "brilliant" or how much of a "prodigy" that kid is-- a sixteen year old really shouldn't try to make a Horcrux. Tom Riddle messes up and sucks his whole soul into his diary, which is found 50 years later by the young Lily Potter in a world with no Voldemort. femHarry AU

**** I don't know. I think a fic where Riddle uses a phylactery instead of a horcrux would be interesting.

Edit: Never mind, I mixed up canon and fanfiction. Whoops. I still think an intact body with a soul in a diary would be more interesting than simply dealing with tom riddle in a diary. It would be redundant because there are a lot of fics with a "sane" tom riddle in the diary.

**** I always got the impression that he fell in with junior DEs because he wanted to feel powerful after his upbringing and the Marauders. In a world where Voldemort never happened, his Hogwarts experience might not have been nearly as bad. Doesn't mean he'd end up with her romantically of course (she may simply never have thought of him that way), but I think there's a larger chance that he'd keep her friendship at least.

I've seen 2 fics with the premise that Voldemort never was a big thing. One of them was Jily but with their friendship still going strong. Don't know if SS had any romantic feelings in it, I didn't read much. The other had a Snily endgame, the fic's focus was from Harry's point of view.
