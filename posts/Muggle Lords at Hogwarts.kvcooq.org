I can imagine titles being used in different ways for Fanfic fodder (though I'm fine with the 'classics' like Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin etc occasionally).

Imagine a member of the House of Lords or any member of the Nobility has a little Witch or Wizard, a muggleborn or halfblood. But the wizarding world is weirded out by anyone with a "Lord..." title since You-Know-Who. This leads to terrorised purebloods thinking they are actually playing dumb when they seem clueless to the connotations, acting like a true Slytherin with this 'long con'.

They all drive themselves mad as cannot figure out why they are pretending they aren't into the dark arts when they're also walking around calling themselves Lord Egbert or whatever.

With so many fanfictions I'm sure this has been done before, has anyone come across it before?


** The ideal candidate for this is Justin Finch-Fletchley.

His name is pretty telling, it indicates two upper class, landed gentry families getting joined in marriage in the 19th century. He is the muggle-born equivalent to Draco Malfoy.

Many fanfics give the title "Sir" to Justin's father.

*** I feel like it was mentioned that he was supposed to go to Eton.. or maybe I'm just conflating canon and fic? Either way I agree he's a perfect target for this prompt

**** Yes, definitely canon. And he would have gone at the same time as Prince Harry and Prince William.

*** This happens in Harry Potter and the Daft Morons - Justin is the grandson of the Duke of Kendal, and due to the nature of the wizarding aristocracy in that fic (older your family House is, the more power you have), outranks even the "Most Ancient and Noble Houses", by a /huge/ margin - and nobody knows about it, till Harry finds out, then gets the ball rolling to get Justin on the Wizengamot.

** Or even better: A Lord of Sealand at Hogwarts.

Sealand is a self proclaimed micronation that nobody takes seriously, they sell nobility titles for money. It's not even that expensive, so I could totally see someone buying one for a friend as a joke.

** I've read a fanfic that used muggle nobility as a feature. Can't remember the title or overall plot, but the author explained in the notes that one of the Gryffindor boys (halfblood, I think) had a surname that screamed UK nobility, so they gave him a noble family title to wave around. In the fic, other wizards at first assumed he was a pureblood wizard of a respectable family when he acted 'aristocratic' and waved around his family name, and then he'd smugly tell them "nope my parents are muggle nobility and oh my gosh i can't believe how rude you're being, you, who are of wizard nobility"

since most fics tend to go ham on all the Lord and Lady titles in regards to purebloods and the Moste Anciente Houses, I really doubt there are fics that take the approach you're describing.

*** Alright, that's fair. Although, muggle aristocracy actually, you know, exists. In the real world and in the world of Harry Potter.

I just thought it mildly entertaining for Wizards who clearly wouldn't deign to take Muggle studies to double-take in disbelief hearing about Lord this-or-that and wonder what they'd missed.

To each their own though, and you have quite a fair point! ðŸ™‚

*** The OP never mentioned or requested Aristocracy wank or muggle Aristocracy wank. he requested stories where a muggleborn/half-blood inherits a noble title on the muggle side of things (the title in this case being "Lord") and naturally this causes some degree of confusion and panic amongst some of the wizarding population. Which makes sense given the last person to attach "Lord" to their name was Voldemort.

Based on the line "They all drive themselves mad as cannot figure out why they are pretending they aren't into the dark arts when they're also walking around calling themselves Lord Egbert or whatever." I'm 99% sure the OP is asking for comedy stories.

Hopefully this clears things up!
