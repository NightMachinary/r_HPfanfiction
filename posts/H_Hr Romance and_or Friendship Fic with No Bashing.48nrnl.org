I happen to like Dumbledore and the Weasleys, so any manipulative!Dumbledore or mad!Weasleys = auto fail.


** I'm very slowly putting together an FFN community of fics like this, but---well, they're hard to find. (One thing I've noticed that links a lot of H/Hr fics I don't enjoy together is that they're very stuck on the idea that Harry and Hermione are smart, rational Muggles and the wizarding world is bad, abusive, and childish. Once I see that I feel like love-potion-Ginny, senile Dumbledore, and Serious and Powerful Bookworm Harry are all inevitable.)

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Quest for Merlin's Blessing) is one of the newer ones I've found that meets these criteria. Really nice slow-burn romance that includes an OK canon-style mystery at its center and is honest about the faults and questions in a potential H/Hr relationship.

linkffn(With Malice Aforethought) is an old, complete sixth-year fic I recommend whenever I get the chance---very confident writing style, interesting takes on canon characters. The end is a little abrupt, and the seventh-year sequel looks abandoned, but it feels complete on its own.

linkffn(A Serpent's Sacrifice by Gabilian) and linkffn(The Bottom of the Lake by Gabilian) are both seventh-year fics written ahead of the release of DH. The writing isn't great but it's solid, and the writer manages to avoid a lot of bad H/Hr fanon.

One I really enjoy on Portkey is [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=7149&chapterid=&agree=1][Three Seasons to Closure]]. Different from the others in that there's no real adventure or mystery, but a very nice, slow-paced romance.

  Explores the close, loving friendship between Hermione and Harry mainly from Hermione's viewpoint. Is it enough to form a devoted life-partnership even if they're not romantically in love? Might their love be just as true? And if so, what could bring them together? The story is fluffy, sometimes sensual, but never smutty or crude, and, of course, has the touch of magic.

** This raises the question of what "bashing" is. Some seen treat it as any negative portrayal of a character, which I'd say is ridiculous.

A jealous or immature Ron is canon, but I wouldn't call it "bashing" unless his jealousy overwhelms his good qualities, perhaps to the point where he's just two dimensional.

A manipulative Dumbledore is canon, too, and again I wouldn't call it "bashing" unless his manipulations are done with bad intentions and/or that part of his character overwhelms any good qualities.

I don't think it matters if the negative qualities are depicted in new, non-canon contexts or not (e.g., giving Ron something new to be jealous about). What matters is whether or not the character stays roughly three dimensional - with both good and bad traits.

*** I would love to find a fic that has jealous immature Ron through the first 4 years but slowly growing up and then continue the growth 5-7 with a relapse in the hunt only to finally be the mature one when he comes back. Like Harry and Hermione be snotty or immature when he does because they don't know how to react to him.

It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
