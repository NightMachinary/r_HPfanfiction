I've read so many fanfics that I no longer remember what's canon and what's fanon.\\
Was Dumbledore evil? Was Ron insane or insecure? Was Harry abused physically or just neglected?

What other big questions can you no longer discern the answer to (fanon/canon?) with clarity?


** I can't really remember Harry's personality. He was already quite neutral in canon, written so that it's easy to imagine yourself in his place.

But with all the fics I read it's hard to remember what he really stood for. Is he constantly trying to push everyone away or is everyone using the funeral scene of HBP as an indication of Harry's entire personality? Is he really dumb and clueless about girls or is that aspect exaggerated in fanon? How much of a push-over was he? Was he even a push-over?

That sort of thing. And not just in Harry's case. I just lose track of what their canon personality is.

***** I think it's because he's a very... go with the flow type character for the most part, and it's exacerbated by the medium.

He doesn't initiate his own troubles. (Probably because life is happy to hand him a steady supply of problems so he feels no need to seek out more) He gets involved, and saves the day when the big todo that's been building all years comes to a head (or if Malfoy is involved) ... but we rarely in canon see him working towards a goal intentionally for personal reasons.

He obviously /has/ goals that he works towards but that's not what makes the books. AKA winning quiditch involves practice and etc... but quiditch games are already pretty boring outside of incidents so we don't read about those practices.

Like... he says he wants to be an Auror... but that's both out of left field (as in I don't recall him ever giving the future any thought prior to that) and also somewhat of a knee-jerk 'well duh' answer to the question of what he wants to do when he grows up given that Voldemort is back by then.

I /think/ that's why people find it so easy to add one of their own 'if i was' goals to his to do list and run with it.

That said yeah, he has a very... snarky? I think that's the word..? personality that (sadly) doesn't always make it into fanfics.

**** Regimented time is actually are rather new idea, many due to the fact that accurate clocks are pretty recent too. If wizards feel the same way about time as they do about changing fashion (in that it's stuck somewhere around the 12th century), then no one really cares about the exact time, because they had no way to measure it. You wouldn't say, "I'll be there at 6pm," you would say, "I'll be there late afternoon," or if you had to go to work, you would leave at dawn. That when dawn occurred changed through out the year wasn't really an issue, people just didn't think like that.

Of course, this doesn't really work at Hogwarts, with its rigid class timetable. But even then, if you just moved when the bell went, you still wouldn't need a watch.

If there is such a spell in the HP world, I really doubt it would create a hovering image of the time. Rather, it would do something like briefly transform a nearby surface into a clock face, or create a chiming sound that only the caster can hear which chimes out the time, etc.

****** I've found, as a useful general rule, that a good way to replicate the feel of the HP magic system is to avoid anything that feels futuristic. HP magic should be relatively subtle, always a little bit quirky, and often does not take the most direct route to something. For example, there's no "warming charm" in canon - whenever wizards want to create heat using magic, they create fire.

It's not that HP magic is incapable of creating visual illusions - we've seen them here and there, such as the anti-gravity illusion in the maze - but rather simply that generally visual illusions don't fit the feel of the system. Auditory illusions, I feel, are more in line with the subtle/quirky nature of HP magic.

***** An explanation for the "why": Because just as me, the first author to do so remembered that there was some kind of "not invisible, but harder to notice" charm, but couldn't remember the name. And didn't bother to look it up.\\
Or someone reinvented the wheel. Then the question would be "is fanon that does the same as canon with a different name canon?"

I never thought too much about how both spells are supposed to work, especially as many FFs don't describe them. Can you be noticed by someone really paying attention while under notice-me-not? If not, wouldn't that make it an invisibility charm and probably much more difficult (I remember it being used pretty early in school sometimes)..

  "is fanon that does the same as canon with a different name canon?"
#+end_quote

I guess the answer is, yes, if the FF author doesn't make the distinction either. For example if the notice-me-not is used exactly the same way as the Disillusionment Charm, and no difference is explained then I guess it doesn't matter, and so they could be. However, not every author does this. And generally the Disillusionment Charm is seen as particularly difficult (the only students that use it are Hermione and possibly Malfoy and co, all in the 7th book), while the notice-me-not is generally used by FF characters when they are young.

According to the [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/magic/spells/spells_d.html][HP lexicon]], the Disillusionment Charm is indeed a chameleon affect, which only approaches true invisibility when completely overpowered (the two examples are Dumbledore and Voldemort when he really doesn't want to be seen). For the majority of magic users, I think the affect is a little more crappy, like the chameleon affect in real life, so moving too fast or being against something to either too simple or with too many fine continuing details will mean the charm can be seen through. Like the difference between [[http://imgur.com/a/PvMRj][spot the sniper]] and something more [[http://imgur.com/BQIr945][underpowered]].

On the other hand the notice-me-not doesn't depend on the background or how fast you move, but if someone knows you are there and is looking for you, or has significant will, or if you act to draw attention to yourself then the charm will fail.

In any case, you're right in that FF tends to fail at pointing out the problems with either charm, and certainly doesn't tend to explain them.

It is never stated that he flinched from contact... and he wasnt extremely introverted... meaning he was most likely only neglected... but... a part of me cant help but think that a kid who does absolutely everything for his relatives, without stepping one noticeable toe out of line... You dont get that way without physicality... So... I think that JK Rowling wrote a situation in which Harry was abused, but either doesnt view it as such, or has shut it away.

*** The original books were written more like a fairy tale, and as such harry has evil relatives as that's a pretty common trope in fairy tales. However, Rowling likely didn't actually want a character with the characteristics that are common in abused children so Harry doesn't have them. Note that Cinderella also doesn't have these characteristics. However the latter books are written as more serious novels, and things that worked from a fairy tale perspective no longer make sense when viewed from a more realistic perspective so there are a bunch of things that are difficult to reconcile that were set in stone in the initial books. Whether or not they were physically abusive as well, (and starvation would probably count as physical) the Dursley's as described treatment of Harry would lead to a kid with emotional issues that Harry seems to lack. So I wouldn't say that's strong evidence either way on whether or not they hit him too.

*** There are other factors. I've worked with abused children and soical services internationally for around 10 years now, some children just aren't fazed by what happened to them until years later, or when they've had time to realise "Oh, that wasn't normal".

Context is most important , abusing (beating) your children is normalised in many countries. What differs is the degree of abuse you accept as a culture, ive seen beatings ranging from, belts wounds, paddling, frying pans induced scars, pokers, lighters, hot baths, cold baths, open hand, closed fists, with kids still being 'sassy' afterwards because its just accepted as a normal punishment for the 'crime'. My conclusion is that some kids are just resistant and resilient as steel, while others shatter like glass.

Harry just might be unaffected, particularly if the Dursleys abuse was incremental, and might feel the abuse later, if at all, but most likely when his own children are the same age as he was when the abuse started.

What is canon: Harry was denied food, he lived in a boot cupboard, he had more chores then Dudley. But we also know he was quiet sassy/defiant, he was fed, he doesn't act afraid of people. In the first few books this is pretty standard orphan fairy tale set up, but if you had this in the later books it most certainly was abuse.

**** I seem to remember an interview where JKR said that her story originally had much /more/ of incidents like that, but her editor forced her to cut them out.

Prism is right that it depends on whether you stop at the first couple of books or take in the series as a whole. For the first couple of books, it's a fairy tale. The Dursleys are an entire family of evil stepmothers. Sure, their actions are horrid, but no one complains about "abuse" in fairy tales. No one notices that the "abused" hero doesn't actually show any of the signs of an abused kid.

Once the later books are brought in, however, that excuse can't be used anymore. If nothing else, book five has Dumbledore trying to justify and explain his decision to leave Harry with the Dursleys - that alone /demands/ that we take Harry's experiences there seriously, otherwise we can't take the scene itself seriously. And when we take Harry's experiences seriously, we can't treat it as anything but abuse - mental and physical. We can debate and disagree about how serious it is, but there's no debate that it happened.

The fact that Harry never shows much or any of the consequences of abuse is a leftover consequence of the first books being fairy tales. It's one of many, many examples of problems that exist because the series is made up of more than one genre of story and the genres conflict in various ways. But without those conflicts, there wouldn't be nearly as much fodder for fanfiction authors to use.

So in the we here should be happy for the conflict existing, but we need to be clear in understanding why it exists and where it's coming from.

****** Well, Snape's memory of his conversation with Dumbledore - the one where even Snape blew up at him, accusing him of raising Harry to be a pig for slaughter - certainly adds to the idea of Dumbledore being a MOB. Then he has to go and make it worse by trying to needle Snape into admitting that he cares for Harry.

What's especially curious about Dumbledore's conversation with Harry is how he contradicts himself. On the one hand he insists that he hasn't told Harry the truth because he wanted Harry to enjoy his childhood. On the other hand, he also admit to knowing that Harry had a horrible life - and even if someone denies that the abuse he suffered was really that bad, it's pretty clear that he didn't have much of a childhood. He didn't have it much better after coming to Hogwarts, either, what with multiple murder attempts several times each year. And that's when he was under Dumbledore's direct care!

Saying that he wanted Harry to enjoy his childhood isn't unreasonable. It wouldn't justify all of the secrets he kept, but it would justify holding some things back. But if that excuse had been true, he'd have done more to ensure it happened. He'd have at least /tried/ to ensure that Harry had toys, friends, and time for fun. He have /tried/ to prevent him from being denied... well, just about everything.

Then again, this is the same Dumbledore who says that the "power" Harry has is "love," right after he got done apologizing for having forced Harry to grow up without love. Because the less you're given, the more you have? Or something?

Yet he still placed him a home where he was abused by those who should love him. I dont care if the end justified the means, that was /wrong/. James and Lily, would have killed Dumbledore themselves for it. ANY PARENT WOULD.

That first year, Dumbledore suspected that Harry was a horecrux. He prayed that it was not true. He begged to every deity that he even thought to may exist that he was wrong... Yet deep down he knew he was not wrong. Dumbledore, while he was The Only One Voldemort Feared, /feared/ Voldemort. Dumbledore hated that he knew what Tom was, but gave him a second chance. He knew that no matter what happened, he had to sacrifice a child to end the death of his people. People he watched grow up from the ages of 11 to 17. But he still had to sacrifice a child to do it.

In the end Dumbledore got lucky. He found his gambit won, that his greatest regret became the world's savior. That the one in a million chance that Harry would live, succeeded. Instead of sacrificing a Kid who only knew love in the world that was unsure how it felt about him, he sacrificed 11 years and 7 summers. If Dumbledore was alive at the end, I think he would have wept for joy... and out of shame of what he knew as necessary.

You also have to think about Ms Figg. She was placed there by Dumbledore to what exactly? Because it wasn't to make sure he had a childhood, and as a squib she would pretty useless if Deatheaters did find the house.

  "They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. 'Get the mail, Dudley,' said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. 'Make Harry get it.' 'Get the mail, Harry.' 'Make Dudley get it.' 'Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.' Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail."

The frying pan is from Chamber of Secrets' 'The Worst Birthday' chapter:

  "As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he was finished."

Harry has to dodge / duck, leaving no question they were actually aiming for him. Dudley may be forgiven for being an idiotic child but Petunia is guily of attempted assault at least (a heavy blow, not a joking fake swing).

******* Of course you meant physical abuse.

Swinging a frying pan is physical.

Throwing a child is physical.

Allowing or encouraging a dog to attack a child is physical.

Denying a child food for a week is physical.

Keeping a child locked in a cupboard as their only room is physical.

Every single one of those things is abusive. Every single one of them is physical.

I'd pity anyone unable to recognize that those are examples of physical abuse, and I would immediately recommend that any such person not have their own kids because I would have good cause to be concerned for such kids' safety.

Children should not be thrown, should not be locked in cupboards, and should not have vicious animals set on them. Full stop.

If you truly thought that it wasn't physical abuse unless you /always/ hit a child, and that therefore it was perfectly fine to /occasionally/ hit them with frying pan or /occasionally/ let a dog attack them, then you'd be a danger to children. Any children. All children.

But I don't really think that of you because such psychopaths are fortunately few and far between. I was being facetious because you were being stupidly dense for denying the incredibly obvious.

No intelligent, moral adult says that it's not physical abuse to do things like above. Only pointing out that the first books are fairy tales prevents the incidents from being horrific (it's a rare fairy tale that doesn't have something horrific going, a least the old ones), and that only works so long as one remains focused on the first books. As soon as the later, more mature books come into play, the incidents become horrible again.

So why not just admit that it's stupid to define "physical abuse" as "always hitting," admit that the incidents in question are indeed physical abuse, and focus the legitimate question of how bad it is. Trying to defend the idea that all those incidents aren't abusive is just ridiculous.

I'll also point out that trying to excuse what he experienced as not really being abuse takes something away from how well he developed. The abuse was something he overcame, and he deserves kudos for it. Pretending that his treatment wasn't so bad makes his accomplishments a bit smaller.

To me, the fact that Regulus has a chosen middle name that he shares with an ancestor points to a greater probability that Sirius' was chosen and chosen from an earlier generation than Orion's.

Actually canon does imply that the oldest son of a Wizarding family do share their first middle name with their father's name. e.g. Harry /James/ Potter, William /Arthur/ Weasley and Albus /Percival/ Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. So I personally feel like Sirius Orion Black isn't bad fanon, it could very well be true.

James Charlus Potter is however pure fanon, James' father wasn't called Charlus but Fleamont. That also means that Harry is not directly related to the Black family.

And personally I think it is bad fanon, because giving someone their father's name as their middle name is rather formulaic and usually done when there's no reason to actually think of a middle name.

#+end_quote

Those some people all happen to come from pure Wizarding families, you know what they say, once is an accident, two times is a coincidence, three times is a conspiracy.

Whatever the middle name naming scheme is, the Weasley family follow it and we know that the first son is named after his father (William Arthur), we also know that the third son is named after the maternal grandfather (Percival Ignatius; Ignatius is the name of Molly's father). So we have a slight pattern with the middle names:

1st son: father

2nd son: unknown

3rd son: maternal grandfather

The only second son's middle name we know off happens to be that of Regulus Arcturus. Arcturus is the name of Regulus' paternal grandfather. If we apply this to the pattern we get:

1st son: father

2nd son: paternal grandfather

3rd son: maternal grandfather

This is a clear naming pattern. The fact that Regulus' middle name fits the Weasley family middle name naming scheme perfectly is too much of a coincidence, especially in a world created by JKR.

It is safe to say that Sirius' middle name is Orion. Likewise Charlie's full name is most likely Charles Septimus Weasley, not that his name is ever brought up in fanon. It's not bad fanon to say Sirius' middle name is Orion, it's logical reasoning based on the information we have of the Wizarding family names.

What is bad fanon is naming every first child's middle name after his father, especially when the character isn't a pure blood (i.e. Remus' middle name is John, Remus' father is called Lyall).

#+begin_quote
  For instance I notice that James Sirius Potter and Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy don't factor into your theory for some reason.
#+end_quote

They're next generation kids, it's a subtle way of showing that tradition is less important and that the Wizarding world is changing. Or who knows maybe the middle name naming scheme might have been vogue amongst Wizards during the 19th and most of the 20th century but it died out in during the 90s.

** Canon or not, we can all conclude that Dumbledore was incompetent in dealing with Voldemort. This guy was the most powerful wizard at the time, had tons of loyal followers, was generally revered by the public, and had past experience defeating a dark lord. Yet, he couldn't put any of his strengths to good use: the ministry was infiltrated by death eaters left and right, a quarter of his school was churning out death eaters en masse, and his own private army suffered 40% casualty rate without seriously hurting the other side.

Then when he finally got that lucky break through Potters' sacrifice, he did NOTHING to follow up this tactical victory. Lucius Malfoy and bunch of death eaters were given free reign to keep corrupting the ministry, while one of his own guys got shoved into Azkaban without trial. He suspected V wasn't dead, but basically sat on his ass doing nothing for 10 years, all valuable time where he could do some serious investigative work, beef up his private army, and prepare for the eventual showdown.

In the end, he gambled everything on Harry to activate the sacrificial magic, where it miraculously worked due to lots of lucky events. Still, hundreds of innocents were killed and far more were traumatized. An entire generation was turned into child soldiers.

The failure of Albus Dumbledore was EPIC and should be studied in great details in ALL magic story classes. He was worse than Neville Chamberlain.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

** That is interesting. Canon is definitely more vivid in my mind. I am re-reading for the first time though, so it's a factor, but before beginning my re-read, I could tell what was being exaggerated. It probably helps when you like most of the canon characters, good and evil.

I also very rarely get past chapter 10 of any fanfic, especially the 5000000000000k word ones.

*** Horcruxes have been destroyed by Basilisk venom, the sword of gryffindor (which was impregnated with basilisk venom), Fiendfyre, whatever Dumbledore did to destroy the ring.

Avada Kedavra... might work. Kind of fuzzy, but Voldemort cast it on Harry at the end of DH, which destroyed the Horcrux in him.

** Hm...I don't have that problem much (and I've read tons of fanfiction by now), I have another problem:

I think a lot of fanfiction is - sadly! - better than the books (I hate Rowling ruining her main character (Harry!) in the last book...he's stumbling around like an idiot and without Hermione (who's the real protagonist in that book IMHO!) he'd be dead -.-) and that's quite sad, because while the writing style in the books is better than most fanfiction, the stories told in fanfiction are often much more fun to read (a hero that isn't just "along for the ride" (and who let's other lead him around like they choose to, like Dumbledore making him a willing sacrifice...I mean why not imprison Voldemort until Harry dies a natural death? Sacrificing a child is despicable and not OK (and I don't even like children all that much!)) but pro-active is just a lot more fun!)

** In order: Not after Ariana's death. No. Yes, along with the rest of the trio, but about different things. Probably only by Dudley.

I haven't reread canon in a long time, but I tend to get into a lot of debates over canonicity, and when I get called out on fanon, I adjust my position, so I think I've got a pretty accurate view of things. Of course, if I didn't, how would I know until someone called me out?

*** So, to answer your abuae queation, I think the answer is yes. Starving your children isn't acceptable, the end, and we see the dursleys starve harry several times during cannon (after harry set the boa constrictor on Dudley in ss, for example, or during cos). But i think what you're asking is whether the Dursley's ever hit harry and the answer is not really. In OotP, Vernon grabs harry by the throat and harry breaks his grip magically. But even though we never see venon hit harry, there's some textual evidence that it happened. There are certainly enough threats, and in HBP we're informed that long experience advised harry to stay out of Vernon's reach when he's angry. So it's in there if you want it to be.

**** Harry wasn't starved by the Dursleys:

#+begin_quote
  The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.

Sending a child to bed without dinner was a pretty common punishment until recently.

***** From Harry's POV he thinks he hasn't been starved. He is, very possibly, an unreliable narrator. Even the way he words it implies he might in fact have been starved, but now he is justifying it. It's like saying, "Oh, it didn't rain too badly," after a storm (he was "never exactly" starved).

In book 1 we have Vernon saying,

#+begin_quote
  /"Go - cupboard - stay - no meals,"/
#+end_quote

and later Harry has:

#+begin_quote
  /Until they were [asleep], he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food/.
#+end_quote

Sure we don't know how long he had no meals for, but the fact he has had to sneak food often enough in the past he thinks it routine is telling. Ron thinks he was being starved in CoS. Harry is always described as quiet thin and small (possible signs of long term starvation.)

***** Before the Weasley's rescued him in his second year the Dursley's were feeding him a can of cold soup through a cat flap for his only meal of the day. I'd consider that borderline starving someone, especially a child who tends to be skinny on the best of days.

Relying on Harry's POV of starvation isn't fair as if he was starved as a child he probably wouldn't know any better. And limiting his food because they disliked him, not because he actually did anything wrong, would probably be considered some form of physical abuse. Granted, as discussed in above comments the first few books were written as a fairly tale, so getting anything definitive from them is almost impossible.
