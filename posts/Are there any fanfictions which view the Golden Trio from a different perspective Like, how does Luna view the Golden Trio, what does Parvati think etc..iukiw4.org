** a) yes, please, there are not enough stories from different perspective than the Golden Trio. More stories like “Daphne Greengrass, Side Character by LinzRW” linkffn(11145058)!

b) did I say The Golden Trio perspective? That's wrong, all we have mostly is just Harry's perspective (and Hermione or Ginny, but only limit to their romantic life). There is not enough stories (more or less canonical, not “Fate by TheTrueSpartan” or “The Changeling by Annerb”) from Ron, Ginny, or Hermione's point of view. And both Hermione and Ginny are bound to have different view on The Trio having part of their lives hidden, e.g., canonically we know almost nothing about relationships in the girls dormitories.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11145058/1/][*/Daphne Greengrass, Side Character/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1763240/LinzRW][/LinzRW/]]

#+begin_quote
  Daphne Greengrass is on a quest to be the main character of her own life for once, but that's easier said than done. Includes: conspiracy theories, evil plotting, a Slytherin revolution, and sassy Potter. OotP, HBP, and DH. Not your usual Daphne.

** Some comments on them in Slide's Anguis series so far. Haven't gotten far enough to where their actions actually start playing a role.

#+begin_quote
  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  The sequel to 'Latet Anguis in Herba', set during HBP. The Slytherins return to Hogwarts under the shadow of the war and their own demons. But with the wizarding world embroiled in conflict, how are they supposed to cope with their seventh and final year? MASSIVELY RE-EDITED.
