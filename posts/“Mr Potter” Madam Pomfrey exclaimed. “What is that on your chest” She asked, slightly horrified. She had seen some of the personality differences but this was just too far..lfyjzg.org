Looking down Tony grimaced. Wondering how he was going to explain the arc reactor or why he even had it.

---------

If you didn't get it basically Tony Stark is reborn as Harry but he still needs that arc reactor because apparently some injuries carry over

****** Well the Hippocratical oath itself is outdated but its main principles still stand at the basis of all legislation that regulates ethics in medical practices. As a matter of fact, considering how stuck in time the magical community is, I would rather expect the healers to be bound by something like a Hippocratical oath (especially since in his lifetime Hippocrates was considered some sort of a wizard in real life and JK had turned some famous historical scholars into wizards such as Cornelius Agrippa or von Rethicus) than by written legislation.

******* Oh sure, we have the GMC regulating along biomedical ethical principles that stem from the original oath, and some medical schools do some kind of promise or oath symbolically on graduation.

But taking an oath as a doctor is not an ingrained part of medical culture here, and only even became widely used in the West in the 1700's - late for the wizards to have taken it up separately to their Muggle compatriots.

Knowing how distinct some magical ethics seems to be from modern British ethics that would have diverged around the same time (eg slavery), it would seem odd that this emerged wholly separately. And other professions have codes of ethics without an oath or equivalent (eg law) that it seems unlikely this particular one would have developed distinctly on its own.

******** Oh that's interesting... I was under the impression that the Hippocratic oath was the basis of all medical practices in ancient and medieval times in the western world. In any case, it seems like Madam Pomfrey and Snape don't make Lupin's condition public while he is under treatment but that could be argued as an order from Dumbledore as well. I suppose there's room to play with it.

It's just that the swearing of an oath itself isn't as much of a thing here, instead the General Medical Council (the regulatory body) has regulations that doctors have to follow which are guided by similar principles, but it's not a 1:1.

** Would absolutely love a fic like this. There's another good one that's Sherlock reincarnated as Harry and John reincarnated as Ron. Can't remember the name though.

Anyway, I'd love to see this Tony fic where he's reincarnated as Harry. Maybe Loki taught him stuff about magic (and/or Dr Strange) and so he can get around the magic and electricity thing!

Bonus if he meets Stephen Cornfoot and hears someone call him Steve and he just cringes so hard hearing that name lol.

**** I honestly think it would be a good dramatic moment-at some point in Hogwarts the magic overwhelms the device and he has to go to the hospital wing, Pomfrey does ‘Lol is that it?' And we get a teasing that the staff are going to find out more about Tony's past life.

Oh and a dramatic monologue.

Despite the ordeals he had been through, Tony couldn't help the tears that threatened to well up at the /clang/ his arc reactor made as the mediwitch dropped his greatest success and the very reason he had survived for so long-straight into a metal waste basket with other assorted oddities, rendering it redundant. The mutter of ‘muggle junk' the woman gave as she proceeded to wave her wand and fix the damage he had thought permanent in less then thirty seconds was enough to make the man bite his lip so hard he drew blood.

Safe to say his first days of magic were rather /mixed/ feeling wise.
