Looking for a fic where Fanon!Harry realises he's not that strong.


** Lol would be better if it was a canon!Harry doing that to a Dark!IndyHarry.

"You have become the very thing you swore to destroy!".

I know there's one where a multiverse travelling Harry does something similar. I think it was by nonjon.

*** That's Probably from Further Adventures of The Lone Traveler That Universe had a Dark Harry which was turning women into slaves or something and Neville was running a rebellion and Traveler!Harry kinda helped him kill himself

** There is a one-shot from the pov of Dumbledore, in which McGonagall scolds Harry into place.

It was recommended someplace here, so surely someone knows what I'm talking about...?

  My take on the manipulative Dumbledore stories - from Dumbledore's point of view. Written late at night, not proof-read. Will probably go over it later, if people think it's worth a tidy-up.
