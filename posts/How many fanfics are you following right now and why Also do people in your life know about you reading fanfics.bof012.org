For me reading fanfics is the main thing I do with my free time besides, Reddit, YouTube, and going out with friends but even than I tend to spend most of my time just reading fanfics since I am an introvert and like spending time alone. Which means that I am following a lot of fanfics including fanfics from other fandoms. Also for me no one in my life knows about this since I feel like they would think less of me or just think I have a sad life or something.

â€‹

So I am wondering how many fanfics other people are following, why, and if people in your life know about you reading fanfics.


** I've got 87 stories on my ffnet story alerts list. 18 of those have updated in 2019. In addition there are a few active authors on my followed authors list.

Why? I think there are about 30 stories on that list that I consider at least good and that I want to read. There are a few that aren't great but I'm following because I picked them up early, gave early feedback and want to see how they turn out.

The rest are a mix of stories. Most were good once but aren't now but I still follow them because I've become invested in the story and want to see it through out of sheer bloody-mindedness.

I think most of my friends know about my fanfic habits. They probably all think I'm a bit strange because of it, but they probably all thought that anyway.

** I'm pretty open about this stuff. All my friends know that I read and write Fanfiction, I even got one of my friends hooked by making him read HPMOR. Every once in a while I'll send the link of my latest fic for review and criticism, and to discuss about stuff.

I follow close to 20-30 fics at the moment, though I only have hopes of about 7-8 of them updating.

Why do you feel the need to be secretive about this?

** Most of my friends know I write fanfic but it's been about 10 years since I told them so they've probably forgotten.

**** Grown ass black male who looks like tupac, into mainly sports, rap music, and smoking weed with the homies. Imagine a grown black male with that sort of profile about himself in California. Would come off mad wierd to most people. None of my homies read ANYTHING let alone use apps like Reddit and shit to discuss fan theories lol

** I am someone who is pretty much obsessed with stories, doesnt matter if its audiodrama (podcasts), books, series, you name it. I follow 3-4 ongoing HP fics and sometimes just reread one of my top ten. most of my close friends know about it but hey they still think regularly sitting together for more than 5 hours playing dungeons and dragons is weirder.

** I'm probably technically following far more fanfics than I think. If I really like an incomplete story and it's updated in the past few months, I'll have whatever site I'm on tell me when there's a new chapter.

Sometimes I'll get an e-mail about a new chapter for a story that doesn't even ring a bell. So probably anywhere from 20 to 200? Maybe even upwards of 500? I've been reading fanfic for a very long time.

** I don't use the Follow button very much, so I only follow like 10 fics.

Both of my parents and my brother know I read fanfic, and I rec fics to my brother occasionally.

** I don't have any marked down as 'follow' but I keep an eye on my (enormous) favorites list and organize it by last updated. That way I can keep easy track of any updates without random emails on my account popping up.

So in general there are six or seven actively updating that I follow and probably another six or seven that I hold out hopes of seeing update, someday.

**** Sufficient Velocity and SpaceBattles forums (some of their authors crosspost to ffn, but many don't), Questionable Questing forum for NSFW or for people who think SV and SB's mods are tyrants because you can get away with a LOT on QQ, wattpad still has a little bit of a few people's older crap lying around (usually low-quality but not always), for some reason one author only uses tumblr, there's fimfiction for MLP stuff in general (only one or two things i follow there that actually update more often than once a year tho), one author only ever posts his stuff on PASTEBIN for god only knows what reason, and there was one fic that was only posted on deviantart but i stopped following that one a while ago after the grimderp got too severe

I'm positive I'm forgetting at least one other site.

** For a long time I was super weird about people knowing that i read fanfic cuz my mom caught me and I guess I was just inherently embarrassed I'm not sure why. This was middle school-high school. I didnt read much in college. Post college I've started up again and have been randomly casually mentioning it and I forgot why I was embarrassed.

Then I went home again for a weekend to visit my parents and as I just reading a fic on my phone in my bedroom and my mom came in and asked what I was doing. I said I was on reddit and then she like "oh I thought you might be reading fanfic" and I was like fuck, now I remember why I never told people.

She never said anything bad about it that i can specifically remember but i guess maybe her dismissiveness of it made me embarrassed to tell people.

** No, I don't really tell people but honestly I don't care if they find out haha. It's just most of my friends and family aren't that into Harry Potter - my SIL is though! For me it's more that it's not going to somehow connect us, and I don't tell people about all the dumb shit I want on youtube either(plan with me's, Sims builds, etc) because there's no point? Unless they also watch it - I did connect with a colleague who mentioned the name of a Cleaning youtuber(clean with me's) and a teacher youtuber and that sparked an hour long conversation haha.
