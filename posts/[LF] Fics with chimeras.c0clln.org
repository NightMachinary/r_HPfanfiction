Chimeras in canon are a XXXXX beast so deadly, only one wizard has ever killed one and it was effectively a tie. Are there any fics where they are used to a degree? I know of the Rune Stone Path and Partially Kissed Hero.


** I have used one in my story "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis".

*** Haven't had the time recently to read a novel length fic, but I'll check it out. I didn't really have the time to read through it yet, but it sounds like arcane magics are aplenty.

** How can only one have died. Just stay far away and hurl killing curses at the thing.

*** Check out the fantastic beasts textbook that Rowling released. It's actually based a bit on greek mythology, except in mythology the slayer fell off Mt. Olympus afterwards.

I personally dislike the killing curse because it is such a lazy attack. Logic indicates since no magical shield can block it that it should be the primary attack curse. The only reliable defense is solid objects and dodging it. It makes duels one-dimensional.

**** I know the Greek story it's based on. It just doesn't make sense combined with the Harry Potter setting.

***** Again, I blame the killing curse for that bit, but the story itself would be kinda cool. Chimeras sound extremely badass.

I'm trying to make the killing curse less overpowered in a fic I'm in the process of writing because of that.

**** If casting the killing curse comes at a price, it only makes dark wizards stronger, providing them a monstrous trump card. I like the idea.

*** At least with dragons, dragonkeepers had to fire stunning curses rapidly and all at once, and I don't remember if they actually managed to stun them, or it was just a means to herd them off. It's reasonable that you cannot AK the dragon either, maybe only if you hit the eye. Chimeras are probably the same.
