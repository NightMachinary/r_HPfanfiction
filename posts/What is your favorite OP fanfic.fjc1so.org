So I love OP stories and my favorite Harry is OP!Harry. I've read plenty but I'm looking for people's favorites and what they consider to be the creme de la creme of OP stories.

Also besides links, what are some of your favorites parts of OP Harry?

These don't have to be OP Harry as long as it's OP characters in HP universe and AU.

No slash please!


** There seem to be four categories of OP stories in HP.

1. (Also the only one that happens in real life) stories that make use of humanity's tendancy to, once in a while, produce a person with just the right combination of natural talent, insatiable curiosity, and ironclad determination, and then light in that person a fire to change the world. For this category, which I will call the "kingmaker category" (its the only one that's actually real, so it gets the best name) I'd say a good example is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/][A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned]]

2. Stories that make someone "clever" someone that never really needs to fully explain themselves but still manages to outsmart everyone by just picking the "simplest", "most logical", and "obvious" solution that no one has managed to work out before them... Somehow... I'm gonna call this the "captain obvious" category, where knowledge is power and common sense doesn't exist. A good example for this one is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13274529/1/An-Old-and-New-World][An Old and New World by Lens of Sanity]]

3. Stories where someone is powerful becasue of time travel. This is usually because of one of two things, either A. After the war was over the mc decided to join the aurors and became the best auror ever times ten so that's why they're basically magic jesus, or B. The war was so bad it desolated the whole world and the time traveler in question is litterally the sole survivor and has through the simple and brutal process of survival of the fittest become the most powerful badass to ever live. These sre sort the two extreme ends of the spectrum, and often time travel stories will fall somewhere inbetween. For this category, which I shall name Typical Angry Rage Dude In Surrey, I recommend [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear by Chilord]] (the reason this one gets its own category is because most OP stories spend a lot of time on how the character got to be so powerful, while this subset of the broader OP genre kinda ignores all that.)

4. And lastly, we've got the !Godlike stories. Stories where the mc has been given some sort of power straight from birth that only they possess and which makes them abouts as comparable to the rest of humanity as Cthulu is to an Ant. For this category which shall be named the "!Tropelike" category, a good example is the unfinished (but still fun to read) story [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads][Core Threads by theaceoffire]]

All these stories are stories that I personally find fun to read when viewed in the context of their category. Some are truly excellent such as "A Cadmean Victory" while others are pure wish fulfillment, and are probably objectively terrible, but are still fun to read, like "Core Threads".

*** I'll second all of these except Core Threads... I still don't get why people like it so much, I hated it, and usually I don't mind tropey fics

*** Cadmean Victory isn't that good. At first glance, yes, but when I re-read it, it felt a lot worse than it did the first time. It gives a complete character makeover to Harry and seriously overdoses on drama in the earlier stages of the fic.

**** It is pretty angsty and as you mature it does lose its appeal, but I remember I enjoyed a lot when I first read it, though back then I enjoyed bashing and I can't even stand it right now so I choose to remember it fondly and not attempt to read it again

**** Read it without preconception, without expectation, wothout bias, and do your absolute best to appreciate it for what it is and not what it isn't. No story is perfect, and far too many have been mocked and abandoned because the ones who read them saw only their faults and not their positives.

***** I must say that is the only fanfiction to make me tear up a bit. It threw me through so many hoops and twists. That is likely one of if not the best fanfictions I have read. I must admit i was not expecting emotions i haven't felt in a long while to well up and I'm not sure how to feel about that but... thank you

A Cadmean Victory is defined as "A victory at the cost of one's own ruin" it says nothing about one's death.

******** No, it was originally meant to be the epilogue of the story, but the author decided not to include it and to post it seperately. Based on my understanding, it is meant to vlear up tue question of which one of Voldemort or Harry survived the final battle, with the usage of the mirror of erised showing the true desire of the survivor's heart as they were so mentally strained from the battlw they weren't sure of their identity. In looking into the mirror, and seeing the desire of Harry Potter, and not of Tom Riddle, reflected there, the survivor is brought closure in the knowledge that he is indeed Harry, and that at last he is fully free to live his life having outlasted all elements of his crucible.

** My favorite is op! Neville. Of course, he's still rubbish at magic, but he can recognize all the dumb crap other people are doing. Master of the obvious Neville FTW

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts) has a kind of OP!Harry in that he operates on a completely different paradigm than pretty much everybody else. He's got his own problems and limitations, but he's powerful enough where he's able to shut down a lot of stuff, but then the power scaling is revealed to show that he's actually on the low end of what's actually possible.
