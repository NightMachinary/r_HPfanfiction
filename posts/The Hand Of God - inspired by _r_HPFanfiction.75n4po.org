  “As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took the chance: He leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco's grip, pointed all of them at Greyback, and yelled, “Stupefy!” The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground.*

*The Hand of God*

“No...” choked out Hermione.

“YES” said Voldemort, as he finished the dark ritual. A silver glow surrounded his body and slowly faded, sinking into the Dark Lord's skin. “Now my body is made invincible!”

A beautiful unicorn foal, the sacrifice, lay mangled at his feet.

“What happened?” asked Ron, slow on the uptake as usual.

The Dark Lord indulged him. “This ritual, O young freckled tampon, forcibly takes the protection that a being so pure and innocent as a baby unicorn deserves, and imbues it into the very fibres of my skin. No spell can hurt me now”

Hermione was incensed. How dare he misrepresent the subtleties of unicorn magic!

“Actually,” she sneered, raising her hand out of sheer habit, “many curses hitting the same place at the same time could break through the protection.”

Voldemort waved her off, “Technicalities. The number required is too large to ever be feasible. Why, not even ten Reductos would be enough! And they would all have to be cast by the same person! Otherwise the minuscule differences in timing would ruin the whole thing.”

He spread out his right hand. “Look, having big hands - my uncle had great hands, John Gaunt; filthy muggle, but good genes, very good genes, okay, massive hands, could reach an octave and a half on the piano, very big, very wide - you know, if you're a dark wizard, if I were a member of the order, if, like, okay, if I ran for minister, they would say I have one of the biggest hands anywhere in the world - it's true! - but when you're a Dark Lord, they try - oh, do they do a number 0 that's why I always start off: Went to Hogwarts, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune - you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we're a little disadvantaged - but you look at these hands, and you know they're great. But even with these hands, I couldn't hold more than five wands at once - it's impossible, I ha-”

He was cut off by a wave of Reductos smashing his face into a million flakes of bloodied meat.

“Ruddy bastard, takes forever to get to the point” grumbled Hagrid, eleven wands in his beautiful, monstrous, half-giant right hand.
