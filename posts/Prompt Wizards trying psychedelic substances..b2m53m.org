** Counter-point: Lots of wizards have probably tried to use stimulants of all kinds to advance their magics, historically.

Gateways or stepping stones towards insight or even enlightenment. Temporary changes to awareness, reaction times for use in wizarding combat.

Imagine some of Grindelwald's Storm Wizards being given "panzerschokolade" by some friendly german troops. Blasting curses at machinegun rates.

I only know what Panzerschokolade is, because it's in a Mass effect fanfiction, where quarians wanted to use the nazis to fight the geth.

** I have no idea what it's called, but Harry accidentally ingested something and goes tripping. He ends up apparating around the world causing havoc. It has an MiB crossover in that J and K are Obliviators trying to cover up Harry's antics that Tonks meets while trying to chase him down. Last I remember it was incomplete.
