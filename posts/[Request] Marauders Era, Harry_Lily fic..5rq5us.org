**** Or it is a time loop where he continues to travel back in time every couple years to shag his mum.

**** So, basically, the situation between Marty McFly and his mother in Back to the Future, except it's reciprocated and they're all wizards.

That sounds worse. Or like it might be prime parody material, either one.

(also, yes, I know, there /is/ worse, but this is the weirdest request I've seen on this sub since I subscribed. I think that might be messing with how I respond to this a little.)

**** Whoever did that deserves a big pat on the back.

I read a pretty good smut fic by James Davey Smith that was of a similar vain. It was Harry/Lily/Harry's OC sister. Not necessarily conforming to the request but it's close enough.

*** It's far from the most fucked up stuff I've read. You could have present time-frame Harry/Lily, like in a few fics I've read. And those aren't even the most messed up ones either.

**** Present day Lily/Harry makes perfect sense. She's missed out on 10 years of loving her son, so she feels she needs to go that extra step to make up for lost time.

I've seen smut with a lot less justification than that.

***** You can use the same argument with time traveling Harry. He feels like he missed out on his mother's love and so he goes the extra mile when he arrives in the past.
