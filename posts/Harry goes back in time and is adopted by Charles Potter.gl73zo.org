:END:
I read this fanfic I really liked but now I cannot find it. Fawkes sends Harry to the summer before James's first year and de-ages him to be a first year. Harry is given a backstory by Fawkes and the day he appeared in was his birthday. Also he was found by Voldemort as soon as he enter this new time. He later stood up to him during break. Also a tiny Fawkes became his pet. I would be very grateful if anyone can find it. Thanks for your time.

  Harry dies at the same time as Voldemort when the killing curse backfires the second time and is sent back to Kings cross station. Now however Fawkes meets him there and sends him somewhere all together different than the Hogwarts he knows. Not Slash
