** Could you possibly add a link to the first book in the series to your post? I hadn't heard of this story before this promo post, and while going and finding the first book to go start catching up wasn't difficult, adding a link might make the less motivated sub goers more likely to click through and try to catch up as well. :)

That being said, I love 'gamer-harry' fics, and its cool to see one that's progressed so far with as much thought and good writing put into it as this one! Most in the trope don't put in as much effort as you seem to have done here. Awesome job, and I look forward to reading the rest of your series and seeing where you take it!

*** It's all in the same story. 'Books' are just a way for me and readers to clearly differentiate between the Years.
