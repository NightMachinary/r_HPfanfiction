After living a life packed with murder and intrigue, the more placid daily life of his nemesis is deeply intriguing. He'd never read a book for fun, just to gain the upper hand, Harry's gotten sucked into LOTR. He'd never watched, let alone played Quidditch, and watching it from a seeker's perspective is fascinating. Eventually he forgets about taking over the wizarding world, he still phones it in but there's no dedication, it's all very self defeating. About the only time he really does anything is when he sends a death eater to fuck with Umbridge because even he can't stand the toady witch. Or to add a bit of action to the humdrum minutiae of live with the Dursleys.

Meanwhile, harry has to get used to the peanut gallery in his head.

‚ÄúMy lord, forgive me for questioning you, but you were the one who ordered Wormtail to kill the Diggory boy...‚Äù

‚ÄúTHAT WAS BEFORE I KNEW HOW CUTE THEY WERE TOGETHER.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't---‚Äú

‚ÄúAND-AND IT'S ALWAYS HARRY, HARRY, HARRY. WHY DOES NOBODY WANT TO DATE NEVILLE? HE'S HUMBLE, HARD-WORKING */AND/*HANDSOME.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe're meant to carry out a raid on the ministry in a half hour, my lord. Is now the time to be discussing---‚Äú

**** ‚ÄúWell, there you have it, Luna. Unfortunately, it looks like you'll be the witch heading home this week. Any final thoughts you'd like to share with the fans before leaving?‚Äù

/[Luna frowns, before looking around the room, bewildered]/

‚ÄúOh, you're right! This isn't my home at all!‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't---are you joking? I can never tell.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan I stay here anyway? It's just that I've already started a vegetable garden in the back yard is all.‚Äù

** So he doesn't give up world domination but Voldemort does quite enjoy watching Harry's every day school life and Harry kind of gets used to it and gets some use out of it in return in linkao3(Harry Potter and the problem of potions by wyste).

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
