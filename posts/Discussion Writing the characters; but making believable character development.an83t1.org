So, I've been starting to read fanfiction again; after having stopped for several years or so, after losing motivation. I've started to recently crave the idea of writing again, but it's been ages since I've actually read the books, and don't really want to fall back into my old style of writing, or other people's style of writing either.

People often make Harry too serious, or forget that he had a rather sarcastic attitude, Hermione isn't as perfect as fanfiction or Movie! Hermione is often portrayed as, Ron isn't as bad of a character; as I've seen in some certain fanfiction, I never thought that Sirius was a womanizer, but so many people have him written that way, et cetra, et cetra.

Any idea to get myself into the right mindset of writing the characters as more canon as possible, with believable character development? Or would writing something after skimming or reading the books again be the better option?

Any ideas/thoughts?

If you need help yourself, feel free to ask for help on certain things and people might help you!


** When it comes to making sure you're not writing people OOC, there's no substitute for re-reading the books. You've gotta re-read lots and lots of passages, IMO. And when you read from the perspective of a fanfic writer, you'll notice lots of things you didn't notice before (like the fact that Hermione "squeaks" all the time, and that most of Ron's jokes are this specific kind of fun sarcasm). These are the subtle details that will help your story feel "right." And re-reading will remind you why you fell in love with the series in the first place.

*** Hermione squeaking is something that always stood out to me in canon. She's also rather easy to tear up. And I like both of those habits (traits?) in her. It's a shame most fanfiction portray her as the opposite of that.

*** There was definitely a magical spark (Pardon the pun), from reading the books. Not just the magical aspect, but the characters. They aren't perfect, they aren't OP or know everything and anything, they make mistakes, they have faults.

One thing I hate about fanfiction is that they make the characters so perfect, in a way that's just not believable.

Giving a character a believable character development is great (and difficult to do), but it's a lot better than just rehashing stuff that you've read in fanfiction a bunch of times, with just a few changes. And it just ends up losing that special magical spark that canon had.

Rowling wasn't perfect either, by any stretch of the means; for instance, if she wanted to write Harry and Ginny she could have started developing it sooner, (or other such things); but that's where fanfiction comes in, we can take what we have and expand on.

I don't have the books on me now, but I'll find them to re read them and see if I can't incorporate ideas I have into fanfiction in a believable way.

** I suppose I'd suggest writing little scenes first, and then see if you want to weave them together into the grander narrative.

Take Ron for example, how can we develop him? Expand on his dynamic with Ginny might be a good start. Ginny sees him as a peer as well as a big brother--she goes to him when she needs help in CoS, she's frequently seen in his company in later books, but she's also harsher towards him than any of her other brothers save post-GOF Percy.

So build on that. What if Ron sees a couple of Slytherins giving Ginny a hard time:

Does Ron retaliate on Ginny's behalf?

Does Ron let Ginny fight her own battle?

Does Ron let Ginny curse the Slytherin, only to take the blame for her when she gets in trouble?

Does Ron try to talk to Ginny, even though he doesn't think he's good at that sort of thing?

Do that sort of thing over and over with different characters--give them little scenes with many options and then experiment with consequences.

** From a writing standpoint, I make a strengths and weaknesses list for my characters to ensure that they have a mix of positive and negative traits. For example, a character who is more skilled magically may have difficulty cultivating friendships with others, or a character who has less cunning may be better at connecting with others on a personal level.

** When writing in general (which I'll admit, it's been a while) I have found that for me, the only way to write a full 3-dimensional character is to know more details about the character than you actually wright. The books do a great job of giving you a firm foundation of the characters but elaborate more in your head about their childhood, preference, idiosyncrasies, habits, yadda yadda yadda. Then as you write them into different settings and situations, their actions become more natural rather than manufactured.
