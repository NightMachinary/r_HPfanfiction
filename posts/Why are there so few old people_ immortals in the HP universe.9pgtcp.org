Magicals live for a really long time, right? Why are most of the people shown in the 10-50 age range? and Horcruxes require murder, right? Why is it so uncommon and ‘dark'? people are murdered by the thousands in war, its not exactly a big deal. Ask a person with a terminal illness if they'll let you kill them, boom immortality. I don't get it.


** Assisted suicide doesn't split the soul, see the Snape/Dumbledore situation. Killing an enemy in combat probably doesn't work either. There's no evidence Molly split her soul by killing Bellatrix.

As for old people, well, Albus is 115, Aberforth also in his 110s, Bathilda Bagshot and Grizelda Marchbanks must both be around 150, Slughorn is around 90 but has the appearance of a muggle in his 60s or 70s. Hagrid is around 70 as well if he went to school together with Tom Riddle.

The only real question is, where are all the grandparents? The only grandma we see in the entire series is Augusta Longbottom.

*** In one way though, she's great. She leaves a LOT of room for fic. All her plot holes and gaps in the worldbuilding, that's where fanfic lives.

Better authors, like Robin Hobb, do such a spectacular job at worldbuilding and plotting that there really isn't room for fic. There are no plot holes to fill and no loose ends to tie up. What is there to write fic about there?

One of my favourite tropes relies heavily on the fact that for a lot of HBP, Harry really had no idea what Hermione was up to or who she was with. That's shoddy writing (how do you lose track of one of your lead characters for most of a book, I ask you) but it's fertile ground for fic writers. In the same way, the holes in JKR's worldbuilding allows great scope for innovation and interpretation from fic writers.

Her worldbuilding may be shit in a purely objective sense, but she couldn't have written a series or created a world more suitable for fic if she'd tried.

There's no reason you can't just change things about fics that aren't swiss cheese. I could be wrong, but I think it would be easier if anything. There's a reason why people stick to the stations of canon and what we know.. it's already been fleshed out. Less original content creation required.

***** That's the thing tho - JKR hit the balance just right between having a story and worldbuilding that's good enough to capture readers, but not so good that there's no room for innovation. And she wrote fantastic characters with complex personalities.

Another story with almost non-existent worldbuilding and plot holes galore, but excellent characters was the original Star Trek.

I don't understand what you're saying though. Do you mean that because Harry Potter is famous I can't have opinions about the books or analyse them? Because I'm gonna have to disagree with you there.

The sad and simple truth is that not only is the Harry Potter series objectively not particularly well-written, it's not even all that original. JKR lucked out by tapping into a particular moment where the world was ripe for her story, and by creating an unforgettable cast of charming characters that captured the public imagination. The same thing happened to George Lucas. The same thing happened to E. L James, minus the charming characters. The right story at the right time.

I have no shame in admitting that I don't write objectively good books. I write books designed to make people happy and get them off. That's what they're for.

In addition, I believe that you may want to go back and look at my first post in the thread, which argues almost exactly what you said in your previous post (Harry potter's flaws in terms of worldbuilding is part of what I like about the series, because it makes fanfiction easy while books that are objectively better don't have room for fanfic in the same way) , but without the personal attacks.

** Because J.K.Rolling seems to see the idea of immortality as evil, or at least it seems that way to me.

The anti-immortality stuff is in there from the first book when Dumbledore talks about the destruction of the philosopher's stone.

"/you know the stone was really not such a wonderful thing.as much money and life as you could want! The two things most humans beings would choose, trouble is humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them/" *~~page 215*

Can you imagen what the harry potter world would look like if Flamel has freely published how to make a philosopher's stone.(provided the way to make it is was relatively benign.)

** Consider the setting, a school. Harry rarely has contact with adults of any age outside of teachers, his friends families and his own family. Its just not mentioned often.

Also consider that there was a wizarding war in Harry's parents time. It likely the older and better trained wizards died fighting. The dark families would have been protected by Voldemort and going back further Grindlewald. Probably other dark lords too.

#+end_quote

I don't think that's true. We don't get many ages for people outside the Black family, and they are noted to have engaged in much inbreeding (though probably less than the Gaunts) which explains their lowered life expectancy. Sirius's parents were cousins for goodness sake. Armando Dippet, the Headmaster before Dumbledore, lived to /355/ without a Philosopher's Stone. Dumbledore was still somewhat spry at 115 and looked to be living much longer before getting cursed before HBP. In normal circumstances, wizard probably live much longer on average than Muggles (there's a lot more things likely to kill you as a wizard though so, heh, trade-offs).

Horcruxes don't just require murder, you have to know the spell(s) to split your soul after the damage. Murder isn't the same as killing. Snape's soul is mentioned to not have been damaged when he killed Dumbledore. The reason it's rare is that aside from the Philosopher's Stone, immortality seems to only be achievable by someone who relishes in killing just to benefit themselves.

** On the age thing, I suspect it's because life in the books is viewed through the eyes of school-age children. We meet their parents, teachers and examiners plus one or two others. That's not all that uncommon really. I've seen several good fanfiction stories that expand on what we see in canon.

As for horcruxes, the books are pretty explicit that it requires a deliberate act of murder (think about Dumbledore's conversation with Snape when the former asks the latter to kill him). Putting someone with a terminal illness to rest isn't that, and even killing someone in war is arguably different.

** Though never described in the books, the method for creating a Horcrux is much more complicated (and extremely vile and evil) than just killing someone. Harry was an exception, apparently, because Voldemort's soul by that point was already so fractured a splinter just fucked off onto the nearest train to forehead town, or something.

She's said in interviews that she's been tempted to publish the method for creating a Horcrux but that it's too terrible and disgusting for her to do so, or something.

** You sound like someone who would love HPMOR.

The real reason is because JKR didn't consider it. She said Dumbledore was 150 years old, but also said he's born in 1881, making him ~115 at death- definitely very old, but not outside the lifespan of a "normal" person. In reality, magical people don't live significantly longer than normal people, that seems to be mostly fanon.

For Horcruxes, you again have to look to fanon/headcanon. Based on interviews, it's implied that normally "just killing" someone isn't enough to make a horcrux, Harry was a special case. Some people have some really gruesome fan theories about it. And there's a difference between death/murder. In the first book, they refer to drinking a unicorn's blood as giving you temporary survival, but forcing you to live a cursed half-life. You can also look at it from another perspective, the idea of eternal life without negative side effects. It ties into splitting the soul, so you're not "really" immortal.

We'll have to see what retcons get added with Flamel in Fantastic Beasts, of course.

They do live significantly longer, provided they aren't inbred like many purebloods are (the Gaunts especially, but so too were the Blacks which is why most died young-ish). Dippet lived to 355 without a philosopher's stone, and Harry thought Dumbledore would live much longer than his did without the cursed hand and getting murdered business.

***** No, it's also confirmed in "The Paintings of Hogwarts: Masterpieces from the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Sets". It's not just the movie props. But even if we're going to ignore that (because the filmverse is deemed by you to be non-canon in its entirety) then even canon sources have examples. Marchbanks is ancient enough to have given Dumbledore his NEWT examinations (and Bathilda Bagshot appears to be in the same age range), Madam Hooch was most likely born around or before World War I, Elphias Doge lived longer than Dumbeldore (the latter of whom was still very capable of moving quickly despite his age),.

Harry himself referred to Dippet as "ancient-looking" and "feeble", which is entirely consistent with the films's given age for the man (Dumbeldore is never described that way, despite being well over 100). Wizards, barring certain circumstances (inbreeding especially), live much longer on average than Muggles.

That's a book about the movie props. Just because bad info is repeated, doesn't mean it isn't still bad info.

Let's put this another way: I absolutely believe that wizards and witches can live twice as long as muggles, but people wouldn't be impressed with Nicolas Flamel for finding a way to make the Elixir of Life if it wasn't a significant step forward in extending wizard longevity, and they would have to have been impressed with it more than a few centuries earlier for the accomplishment to be known and nearly forgotten by the time the kids are researching Flamel in the first book.

******* How would it fail to be a significant step? Dippet lived to 355, at which time Harry referred to him as looking ancient and feeble; clearly he wasn't going to live that much longer if that was his state during Riddle's school years. It is doubtful Flamel looked the same, he was bordering on twice the age Dippet is listed at and could have gone on indefinitely. Immortality is impressive, but there's no reason to doubt the age given in the films. It contradicts noting in the books and lines up with Harry's observation.
