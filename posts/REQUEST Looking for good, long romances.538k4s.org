Good evening. As title says i am looking for good romance stories. Could read anything but slash and Harry/Hermione. Sorry for my bad english and i know that probably someone else asked for that already but it is Saturday evening...


** Are you willing to read a Pansy x Percy fic? This one's been in my favorites for a long time, 92k words so it's pretty long.

** How do you feel about Hermione/Draco? Some of my faves are linkffn(Aurelian by bittyblueeyes; As Certain Dark Things are to be Loved by somuchcloser; The Request by redhead414; Rebuilding by colubrina; Isolation by bex-chan)

I'm also a big fan of Hermione/Sirius or Remus but typically only when time-travel is involved, so linkffn(One Hundred and Sixty Nine by Mrs J's Soup; The Debt of Time by shayalonnie; Divergence by abovetheserpentine; The Last Marauder by Resa Aureus).

I'm sure I have more but that's already a bit of a huge rec list dump. Hope you like at least a few of them!

  Dark Magic changes a person. What lines do you cross to kill Voldemort? What do you give up? How do you live afterwards? Dark, some sex & torture. Hermione-centric story; slowly develops into Dramione. The wait is worth it. 1 yr post Battle of Hogwarts.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
