:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for an older fic from a few years ago. Ginny gets sent to Azkaban and saved on the way over to the island. Muggle criminals are the ones that got her out. On Harry's request.

I just can't find it and I don't recall the name.

*** Thank you! My favs list on that site for HP is just too long to go searching for it (1200+) when on mobile.

Also, chapter 12.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is a thief and a lawbreaker long before he gets his letter. Upon discovering he's a wizard, he sets out for the wizarding world - but he's doing things his way. Dumbledore has no idea what his decision to leave Harry with the Dursleys has wrought. Harry/Multi, darkish, some Dumbledore bashing, rating may go up later.
