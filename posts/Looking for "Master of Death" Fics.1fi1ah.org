I have recently discovered that I enjoy post-Hogwarts stories where Harry ends up being the "Master of Death" (however the author portrays that concept) via the Deathly Hallows. Has anyone read any good stories that follows along these lines? I'm especially interested in cross-overs of all kinds.

Edit: Here is an example of a [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8282970/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Aftermath][HP(MoD)xAvengers]] crossover (there seem to be lots of these) and a [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9115767/1/Harry-and-the-Blades][HP(MoD)xStarcraft]] crossover. While both of those stories are of questionable quality, I /really/ enjoyed Esama's "Whispers in Corners" which is a great HP(MoD)xSherlock(BBC) crossover (I have a copy of all of [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/1kaz229idzs6h7a/Esama.ZIP?dl=0][Esama's available works]] if anyone wants them).


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7779108/1/The-Master-of-Death][The Master of Death]] by rgm0005 is a great fic that's set in the Dresden Files universe. Unfortunately the version on fanfiction.net isn't that long, but there's a lot more to read in the DarkLordPotter Dresden Files WBA section.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1446455/Perspicacity][Perspicacity]]. It's a short but powerful piece about Harry trying to rescue Hermione from her own obsession.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] by Morta's Priest is a great HPxAvengers crossover that contains a Master of Death element.

  The world is breaking; war and technology are pushing on the edge of the unbelievable, and S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately attempts to keep the peace. Their newest target is a man called Harry; he is capable of impossible feats and has no clear origin or allegiance. A new piece on the chessboard, one that doesn't follow any of the rules.

** There is a good one i read awhile ago but cannot remember the name of at all.

The story opens with Hermione stealing a time turner to chase down Harry. As far as I can remember there was a significant death at the battle that prompted all the time travel.

Harry also has a time turner and takes the time to wander the earth and learn, and master the hallows.

But it was the ending that had a real good take on what it means to "master death"

So if that rings an bells with anyone let me know, I kinda want to re-read it now
