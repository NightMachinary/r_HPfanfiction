In Darkness Ascendant, Dementors are one half of a more dangerous creature. Unable to destroy them, an older mage society separates them and a Potter hides one half away where dementors can never go.

The other half is a large, putrid female that is incapable of moving. She is just a whitish-blue rotting mass of flesh in the vague shape of a 700lb, 5'8‚Äù woman. Without the male half, the dementia will hold a human in place and create an idyllic fantasy world, keeping its prisoner alive. The prisoner will eventually realize they're trapped in a prison. And then the idyll resets and they forget they're in a prison. Until they remember. And realize they learned this before. This repeats as long as the person is trapped within. The more intelligent the prisoner, the quicker they realize. If Hermione was trapped within, she would realize it within a day. Riddle would realize it within twelve hours or so.

Without the female half, they are unable to procreate. But when they're together, what should the be? One creature or should the dementor and dementia always have been separate and mages in the past were just able to find the colony to steal the dementias?


** What are they together?

Severus Snape.

** Together? There is only one possible thing that could induce that much terror:

A Weeping Angel with the depression-inducing aura of the Dementor.

** What if coming together they create a new combined horror for the victim... like some form of paralytic disorder or catatonic state where the victim, instead of being aware of their soul being eaten, becomes aware of all the souls the dementor has eaten... like they will experience a form of hell that only lovey duvey dementors create.

** Were you by any chance inspired by SCP? It has a very similar vibe.

What does the dementia actually feed on while the person is trapped? And what happens when they cannot feed? (They cannot move, after all.)

It sounds like a Dementia feeds off the mind while the Dementor feeds on the soul? Maybe together they feed on all three (the body, also). I remember reading an absolutely horrifying vision of dementors in [[/spoiler][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls]] which might help you with ideas.

What would the combined form be called?

*** Secure contain protect? Not directly but i have read their stuff before so it could be ancillary.

I would think as a minor(?) demon, they're immortal and only need to feed to reproduce when the male half is there. I like the feeding on body bit. Perhaps as it feeds, it turns the embraced into a new child. OOH. And because their soul was removed by the dement, they want A NEW ONE. But because they can't have one anymore, they jist steal others'.

I tried reading that before but was unimpressed. I'll try again.

A dement, I should think.

**** huh if you remove the end letters it could just be "Demon".

SCP is a mixed bag, since it's written by so many people.

** The other half of a dementor should be the conceptual opposite. An enochian angel.
