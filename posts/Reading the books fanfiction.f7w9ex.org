:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So there was this Harry Potter fanfiction that I read a while ago, and I'm trying to find it again. It was on Archive of Our Own, and it didn't have a lot of chapters. It took place during the Goblet of Fire, and Harry could feel everything that was going on. Helpppppp it was really well-written too. I just want to re-read it


** “Feel everything that was going on”? Like being an Empath, or some kind of Seer? What?

*** Oh, well, first of all, I actually found it because they updated it. What I meant was that as they were reading, Harry felt the same sensations that he felt during the actual book. Like, for example, when he was sleeping in the book, he would fall asleep outside of the book as well.

***** Time to take a chance by Bookworms75. Here's the link if you wanna read it. I mean, it only had 3 chapters, but it's long (like 30,000 words per chapter), and it's well-written.
