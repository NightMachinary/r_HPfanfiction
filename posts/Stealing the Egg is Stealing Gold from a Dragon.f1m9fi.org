The Triwizard Tournament organizers fail to anticipate that putting the golden clue eggs into the dragons nests is the same as giving them a "hoard".

All successful competitors are struck with the "Dragon Sickness", a la The Hobbit.


** I think you mean a "hoard". Could be interesting if handled well.

** Hmm...hey, it's established that [[https://redd.it/5e0b7r][Harry loves gold]], so...what if he fell asleep with the golden egg in hand one night, dreaming gold-ish thoughts, and woke up as a dragon? Ala Eustace Scrubb in Narnia?

**** You know what, I think I'll make a prompt of my own. Whether it's creature heritage, exposure to strange magical artifacts, accidental magic or animagus training mishaps, Harry just can't stay human.

***** I feel like I've been recommending this a lot lately, but in linkffn(13230340) Harry has some draconic tendencies---though he's really more of a bookwyrm than Smaug.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. But more importantly, Albus Dumbledore is a comedian. Not in the literal sense, but every other sentence out of his mouth is chuckle-inducing or at least groanworthy. Comedy fic, largely thanks to one slightly eccentric headmaster. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
