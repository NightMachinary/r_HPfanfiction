** I'm hesitant to recommend this story to be honest.

It's /probably/ the most "complete" 'characters read the books and react to them' type of story. It's currently half way through the third book, but it's still updated regularly and I have no doubts that the author will see it to its completion, no matter how long it takes (it's been removed and reposted several times across several sites due to copywrite and even went through a period of being updated solely through email. Determined if nothing else.).

The reason I'm reluctant to recommend it is because I don't think the characterization of several characters is done well, like at all, and really that's the only thing that matters with stories like this. It's like they become over the top caricatures of how people /wished/ they would act or something. But even that isn't correct.

Sirius becomes this over protective stand in father figure, and it's such a strange departure from his actual character. He goes as far as to literally spank a /fifteen/ year old Harry for doing something that occurred three years ago and before he even met Sirius. The craziest part? Everyone is /totally/ okay with this. Business as usual.

If you can look past the judicial use and threats of corporal punishment, and can look past the awful characterization, then give it a shot.

  A character reads the books story heavy on Sirius and Harry. THERE IS NO ACTUAL RECITATION OF THE BOOKS!
