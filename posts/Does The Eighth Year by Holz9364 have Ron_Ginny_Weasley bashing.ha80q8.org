I don't mind the pairings but whenever I seem to come across anything with Harry and Hermione ending up with slytherins it tends to have a contrived break-up scene with a load of Ron/Ginny bashing.

Usually not bothered with just giving things a try, but more than 900,000 words is a big commitment if half way through it takes a left turn and becomes a typical bashfest!

(I don't mind spoilers in the answers.)

Anything other else post-war fics with non-canon pairings you'd suggest?

Thanks :)


** I gave it a look for you and it doesn't appear to. At least with the first five chapters.
