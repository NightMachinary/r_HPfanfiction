I just read a fic where Harry falls through the veil instead of Sirius and date sends him back in time. He resumes a new identity and becomes Evan Granger. He falls in love and has a daughter, you guess it: Hermione. They raise her and don't let her know her dad's magical - Hermione doesn't know this until Harry shows up at the ministry just as his 15 year old self falls through... my prompt is basically just this and to expand on it and maybe show reactions of the 'new' Harry.
