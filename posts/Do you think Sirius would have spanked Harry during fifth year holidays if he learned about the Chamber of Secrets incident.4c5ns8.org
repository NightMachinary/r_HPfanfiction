I've been reading off and on a story linkffn(Under a Watchful Eye) (more like begrudgingly skimming through) and I just read chapter 40.

The context is that several characters are given copies of the HP books and are forced to read them. After finishing the second book (Chamber of Secrets) Sirius decides it prudent to deliver some corporal punishment to Harry, twenty spanks to be specific. The justification being that Harry put himself in harms way willingly (a pretty fucking dumb reason to spank a kid all things considered).

Honestly, to me it ruined the entire story. In no conceivable universe would Sirius ever harm Harry like that /especially/ after reading in great detail about the life Harry had with the Dursleys. Corporal punishment would be completely off the table. Period. Plus, Sirius has really only known Harry for what, a month? Not counting the letters sent over GoF obviously. It's /super/ odd for a grown man to spank a fifteen year old kid, who honestly doesn't even know him that well.

Reading the reviews for the chapter most people seem to think it was justified and added a lot more depth to their relationship. I think it's all bollocks. How about you guys?


** Yeah...I tend to nope out of stories with corporal punishment. Completely leaving my opinions on it in real life out of the equation - in fics, it just tends to feel like the author indulging their kink, particularly when it involves spanking a character older than twelve. I don't share that kink, so it makes me uncomfortable and I leave.

What you just described reminds me of that, only this author is trying to sneak it in with a weak justification. At any rate, Sirius doesn't strike me as the spanking kind. I think, in the situation you described, if he was really that upset about it, he would make Harry promise never to do anything like that again, and then maybe ground him or something. If that. I've never thought of Sirius as the disciplinarian type.

*** Exactly.

Also, putting aside Harry's home life, I doubt Sirius would ever physically punish a child considering the home he grew up in.

** These kind of fics are always super weird. They always feel a bit sexualised to me. I don't agree with hitting children at all, especially not in a calm, structured way, but when it gets to teenagers it crosses well into wtf territory.

*** I've got nothing against some good ole spanking going on between two consenting adults, by all means partake, but ya corporal punishment like that (especially at the age Harry is) is just so out of place it ruins the entire story for me.

It's even weirder when you take into account that Ron was spanked by his dad a few chapter previously. Definitely more than just toeing the line of kink territory...

*** Yes, I agree on the calm structured way....I have always thought of spanking when the person is really angry and has lost control of themselves. Which doesn't make it right at all but at least is more convincing than the way some authors portray it.

**** If one believes in corporal punishment, but not in abuse, then it would follow that you would wait until you were calm to administer the punishment so you wouldn't go too far in your anger (and fear). I can see an angry dad just whaling away, but a calm one counting out 20 strokes exactly, or whatever had been decided.

** In real life I wouldn't put anything past anyone...meaning I think people are capable of doing all kinds of crazy things even if I wouldn't myself do them.

But if he did spank Harry, I would immediately think he is a creeper. For one thing, as someone else pointed out he has only known Harry for a month and Harry is 15!!

If Harry were say 2, and had been staying with Sirius this entire time then a swat for something or other would be more reasonable.

But anytime a story features a teen or pre-teen getting spanked by someone I stop reading and start wondering about the author of the story. Yuck.

** It sounds like that's the author's / reader's kink and they'll use any excuse to justify it.

I don't see the point in punishing a teenager for something he did /three/ years ago when he had no real authority figure. For most of the books Harry's only source of rules were wizarding laws and Hogwarts school rules. When he broke those, he was punished according to those rules (warning letters from the ministry, points deducted, detentions, etc). He also /knew/ he was breaking a rule, although granted, some of them were beyond his control or he was wrongly accused. He never had rules set out by a parental figure, so he can't really be held accountable for breaking arbitrary rules that he was given years after the fact. Sirius could talk to him, especially if he has concerns, but punishing him is weird.

EDITED: I also think corporal punishment is wrong, especially on older children. I can see toddlers getting the occasional swat on the bottom when they're misbehaving, but that's about it.

*** The crazy part is that Sirius /did/ talk to him, and honestly those parts were fairly well written and fleshed out their relationship rather well, but then even after they come to an understanding Sirius still thinks it's a great idea to spank him.

It boggles my mind, and considering how often the subject comes up during the story, it's most likely the authors kink.

** Would be kind of weird. I could maybe see Mrs. Weasley, or some other character, doing that, but for Sirius it would be out of character. He hasn't known Harry long, Harry is older, it happened three years ago, and Sirius isn't particularly paternal or disciplinary.

** Sirius's family life is the sort where I would expect him to have been subjected to corporal punishment repeatedly and often, and it would only have made him more defiant. It would have made him resent his family even more. So he of all people wouldn't use it.

Punishments work best when they are closely linked to transgressions. In this case, it's three years after the fact.

Here, Sirius is essentially telling him that he was stupid or evil to trust Hagrid and for not being forthcoming toward other adults. Hagrid was the first person in Harry's memory to be kind to him, and a neglectful or abusive upbringing does not teach you to be trusting. It's worse than normal. Also, in this story, apparently the Dursleys had been physically abusive, which makes it even worse.

** Even given that the books are about characters a decade older than me, Sirius simply doesn't seem like the type of character who would spank a kid, particularly not Harry, particularly given how shitty Harry's childhood was. Or if he did, it would be because he lost it, not because he thinks it's a reasonable punishment. Part of this is that I'd be shocked if Sirius's parents were not overly fond of corporal punishment, and Sirius very obviously strives to be completely different from his family

If you told me that Augusta Longbottom spanked (or used some magical equivalent on) Neville, I wouldn't be terribly surprised. But that's partly because acceptance of corporal punishment is extremely generational. Given that the wizarding world is slow to modernize, it is conceivable that the adults in Harry Potter would be less opposed to corporal punishment than adults of the same age in the muggle world, however, so once you get to the younger adults, it's not so obvious how they'd approach matters. But I would definitely assume the older ones would not be in the "never hits" category.

** As others have pointed out, this seems totally out of character for Sirius. As a Hogwarts student, he routinely put himself in danger--becoming an Animagus, hanging out with a werewolf, etc. And then he left school to be in the Order, and pulled the Secret Keeper bluff so that Voldemort would come after /him/.

Honestly, I would expect Sirius to be rather proud of what Harry did. If anything, Harry is less reckless than his godfather. Consider how in OOTP Sirius has to be shouted down by Dumbledore and Harry several times with regard to his dangerous choices, like coming out to the Platform, or coming with the Order to the Ministry (though he doesn't always listen). And when Harry refuses to meet Sirius during their Hogsmeade weekend, Sirius gets mad and says that Harry is "less like his father than [Sirius] thought."

I suppose one could argue that while Sirius himself would have done the same thing as Harry in CoS, he's teaching Harry to be better than he was by spanking him. But aside from the aforementioned reckless tendencies (which indicate perhaps a blindspot where such behavior is concerned), I think that Sirius wouldn't actually see a refusal on Harry's part to put himself into danger as the right choice. Yes, Harry did make some unintelligent decisions, but the kid was twelve and not thinking straight, seeing as his best friend's sister had been taken down into the Chamber, so I don't see how spanking would actually teach him anything ("Harry, I'm spanking you because 12 year old you needs to learn to act more rationally in an incredibly emotional and stressful situation"). And Sirius is in the Order; he knows what it means to sacrifice yourself for a greater purpose. Spanking Harry would probably discourage that, which isn't something he'd want to do. Not to mention the fact that Harry managed to win in the end of CoS.

So...no. Definitely not.
