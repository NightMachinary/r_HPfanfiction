More specifically, I don't want fics where Harry and Hermione turn to each other, with the mindset that they've always been right for each other or any of that shite. I'm more interested in the idea that because they only have each other, they eventually become closer, whether they want it or not. Even better if they don't forget the fact that they already have feelings for other people and therefore feel guilty about it.

I don't even know if a fic like this exists, but might as well ask. if it doesn't exist, get on that, fellow writers.


** Watching this with great interest, as I think it's the most plausible scenario for them getting together.

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.

** [[/u/Darklooshkin]] has a one-shot in his [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/21/The-random-craziness-file]] . I like it because it doesn't ignore or smooth over the characters' flaws and rough edges.

** There are innumerable such "tent fics", but they rapidly dwindle when you start eliminating the Harmony crap.

I was about to link you four fics, but it seems that two of them have been deleted.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5479108/1/Dirty-Laundry]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7094510/1/Now-that-We-re-Alone]]

The other two were:

Stay

#+begin_quote
  There was a moment in that tent...a moment she'll never forget.
#+end_quote

Duties and Dreams

#+begin_quote
  When Ron storms out during the Horcrux hunt, he leaves behind two friends who struggle to remember that life is worth living, after all. Pain and comfort co-mingle as Harry and Hermione come to grips with their future. Harry/Hermione, implied H/G and R/He
#+end_quote

Unfortunately I didn't note down the author names, but you might be able to google them with that info.

Oh, also, try this:
