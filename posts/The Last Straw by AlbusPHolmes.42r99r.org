While this story isn't very new (it was published in 2013), it isn't very well-known so I thought I should share this masterpiece with you guys.

The story is a short, character-centered oneshot of an encounter that led to Dumbledore facing Grindelwald in their legendary duel. With great writing, strong grammar, and one of the best portrayals of Dumbledore I've seen until now, this oneshot was truly a pleasure to read.

Dumbledore's characterization in this story is absolutely brilliant. There's a healthy mix of ruthlessness and kindness, which I believe is spot on Dumbledore's character. After reading this story, I feel like I understand why Voldemort and Grindelwald feared Dumbledore so much. He's just that badass in this story. However, there is also the canon grandfatherly kindness that we all love (except for the Dumbledore Bashers out there).

The story also shows small details that hint to Dumbledore's canon personality. His humor, his observance, his politeness, and his skill in Transfiguration. These things make it feel like this is an extension of canon Dumbledore, not just a fanfiction portrayal of him.

Finally, it fits so well thematically with Dumbledore's character and the canon events that led up to the legendary duel.

TL;DR: This story is awesome. If you like reading badass, classy-as-hell Dumbledore stories, be sure to read this!

*** It's a great one shot, always leaves me wanting more. I'd love to read a story built around this Dumbledore in the grindlewald war, but I'm afraid if you made a long story out of it this Dumbledore would become watered down.

**** I'd agree. With such a depth of character - especially one that is wrought so well, any significant length over the necessary would be stretching it thin.

***** Yeah. While not always the case (sometimes length is needed to add depth to the character), this piece is a short work of art.

A longer story would be written as a build up to this point, which would be the beginning of the climax of the story. As such it would need to be /very/ well planned and written in order to not lose the intensity and mystique of dumbledore's character.

I think It would be beyond most (if not all) fanfiction writers abilities. Not only just due to difficulty, but also due to the source material. It would be hard to keep dumbledore's power, his morals, and his leadership prevalent during a long war in which he actively avoids a confrontation with his former friend.

Edit: I think the best (possibly only) way to accomplish a story that works would be to do a series of events that slowly break dumbledore's resolve, ending with this story. Show the other straws that led to this meeting being the last one. One of the biggest would be seeing the Muggle concentration camps that grindlewald is allowing (or encouraging?)

**** I do wish the author would write a oneshot (or more) about Dumbledore and Grindelwald's duel. That would be epic and extremely fun to read.

***** I'm not sure it would be the same though. Here, the magic is understated, an afterthought. It adds to the power of Dumbledore since he does amazing magic as a matter of course. But as soon as you write about a duel, the magic needs to come into the foreground, be the star of the piece. The writing style would need to change, and the magic would feel a lot more forced. The only way to keep up the feeling of immense power would be to explicitly show the power being used, and that can easily bog down a story.
