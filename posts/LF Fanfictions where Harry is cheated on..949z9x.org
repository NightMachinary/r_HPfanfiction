Hey there!

I am looking for fics where Harry is basically cheated on.

There are two kind of Fanfics that I look for.

1. Where Harry's girlfriend / wife / bethroted cheat on him with another guy / girl.
2. Where Harry's friend / family and etc betray Harry by stealing his girlfriend / wife / bethroted.

One good fic that comes to mind when thinking about this kind of Fanfictions is a Fic called "Just Sad" by Perseus Potter-Black.

and "The Path to Judge" by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2248620/Dragon-Master-Naruto-003][D]]ragon Master Naruto 003

So, if anyone know Fanfics like what I asked for or resemble the ones that I have linked and spoke off in the thread then I will very much appreciate it if you link them here :)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]]: [[/spoiler][Harry was neglecting his women in favor of satisfying his bloodlust on the front line. After several years, Hermione lost patience and ORDERED Jack O'Neill to fuck her. Harry quickly found out and personally executed O'Neill. Luna however defended Hermione and pointed out that Harry shared part of the blame by neglecting them. This betrayal would have much worse consequences down the road, and billions of would die as a result.]] I couldn't help but to think that Darth Marrs took a page from his personal experience.

*** It sounds good but the fact that it's a crossover kind of ruins it for me. If you know other fics then I'll appreciate if you could link them.

  Alone. That's all he's ever been. Whether he was at the Dursleys or Azkaban. Flung straight from the frying pan of hell, into the fires of war, Harry must learn to adapt quickly. On top of this, new secrets come to light, forcing Harry to ask, "Does family make the man?" HeavilyLight-sided Harry! Manipulative!Dumbledore, eventually evil! Warfic!
