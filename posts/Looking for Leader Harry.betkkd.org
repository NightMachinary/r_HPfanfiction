Can anyone recommend some good, preferably long, fics with Harry in a clear leadership position? I like the idea of set ranks or hierarchy, whether that is within the Aurors, within an extended version of the war, or elsewhere. I would like to see Harry leading competently and being respected by others for his position.

I've searched for something similar before without much luck, but recently read the Dangerverse series which reignited my urge to read this dynamic. Hopefully you guys can help!

Any pairing (or lack thereof) is fine. I don't mind most tropes as long as the writing is decent, and I would be fine with the leadership role being in the past as long as it is mentioned or informs some of the interactions in the story. Thanks for any help!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): About 10 years after the War, Head Auror Harry has to deal with a surprising marriage contract, and he masterfully uses this opportunity to advance his career.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): Extreme AU in which Harry is raised by own parents, but that doesn't make him a nice guy as he will eventually conquer Europe as the Emperor.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): The real war began after Voldemort's fall. He, Hermione, and Ron again led them to victory.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Being failed again, Harry declares war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot after Voldemort's defeat. His friends are nevertheless supporting him fanatically.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971): This is pretty much the only finished, plain vanilla â€˜Wizards in Space' fic. Harry led his people to safety again and again, and is being totally worshipped. Unfortunately, this fic suffers from many shortcomings.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** I really like the dynamic Harry has with the other Aurors (sometimes irritable, sometimes at odds, but ultimately working together as a team) in linkffn(The Aurors) . He's pretty well-respected in the department, despite how young he is at that point.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...
