I've been reading a few fics where the quality, writing style and ability seems to make massive peaks and troughs between chapters, so I was just wondering if it could be multiple authors.


** It happens from time to time, but also betas change pretty often, as does using one in the first place. I've read stories where only a handful of chapters actually went through someone to edit/check before it was put up, by the author's own admission.

** Consistency comes with practice, in pretty much every discipline. Sports, Gaming, Painting, Writing: An experienced practitioner will be more consistent than a beginner. FanFiction is often written mostly by beginner-amateurs, which doesn't lend it self to consistency by default :)

A related point is that some people are better at some stuff than other stuff. For example, a chapter with little Dialogue and Mystery might be easier to write than a witty dialogue-exchange for some people. It is like when people suck a drawing hands or eyes, or a soccer player is especially bad at penalty shots. With enough practice even the stuff you're bad at becomes good enough, but that hasn't happened for a lot of the writers in fanfiction.

Also Authors sometimes get a beta for later chapters, which helps fixing the rough edges. And similarly, authors sometimes just improve over time while writing a story: The most obvious fics where I saw this happen is in "/The Difference One Man Can Make/" where the writing just improves so much over time, and in "/Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/" where the writing in book two is way better as in book one.

Takes these together, and you get a seemingly random quality between scenes.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Might be.

But I feel like this sometimes happens with my story. Right now, I'm going back and rewriting a lot of scenes/paragraphs, but I often skip some because they were just better.

I think many authors, like me, have paragraphs or scenes or writing sessions that just stand out more, you know? Sometimes I'm writing sentences that I love, and other times I write 5k words that I could wipe my ass with.

** I'm not sure if it's common, but it definitely happens. Delende Est was written by 2 authors, for example, and there are some pretty obvious differences in styles. There's also the author nostresreges who wrote a bunch of popular stories back in the day, which was 3 authors.

** "My Immortal" (that terrible, brain-shriveling old fanfic with the unending, super-insane authorship drama surrounding it) was allegedly co-written by two people, plus at least one other person who allegedly hacked into it. So there's definitely a precedent for this sort of thing happening. From what I've seen, it's especially common in the smut-writing community.
