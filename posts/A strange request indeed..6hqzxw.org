I am looking for something strange, something strange for certain, so I hope you all consider it for a moment...

I've come across a whole heck of a lot of "Obviously just a self-insert" HP fan fictions out there (You know the ones), but has there ever been a marginally well-written fic that just throws their hands in the air and proclaims: "This is an Original Character with Meta knowledge!" and just, sort of, has fun with it? The Anime FFs are chock full of it, a couple of which are pretty good even when I hated the original series, so I figured I'd ask the experts here.

I read "The Evil Overlord's Guide" a while back, and that was funny as hell, so I think it might be viable for HP.

I'm not looking for Tolkien level stuff here, just maybe something to pass the time with some laughs, maybe an OC's existential dread.


** Self insert OC with existential dread? Try this sally Anne perks story, ft. a self insert who knows nothing about her fate except that she doesn't make it to OWL testing. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/]]

** I have a dust bunny of something similar, where the MC is an OC with meta knowledge but just wants to chill out and not get horribly involved with the plot of the books. He also tries to fit in by following British customs and keep his Americanisms on the downlow, but his Patronus is a Bald Eagle.

*** Could the circumstances maybe keep conspiring to involve him in the plot? A character that just wants to have fun and has to struggle not to get involved because his luck keeps putting him in the bad places at the bad times. It seems amusing.
