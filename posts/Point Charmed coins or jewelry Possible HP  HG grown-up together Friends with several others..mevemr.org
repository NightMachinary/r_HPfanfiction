Harry has grown up with/close to several others - possibly Hermione, the Weasleys, Susan Bones, Draco Malfoy. Harry has possibly been raised by Sirius and/or Remus. Anyway, when Harry and his friends (3 to 5) arrives at Hogwarts, they got this well-established routine (possibly together with Sirus and Remus), that whenever one of them scores a point on another during a discussion, the other will admit it by saying "Point!". This will activate a charmed coin or jewelry, and the point will be registered in a tally at their home - the winner each month gets a price. A new friend (Draco?) ask about why they yell "point", gets an explaination, and eventually a point-tracker himself. This is just a minor part of the story overall, but it was strange enough to stick. Anybody remember it and the title?
