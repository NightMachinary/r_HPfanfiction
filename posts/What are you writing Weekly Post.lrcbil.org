** I posted the first chapter of my Harry x Hungarian Horntail fic. Thanks to [[/u/Crayshack]] for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/lf8jqd/the_notso_imaginary_girlfriend/gmlj2i2/][the inspiration]]. I didn't exactly follow the prompt in that thread, but there's a dragon, and she's a girl, so... close enough?

** I've set out on a quest to write one of the most recommended fics ever tbh. I just want to see if I can do it -- like a personal goal. I just want to see if I have what it takes.

This story in particular is about Harry inheriting the knowledge of Lord Voldemort. The idea here is that Harry wants to solve his problems by himself, without the Ministry of Magic or Dumbledore or the Order getting in his way. Of course, because power corrupts, Harry may have to battle his own morals as he realizes right from wrong. I also want him to explore what his definition of right and wrong is.

I just now got back into consistently writing, so hopefully I can update once every couple of weeks, but I have to make sure I don't rush this stuff into production, mainly because the story requires me to do a little bit of research and I don't want to put out something riddled with grammar errors. Even now, I go back to my old chapters and edit mistakes I may find.

  What if Harry Potter had died that day in Little Haggleton? One could assume that the horcrux within would have split and been destroyed, pouring the knowledge of Lord Voldemort into Harry Potter. A very powerful and charismatic Harry that seeks to control his own fate by any means necessary.

  1st year students at Hogwarts were always sorted at the Welcoming Feast. The sorting ceremony was skipped in 1991 due to a radical change in how Hogwarts intended to engage with its younger students. Two years later the now 3rd year students are going to be sorted. Will the changes made at Hogwarts bring more unity to the school and Magical Britain? Pairing TBD, nothing too serious

** Right, so I have dozens of notebooks' worth of ideas, ranging from a seven-book sequel series to shorts centering on minor-ish characters I'm obsessed with but let's face it, it's highly unlikely all of these will end up being done. However, my favourite idea which I'm currently four chapters or so into writing and going strong (won't upload any until I've got a good chunk done, will be a WIP for ages) is an epic backstory/chronicle about Antonin Dolohov (by epic, I mean in scale not in quality -- that'll for you to decide) covering school years and early adult life and his journey into becoming one of Voldemort's most feared Death Eaters.

None of the fanfiction clichés, with the possible exception of pureblood politics -- it's kind of necessary. It'll be canon-compliant but certain liberties will be taken. For example, Hogwarts at this time has a permanent duelling club (and not the amateur one Lockhart organised, because Flitwick is one of the instructors here and the DADA teachers are generally less inept), Yule/Easter Balls are an annual thing, and there's a grand duelling competition at the end of each year.

I'm still not 100% on the title but ‘Antonin Dolohov: Legacy Of A Wizard' and ‘Duels, Dames and Dark Arts' are my top two contenders.

** Working on a crossover between HP and Cells at work set in fifth year. Currently on Chapter 6. I keep getting distracted while writing this, so I am also writing a trial scene that will happen in a later chapter.

Also because this fic is about enlarged humanoid cells, I have to think of many things from a biology perspective as well as the cells' perspectives. So I have some random questions.

How does Harry's horcrux work in relation to cell function?

How do phoenix tears heal?

How would magic work to keep Harry alive? If we assume that Harry's magic kept him alive when he was more likely to die? (I think there was a point in time where he was heavily malnourished.)

** So I finished editing A World Without Secrecy this week and put the final part up on fanfiction.net. It's a big AU that sets the stage for a Harry adventure in the same AU, so I'd love to get some feedback on the world and setting. At 20ish thousand words, it's a quick moving threeshot that follows him for Portugal to the heart of africa, and is inspired by Conrad's famous story.

The story follows a British Wizard, who is closer to a known canon character, than his name suggests in this AU. He is in the British Military during the war against Grindlewald and has been sent to check in on a wizarding commander by the name of Prewett who has stopped checking in.

Prewett was on an expedition to the source of the Nile, a magically potent place, to retrace the steps of Grindelwald and discover if it is where Grindelwald invented the particular magic he is using to devastating effect in the war: what we know as the unforgivable Imperius.

** I keep getting random plot ideas (most for Harry/Daphne because for some reason my muse is on that ship very strongly for the moment) and one that's not going away until I write it is a post-war fic inspired by Pixar's Inside Out and more strongly the YouTube series Sander's Sides.

The main idea is Harry is an Auror and Daphne is an Unspeakable. Either they're both called in because a mysterious magical object was found in possession by people arrested by the Aurors so Dept of Mysteries were called in; or Harry gets assigned to bodyguard duty or something because of an accident with the McGuffin. Said McGuffin somehow splits people into fragments of their own personalities, Daphne got hit with it, and they have to find a way to put the different fragments of her back together again.

By fragments, I mean basically split into different versions of themselves based on a different aspects of their personality; ones I've been thinking of for Daphne being Happiness, Logic, Anger, Anxiety/Fear, Desires/Creativity (?), Deception/Selfishness, and Inner Child. Seven of them because seven is a magically powerful number.

I get the weirdest plot ideas sometimes. Possible Title: All The Kings Horses And All the King's Men (or just one or the other). I got a bit of the first chapter done, and a sequence with Astoria that would be happening in another chapter.

** I've been working on a fic for a while, but I've made minimal progress because I'm not sure what the main plot is going to be and I don't really want to write scenes with no end goal in mind.

The things I do know I want to include are:

- The main character will be a metamorphmagus fem!Harry

- Fem!Harry's grandparents will be Dorea and Charlus

- Fem!Harry will be raised by Dorea's sister Cassiopeia. Fem!Harry grows up as Miranda Black, considers Cassiopeia to be her mother and Cynthia Potter (her original name) to be a separate person/her alter ego. Cassiopeia renamed her Miranda Black in order to protect her from death eaters.

- Cassiopeia used to be a blood puriest until she got to know Lily (who in this AU is her niece-in-law) and realized that muggleborns can be quite talented mages (she still is not fond of muggles, however)

- Cassiopeia has also come to the realization that the Black's obsession with blood purity has drastically decreased the number of people in the Black family very few members are not dead, disinherited, or in azkaban. As a result Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Narcissa are all pushing the remaining Black family (particularly the new generation) to be better people.

- Bellatrix in this AU will have never married and will have turned against Voldemort after she learns that Regulus is dead she thinks he was killed by Voldemort for trying to leave the death eaters (like what Sirius thinks happened in canon.) After the war she is sort of pressured/forced to go to therapy for years before eventually teaching dueling at Hogwarts.

As you can see, I have a lot of ideas for this fic, but I don't want to really write more than a few scenes until I have an over arching plot and outline, both of which are giving me trouble.

*** It depends which way you want to go. You already have a solid foundation, you know who your characters are and you know what changes their minds. At this point, you need to work on the exact character of fem! Harry and his guardian. If you want Harry to be similar to the canon, you just need to highlight some things that are decidedly masculine and totally belong to his character as a boy. Then you have to figure out what kind of relationship Cassiopeia and Miranda will have. From what I read you can see that they will be friendly and loving each other. I think it would be a good idea to decide whether Cynthia will be raised in the traditions of the Black family or completely differently.

If its character is completely different from that of Canon! Harry, you have to substitute the events that caused it. Example: Harry, in the books, shrinks at anything reminiscent of murder and deeply hates everything that Voldemort and his followers represent. If you want here that Cynthia wasn't above the murder, and Tom even admired a little for creating such an association, you need to find the point where she started to think so. This could be her guardian's overheard conversation with someone else, a discussion at school, or just a conversation with a cousin / friend.

The plot ... it depends where you want to lead the story. This could be the story of Tomarry where Voldemort sees Miranda's potential and she is inspired by her teacher / political enemy or whatever you want it to be. It might as well be a novel, not about the relationship of the two, but about Cynthia's life, her adventures, suffering, making friends and rising to the heights.

It can also be something completely different, let your imagination absorb you and guide you. Spend some free time thinking about it, and you have a pretty good story as long as it's well written.

** Still working on book 4 of my female Slytherin Harry series. It seems like it's been forever but it's really only been two months. I'm at 120k and 15 chapters in, with 10 more chapters to go.

I'm not sure how I feel about the longer chapters. I was writing 5-6k chapters (for books 1-3) and they seemed reasonable, but this book has been 8-9k chapters which feel a bit unwieldy. It's definitely too late to change them for this book, but I'm not sure how I'm going to do book 5 yet.

Here's the first one in the series if anyone is interested:

I outline an entire story before I write, so I don't have to pause to figure out the plot. I was trained on doing NaNoWriMo for years so writing at least 50k a month is pretty natural to me now. I take breaks between stories though.

I hope you enjoy my series!

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

Second year Fem!Harry gains the memories of Harry Potter just as he walks to his death in Deathly Hallows. Knowing that she's a Horcrux and sure that she is going to die, Mary Jane Potter tries to change the future to protect her friends. Features a Dumbledore with questionable motives. No bashing.

I just published Chapter 7 of my story, 'The Purpose of Wings.' I'm currently editing Chapter 8 and I'm very excited to get it out. It was one of the first chapters I wrote all the way back in November when I first started. The story revolves around a married Harry and Fleur after the war raising their two children. I enjoy writing domestic, mature love and the story also tackles 'creaturist' ideology in later chapters. Now to stick the landing!

It seems to have been inspired by a pandemic induced early mid-life crisis which has involved me listening to a lot of the music I listened to as a teenager while dreaming of the pub.

** Hate the Cursed Child?

Ever wondered why Harry is not behaving like himself in it? or why we barely see him or the original trio at all? Why Cedric Diggory ever becomes a Death Eater? What's the deal with Voldemort having kids? And what's with all the time travel, didn't JK Rowling specifically say she smashed all of the Time-Turners in OP to get rid of this plot device?

*What if we could make the Cursed Child better? What if we could make it fit better within the Harry Potter series?*

I'm working on my own "fix" of the Cursed Child story with my own (upcoming) series of books (Harry Potter and The Lost Child is the first of five):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13823288/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Lost-Child]]

General summary: no Delphi, VERY canon adherent, the plot draws a little from the Cursed Child but improves upon it (at least in my opinion), and NO BLEEDING TIME TRAVEL.

*CHAPTER 7 IS OUT NOW!*

Let me know what you guys think!

I knew my fic was going to be heavily plot driven (it's basically a thriller/action story) when I outlined it last year, and there were a lot of complex parts that were always out there on the horizon like, oh, yeah, psh, if I stay with this I'm sureeeee I'll be able to write this shit when the time comes. Well, the time has come lol. And I think I'm actually pulling it off?\\
IDK I'm really into this feeling of having accomplished something and having a coherent story to look back through!

Just when she feels like her blood doesn't define her in the wizarding world, Hermione is thrust into a new world based on blood status. Working with unlikely allies, can she navigate new societal challenges, better the wizarding world, make her friends all get along, and fix her parents? Dramione, enemies to lovers slow burn.

** Last night I posted the first chapter of my first-ever HP fic, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29600223/chapters/72758550][150 Points]]. It is the diary of a veteran seeker that was unwillingly traded to the Chudley Cannons in 1969. The story will follow him as he adjusts to his new circumstances, and explore Quidditch and the culture around it in Britain.

My inspiration comes from baseball stories like Ball Four, Bull Durham, and Major League, so this is very much intended to be a slightly cracky, comedic take on a sport that makes absolutely no sense.

I'm writing a crack fic that's going to become a series later on down the road. Right now I'm just writing whatever pops into my twisted mind, it's based on the premise that Harry Potter is the Outer God Nyarlathotep from the Cthulhu Mythos. So there's going to be a lot of manipulation from the shadows, selling of faulty weapons to major world powers, fraud, counterfeiting, extortion, bribery, fencing, loan sharking, money laundering, racketeering, smuggling, and overall chaos.

** I'm writing a short story based on the following prompt: Hermione hates Harry Potter with a passion. He's always bothering her, and he's always beating her out for the top spot at school, and ugh, he's just so annoying. She wants to punch him in the face. And kiss him. But mostly punch him in the face.

It's a rivals-to-lovers type of story, where Harry is in Gryffindor (and Head Boy) while Hermione is in Ravenclaw (and Head Girl). The story is told from the perspectives of Harry, Hermione, James, Lily, and Lavender. I'm a little more than halfway finished with it, hoping to post it sometime in March.

  Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. The star Seeker and the swotty muggleborn have been at each other's throats since their first year at Hogwarts. Their feud has cost Gryffindor more points than the Weasley twins and has now resulted in the two of them being stranded on a deserted island.

** I'm converting an outline I've been writing into a rough draft! It's for an HP fanfic set in the 1998-1999 schoolyear, immediately following the Battle of Hogwarts. Hogwarts is divided, with Gryffindor and Slytherin Houses attacking each other in the hallways. The magical repairs done to the school aren't holding, and the school's magic is failing bit by bit. And no one knows what the mysterious clues popping up are pointing to, but if they want to find out they need to figure it out fast. No one knows how much longer magical patch jobs can keep the school open.

/1945, the Global Wizarding War wreaks havoc over Europe. There have been many attempts at stopping Grindelwald, but in vain. The only wizard powerful enough to challenge Grindelwald in a one-on-one duel is Albus Dumbledore, who refuses to do so. The minister of magic hires an Inception team in order to infiltrate Dumbledore's subconscious and plant the idea of confronting Grindelwald into it./

German fanfiction, the team consists of own characters of which some were created by contributing readers. I started plotting in 2016 and follow the HP canon up until the second Fantastic Beasts movie. There was a first version a few years ago but I decided to reboot it and improve on my writing. This project, time-consuming and complicated to plan as it is, is very dear to me. I came up with it while watching Inception. The fic also follows the rules of the Inception movie.

I'm still somewhat at the beginning, but as the story unfolds, the protagonists will find themselves in Dumbledore's mind, trying to understand what happened between Dumbledore and Grindelwald in Godric's Hollow. Once they do, they can manipulate it and perform an Inception on Dumbledore, tricking him into whole-heartedly believing an idea that they planted into his mind. Along the way, the team will encounter their personal demons as well.

Once the fic is finally finished, I'll probably translate it into English as well.

******** "What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows."

"The whole school's talking about it. What really happened?"

"It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more exciting than the wild rumors."

The gist is that it seems like all of Hogwarts knew Harry had gone after Quirrell, but not that he was Voldemort. At the end, the only people who seem to know for sure are Dumbledore, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and then Harry tells Hagrid . . . and everyone just kinda shrugs it off til next year. So, for your story, I imagine Hermione would have totally heard the Quirrell rumors but knowing he was Voldemort and living in a dude's head doesn't seem like that part was common knowledge. And, to clarify, it doesn't say Harry killed him, just that he kind of . . . fled Quirrell's head.

You'd think after this the whole revelation at the end of GOF that Voldemort is back wouldn't be such a damn shock.

** I've started a fix it for Cursed Child where Delphi's plan makes more sense - they still try to save Cedric, but when she goes further back by herself, she rescues the diary after after Ginny abandons it in the bathroom. This would mean that the trio don't actually have any way of destroying the horcruxes, because they never fight the basilisk at the end of CoS.

Mostly this is an excuse for a smutfic detailing young Tom Riddle seducing kicked-out-of-the-Tournement!Cedric to the dark side, but I want the actual plot to work, too.

Looking for inspiration: I've done some searching on ao3, but I can't work out if there's a tag for AU's (even canon AUs) where Cedric is evil. (I had a similar problem when I read that old "Hagrid is a secret Death Eater" theory - either there's no fic for it, or I just can't find it!)
