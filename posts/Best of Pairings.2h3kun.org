Post stories that are the best of the best in their respective pairings, story doesn't have to be romance oriented as long as its present.

Fairly new to fanfiction but here's my list:

*Harry/Tonks:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Summer-Of-Change][Harry Potter And The Summer Of Change]]

*Harry/Daphne:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][The Pureblood Princess]]

*Harry/OOC or AU Bellatrix:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]

*Harry/Bellatrix:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2896398/1/Only-Enemies][Only Enemies]], However if [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6927447/1/Ouroboros][Ouroboros]] would update more it could easily take the cake.

*Harry/Alicia Spinnet:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1300829/1/Aren-t-Little-Girls-Made-of-Sugar-and-Spice][Aren't Little Girls Made of Sugar and Spice?]]

*Harry/OC:*

First 7 chapters of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2163835/1/The-Refiners-Fire][The Refiner's Fire]]

*Harry/Ginny:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2163835/1/The-Refiners-Fire][The Refiner's Fire]]

*Harry/Narcissa M:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2127558/1/Narcotic-Effects][Narcotic Effects]]

*Harry/Female Harry:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/1/Equal-and-Opposite][Equal and Opposite]]

*Harry/Fleur:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/23/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]]


** For Harry/Luna, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7352166/1/Protection-From-Nargles][Protection from Nargles]]

For Harry/Tonks, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6740130/1/The-Rebel-and-The-Chosen][The Rebel and the Chosen]]

*Draco/Neville:* The [[http://ajhall.shoesforindustry.net/about/lopiverse/][Lust Over Pendle]] series.

*Draco/Hermione:* I'm a big Dramione fan, so it's hard to pick just one, but maybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3144908/1/We-Learned-the-Sea][We Learned the Sea]]

*Hermione/Luna:* [[http://www.dreiser.org/miscfic/crazy.htm][Crazy Little Things]]

*Hermione/Ginny:* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/Here-And-There][Here and There]]

*Harry/Ginny:* I don't read a lot of canon pairings. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3728284/1/In-the-Words-of-Ginevra-Molly-Potter][In the Words of Ginevra Molly Potter]] is the only one that comes to mind.

I feel like I've read a lot of Harry/Hermione but can't think of a single one that sticks out as especially great. There's a lot of clich√©d dreck in that ship. I'm curious to see if there are any good recommendations for Harry/Hermione or Harry/Ginny.

**** I started it, even went half-way though since it's a short story, but found it so unbelievable and bad that I gave up.

I wouldn't mind trying another Harry/fem!Harry though. It's kind of weird at first, I'll admit, but I rationalize it by thinking it's more like masturbation than incest hahaha

*** Same. I fucking adore Harry/Tonks, but Summer Of Change is just so poorly written. It's popular because it was the first big H/T story, and because it was written in 2005, when the standards for HPFF were /far/ lower than they are now.

Harry/Susan

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6044969/1/Journey-Through-the-Dark][Journey Through the Dark]]

Harry/Tracey

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]]

I have not (re)read a worthwhile Harry/Tonks or Harry/Hermione fanfic in a very long time so I wouldn't feel right recommending one.

Never read a Harry/Gabrielle (outside of a harem), Harry/Luna, or Harry/Pansy that I liked enough to add to my favourites.

There's very few Harry/Bellatrix fanfics that I enjoyed outside of the two you mentioned and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8378840/1/Passageways][Passageways]]. This is mainly because I do not enjoy reading pairings with a large age gap and some of the first fanfics that I read had Bellatrix as an adoptive parent/parental figure.

****** I haven't read it, so I can't judge whether it's good or not. But i wanted to take this opportunity to point out that fanfiction or even most fiction doesn't necessarily have to be objectively good to enjoy it. If you enjoy it, good for you. I mean, take a look at twilight or the movie Cabin Fever. Both are objectively not good, but that doesn't mean you can't like it. I may hate twilight but i love Cabin Fever, despite (because of?) how awful it is.

So...just my two cents.
