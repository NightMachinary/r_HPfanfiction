***** By the way, [[/u/DatKidNamedCara]], don't let the H/Muggle beginning fool/dissuade you from reading it. It's incredibly well written, and once you'll read it you'll see how well it flows into a H/G story :)

*** I will never not upvote The Refiner's Fire. An absolute classic. Some might say it hasn't aged well, but it's an incredible fic (and its sequel). H/G with Hr/R. Yes, really.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

** Harry's animagus form was a snake in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345). He used his form extensively, and finally con-ed Voldemort into his deadly trap.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.
