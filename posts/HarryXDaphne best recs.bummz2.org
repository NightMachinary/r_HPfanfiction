#+begin_quote
  Mysterious events that occurred in Privet Drive change the turn of events completely. Professor McGonagall's ominous statement proves to be true as the Dursley's never truly 'understand' Harry Potter. A completely new take of a Harry Potter fanfiction featuring Wizarding Finances, Politics, Betrayals, and Justice. Harry/Daphne. Sporadic Updates.

** Here are two I love! One is a hilarious one shot, and one is unfortunately on hiatus but the 7 chapters that exist I love a lot.

​

The one shot:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12673854/1/Butterbeer-Bollocks-and-a-Ball][Butterbeer, Bollocks and a Ball]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1585368/James018][James018]]

"She Transfigured Seamus' testicles into a pair of tweezers!" Through a series of unfortunate events and unwise decisions, Harry Potter ends up going to the Yule Ball with Daphne Greengrass. Perhaps things won't turn out so bad after all: when you've hit rock bottom, the only way to go is up, right? ...Right? Not your usual Daphne fic. Warnings for language and underage drinking.

​

The other, same author:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6367688/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]]

The effect a twist of fate can have... Instead of Malfoy, Harry meets someone else at Madam Malkin's, someone who causes him to question the wizarding world more. What happens when Gryffindor boldness meets Slytherin shrewdness? A tale for the ages, of course. No bashing. Discontinued, pending rewrite.
