** That would be funny. Not only is Quirrell's cover blown, but the troll walks headfirst into the best defended room in the whole place since all the teachers are congregated there. Or at least the ones that are useful in that sort of situation, as in, we wouldn't know if Trelawney was there, but I doubt it would matter when you have the heavy hitters like Dumbledore and the HoHs.

I'm liking the imagery of tiny Professor Flitwick levitating the troll. The troll depends on size and strength to defeat its victims so removing gravity renders it impotent. Meanwhile, the other professors incompacitate Quirrellmort who is at a disadvantage from pretending to faint and being outnumbered while upper year students shield themselves and younger years from stray spells from Quirrellmort defending himself.

*** "TROLL IN THE DUNGEON" Professor Quirrell shouted exuberantly in fear. "thought you ought to know" he stuttered out before his eyes roll into the back of his head and he collapses on the florr in the middle of the great hall. after several heartbeats pandamonium broke out the students start crying out in fear, one particular slytherin student and his babbling baboons look as if they are about to wet themselves. its so loud its a wonder anyone can hear themselves think, suddenly from the head table a rather thunderous 'BOOM' emits from Professor Dumbledore's wand.

"SILENCE" he screamed calmly to the students. he was about to give instructions to the Prefect but before he had the chance to a 2nd loud bang rhe doors to the great hall suddenly slam open to reveal the hideous mug of said troll. dumbledore without missing a beat states" it would appear as if the troll is no longer in the dungeon" another moment later the short statured Proffesor Flitwick was standing on the table, and the troll was in the air slowly spinning attempting to grab anything to find purchase, helpless in the effort having dropped its club."however did a troll get into the castle" pondered dumbledore alloud " I wonder if by chance you would know Qurinus, after all you were the only staff member not here at the feast, and i seem to remember you have a peculiar partiality to the predomination of these particular creatures"

Professor Quirrell and his parasitic passengers knew right then the jig was up. in a snake like voice emanating from the back of Quirrell's head "forsaking the part of the fool, old man" Quirrell stood up "since as you put it the jig is up, i suppose i just have to kill you, and take some of your precious students with you" he spat in a voice filled with venom. all of a sudden sickly colored curses were flying across thw great hall, dumbledore casualy put up shields and the older students after a moment did as well. Quirrellmort caught at a major disadvantage, not expecting mere school children to be able to defend themselves this well, began to flee, before suddenly he was surrounder in a cage, at somepoint the trolls club had shattered, giving dumbledore and mcgonagall ample material to work with. voldemort seeing no alternative combusted, leaving Quirrell's body as dust while he escaped.

Mcgonagall after this event, looked almost ready to cry at the amount of paperwork she would have to fill out

flitwick, hagrid, and professor grubby-plank escorted the clubless, very dizzy troll to the forest.

the students were simply confused

and trelawny retreated to her tower to drink herself into a stupor.

and harry is much closer to his year mates, barring Hermione. because sharing an experience like that is sure to create bonds.

Who knows? Maybe the prefects and other older-students end up taking it down before any damage is done?

If we assume that there are about ten to maybe twelve people per year, that would be quite a lot of wands aimed at the troll (the fourth-years and up would be roughly 12 x 4 = 48 students per house).

**** True, I know its mentioned that they are naturally resistant to magic though, but how resistant exactly is never specified

But I also imagine the shock factor kicking in for a lot of the kids along with sheer panic making it much more likely only a handful are even prepared to fire off spells (if they are effective) before the Troll does any damage to any of vast amounts of very squishy targets it has available to it

"This is the most ridiculous conspiracy theory I have ever heard, and I have an uncle who believes that the queen is secretly a Communist," pronounced Hermione. Neville, who was standing next to her, nodded along.

"Well, nobody asked you," said Ron. He and Harry were facing the other two Gryffindors, who were blocking their way out of the Common Room.

Hermione ignored him, and turned to Harry. "Harry, I know Professor Snape is absolutely horrid to you, but that doesn't mean that he is stealing the Philosopher's Stone for You-Know-Who! Please reconsider!"

"Sorry, Hermione. I can't risk him getting the Philosopher's Stone. Please don't try to stop us." He stepped forward.

"And mind your own business, for once!" Ron added, also stepping forward.

"Very well." There was a gleam in Hermione's eye, that made Ron shudder. "Let's try basic logic. If you can't get past us, you do not stand a chance against Professor Snape." She drew her wand, and Neville drew his.

* * *

In retrospect, he was the lucky one, Ron thought to himself, as he stared at the ceiling, due to lack of other options. Hermione's Full-Body Bind had cancelled out the other jinxes that she had cast on him, and wasn't in itself particularly uncomfortable. Harry, on the other hand, had taken some abomination of a spell from Neville. Said wizard was now kneeling next to Harry, tearfully apologising, even as the prefects were trying to get a hold of Madame Pomfrey through the floo.

Apparently, after the better part of a year under Hermione's tutelage, he had had the confidence to cast a spell in anger (or at least the fear of disappointing Hermione to), but still lacked the ability to reliably control the results. "She really is a nightmare," Ron wanted to whisper to himself, but couldn't.

McGonagall's eventual arrival brought with it a firm talking-to to everyone involved, and a loss of 200 points for Hermione and Neville, so it wasn't a total loss.

* * *

*Choose your option:*

1. The next morning, despite everything, Dumbledore was looking very... content. Slytherin won the House Cup for the eighth year in a row. Snape left Hogwarts, and Dumbledore announced a search for a new Potions Master and a new Head of Slytherin. The rest of their Hogwarts career was pretty uneventful. They even won the House Cup a few times.

   A few decades later, on his deathbed, Dumbledore invited Harry Potter and told him about the prophecy about which he no longer had to worry, because Voldemort was trapped beyond the reach of his followers, and that once Harry too passed away in due time, Voldemort would be gone for good.

2. The next morning, Dumbledore was absent at the high table. He returned the day after, bearing dire news: Voldemort was back, and he had the Philosopher's Stone.
