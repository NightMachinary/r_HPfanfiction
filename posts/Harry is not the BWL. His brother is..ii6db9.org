I'm honestly sick and tired of WBWL fanfics. It just puts a bad taste in how incompetent Dumbledore is. I mean, dude's better than Voldemort, and he couldn't recognize a cursed scar?

And the poor kid that's marked as the BWL, when his brothers the actual one... Man, that's some major damage to anyone growing up.

** Honestly, the WBWL/Harry-has-a-twin genre in general is rife with fridge-logic and badly done tropes.

Just about the only take on the genre I like is a wholesale subversion of the entire plot - as in, it doesn't get started in the first place. linkao3(1115311)

**** ... when it comes to incompetent Dumbledore, this rec takes the cake.

I absolutely LOVE competent, genius Dumbledore, and those are rarely ever shown in fanfics. What I can't stand is a fool Dumbledore that can't seem to understand basic empathy if it stuck it up his ass.

***** It's basically a parody of incompetent!Dumbledore in this kind of fic, so it was intended to be that over the top.

Yeah, I too vastly prefer it when Dumbledore is compassionate and capable. Sadly, it's rare enough in WBWL/Potter-Twins stories that I genuinely can't think of any off the top of my head.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** A lot of good "WBWL" fanfics which manage to avoid the typical tropes, to an extent, don't have Harry as the BWL. Prince of Slytherin, Sarcasm and Slytherin, HP and the Boy Who Lived, Subversion, To Be a Slytherin all are narrated from the perspective of the non-BWL.

** linkffn(5353809) is probably one of the most popular HP Fanfictions in terms of being well-written and famously abandoned.

linkffn(5201703) is also a "Harry isn't the BWL" fanfic but this time it's Neville instead and honestly it's my favorite fic ever created. Incredibly well-written along with a gripping story and probably the best Dumbledore written in fanfiction.

** I still want to read a story where his brother genuinly is the BWL and Harry is a few years older. I had this nagging idea where Harry truly and genuinly loves his family and they love him which means as he gets older he gets more and more desperate to protect them. Especially his brother.

Ambitious. Clever. He's in Slytherin and by all appearance falls in the bad crowd. Goes to join Voldemort. Rises in the ranks and does some bad stuff (only maybe not and with the help of Snape /& Dumbledore hides his victims until the end of the war).

Another twist? I want Harry to be named the Boy-Who-Lived, a decision made to protect his brother. His parents and Dumbledore (and Voldemort, maybe?) are the only ones who know. And his brother is motivated by the desperation to bring his beloved older brother back, facing down Voldemort without knowing the truth.

I think it'd be an interesting twist to the trope.

I should really get around to writing it some day. Hm.
