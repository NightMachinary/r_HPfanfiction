** You may want to ask [[/r/hpslashfic]] instead. This sub is really not a fan of slash or any romance fics involving current or former death eaters.

*** I may, but I asked for slash or not, so I thought I'd ask here first. Thanks tho!

**** I really don't like this ship but there is always time travel to make the relationship more equal age wise. I also wouldn't say that the age difference is the main reason that this subreddit dislikes Snape pairings. There have been requests for Bellatrix/Harry or even fem-Voldemort/Harry (or Harry/Lily...) with a lot less negative response despite being similar in nature.

** Try [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1415023][Neymovirne]] good characterization and the oneshots are fun.

** It would never happen the ship requires them to be out of character.

I am being downvoted but the OP asked for a ship that inherently requires the two participating in the ship to be out of character, I'd say the same thing for someone asking Harry/Luna when the ships require Harry's entire preference for women to change and i like Harry/luna

**** The two ways where you could make it work would require either Snape to change early on and thus become unrecognisable compared to his canon self (especially since Snape's motivation to abandon the dark does not work if he's gay) or use the "pureblood/Slytherin" Harry, which is equally OOC.

***** There are plenty of other ways, the author would just have to do some more work to get there. With how you describe it, they would be in love right from the beginning of the story. But it could be a slow burn with events happening that make them understand each other better. There's also something like being bisexual, so Snape could still love Lily. Or it could have been platonic love, which people often underestimate. Harry would have died for Ron and Hermione and it wasn't romantic love he felt for them.

*** At least canon Harry does have a preference for women. The OP is asking for a 'realistic' pairing between two characters with a twenty-year age gap, both of whom are canonically heterosexual, who dislike each other intensely and have no chemistry whatsoever.

*** I asked for a ship that yes would be very out of character, but specifically asked for them to be not very OOC personality wise. that's what i meant.

** I would suggest Lomonaaeren's short snarry fics on AO3--it's all short oneshots. Most of the characterizations are close to canon, that is, with Snape having a difficult personality, not very communicative, still with petty anger over incidents that happened years before and lingering grief for a friendship or relationship with Lily that never really existed (too much idealization of what she symbolized, not who she was), and some really interesting choices for Harry's career path.
