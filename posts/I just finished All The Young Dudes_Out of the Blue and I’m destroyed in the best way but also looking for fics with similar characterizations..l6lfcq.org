I am utterly speechless. I think I would feel a lot more devastated if Out of the Blue wasn't there that is such a beautiful ending to the story...I keep randomly bursting into tears.

But I'm looking for stories with similar characterizations...I like how we get to see a side of Remus that is rougher and more streetwise and angry and moody than the calmer more reserved professor we meet in POA.

Also really enjoyed the characterizations of Sirius and James though I'm not sure if it's common in wolf star fics for them to be portrayed differently but I have heard that this characterization of Remus is pretty different so that's why I'm asking

Also nothing too sad please like if it's amazing maybe but I can't take reading about Sirius death right now or the ending of the story being Sirius dying. Something where they get to raise Harry starting after POA or getting to see them in a parent role at all would be cool. I don't mind some PTSD/angst/war stuff just no death.


** Glad you enjoyed it! I just finished it myself a few weeks ago. I would love a sequel but also don't want to read chapters upon chapters about Remus being upset for Sirius dying.

James is characterized really well in this...think this won an award for best portrayal of James.

*** Oh yes James was sooo good in this fic like just so well done and I just loved all the scenes with him it hurt me so much that that James never got to be in Harry's life.

Yeah I would have liked to see the time him and Sirius spent together in the house and interacting with Harry but I guess we have the canon interactions with Harry and can assume how their year there went. And I'm glad that Out of the Blue showed him being at least happy in that wedding picture with Tonks even if he looked tired and skinny and grant knew he had taken Sirius death really really hard. I'm so curious as to how the author would have portrayed Tonks and Remus together and the birth of Teddy not gonna lie.

** Oh wow that's long. Thanks, I'm excited to read it.

It's not very long, nor is it finished (though it is actively updating), but I read this one earlier this week and enjoyed it. Remus is kind of numb in the years after James and Lily's death, and he ends up taking Harry as a young child (~3/4). linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27300139]]).

** A few ðŸ˜Š mostly recommended from the ATYD discord.

linkao3(Dress Up in you by MsKingBean89) - Muggle Wolfstar. Same author and it's just bloody adorable ðŸ˜….

linkao3(Stealing Harry by copperbadge) - A raising Harry story with decently similar ATYD vibes ðŸ˜Š. Adorable but with enough mystery and tension to be interesting.

linkao3(Calibration by TheDivineComedian) - Everything by TheDivineComedian is brilliant. They really capture Remus well and expand on the world of HP. You can slot their work around ATYD and it fits perfectly.

linkao3(Remain in Light by veeagainst) - A Sirius doesnt die fic. Great Wolfstar. Really heartwarming, again with enough drama to be interesting!

  Non-magical modern AU - Marauders/WolfstarSirius attends a charity rock gig organised by his best friend's girlfriend, and the tall, quiet bassist catches his eye...Basically just a thing I wrote after listening to Belle & Sebastian's 'Dress up in you' a million times.Quite sexy.

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

  What if Sirius Black didn't die? It's been done many times. Here's my take on it.
