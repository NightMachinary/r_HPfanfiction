Gilderoy Lockhart might have been going around obliviating people, but that's because Lockhart is a cover identity for a ministry unspeakable. His job? He performs ministry cover-ups specializing in magical creature containment. He goes around dealing with problems and using his public face to prevent anyone from figuring out that the ministry was involved. During research towards a cure for werewolves, the DoM causes an outbreak in Wagga Wagga. Gilderoy Lockhart makes the problem disappear. Experiments with the Veil release a banshee? Gilderoy Lockhart is there. DoM predicts an attack at Hogwarts, Gilderoy Lockhart gets hired.


** Considering he was a Ravenclaw I would gladly accept this over canon

*** Now I want a Harry the Hufflepuff style story where Gilderoy Lockhart is a student at Hogwarts who was sorted into Ravenclaw because of his single-minded focus on acquiring knowledge. Specifically the knowledge of whichever spell will get him out of the most work.

** Gilderoy Lockart is the cover identity assumed by any Unspeakable sent on the field. Some of Lockart stories seem to happen at the same because they really did, with 2 different agents. After the "CoS incident", Gilderoy Lockart vanished from his room in St Mungos, and resurfaced one week later driving a Nundu off a village in Congo, all of his injuries having magically disappeared.

During this time, in the bowels of the DoM, one man is tirelessly working, rewriting every field report into publishable books. Currently, the sales of "Gilderoy Lockart adventures" make up for more than half the DoM fundings.
