  Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters.Fem!Draco

  The classic tale. First she hated him; she hated him with every fiber in her body. Until she became intrigued with him, then fascinated with him, and ended up falling in love with him. Then again, she suppose she always loved him, even when she hated him. *Sequel to Hunt for Bridal Perfection. Features FemDraco*

  The walls of Hogwarts hold many secrets, some of them benign and some rooted in a deep, dark past. When Harry stumbles upon the latter, his life and soul are shattered, leading him down a path of power, destruction, and sex. A Dark!Harry, Possessed!Harry, Harry/Harem story. Rated M.

** I've linked this in a couple of other threads, but try The Wizard That Never Was ([[http://s3.zetaboards.com/FanFictionFederation/topic/9004704/1/]]).

It redirects to another address, and a lot of the punctuation has been lost since the copy I saved, but it's an interesting premise.
