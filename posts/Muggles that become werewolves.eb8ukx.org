What's everyone's opinions on what happens to muggles that become werewolves? Do you think the ministry has different regulations for them vs wizards/witches who are turned? It's not like being a werewolf is something you can obliviate away. But their muggle family/friends can be. Does the ministry give them a crash course to the magical world? Are they even allowed to go back to the muggle world?

Does becoming a magical creature give a person the ability to use a wand or see through muggle wards? Can a muggle even become a werewolf or do only people with magic survive the curse?

Opinions?


** My thoughts are only magicals can become werewolves as it requires magic to fuel the change.

Also I have always figured werewolves were created by some dark lord type as wizard killers. He infects his troops with the curse and they make their way into enemy territory. Full moon and wizard hunting unreasoning beasts that spread the curse among any survivors.

Survivors that will have no clue they are a danger to everyone around them until it is far to late.

*** I have to agree. It would probably require magic to even transform in the first place.

Suppose that a muggle does survive a werewolf bite. I would think that, because they have little to no magic themselves, nothing would happen during a full moon.

** u/zenguy3:

  ...when a transformed werewolf bites a human, the bitten will become a werewolf themselves.[3] Most Muggles, however, will die from the extent of their injuries in the instance of a werewolf attack as noted by Professor Marlowe Forfang, though some do survive to become werewolves themselves.

Coming from the wiki, it's rare but it happens. I agree with [[/u/drsmilegood][u/drsmilegood]] that it should only happen to wizards because the transformation is obviously magical and muggles have to magic to involuntarily perform it.

*** Omg now that is a story prompt if I ever thought of one! Lycanthropy is a magic curse, so it GIVES muggles magic when they are cursed with it!

Find cure to Lycanthropy, infect muggle safely. Feed wolfsbane until they transform and are fully magical. Cure Lycanthropy and BOOM!

Muggles into Magicals!

Dear lord would that change the game. Imagine month long spa clinics to get turned into a Witch or Wizard. Who wouldn't pay obscene amount of money for that?

Edit: Short Story bug just bit me, must create this.

**** It could be done... however...

if Muggles are inherently more vulnerable to being killed and developing full lycanthropy is rare, even if it comes with magic they might not be willing to take the odds. It's possibly like the stand virus in Jojo- some people survive and develop cool magic powers, the vast majority die.

If you want to take your short story in a darker direction you could have a pureblood sponsored genocide program where darkwizards and werewolves rounded up muggles, deliberately infected them and the "worthy" ones became magical. Like some sick conversion process for the whole world.

The bug bit me too. Wanna have a contest to see what kind of one shots we make by the end of the week?

** After the first transformation said muggle would be able to do magic (tho wouldn't be very good at it, nor would they know they gained such power) because it is a magic disease.
