  Harry Potter's world is flipped upside down when he is unexpectedly visited by a naked fairy on his fourteenth birthday. Finding out that he is a rare species of incubus known as a Choiceling is the least of Harry's problems when he discovers just how drastically his life is about to change. How will our young hero deal with an entire year at Hogwarts when he has to have sex at least once a day just to survive?! Join Harry on an epic tale of love, lust, and innocence, as he battles against much more than just dark wizards and learns just how strong bonds can be.
