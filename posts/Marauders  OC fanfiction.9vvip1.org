So for a time i was planning to write a fan fiction of this era. It will tell the story of an OC at the time of the marauders and would be a friend of lily evans.

He will witness the story of james and lily and the other marauders along with snape but from an external point of view, with his own opinions and vision of the story, although he will also have moments with the characters already mentioned. The biggest problem is to invent situations that do not contradict the established lore but even reading all the possible lore of that time would help a lot if they indicated some things or some pages that will allow me to write without contradict that lore. I'm trying to make it as lore friendly as possible. Also if there is already a story of that type I would like to tell me so I can read it and see if it is something similar to what I want to write.

Obviously time will pass faster than the original series because many things are already known and it would be unnecessary to repeat them but other things also will be invented but trying to respect the lore. The plot could also advance from the Hogwarts years to see an inside look at the first wizarding war and what was like to be in that era... so that's all I have in mind for now. If you have any advice or just if you think it would be interesting to read or not something like that, I would also appreciate it if you would tell me.

Pd: sorry about the awful english, is not my original languaje but i like to translate to english with help if i can write it.
