I would like to read something where Voldemort isn't the only threat. I want to read a fic where Hogwarts is seiged by a dracolich, where Godric Griffindor returns from his eternal duel reanimated and tries to take back hogwarts for his own dastardly plans, or where an apron invasion happens, with Fred and George as the last line of defense. Can you recommend me any fics with an interesting non-voldemort bbeg or sideplot?

Ok with anything barring HP/SS, and HP/LV.


** There's one I'm reading right now called, 'The odds were never in my favor' . The fic is based around a Neville is the BWL while James Potter was supposedly the Longbottom's secret keeper and James got arrested while Lily was killed and their daughter, Alexandra, was sent to the Duesleys by Dumbledore. She is shunned when she comes to Hogwarts cause of her 'death eeater' father. There is plenty of bashing in it but Voldemort is anything but a massive threat and Alexandra is very dark-neutral. I've been enjoying it a lot.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A_Second_Chance_at_Life][A Second Chance at Life]] by Miranda Flairgold. When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic. Harry got 99 problems and Voldemorts is only 1. Excellent fic. Complete but has an unfinished sequel. FFNet.

** Voldemort isn't the /only/ supervillain in linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) series; he recruits a team of other dark sorcerers at his power level, each with their own specialties.
