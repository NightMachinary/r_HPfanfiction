one of the first fics i read was a genderbender, where harry had always been a girl, and her gender was disguised from birth. i know that there was an oc defense teacher, and it might be drarry. i thought it was called harmony lives, and fem harrys name is definitely harmony, but i cant find it, if anyone know what happened to it, or what its called please let me know.
