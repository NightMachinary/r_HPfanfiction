The main thing I remember is that Harry summons au Hermione and one is dumb/brain damaged. Fairly sure it's NC-17.


** I read this one recently. Voldemort attempts to summon his alternate-universe self and accidentally switches Harry with his evil mirror-universe self.

It then gets sillier.

It's linkffn(4045539) Crack'd Mirror by Cloneserpents.

*** Many thanks. I read way too much fanfiction, and when I can't find anything new, I'll go back to the old good ones.

**** On the other hand, it's the one with FLYING DEATH in it. So not all to the bad.

** I'm not usually a fan of crack, but this sounds extremely funny to me. Also, have no idea what's the name of it. Sorry.

She's just 'canon' Hermione from HBP/DH. I think the "brain damage" is just dark!Harry's explanation for why she's so stupid. The "real" Hermione from their world wouldn't do something like that.
