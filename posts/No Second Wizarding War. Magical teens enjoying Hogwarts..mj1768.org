Basically, hoping for the vibe of a Marauders Era fic, but Hogwarts Era. No Voldemort (either he was defeated in the first war or never came back after Lily/James' deaths). Just these characters being teens at a magical school without the constant threat of death, ya know? Preferably some canon ships included!

Not 100% what you asked for but /Harry Potter Is A Dragon, And That's Okay/ is mostly about magical teens just enjoying Hogwarts. Yes Voldermot exists, but he's no real threat, just an annoyance.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
