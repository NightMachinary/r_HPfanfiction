Poisons are ingested. If you eat or drink something, it's a poison. If it is injected via fangs, or I suppose the Sword of Gryffindor, it's venom. Also, poisonous venom is not a thing. /rant

Sorry, this is just something I keep seeing and my mind twitches a little every time.


** A random question: how do we know that the basilisk isn't both venomous and poisonous?

But yes, it's a somewhat basic thing for people to not know.

*** To be quite honest: I didn't know.

However, both venom and poison translate to "Gift" in German ("giftig" for venomous/poisonous), so I wasn't even aware that there could be a difference and thus don't feel bad.

If we're on it: What exactly does "toxic" mean than?

**** Toxic means that something is harmful if it enters the body. This can be ingested, breathed, touch ect. All poisons are toxins, but not all toxins are poisons. Venom is also a toxin, but one that has a biological origin and usually is injected by a creature.

**** Hmm ... basically, you could say that toxicity is about a substance's ability to mess you up if it, or a part of it, gets inside of you via any possible method of entrance (though the word “toxin” itself means poison, and “venom” is a toxin, just one of animal origin). A poisonous snake's meat is toxic. A venomous snake's poison is toxic. Anything that gives off noxious fumes is toxic. Anything chemically reactive with the result hurting you is toxic. Anything extremely acidic or alkaline is toxic unless it just cannot interact with your body negatively (so stomach acid contained in the stomach is not toxic, but make a hole and it can start to be). Some radioactive stuff is toxic, like uranium, but some of the more radioactive substances like radium are not because they can only harm via radiation and while the radiation is toxic something that /only/ produces radiation is not. Stuff like lead is toxic because of the body's inability to get rid of it and the negative effects of too much of it being present. Then stuff like asbestos is toxic because you can inhale it and that's not exactly healthy.

But then, you have stuff like water being toxic when there is enough of it (though drowning is not death by water toxicity), and stuff like parasites generally aren't toxic because it's something they produce being toxic and they themselves are pathogenic instead. [[/u/triforceelf][u/triforceelf]] explained it without the word abuse if you want a shorter explanation.

And yes, giftig can translate to “toxic” too. I am unsure if that is because of the “poison = toxin” thing or if there is more to it, however.

**** Another key difference between venom and poison. Most animal poisons will kill u if ingested or reaaaally fuck you up (think fugu fish) but you can drink snake venom and basically be fine (make urself sick) but you can build up an immunity to it over time. Poisons work by being ingested and absorbed into your blood stream through your stomach while venoms need to be injected directly into your blood stream

Well, it's a rare thing. "Most" venoms are destroyed if you eat them

** I believe that when you're referring to animals, poisonous refers to when you eat the animal (e.g., fugu) and venomous refers to some kind of defense mechanism by a living animal - whether the venom is delivered orally, through skin contact, or whatever.

Which is actually consistent with your point. Just saying. I think confusion between poison/venom is probably rampant, though.

** Sometimes little things like this annoy me too. I have to say though, as a Linguistics student, that if the meaning is clear there really isn't any cause for complaint. But I can't really say that without being a hypocrite because I hate it too when we lose these kinds of distinctions.

My guess is that venom and venomous will either retain the distinct meaning they have now or narrow further to herpetological use only. Even now, in reference to spiders I'm much more likely to hear poison/poisonous than when referring to snakes.

Poison on the other hand I confidently predict will continue to be used more broadly and eventually it won't even be incorrect. My Linguistics professors would all be saying that this is why language is exciting and isn't it wonderful how it's constantly evolving.

I suspect I may not major in Linguistics because I just get really grumpy and sad about this kind of thing. Like when I just said that it won't even be incorrect. My mind is screaming at me two things, 1) it will always be wrong! And 2) A double negative? Really?

** Eh. From what I've seen a poison can still be injected.

Poison\\
[poi-zuh n]\\
noun\\
1. a substance with an inherent property that tends to destroy life or impair health.

*** The issue is with confusing adjectives /venomous/ and /poisonous/, not nouns /venom/ and /poison/. Whether or not the poison would be harmless when injected is irrelevant in this case --- what matters is how and for what purposes is the harmful substance generated by the creature and used by it. [[https://io9.gizmodo.com/meet-the-deadliest-venomous-animals-in-the-world-1382395982][This article]] explains the categorisation of animals rather nicely.

In case of our basilisk, if the characters were concerned about it harming them through its bites, they'd be researching whether or not it's a venomous snake. And if they wondered whether touching its skin during the battle or eating it afterwards should be ok, they'd be looking up whether or not basilisks are poisonous creatures.

And if the basilisk turned out to be venomous but not poisonous, it would still be possible to use the secreted venom from its glands as a poison ingredient for creating poisoned melee weapons, poisoned drinks,^{1} and so on.

^{1} if the resulting liquid didn't burn through the container --- that snake's venom corrodes horcruxes, after all

** I think I've seen a bunch of fanfics where they go back to the chamber and find the basilisk corpse perfectly intact, with no sign of decomposition or scavanging. That suggests they are poisonous.
