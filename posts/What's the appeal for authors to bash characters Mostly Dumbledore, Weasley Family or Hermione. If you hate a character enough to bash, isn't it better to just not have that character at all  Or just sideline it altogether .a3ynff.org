I've read dozens and dozens of fics with bashing and it always grinds my gear when someone does that with no purpose except to hate on the character. Bashing for me doesn't do anything, it just shows the immaturity of either the character doing the bashing(which is a valid point if this is what the author wants but rarely it does.) or immaturity of said author. There's almost nothing you can say that's worse for someone that you hate than simple apathy. It cuts way deeper than straight anger and confrontation.

IDK, I just don't get why there are SO many people that enjoy reading and writing bash fics with the bashing as a big focus of it.


** I think people often project their own feelings and issues onto characters - I think this is a reasonable thing to do. I definitely use writing as therapy and a way to explore my own feelings toward my mother and grief.

But when you see people hating Molly for being overbearing or Dumbledore for being manipulative, or Ron for being jealous, I think it often comes down to personal experience and how that shapes their world view. I often see people disliking the Weasleys for being one big happy family - as someone who came from a big happy family (with a very Molly like mother), this baffles me, but it's their lived experience and their preference so for them it makes sense.

Personally, I just avoid writing about characters I can't relate to. But I can certainly see why it would be cathartic.

The other side of the coin is that it also provides fast, easy drama.

** Sometimes an author will bash certain characters when they want to pair their canon partner with someone else but need it to come off sympathetic. For example, if you are doing a post-battle fic that has Harry and Hermione falling in love, but also kept it consistent with canon where they were dating Ginny and Ron, respectively, it's tough to objectively make them look good. If Harry and Hermione got together, it would destroy their relationships (friendship and romantic) with Ginny and Ron. And Harry and Hermione would look like the bad guys. So you solve this by making Ginny and Ron awful people. This doubly works because you can then have Harry and Hermione look good not just to the reader but to the other characters, because Ron and Ginny are clearly awful people so why would any of their friends side with them?

Other times, you bash characters in an effort to create conflict while still avoiding the conflict between your main characters. For example, I've read Harry/Ginny fics where they are this perfect couple who don't really fight or struggle, but the author makes Molly into this awful caricature trying to keep them apart. The conflict is created as H/G vs Molly (and often Dumbledore). As such, you protect the ship while still having conflict in the story.

Mostly, bashing occurs when authors dislike a character because of their flaws in canon, but ignores all the good parts about them.

** All fanfic is reactive. It's deconstructions all the way down. So there are a few ways bashing comes about:

1. Poor implementation of, "what if $beloved_character was not so great after all?"

2. Flanderization resulting from fanfic writers having read a lot of fanfic and building on top of that.

3. Competition between shipping communities. DLP's old Ginny kill-off contest was a tongue-in-cheek extreme version of this.

That's so true. It doesn't matter in a humorous, crack-style short, but in a long epic drama, having the favored character do the bashing often undercuts the favored character's canon personality.

If you write Harry and Hermione as hating Ron (really disdaining him on a permanent basis rather than being angry once in a while), you're no longer writing Harry or Hermione anywhere close to in-character. Not even if according to the narrative of your story, Ron deserves it because he teased Hermione about being a know-it-all.

If you write Sirius as teaming up with Umbridge to make sure anti-werewolf laws keep Remus from ever having any kind of life, you're no longer writing Sirius as remotely in-character. Not even if according to the narrative of your story, Remus deserves it because he believed that Sirius was the secret-keeper.

There's no rule that says fanon characterizations have to stay close to canon, of course. I'm not sitting in judgment of anyone who enjoys dark!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, fem!Harry, powerful!Harry or any of the other myriad variations.

But sometimes I read reviews of fics like the ones I described above and the responses are along the lines of "you really got Harry in character when he dropped Ron in the vat of acid and watched him die because Ron didn't support him in the Tri-Wizard tournament, that's exactly what Harry would do and so many authors get it wrong" or "exactly, Sirius is too strong to be friends with someone like Remus and I'm glad you understand that."

Sometimes I think there is no appeal of bashing. Authors just think that they're being true to character with the bash. (Doesn't apply when someone labels bashing up front... which I wish was more common.)

*** So let me be the devil's advocate here... The people might have been talking about have Harry in character with whatever character the author was creating.... That being said It's a fine line between realistic bashing and non realistic bashing, especially if you are changing who the characters are....

For ex... Your first example of how much hate does Ron deserve for being a mean 11 year old boy making fun of a fellow classmate if Harry wasn't friends with Ron but that classmate (aka Hermione).... Yeah a little hate is deserved but not I'd kill you.... Now if it starts off as slight hate because of that then Ron becomes Malfoy in his actions, it's alright to write him it disdain that's a realistic bash.... Most authors just don't know how to change levels of hate is all

Your second example that's absolutely Ludacris.... Now it's sightly more acceptable if it's au and Lupin was the betrayer instead of Peter... But I would like to think that Sirius could separate the action from all werewolfs.... Though then we start going into, how sane was Sirius after 10 years in Azkaban? That's really up to someone's interpretation if they don't go cannon.

​

Half of my point, which I can see I made badly early in the morning, is that people view canon differently and that what one person sees as canonical in-character, another person sees as a bash (or an OOC portrayal of the character doing the bashing).

For example, the other day on this subreddit there was a request that read in part: /give me a Sirius that reflects his actual character, and not the stuff of Tumblr lore./

One of the first recommendations was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7254667/1/][*/Black Vengeance/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1729392/Teufel1987][/Teufel1987/]]/./ That's the fic with the plot in question-- in order to punish Remus for believing that Sirius was guilty and for toeing Dumbledore's line regarding Harry (his canonical actions), Sirius helps Umbridge with her anti-werewolf legislation, eventually resulting in Remus' execution. To me, that's massively OOC for Sirius, who hates prejudice ("pureblood mania") and urges Harry to look at how someone treats his inferiors to get his measure. To someone else, that "a Sirius that reflects his actual character." And to yet another person, "the stuff of Tumblr lore" might be in-character rather than something they enjoy but see as a bit AU.

The other half of my point, also made badly, was that you can't bash a character without fundamentally changing the character who does the bashing.

To be clear, I'm not picking on /Black Vengeance/, which is after all marked AU and has obviously been enjoyed by many people who like Remus Lupin and the Remus/Sirius friendship less than I do. :)

***** So I see where you are coming from and I think we're thinking pretty similar for the most part

I think that was major case of a recommendation that was absolutely terrible.... Happens all the time I myself will personally ask for a non dark/evil Harry and get multiple Dark evil Harry recommendations

Now I agree for the most part you can't "bash" a character without vastly changing the character doing the bashing or imo the character that's being bash .... But if it's AU that Doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing ... It's just done badly more than it is done good. It's just most people can't write a realistic bashing. And there's a market for unrealistic bashing anyways because consumers can't see past their dislike for characters either... And for us that don't like unrealistic bashing it leaves us out of luck

The biggest example I can give is Sinyk, who is vastly popular in his fanfics.. Several 10k favorites fics..... I personally don't like them I don't think he sets up the bashing adequately, it's just I dislike this character so my main protagonist Is going to dislike this character.... That being said he's real popular on Fanfiction.net.... So he's not going to change his writing style when he has that much of an audience

I think you should re-read the first book, because I recall Hermione picking on Harry and Ron, and the bathroom episode was caused by Ron venting to Harry about her attitude. I mean, I know that Sinyk, etc. like to portray it as Ron bullying Hermione relentlessly, but do you remember how annoying she was back then?

** The easiest (and worst) way to realize a certain ship is to get rid of the competition by bashing it (actually, the /easiest/ way is to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip][kill off the character alltogether]], but that's something you generally can't get away with). I think this is the most common reason for bashing in general.

Certain common plots also usually tend to involve bashing of certain characters. For instance, WBWL usually contains James bashing (and rarely Lily bashing as well, allthough she usually doesn't play much of a role at all in the story), Manipulative!Dumbledore bash, Ron bash, etc.

Ron bashing is also very common in plots where Harry becomes chummy with Slytherins and starts politicking, is paired with Daphne, or similar, giving into his Slytherin prejudice at the expense of his friendship with Harry.

So -- IME, bashing is usually done for shipping reasons, but is also common with certain common plots, as if it's obligatory.

*** Hermione gets bashed a lot in stories. When she "learns" that house-elf slavery is fine because they die without an owner, and that she shouldn't blindly project her filthy muggle views on them? Bashing. She researched house-elf slavery thoroughly in the Hogwarts library; she didn't act out of ignorance and there's no hint of an elf bond or need to be a slave in canon. She's also the token "ugly mudblood" in many Harry/pureblood princess stories, or the "spy for Dumbledore" in many "Indie!Harry" stories.

I'd also consider her reduction to eye-candy and moral support for the great Lord Potter in many Harry/Hermione stories a form of bashing when Hermione suddenly is fine with being a second-class citizen as long as she's with Harry.

**** Not sure why this is getting downvoted since you are speaking the truth. Hermione is bashed incredibly often. In no particular order there is:

- Hermione not believing Harry about his participation in the TWT and joining the hate bandwagon. Usually, the newly-introduced love interest is the only one who stays with Harry then.

- Hermione spying for a manipulative Dumbledore, usually in exchange for books (because that's what you bribe people who like to read with).

- Hermione being a bint for SPEW. Her methods and target (Hogwarts elves) might be wrong, but the general idea to fight slavery has been rather widespread in Western Europe for a few centuries.

- Hermione nagging Harry to death over some trivial issue.

- Hermione snitching on a dark Harry because that's what the most Machiavellian character of the series would do. DARK MAGIC is EVIL!!! after all.

- Hermione being bashed to hell and back for her attraction to Ron. Usually, that has her domestically abused later on because that's what she deserves for being with a Weasley, amirite? And obviously, those Weasleys all band together to abuse the Mudblood slut.

- Hermione being slut-shamed for a promiscuous attitude. Not very common, but you see that on archive occasionally. Tends to involve rape by pureblood supremacists as a plot point (because that's what she was asking for, amirite?).

** It's usually slash writers that bash Hermione so they can get rid of "Everyone's favourite girl" to make Harry gay, and paired with a Slytherin/Death Eater.

Bashing is just a case of "Let's exacerbate one bad point about a character. Dumbledore is manipulative, yep, let's make that all he is. Ron is a bit of a dick sometimes? Let's make that ALL The time. Molly offhand mentions Love Potions to Ginny and Hermione in like 1 line in the whole series? Let's make her plan to potion everyone"

Though sometimes it's good to read Hermione bashing, when it goes from "Hermione is basically Omniscient, knows more about Magic than Nicholas Flamel, even as a first year, Harry regardless of whether he's literally a Death Eater raised by a not dead Voldemort will fall for, and be submissive to her" you just want to see Hermione bashed to make up for Hermione-Sue.

*** I am quite confused by the point you are trying to make. Why would slash writers need to get rid of Hermione when Harry is already gay? If he is gay, there is no need to bash her because she is no longer a relevant love interest that can go anywhere within the story. In most slash, she is left alone. Bashing (of Hermione) is more common in straight fics where she is essentially a ‘threat' and needs to be put in her place.

** So there were a lot of great answers above, here's my take on bashing in Fanfic.

We are all human we all view things differently, so it makes sense that we have different interpretations of the same character.

Now personally I think we have become such an society that if anyone writes something we disagree with, and it paints someone in a negative light it's automatically terrible bashing, and I don't think that's the case. Harry Potter fanfiction is taking the Harry Potter world and adding our own twist on it. I have no problem with any character being "bashed" as long as it's realistically done....

That's the kicker, most authors are so caught up with just wanting to hate a character that unrealistically bash them. It's also a lot easier to write unrealistic bashing than realistic. Top that off with non prefect characters being written by J.K, it's easier to focus on the negative instead of positive about characters you dislike.

Now we can blame the Authors for this but we really have a lot of the fanfiction readers to blame.... If we as consumers as a whole, didn't consume unrealistic bashing there wouldn't be so many real popular stores with unrealistic bashing. We have no one to blame but ourselves.

*** You draw a line between realistic bashing and unrealistic bashing, but if a character is written realistically is that even bashing?

**** This is a tough one. For instance in an AU where Harry doesn't go to Hogwarts until later (post 4th year) but somehow the first year instance of Ron insulting Hermione, her going to the bathroom and the troll incident happening, but there's no reconciliation. And as the years pass, they become a thorn in each others sides and yeah, they hate each other. Or if Harry's not there he hangs out with others (Seamus, Dean, etc...) and they influence him to hate her or to think negatively on "nerds", muggleborns whatever.

That said I agree that fanfic tends to exaggerate traits in certain characters, especially bad ones if the author sees them as a barrier to their ship. And yes, I would also agree that people see canon differently, which leads to this kind of stuff.

For what it's worth, most fic tends to be AU to me so I tend to find more of this stuff realistic, though I would agree that it's over the top oftentimes.

Of course most characters in all fandoms are not perfect, and when the author dislikes some of them, their negative traits appear very prominently in their fanfiction, but bashing just for the sake of it? Basically neglecting any positive traits a character has and actually spending time to kill/maim/ridicule them? That's a bit abnormal imo... and very wide spread in this fandom for some reason... Especially if you think about what Dumbledore, the Weasly family, Hermione and some others have done throughout the books FOR Harry, despite their imperfections.

Because they feel better for it, and yes it is an extremely immature coping mechanism. Personally, it is one my biggest 'Nope, I'll stop reading this immediately'-trigger, as it does a great disservice to the author, the story and character. Frankly, it's also insulting to the reader.

I suspect that ego (and consequently envy) is one of the main motivators to write or read bashing. Character like Dumbledore, Ron and Hermione receive a largely positive characterization in the books, and while they are certainly flawed (and shown to have flaws), they feel like they never have to assume responsibility for these flaws - possibly a stark contrast the personal experience of the author/reader who might feel their own flaws are unfairly emphasized in their own social groups.

Consequently, they strive to assert their own perception and interpretation onto the characters they feel frustrated by, and show the world how intelligent and morally superior they themselves are for 'seeing through the deception' and 'showing things how they really are'.

At least thats my interpretation.

I can only hope that the understanding that people, and therefore characters, are never one-dimensional caricatures comes with time and experience. There is very rarely only one truth, and even directly opposing statements can both be true, depending on the circumstances.
