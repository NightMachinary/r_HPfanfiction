Arguably the most famous fan fiction. It's even got its own website. What do you think of it ? I'm leaving three comments below reading Like, Ok and Dislike. Upvote or downvote according to your own opinion.

** This topic is ripe for brigading from other subreddits.

I voted, but I also kinda feel like this subreddit spends an inordinate amount of time discussing HPMoR. There are plenty of other, less controversial fanfics to enjoy.

** I really liked it, it was the first fanfiction i've ever read and it did convince me that fanfiction can be worth reading. It has it's flaws and is a bit pretentious at times but most people simply dislike it for his author which I think is wrong. Good books can have shitty authors. Best case Ender's game.
