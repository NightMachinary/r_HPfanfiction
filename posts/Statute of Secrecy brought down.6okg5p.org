Any stories where the Statute of Secrecy comes crashing down? Not systematically worn down on one side or the other, but because of something that can't be covered up? Please and thank you.


** I have read two one shots about this. One Harry running away from Aurors(I think) in a broom and is recorded on tape for a beer commercial, no one noticed this till it was shown in the Super Bowl. Second one, he's also running from the Aurors, passes by mistake or deliberate by a news room while they are live and the Aurors obliviate the news crew without knowing that they are showing magic to the world. I'm really trying to find the again, but can't!!!! I'll keep trying.

*** I know the second one, I'm pretty sure it was in a collection of one-shots.

In fact, I'm pretty sure it was this one-shot: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10280808/22/Little-Whinging-Pet-Shop]]

Its setup is that after Harry is attacked by dementors in the beginning of OotP, he believes that since a) only Voldemort has a reason to attack him, and b) it's the Ministry which controls the dementors, he comes to conclusion c) the Ministry has been taken over by Voldemort, leading him to flee; the Aurors catch up to him just as he's leaving Gringotts and he leads them on a broom chase which inadvertently disrupts the filming of a Top Gear episode.

*** The first one is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4626147/navigate][Harry Potter and the Superbowl Breach]].

It's very long (1,040,515 words) with the first half covering the 2015 - 2016 academic year (primarily [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXX][January 28]] and after) and the second half of the story covers the following year. The first half is a thorough exploration of OP's scenario (statute of secrecy collapses, what happens next). I've looked for a story like this for a very long time, and this one did not disappoint, although the writing is a little below standards, at least in the beginning-- for example, there are a few inline ANs.

The second half goes beyond this scenario and also explores the impact to the "hidden nations" of merpeople, centaurs and so forth; this part I did not like as much as the first, and I also found it a bit hard to follow.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this story if you're interested in a slightly-too-long epic about what happens when the statute falls.

**** It's a decent timewaster. Writing is BeardedOne standard, aka functional with little purple prose that can be a bit dry, tone is about what you'd expect if you have familiarity with his other works (mostly light, not shying away from the darker side of stuff but not going in full detail and balanced by diabeetus-inducing WAFF), and the plot is, fairly decent. I remember a bit too much telling over showing, but nothing severely bad.

In all, a solid Acceptable.

**** It's pretty much the opposite of the two you mentioned, instead of Harry messing around int he Star Wars universe, Ahsoka ends up on Earth and raises Harry as a Jedi. There are also some very funny moments like the twist in the prophecy and all of the Founders achievements involving being completely hammered/wasted/sick at the time. (Helga and Rowena made the stairs move with parselmagic that was bound to themselves, so Salazar couldn't help. The Gargoyle was the result of a potions accident, and Salazar was the one who enchanted the Sword of Gryffindor to prove that it could be done.)

** This usually occurs in fics where the Second Wizarding War gets so far out of control that it spills over into the Muggle world. Once Voldemort has control of the Ministry, he openly declares himself to the Muggles and begins his attack. "Black Serendipity" by opopanax (especially the first chapter) came to mind. Some other fics like that have already been recommended.
