I've been wondering about this for a short while now, although I still am not too sure of how it could work, if it could work.

I think that, since death is such a prominent element in the HP series, that ghosts could SOMEHOW make a good plot...

And... that's basically all I've got. Sorry.


** MNFF has a Halloween challenge for that at the moment. There are a few already up but I expect a lot more will follow.

***** Nah, it's okay. Actually, I didn't know much about Mugglenet to begin with, since I've never ever visited it and all.

** Disclaimer: I'm not a fan of the story I'm about to link.

That said, I did like the author's other fics, and the fic being linked is not bad writing-wise, it's just I didn't personally enjoy the plot and couldn't keep reading.

Anyway, from what I recall (having read only a portion of it quite some time ago), Harry is a ghost for a good part of the story.
