Please note that I avoid unfinished stories unless they are very regularly updated or will be finished extremely soon.

As the title suggests, I've read Backwards with Purpose and polished off most of little0bird and Northumbrian. But you can never, ever, have enough H/G and R/Hr. Give me all your recs, guys! Thanks.

** I like a few more H/G authors:

kbo: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1251524/kb0]] He likes to write intelligent Harry stories, such as *Harry Potter: Rogue*, linkffn(3796738), and *The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382).

Brennus: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus]] His stories are good, but bashes Dumbledore/Molly/Ron too much. In *Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463), he bashes almost everyone else except the protagonists.

pottermum: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1864945/pottermum]] Her latest *It's Complicated*, linkffn(11567591), is a BDSM smut fic. *Always*, linkffn(11379466), and *Living for the Moment*, linkffn(11299554), are nice fluff romances.
