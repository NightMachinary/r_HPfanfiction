** To me, Romione is cute. They have such a strange relationship because most of it looks like arguing but I think that's what fuels them and keeps them on their toes (I'm sure in the future they learn where to draw the line in their arguments). Despite this, it's actually one of my least favourite pairings just because I think there are other people Hermione would have been way better off with.

I shipped Hinny before I knew what shipping was because Harry and Ginny being together just made me so happy. I guess because I love Ginnys character so much so I like her with Harry. It's cute to me how they grew up together and Ginny had a huge crush on him half her life. I do think JKR could have developed it better because their relationship was very sudden.

Overall, I think these two being canon ships are the reason why I would still ship them? I've seen it happen and I don't hate them, I'm just like “okay I'll take it” and these ships have aspects that make them appealing/cute. (That being said, I think there are still other pairings that would have been stronger but that's what fanfiction is for I guess).

** I do go with most canon but regardless, Harry/Ginny IMO just seem perfect for each other. Ginny is into Quidditch, has common experiences, is fun and extrovert compared to his introvertion. She doesn't let him overcomplicate emotions. There's definitely a spark there. Romanticc dynamics with someone like Hermione in the other hand seem boring by comparison. Personally I don't think I have seen Hinny haters saying that Ginny doesn't work for Harry, because she totally does. The problem with Hinny, and what most people complain about, is that Ginny changed as a character overnight and off screen in order to be the perfect match for Harry. Not that she is not a perfect couple to Harry's canon personality.

About Ron and Hermione I could go on for a while as well. But I'll just limit to say that the spark is there, we all see it. There's chemistry. And to those saying it's a school thing and can't be something stable, I say my wife and I have a pretty similar dynamic and have been married for almost 10 years now.

*** 'I say my wife and I have a pretty similar dynamic and have been married for almost 10 years now.'

I used a similar argument with my parents as an example and the Harmony fanatic I was talking with gave me this dogshit response.

*** Agreed on the difference between book Ginny and movie Ginny. Unfortunately, movie Ginny was badly miscast, and Bonnie Wright just couldn't pull off the fun, fiery Ginny from the books. She was far too posh (her accent didn't match the rest of the family at all), far too serious, and had no chemistry with Daniel Radcliffe (who I don't think made a good Harry, but that's beside the point).

***** Definitely. If you look at Bonnie Wright, she's a good looking girl. But when she is playing Ginny, she is incredibly dull.

Just look at the way she says "hey, you!" to Harry when she enters the room. It's supposed to be casual, flirty and friendly. It doesn't come across that way at all. She hardly ever smiles in the movies.

** Considering that they're canon ships, it's not surprising. Even JK Rowling has admitted that Ron/Hermione doesn't make sense (at least I think she has), but as long as you don't conflate movie Ginny with book Ginny I can see the appeal of Harry/Ginny. She's a great character in the book, and while she could have used a lot more development (and Harry's attraction to her really came out of nowhere) I've seen fics that really make them work. Ginny is a character who's developed enough canonically to have a distinct personality, but minor enough that authors have room to put their own spin on her personality without her seeming too out of character.

*** Ron and hermione both have dominating characteristics that cause them to argue more often than not. They believe in different things. I also believe that Ron dampens Hermiones enthusiasm also he always says mean stuff to her

With hinny the movie versions was very bad. It showed a stalker/obsessed Ginny and the relationship came so sudden that it was unnatural and therefore people suggest that funny used love potions With hinny books, I love the way ginny was written but because they made her so dominating I feel as if he would rile Harry up or crush his opinion

**** Don't agree with this assessment of Romione. Ron is a young boy who has always lived in the shadow of his siblings. He has to develop self confidence. He likes Hermione and it's pretty obvious, even to Hermione, but he's a teenager boy and talks before he thinks and that's when he says the mean stuff. He's jealous of Victor Krum (and probably feels a little betrayed that his hero got his girl). Then this chick Lavender comes along and snogs him and it's the greatest thing ever and Hermione doesn't seem interested, so why not keep it up with Lavender. Both Hermione and Ron had to come to that point where they realized that they liked and respected each other and were willing to admit it - that's terrifying as a teenager.

Ron is intelligent, no matter what people say. He's a brilliant strategist. He is amazed by Hermione's intelligence. He probably thinks she's far too wonderful for him.

Hermione is a muggle at a magical school who just found out that magic exists. She's homely with buckteeth and probably never had a boy take a second glance at her. On top of that, she's crazy smart, and that intimidates boys (I know this because boys said it to me all the time as a teenager). She's a foreigner in a new world trying to get her footing. Ron saves her from a troll. He's funny. He's secretly brilliant. He's a quidditch star. Hermione sees her friend grow into a man and realized she fancies him but he's off snogging Lavender and then later when it gets really shitty, he leaves. But he comes back. He figures out how to break into an impenetrable bank and steal a horcrux and gets them moving again. In a sense, he comes back and gives them new life and hope. He admits he was wrong. He admits he loves her. It's a love story for the ages.

This doesn't mean that I don't think Hermione and Harry were suited for each other, too, just that Harry obviously saw what was happening between his two best friends and stepped out of the way. And book Ginny challenged him and was loyal and beautiful and had grit and moxie. She was the hot athlete girl. So book Ginny I approve of. Movie Ginny was too watered down. They made her one dimensional. Movie Harry and Movie Ginny weren't suited to each other. But the book versions were.

** I'm someone who likes canon compliancy and like the dynamics of both ships 🤷‍♀️ For me, Harry and Ginny have a really nice relationship with complementary characteristics that I wish there was more of in the books so fanfic can develop that further. Ron and Hermione - look, I can see why some people don't like them, especially people that are particularly averse to bickering. I think they would both need a lot of growth as people but I think that's ok and fun to read and write too.

I'm not opposed to non-canon ships and can usually see the arguments for them, they just don't capture my attention in the same way.

** Why not?

While I'm less enthusiastic about Ron and Hermione, Ginny is written to be the perfect match for in the Books, almost perfect. She's exactly what canon Harry wants and respects: a hot, fun, and strong Quidditch girl. On top of that, she's fanatically and unconditionally loyal to him:

- As a 14 years old, she got him into Umbridge's office and never raised a single objection over the entire (foolhardy) undertaking. Hermione didn't want Harry to go at first.
- After this brush of death (or worse) with some of Britain's most murderous and sadistic serial killers, she didn't hesitate to risk herself again and again. Hermione and Luna matched her courage here, but no other girls in the Books come even close to this feat.
- Never raised an issue with Harry using the HBP book, after verifying it's not another Diary. Hermione is pissed at Harry for almost entire school year.
- After Harry sectumsempraed Draco, Hermione was gloating with righteousness, while she fiercely defended him.
- When the Trio went Horcrux hunting, she attempted to steal the Gryffindor Sword from Snape. When that failed, she, Luna, and Neville restarted the DA, fully knowing that their actions would get them tortured or worse. Luckily for them, Snape was on their side.

--------------

Based on canon depictions, my shipping preference for Harry is obviously Ginny > Luna > Hermione. But they are all great girls
