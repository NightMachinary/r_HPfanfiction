I finished Harry Potter and... I just wanted more. I also greatly struggle to read, and have a very fast typing ability, so I can literally type faster than I can read. In short, I find it easier to consume and enjoy stories by writing them instead of reading them. You can probably see where I'm going with this...

So far I've written the first drafts for four books, and am in the beginning stages of drafting the fifth, for an original Hogwarts-set story with all new characters, plot stories, themes, etc to be enjoyed. (Boy have I had fun writing it myself). To give a brief idea for the foundational idea of this story: the protagonist, Bagsy Beetlehorn, sucks as spells, and achieves most of what she achieves through sheer force of practise-making-perfect and working on inventions to solve difficult problems. (Think alchemist type gal). All the while her skills are complimented by a massively magically gifted friend who is also a bit of a jerk. Some general themes are: trust, identity, forgiveness, determinism, jealousy and talent vs practise.

I'm hoping for some peeps to come and help me get this all finished up. Whilst I intend to do all the writing myself, I'd super appreciate all kinds of help from beta-readers, to hype buddies, to plot-refiners, to whatever really. Honestly, even just chatting to someone about the books will go a long ways in helping me get them finished and would be huuuuugely appreciated.

I intend to have the final three books (books five, six and seven) drafted within the next two years so that I can begin releasing the first one. (Given I've been working on this project for around two and a half years now, this goal is fairly manageable, if optimistic).

Progress wise, here are the current word counts, and roughly how long it took me to write them:

Book One: 70,000 words (a few months)

Book Two: 80,000 words (two weeks (no seriously it was a wild tow weeks I don't think I slept at all))

Book Three: 150,000 words (a year)

Book Four: 170,000 words (a few months (someone I know read through all my stories to help me out and their hype made me write so quickly I thought I was going to get whiplash))

Book Five (only just begun writing this): 10,000 words
