Are there any stories where Remus, between the attack on the Potters and Harry going to Hogwarts, became successful? Numerous stories show that knowledge of magic such as repair or cleaning spells and the muggle world could be used to make money. Where are the stories that show Dumbledore trying to convince a wealthy, happy Remus to teach at Hogwarts instead of a poor, struggling, a threadbare clothing wearing Remus.

  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.

** There was a story wherein Remus would use magic to create amazingly good forged documents. I think it started with him in Marauder era and he would rent a P. O. Box and then reroute it to a piece of parchment to receive orders and work in the room of requirement. Anybody know of this fic?

*** Yup that's defiently The Diadone Method. Harry is raised by a mob boss they then hire Lupin at first not aware who he was. He's a world renowned forger in the mundane world as well as magical linkffn(8046571)

edit: It is unfinished and unfortunately abandoned. It was really good writing wasn't all that good but it had a some what reasonable OP Harry! I also may be wrong but this is pretty close if it isn't the one.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.
