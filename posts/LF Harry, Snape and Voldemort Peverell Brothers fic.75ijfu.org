There's a post over on tumblr that's been circulating for a while now that talks about how Harry, Snape and Voldemort each fit with the story of one of the Peverell brothers but I was just wondering if there were any fanfictions out there that drew on that, with the three of them maybe being the reincarnations of the three brothers or something similar?


** There's a few fics, like linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11544031/1/Rebirth-of-the-Three-Brothers]]) that start and are abandoned, but no good, long ones.

  When Harry finally dies, he's reunited with his friends and family, even Tom Riddle. But back on earth things are just getting worse, despite it being years after the war. So Death has decided to send the Three Brothers to 1980 to be reborn as actual brothers and to stop the war before it even begins.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.
