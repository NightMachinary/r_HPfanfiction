So, I just finished The Life and Times, which is a Marauder/James and Lily love story. However, I'm itching to read some more stuff about the Marauders, their time at Hogwarts and the relationship between James and lily. My main requests are that the book be written with Deathly Hallows in mind (so written after DH was released) and that the story be as canon-compliant as possible. I'd also like it to be set during their later school years, i.e. 6th and 7th year. Any recs? Thanks for the help. I'm new to fan fiction, so assume that I know nothing.


** Here are my favorites:

- linkffn(7305052) - "Against the Moon" is my all time FAVORITE Marauder fanfiction.
- linkffn(12248997) - "The Colour of Everything" is about Remus during the war. Excellent and reliable author.
- linkffn(3325624) - "The Age of Inertia" is about Lily during the war. I fell in love with the writing style so much that I recommend it even though it is unfinished.

Here are popular fics that I either didn't read or didn't really like that much:

- linkffn(8236381) - "The Rise and Fall of the Stag and Doe"
- linkffn(3323816) - "Commentarius"

Here is my Lily story because I am shameless and would like more reviews:

- linkffn(11440239) - "Flowers in Winter"

  Moments. They make or break relationships. Lily didn't just happen to fall in love with James. It wasn't an accident, but a long drawn out process that grew out of the relationships of the people around them. And when it came down to it, even Lily and James couldn't fight fate.

**** Against the Moon is pretty slow-paced, but I am enjoying it immensely. Especially now that I've gone through it and can just read each chapter as they come out. For reference chapter 124 (most recent chapter) is in October of 3rd year. If that's too slow for you, then you might want to pass...but I think it's a breath of fresh air. Lily is barely a character at this point. So far, Remus's opinion of her is just the nice girl who is friends with the Severus Snape. Dorcas is a character, but she's four years older (prefect). Other than that, she's the only one of the group you named. Sirius and James are BRILLIANT and quick-witted. They are super smart, but rarely apply themselves to anything meaningful. Peter is hands down the best Peter I've ever seen in a fanfiction. I will literally fight people on this. His character is extremely well-rounded, and he has his moments where he is an incredibly valuable member of the group.

Honestly, it's slow-paced, but Spotlight has a way with creating characters who feel incredibly life-like. My one complaint is that the story is often too wordy...but it's not dry or repetitive.

****** Like I said, Lily doesn't show up much. I'm only thinking of a few moments where she really says anything. Occasionally she'll roll her eyes at them and ignore James and Sirius if they are being childish, but the only reason she is even around them is because her friends are sort of friendly with them (Charlotte and Betta).

If you want a minor spoiler, Remus had an interaction with her a few chapters back. He needed to borrow her class notes, she was worried that she had let something slip about Severus's home life. She's still pretty one-dimensional at this point.

I hope you enjoy it!

******** I still haven't had my coffee, it's quite understandable that my comment made little sense.

First of all, it's not that I'm against slash - I simply avoid it if it's not canon /and/ if I think the relationship couldn't work. For example, I could read Dumbledore/Grindelwald but not Severus/Remus. /No./

In my opinion, Wolfstar wouldn't work. I'm most certainly not an expert on relationships, but the history between Sirius and Remus is quite complicated.

1) The Shrieking Shack. Sirius sent Snape to face a werewolf, and the consenquences would have been disastrous, were it not for James. Remus could have maimed, infected or killed Snape. It was an enormous betrayal of trust (and most writers overlook this) between two friends; imagine if they were actually dating.

2) The spy.

#+begin_quote
  "Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter," said Lupin. "I assume that's why you didn't tell me, Sirius?" he said casually over Pettigrews head. "Forgive me, Remus," said Black. "Not at all, Padfoot, old friend," said Lupin, who was now rolling up his sleeves. "And will you, in turn, forgive me for believing you were the spy?"
#+end_quote

I mean, /really/? The whole story wouldn't have happened if it weren't for their *mutual mistrust*. Again, you can't build an actual relationship on this.

#+begin_quote
  What's the main pairing?
#+end_quote

There's more Lily/James than wolfstar in this fic because Remus and Sirius have a completely platonic relationship until about halfway through the fic. The next 40% is a slowburn realisation of feelings and only the last 10% has a full relationship with sex scenes etc. Remus and Sirius' friendship is the main relationship though.

#+begin_quote
  Are Sirius and James still stupid (because they were ridiculously intelligent)?
#+end_quote

They are both stupid with zero common sense and intelligent at the same time. Like Fred and George I suppose.

#+begin_quote
  Is Peter just 'there'?
#+end_quote

Not at all. This is one the best things about this.

#+begin_quote
  Are, or is one of them, Marlene McKinnon, Dorcas Meadowes, Hestia Jones, Emmeline Vance, Alice Prewett(?) Fawley(?) Fortescue(?) there?
#+end_quote

The story is set over the last two (?) years of school and then the next 1-2 years after. A few of these are introduced when they join the order. I don't think any of them are at school. And definitely none of them are Lily's BFF gurlfriends.

This fic is a lot more focussed on just the core characters than others I've read. There are comparatively few OCs and side characters. None of them feature prominently and none of them have useless side plots that nobody cares about.

#+begin_quote
  Are people IC?
#+end_quote

The characterisation is probably gonna be your biggest annoyance here. This fic was published in 2004 and I think it was the one that started every irritating trope. It does them /far/ better than most other Marauder school fics but you've sound like you've read enough of them by now that nobody could do those tropes justice ( I'm at the same point now).

They're all /in/ character. But they're all dialled up to eleven. It's really over the top; but in an intentional way. I would definitely describe this fic as a humour fic above anything else. It would probably help to know that before you read it.

#+begin_quote
  Are Sirius and James portrayed the same way like The Elvendork Prequel?
#+end_quote

Yeah, I'd say so. The part where they backchat the policeman is similar to a lot of their dialogue in this.

#+begin_quote
  Is Lily the most intelligent, most courageous, funniest, most beautiful, most powerful and most incredible girl of her year (I am absolulety done with glorifying Lily. It's disgusting)?
#+end_quote

No. She's just average (well, slightly above average). It's been a while since I read the whole thing. She's not the talk of the entire school.

#+begin_quote
  Is she like Hermione in personality?
#+end_quote

A little. Not so much of a stick in the mud. She's not really a major character until about halfway through.

#+begin_quote
  Is Sirius this childish and whiny teen?
#+end_quote

Unfortunately so. I think this is the fic that started that. He has other qualities though.

#+begin_quote
  Does James just exist to stalk Lily?
#+end_quote

No. Although there is definitely some of it.

#+begin_quote
  Is Remus the boring, bookish one?
#+end_quote

Yes, but the authors are entirely aware that they have written him like this and poke fun at it all the time. They write it in a funny way.

#+begin_quote
  Is he addicted to chocolate?
#+end_quote

...yes. Unfortunately this is a recurring joke through the fic. I wish it wasn't.

#+begin_quote
  Are Remus and Lily friends before she and James started dating?
#+end_quote

They don't spend any independent time together in this. But she doesn't find him annoying like his friends.

#+begin_quote
  What about Fabian and Gideon Prewett? Are they there? Benjy Fenwick? Caradoc Dearborn? Kingsley Shacklebolt? Sturgis Podmore? Frank Longbottom?
#+end_quote

Most (or some, I can't remember) these are background characters upon joining the order. I think Kingsley also briefly features in their time at school.

The main selling points of this fic are it's humour and writing style. It is funny and surprisingly light hearted all the way through. The quality of the prose is exceptional. I've only read a small handful of other fics that come close. The language used and the sentence structure is artful whilst the humour keeps it from being pretentious.

#+begin_quote
  And the last question: If you ship Wolfstar, WHY do you do?
#+end_quote

I initially didn't ship it. I'm still not 100% sold on it. 70% maybe.

I started reading it because I love the Marauders. I had read every half decent gen or Lily/James school fic I could find. And they were getting repetitive and boring. Shoebox was the first wolfstar fic I ever read. I read it because someone mentioned that its completely gen until halfway through. So I decided to start it and stop reading when it got to slashy for my tastes. I enjoyed it so much that I stayed til the end.

So now that I had read a wolfstar fic an enjoyed it. I decided to read some more. I enjoyed most of those too. This discovery had doubled or tripled the pool of marauders fic to read.

Sometimes I don't always enjoy fics because they mess with the Sirius and James dynamic too much. Making Remus more important than James to Sirius can throw me off. And the silly, hyperactive Sirius characterisation is way more present in wolfstar than other fics.

I now enjoy reading wolfstar more than Lily/James because the variety is much greater. Lily/James are always set during school or shortly afterwards. Obviously there's good canonical reason for this, but it gets boring. Wolfstar fics are set during school, after school, reminiscing whilst in prison/working shit jobs, on the run, living in Grimmauld place etc. The dynamic of their relationship changes a lot too.

Also the quality of the writing is generally higher. The characterisations are more thought through and less generic. The quality of the prose is /far/ higher. But this is possibly because a lot of wolfstar fics are character pieces rather than plot driven.

TL;DR: No wolfstar until halfway through. Very few of those annoying side characters that are practically OCs. This is the fic that birthed all the annoying tropes so, boy, are they there in abundance. Personally I think the humour and writing style make up for that. Would recommend reading first 2-3 chapters to see if you can get past it.

******* Just to add to this, it's been a really long time since I read it and I'll probably have to do a reread because some details are a bit blurry but what stuck out most to me were:

Peter Pettigrew: The last chapter is gut-wrenching because of him. The descent to the dark side was done extremely well and I loved his characterization. Honestly one of the most believable portrayals of him I've ever read. The seeds of his betrayal are there and you /almost/ think he's sympathetic before you remember what he did to James and Lily.

The humour: This is the selling point imo. I've found prank and joke sequences to be quite cringy in most fics but this is genuinely, laugh-out-loud funny.

I remember Fabian and Gideon Prewett being the first generation of Fred and George whom the Marauders worship. Can't recall the others. I think Lily initially had a crush on Remus.

To be honest, I actually have zero interest in the Marauders and couldn't get into any of the other big fics, including TLAT but this one is really good. I don't mind Wolfstar and I read a lot of slash so it's not a problem for me. I don't ship it though i don't mind reading about them as secondary pairings. I agree that it is a bit dated. I'm pretty sure it started chocolate addict!Remus and because it's so old, some things might be a bit off but it's still a classic.

******** It's also my favourite portrayal of Peter (not there's many to chose from). The last chapter ends perfectly. It really does make me feel for him. It ends the fic on a really dark note; the story isn't tied up but we know from canon exactly whats going to happen next. It's possibly my favourite chapter in the story. I also really enjoyed the careers advice chapter. Though that was just purely humour.

I've read a few bits of the fic recently but not all of it, so lots of details are fuzzy. But now you remind me, James and Sirius did have that over the top hero worship for Fabian and Gideon. Also, from briefly flicking through just now, there's a lot less of it set after school than I remember. Looks like its only the last two chapters.

******* Hmmm, looks like I'm not reading it after all. I'm trying to avoid cliches and /not/ go to the roots of them. I think I'm too young for some things.

Anyway, I might give it a shot if you can remember what 'slightly above average' Lily looks like. I would really like an average Lily instead of one that is smarter than Einstein with an IQ of 7655997, hotter than the sun and the most beautiful girl to ever graduate Hogwarts who makes a veela look like a troll, is more powerful than Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald, the Founders and the Peverell brothers combined who is the second coming of Merlin. I don't want a Lily that is the kindest, calmest, bravest, smartest, prettiest girl in the school. Thank you!

Wolfstar is [[http://bronzedragon.tumblr.com/post/33396438434/why-i-dont-ship-it-wolfstar/amp][extremely unhealthy]] and Sirius and James were described as brothers so I don't think we should shove James aside so that Wolfstar could work. Seriously.

Thanks! =)

******** Lily is definitely not described as any of those things. I don't recall her being described as anything more than 'pretty'; Her physical appearance and academic ability are not dwelt on. She's not a main character, so if you're expecting her to appear in most scenes, I wouldn't bother reading.

See, that's my problem. 'Pretty' suddenly turned into the goddess of veelas. 'Smart' suddenly turns into an IQ of 8654. 'Fairly skilled' suddenly turns into the second coming of Merlin. 'Kind' suddenly turns into kinder than the kindest person alive.

People forget that the woman was dead and they were talking to her son that she died to save so stuff like 'Pretty, smart, talented, kind, etc.' isn't very uncommon for orphans to hear even if their parents weren't.

When James was described as smart he suddenly had an IQ of -0976...?

I'm not reading it after all. Thanks though! =)

** I just found linkffn(a month of sundays) not too long ago and re-fell in love with James/Lily. It's Lily POV and is about her falling in love and realizing her feelings for James throughout 6th and 7th year.

  Lily Evans has spent years despising James Potter. He has spent just as long worshiping her. When seventh year pairs them Head Boy and Girl, each comes to realize that their judgment isn't quite what they thought it was. This is the same story that was over on Checkmated, but I completed it here. Prequel to Heroes for Ghosts. Warning: this story is a strong M rating.
