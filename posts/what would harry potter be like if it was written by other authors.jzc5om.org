******* Also, at the end, have a baby basilisk (or whatever) come searching for its mama. Because a staple of the horror genre is to show, once the heroes think they've won, that they missed something and it's only going to be worse next time.

** In a cupboard under the stairs there lived a wizard. A nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of spiders and a musty smell, a bare space filled with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat. It was a cupboard, and that means child abuse.

** Well, if GRRM wrote Harry Potter we would probably be still waiting for the ending, but at the same time, the books would probably be two or three times longer. I also think if GRRM wrote HP, the characters would be much more interesting and more complex, and there wouldn't be as many plot holes as we have currently(probably). And the world-building would be much more detailed than what we've got from JKR.

Also, much more death in the Weasley family.

  "Headmaster, I'm sending you sample of the brats blood, what do you make of this?"

  "Severus! This is astounding! Over 20 000 magicloriens!"

  "He is the child of the prophecy!"

  "That may be, but he is too old to be trained now ..."

  "He is 11 years old, like every other child in our world, what are you on about?"

  "No no, Severus, Sybill Trelawney was just here, she foresaw a dark future. Much anger is in that boy, anger leads to hate, hate leads to angst, we can't have that at our school! Board of Governors will never approve!"

  "Then I will train the boy myself. Without their approval if I must!"

This whole thing would be a great fanfic anyway. I love to see ones where Snape and/or McGonagall keep calling Dumbledore on his ridiculous pronouncements. One of the things that gets me the most, as an adult, is how everybody just goes along with whatever Dumbledore says when he gives no explanations or justifications at all.

** Pterry, you say...?

Ron would put a great deal of effort into being lazy, and somehow stumble into becoming a romantic lead in several Wizarding Wireless dramas, opposite Hermione. Their witty, UST-filled banter would be the stuff of legend throughout the wizarding world. They would initially be horrified at the thought, but eventually come to terms with it.

Neville would achieve top marks in his exams due to a convoluted set of mix-ups, and would end up building a mechanical arithmancy machine to try and balance the Hogwarts budget. Despite it being able to use theoretical mathematics, it would still fail due to Dumbledore's incredibly expensive custom pointy hat (with inbuilt tent, lemon sherbet reservoir, and miscellaneous) and random decision making (like deciding part of the first-year curriculum is a survival exercise in the forbidden forest).

Harry would have the same "luck" at getting into (and winning) crazy dangerous situations, though this time despite his best efforts to avoid them and sit quietly in the common room with a plate of mashed potatoes.

He would struggle to learn any magic, due to the spell lodged in his head after Voldemort's defeat. Eventually, he would be forced to cast the spell, which would reassemble Voldemort from his constituent horcruces. Voldemort would proceed to gloat at length, before being sucker-punched by a half-brick-in-a-sock.

Oh, and his trunk would have lots and lots and lots of little legs.
