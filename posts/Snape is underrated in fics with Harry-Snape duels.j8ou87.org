I know that many of you agree that Snape is a bastard who didn't love lily and other stuff, while many of you don't. However, one thing we can agree that he was an exceptionally talented wizard. As we have Seen in Deathly Hallows, Snape had a great deal of control on his magic. Making a flower bloom or fly. And doing other stuff. I won't say Harry didn't have control, but it was cruder or power-intensive magic. Like apparating, I won't say it wasn't smart, but again power intensive. Blowing up his aunt? Power intensive.

What I mean by power-intensive is that it wasn't conscious, but rather he used magic, or asked his magic to help him in an emergency.

Snape on the other hand could use his magic consciously in his childhood and without a wand.

Of course, as Snape aged he better understood the usage of Magic. Even if Harry was magically powerful than snape, he didn't have as good of a hold on his magic as Snape.

In a duel, Snape would think that Harry Couldn't win against him so of course, he would start lazily and arrogantly but when he would realize that Harry is more powerful than him, he would, of course, use his tactics. And I think we can all agree that using tactics is better than using brute strength.

And I think that Harry training hard for a few months and becoming equal to the likes of Dumbledore or Voldemort or Snape is a load of rubbish.

What are your views?


** In Canon, Snape just completely destroy Harry in HBP, and is pretty much equal with McGonagall in DH. He may not be at the level of Dumbledore or Voldemort, but he is just behind among other "Masters".

*** Exactly. But in fanon, any other characters apart from the main characters are always shown as dunger heads in magical capabilities mostly. I know it depends on the writer of the fic but it touches a nerve whenever I read it.

I think a duel between Snape and the golden trio would have been better and more dramatic but that wasn't bad. However I think what took place in HBP was not a fair fight. It wasn't even a fight. Snape was practically running away with his back on Harry and Harry was throwing spell after spell on him but Snape wasn't even touched or even tired after it all that!

** It's a pretty common trope, in all honesty. The protagonist is shown beating other characters that we're told are powerful to show how powerful the protagonist is. Star Trek did the same with Worf (the Klingon security officer). We kept getting told he was a strong, skilled warrior but he got beaten every other week to show how tough and strong the enemy was.

Personally, I prefer the more balanced approach. If Harry does go around beating these Aurors and Death Eaters and so on, it doesn't cause people to be amazed at his competency, but questioning the competency of the people he's fighting. A well trained auror or a lethal death eater should not be beaten in a head-on fight by a child without some hella exceptional circumstances kicking in.

** I don't think it's so much people underestimating Snape but rather overestimating Harry. Nobody is going to deny that Dumbledore is a skilled and powerful wizard, and yet we sometimes see incidents in fics where Harry can hold his own against him. In canon, he would be utterly trounched.

*** Harry would never even have a chance to draw his wand unless Dumbledore gave it to him.
