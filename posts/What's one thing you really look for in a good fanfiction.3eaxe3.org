** A good knowledge of canon and a logical cause-and-effect based deviation from the canon timeline.

I absolutely hate it when a fic starts with outlandish ideas that wildly deviate from the plot only to be forcefully railroaded back into the canon timeline even though that should no longer be realistic at this point.

If you change stuff then stuff changes!!

a few examples:

Harry is sorted into Ravenclaw instead of Gryffindor, but

- He still becomes the seeker of their house team in year 1. Even though the extraordinary events that led him to becoming Gryffindor's seeker should have become null and void now.

- He still notices Hermione's missing and seeks her out on Halloween. Even though as Ravenclaw he really shouldn't have.

- Every plot-event stays the exact same except he now has a new friend "Jon Beasley" who is also good at chess.

No! Just no!!

Take your premise and run with it! Don't just rehash the exact same scenes out of the blue!

** I'm gonna list general points:

- Realism in fights. None of this bullshit where he takes a million hits but doesn't go down once or dodges everything with no signs of exertion or tiredness. I hate OP characters like that.

- Dialogue that suits the characters of their age, personality and nationality. (I'm not so fussed about Americanisms, because I've read so many ones where they are prevalent) Or as close as you can get with it.

- Well written OCs - In other words, not just canon characters with a different appearance and name. Actual characters with different and new backstories, personalities and attitudes. If they're an OC replacing a canon character for whatever reason, then why not just use the canon character?

- Realistic development of a character. None of this random event/rituals making Harry effectively a god in every way.

*** I don't understand why you think well written OCs are bad. I think if anything a well written OC should be a hallmark of a great story. If they are replacing a canon character it is usually because the canon character has some quality that couldn't be axed to move the story along.

EX: having someone fill a similar role of Hermione, but then also doing considerably dark deeds.

Or perhaps to introduce a plot element later in the story that you can work into that OC's past. That isn't something you can adequately do with canon characters without causing problems.

I said that I look for well written OCs in a story, but if they're just a canon character with a different name/appearance that serves the same purpose as the original canon character then why not just use the original canon character?

I've read several fics that start off strong, and are clearly building up to /something/, but after a while they just seem to meander, letting characterization suffer in the process because the author has lost direction.

Believable dialogue. People don't always talk in an overly formal, technically correct manner, and stories in which they do make them sound forced and awkward, especially with characters like Ron.

I'm not picky about the "originality" of the topic; I read fanfiction to hear more about characters that I'm attached to or a continuation of a story I love, usually not to read a completely new story.

Oh- and I don't need to be reminded what characters look like every other paragraph. It's fine to be descriptive more than once, but going overboard can be quite annoying.

** - If you give Harry a lightsaber, you must give Voldemort a Death Star.

Or you turn it into a romance or something like that, where having the lightsaber isn't terribly relevant -- or even exists to minimize the conflict with Voldemort.

This applies to the political scene too. I couldn't get very far at all in Harry Crow because Harry was a political juggernaut, able to impose his will on Dumbledore just by threatening to leave Hogwarts.

- Everyone should be at least attempting to fulfil their accepted roles in a reasonable manner.

McGonagall, for instance, has an idea of how a deputy headmistress should act. If you are writing her well, you will have her act according to that idea.

Ron Weasley has an idea of how a good student should act, but that isn't really a role he accepted for himself. He tries a little, but only because others have expectations of him. This is still fine.

Canon Harry has no idea how a Champion of the Light and Only Hope Against the Dark Lord should act. He doesn't even care about the role. He barely lifts a finger to fulfil that role. I'd understand if he were confused and aggravated because of his confusion, but that didn't happen. This is not okay.

Its okay if your main character is clearly going to succeed, We know that already, but he still needs to overcome challenges. Having the character behave in a believable fashion is also really important. There should never be a point in a well written story where you are yelling at the character for being a moron.

** This is my personal view on what makes a fanfic good or not

1. First is the premise, I would say. Remember that FanFiction should first and foremost have some link to the Canon story. That means if you start throwing in God's, demons, ancient spirits of Morgana or Merlin, or otherwise invoke severe drastic changes that the overall atmosphere and setting of Harry Potter is completely unrecognisable, then it is basically an original story borrowing the names of some HP characters. I guess the biggest offender is HPMoR, which by halfway through the fic does not look even remotely like the original HP books. In short, if I can understand the story and it's appeal without having read the HP books, I would not call it HP fanfic at all

2. Length

First, if it is not a new story( i.e withing the last 6 months), I usually go for completed stories. Because an incomplete story is quite frankly more unacceptable than even some of the worst fanfic, because metaphorical blue balls can hurt. So that said, I would take a look at how long a fanfic is and use the description to gauge not only where in the books it veers off but also the duration. Next, I would compare it to the length of the Canon books. Remember that even the longest book in the HP series did not even break 300 thousand words. So if one spends that same number of words to rehash Year one, well it is clear that the fat needs to be trimmed. I would mostly aim for 150- 250k word fits because the good author has already laid a solid respectable foundation and there should not need to have long-winded references to how the fic departs from specific events.

1. Show, not tell

If I see the phrase "X knew that" or "X felt that" more than twice in a paragraph and now than 5 times in a single scene, my attention drops drastically because the author does not me hours to present the information in a most interesting way.
