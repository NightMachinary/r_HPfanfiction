Potential additional twist: Tom and the Author SI who switched bodies and places can still communicate in dreams to make sense of what's going on in each world and try to figure out how to reverse the switch.


** Does he have magic or not?

- *Y* = He Imperio's everyone he meets, tracks down JKR, and imprisons her in a basement until she re-writes the Cursed Child.

- *N* = He is confused about modern London, gets run over by a kid on a hoverboard, spending the rest of the story sitting in an NHS waiting room while a medical receptionist tries to find his national ID info. They fail, Tom ends up as a stateless citizen, and gets deported to a processing facility until they can figure out what to do with a guy who claims to have been born in an orphanage that was torn down in the 1960's.

*** Well generally in stories where people switch place

said person is in the body of tom riddle so tom would be in the body of said person as well

also in such stories, they sometimes inherit the persons memories and skills so depending on which version of the story it is

Tom riddle could grow to be a rather wealthy ceo or the founder of a cult

******** I feel like this would only happen if he was talking to certain people. It's not like his name is Ron Weasley or Hermione Granger, or Voldemort: most ordinary people he introduces himself to in the real world (by full name) aren't going to react that way. And the charming young Tom Riddle shows no signs of being interested in reading children's fiction: he'd write it off as nothing.

He'd need to hear some reference to Hogwarts, or maybe Dumbledore, to get him intrigued, and I think a fic writer would need to put some thought into how that would happen organically and realistically. It would then take him until deep into the second book to know that it had anything to do with him.

Not at all. I think you over-estimate both how many people remember the name ‘Tom Riddle' from either one of the movies or books, and how many people would give a fairly rude response to a relatively normal name even if they made the link (Tom Riddle is barely a step above Tom Brown). When you move in nerdy circles, it's easy to forget how much most people don't remember about the things they watch and read, and how much they don't go on about it.

Poster of Dumbledore (I have never seen such a thing) /with Dumbledore's name on it/ would be an easy way in. Much more natural would be some sarcastic reference to Hogwarts or Dumbledore.

************** Sure, and I said that if you move in non-nerdy circles you can forget (or fail to appreciate) how non-nerdy people tend to engage with the things they love. If they /actually/ obsess about it in the way nerdy people mean (watch it/read it again and again, learn all the details, learn everything about it) then they are not non-nerdy people, because that is what makes people nerds.

Non-nerdy people don't learn or remember all the little details, and they don't tie everything in their life into the details of their obsession. People who do that are nerds: that is what nerdy behaviour is.

If I met a Michael Corner, I would think “Haha, like Ginny's boyfriend” but I wouldn't /say/ that because it would be rude and non-nerds would consider it weird. Out of my students, I wouldn't even expect most of the ones who are actively currently reading the Harry Potter books to clock it. If I met a Ron Weasley, and he didn't acknowledge the name being famous, I might gently bring it up after I'd known him for a while, probably in the spirit of ‘must have been rough growing up'. I would expect that everyone he had ever told his name had recognised it as being from Harry Potter.

Tom Riddle is a name that falls between those. Unless our Tom is hanging out with children who are reading the books, or spending his time with the sort of people I just don't see him wanting to hang around with, I doubt anyone would bring up that his pretty ordinary name is the secret, rarely-used name of a villain that most people just know as Voldemort.

**************** In conversation /with who/? In what situation in Tom Riddle going to introduce himself and have someone go “lol like the real name of Voldemort”?

It isn't like Vader is Luke's Father: it just isn't as well-known as that. Think about the Vader bit again: people /still/ say the line wrong, although not as much as they used to. People don't remember the details, they remember the bits that get passed around as memes. There isn't really any special significance to Voldemort's name being Tom Riddle /in a way that would be memorable to someone who doesn't remember the full anagram, which uses his middle name/. There aren't really any memes in non-nerdy circles that use the name ‘Tom Riddle', in the way that the line “Luke, *I* am your father.” got endlessly repeated.

And people aren't generally so rude as to bring it up when it's relatively obscure and a normal name, unless they know you quite well.

????

Are you assuming the UK has some sort of national database that could be used to look someone up, maybe based on fingerprints or DNA or something? Blair wanted one, with the whole ID card plan, but it was scuppered because the public were so alarmed by the very idea.

If a confused man showed up at a hospital claiming to be from the past, I don't think they would decide his lack of ID meant he was a stateless citizen: they would treat him as a vulnerable and confused person in need of medical help.
