  All the furious parents sue Harry for getting their kids killed
#+end_quote

Ah yes, I can totally see the Longbottoms sue Harry. Or Hermione's parents taking him to magical court.

Let's be real here, there is nothing you could sue Harry for other than maybe endangerment, and even then it would most likely result in nothing since the location was not Harry's but the Ministry's and it was either Umbridge and/or the other Hogwarts teachers who failed their supervision responsibility.

That is not to say that Harry wouldn't kill himself out of guilt, but legally, there is nothing you can charge him with since it were the Death Eaters who killed them, not some faulty wiring in Harry's room.

**** Augusta Longbottom would learn her grandson went to help a friend fight Death Eaters, and was killed by the Death Eaters, I don't think she would blame Harry.

-

The Grangers might as well be fully obliviated over the whole thing if they start throwing up much of a fuss about it.

They can't sue them because they can't tell the mundane government about it, a no one would believe, and if they tried too much they would just be obliviated.

The one who would suffer for this would be Harry, crushed by overwhelming guilt. It would probably destroy him.

I doubt the Weasley's would blame Harry, they would probably blame Voldemort, they knew Ginny and especially Ron, would never, ever let him go alone. If anything they may blame Dumbledore, or the Ministry.

Bashing fics can really mess with one's perception of a character, eh?

"At least he had honour in death even if he lacked it in life" or something along those lines is honestly what I would expect. She'd be proud that her boy died fighting Death Eaters.

** Here's what I think would happen:

- Harry doesn't get any trouble (legal trouble, he would be a wreck mentally). He didn't force any of them to follow him, and even tried to stop them. Since he also just proved that he said the truth all along, the Ministry would probably use the "Hero" card and refuse to do anything against him.
- Umbridge is in bigger trouble that canon (and at least lose her position), but nothing else happen to the school. They were technically "occupied" by the Ministry and the ones that could be considered responsible for the Death of students were either banished by the Ministry or sent to Saint Mungos.\\
  If anything, the Ministry should be in bigger trouble since it's their intervention that lead to such a situation, and since they are currently in a war time, they would do their best to cover the whole affair.
- Xeno doesn't do anything. The Quibbler only has some credibility because they supported Harry against the Ministry. If they attack him the moment the rest of the country see the truth, they lose that and turn into a joke again. I also think that Xeno is more the kind to "give up" after the death of Luna. Either a quick suicide or a long death where he let himself go.
- I don't know what the Weasleys would do. Some of them would probably hate Harry (Percy, and maybe Bill and Charlie who are not that close to Harry), but I'm not so sure for the rest.\\
  I mean, yeah they died because they followed Harry, but they knew the risks. And it doesn't change the fact that Harry also saved the life of Arthur month before, not to mention Ginny's back in 2nd year. And Molly also consider Harry "as a son" (a sentiment probably shared by Arthur).\\
  If there is an estrangement between Harry and the Weasley, I see it more as Harry not being able to handle his grief than the Weasleys hating Harry.
- I also don't know what Mrs Longbottom would do. With her, there is 50% chance she goes bat shit crazy, and 50% she just says "at least, he died a hero just like his father". I still wouldn't try to either meet her if I was Harry, not doing any legal action doesn't mean she wouldn't hold a grudge. As for the Grangers, they would probably be completely ignored as "some Muggles".
- Finally, concerning the public view of Harry, I doubt it would change that much. Most of them only know Harry thanks to what they read in the Prophet, which is controlled by the Ministry.\\
  After the Battle of the DoM, the Ministry is forced to admit that Voldemort is back, and that Harry/ Dumbledore were right all along. It is also in a difficult situation because these deaths can all be traced back to their ingerence into Hogwarts, so attack against Harry would probably also hurt them.\\
  In such a situation, the best course of action for the Ministry as an organization is to push everything on Fudge and Umbridge, before distancing itself from them. Both of them would have a lot more troubles than in canon (at least losing their place in the government, maybe even a trip to Azkaban), but Harry's image would not change that much. If anything, his dead friends would be presented as martyr which would elevate his position even more for the rest of them.

** In a way, that's what should have happened.

If he doesn't kill himself or in a suicidal way immediately, I can definitely see him going mad and all out for revenge.

When he eventually learns that he's last the Horcrux, he will not offer himself up for execution, but will strap himself with enough Muggle bombs and magical explosives before challenging Voldemort for a duel. Then he blows everything into smithereens within a 500 meter radius.

Once in after life, he says his mission was accomplished and sorry to his friends. They all forgive him and go on happily together into their afterlives.

Meanwhile in Britain, Dumbledore still lives, and if he has learnt any lessons (which I hope), he will finally stop manipulating his (Ex) students to do his dirty work and take the lead himself. He can use the last decade of his life to thoroughly *cleanse* Wizarding Britain from all remaining Death Eater filth.

** Harry was quite a strong character. Despite of all the pre-HBP fics, Harry did not turn into an angsty kid. Hell, he even forgave Kreacher whom he held directly responsible for SIrius's death. And I think that's not really forced. I know people irl who killed dear ones sitting on the right because they were reckless drivers and they moved on eventually. So I think Harry would not have committed suicide. Also Neville had no parents, the Weasleys were quite understanding (see Fred's death), Hermione's parents had no clue what was going on. I don't know how Xeno would have reacted, but assuming that he tried to bribe the Death Eaters with a copy of Ravenclaw's diadem or with a horn of the Crumpled-Horn Snorkcack to find about Luna, I don't think he would have sued either. Everything else is likely, and that's what should have happened were they not protected by plot armor.

**** I think suing is out of character for the culture - we don't see any other mention of it in the books (despite there being plenty of opportunities). It sounds a bit too American for me.

I mean, it's fanfiction so you can add suing if you like, of course, but I don't think it fits with canon.

I can't imagine how broken Harry would be if all his friends died, but I don't think the world would turn on him if they knew Voldemort was back and 5 out of 6 kids died fighting Death Eaters. I know the "wizarding world" in general is quite flighty, but (most of) the Weasleys, Sirius if he survives, the OotP and the usual Hogwarts staff would rally around Harry. It'd be interesting to see what new friendships Harry would make...

** Yes realistically with no plot armor and no kid's series they all would've been tortured and even killed by the Death Eaters in that fight! That's why when I write the DOM battle if I have to, I make them at least take serious damages, like missing eyes and arms and legs, or at least one ending up like the Longbottoms in St. Mungo's. Sometimes I kill one or two, too.

**** You need to remember the hardened criminals weren't there to kill them, they were there to /capture/ them, and received orders to absolutely not kill Harry.

Most of them were also just out of prison and a bit crazy. And Lucius, is well, not said to be especially good, the only ones there who are said to be very skilled are Bellatrix and I think Dolohov.

The Basilisk was okay for me because Harry had the help of one of the most OP magical creatures in the series, Fawkes, who's not only immune to a Basilisk's stare, but also strong and fast enough to blind it.

Harry then spends a lot of time running and trying to fool a snake that arguably, always used it's eyes for guidance, so it's believable it would take some time to adapt(it also must have been in pain).

He then slashed it a bit, and only wins because the snake tries to swallow him whole while he has a magical sword, he just thrusts back and let's the snake do the rest.

I mean, it was blind, and I guess it hadn't actually fought anyone in a thousand years, and it had just lost it's biggest weapon. The hard to believe part is Harry not having a full on panic attack, but that's kind of part of his character.

And maybe be gentle meant not to go overboard, remember they did try to convince him with hostages, so they figured if his friends were hurt he would just smash the thing and then Voldemort would be furious. And most of them survived through sheer luck, I mean Hermione only managed to barely fight Dolohov because she used a silencing spell on him.
