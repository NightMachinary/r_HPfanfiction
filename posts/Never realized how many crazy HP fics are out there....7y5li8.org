Ok, I admit that I do have my share of sexual fetish and cliched ideas...but good Buddha, there are so many crazy and borderline insane HP fanfics I just found in this forum. I now understand why # of review doesn't always indicate qualities...


** When I think of fandoms that scare me usually Supernatural comes to mind first, but Harry Potter has some seriously dark corners. I guess with such a massive fanbase it's impossible to avoid. I usually filter my searches by kudos on Ao3, or I find authors I like and go through their bookmarks.

That said I love going through the tags and seeing what fresh ridiculousness has been uploaded. I wish there was like an anti-rec list of bizzare HP fic.

  Instead of making new friends on the Hogwarts Express in 1995, Luna loses the only one she has. In the lonely year that follows, she discovers just how well the name 'Loony Lovegood' fits her. Insane!Luna. Very dark.

**** Don't, for the love of your sanity, ever study real human history.

Taken collectively, there is a /lot/ wrong with people. Although, thankfully, taken collectively, we're remarkably loving toward one another as a species. But there's nothing so outrageous that if it's possible without magic, it is implausible for humans to ever do to one another.

Thankfully, most of that style of fic is just enjoying how screwed up it actually is, to thrill at the dark side of humanity from a safe place. But humanity's dark side, in real life, is /very/ dark.

** I am guilty of writing these fics. I just think there's something fun about taking a series and characters I love and putting them in absurd situations. Mine are always firmly humorous, though. I was the only Voldemort/Filch story for years on FF.net just to be a fic in that genre.

***** What message? That the DLP cabal has hijacked the sub? Lol. We have /maybe/ a few hundred members who are regularly active. Top 30 posters made more than 10% of total posts on DLP. We don't have a brigading army big enough to swarm a reddit sub.

And of course DLP people on this sub are gonna downvote you, because you're full of shit.
