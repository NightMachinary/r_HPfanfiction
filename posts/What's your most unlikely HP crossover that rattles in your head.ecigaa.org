Mine's pretty simple- HP x Code Geass. I imagine Lelouch being reborn into Harry's body. Now that's the simple part the harder one is how would war veteran and an irregular world tyrant will deal with a Dark Lord that can't be killed (he doesn't know about horcruxes). Lelouch clearly wasn't Gryffindor, but a Slytheryn so our ostencible Harry would likely go into a snake pit and they would likely start eating from his hands in about a week. I mean really it would be an OP political Harry- as in OP in politics and tactics, not in power. Not Harry Gryffindor Slytheryn Prevell Babdoomdoom Potter. Simple Harry Potter with a small trust fund a celebrity status and living in Slytheryn. Now Snape would likely be antagonistic, but not insanely so. Simple dislike for a kid that's just too charismatic and maybe some suspition that he uses legitemancy. Albus on the other hand has clear two way to go: now obvious suspitious Dumbledore that sees Tom Riddle in him (boo), or straight-forward Dumbledore that see Tom Riddle in him, but also see where he fucked up on that one (yay).

Thanks for reading and please share some of your rattlings.

P.S. not an English speaker so sorry for fuck ups in language.


** Honestly, might sound a bit eh but... Disney crossovers. I like remembering that Rowling books for me were a grand part whimsical and darker themes underneath. That's very much present in Disney movies, though shown differently.

HP Frozen crossover, a good well written one... Now that's the shit I might pay for.

MP plays Mr Banks like a true Slytherin. She is also just about the right age to have gone to school with Albus, or his brother "Bert".

*** Pff that's easy watch.

Harry, 8 years old, gets new neighbours. It's Nero Kyrie and Nico. They are moving in because they are expecting some business to pop up in London. Meanwhile Dante and Vergil are kicking all kinds of ass in Hell. So much ass in fact that demons are fleeing Hell and are appearing all over the place. London mostly for some reason

Nero and Harry (Who has been told by Nero he's a wizard) go down into hell and kindly ask Dante and Vergil to stop kicking so much ass.

Bored with hell anyway they decide to join them back into the human world where they go into family counselling because they've got some shit to deal with.

(So then my deadbeat dad tore my arm off and stabbed himself with it to separate himself from humanity. "And how did that make you feel?" Sort of stuff)

They find out that Harry as shit guardians. They kick the door down and wave guns in faces. This would be a good time to introduce lady, she becomes Harry's new mom.

Because life is all hunky dory now Kyrie gets preggars and Vergil grows a moustache 'cause he's grandad now.

Meanwhile Dante teaches Harry how to use a sword, because he's just awesome like that and gives him some demonic wand he picked up from his many forays in Hell.

Hey just like that 3 years pass and it's time for Hogwarts. Harry swaggers onto platform 9.75 where he soon will be known as wacky whoohoo pizza boy.

** Is this an inappropriate place for self promotion? Because I literally just published my first legit fanfic 4 hours ago which is a crossover. It's very much early days for the fic though.

If it is, just downvote and I'll remove the comment.

** Forthwith16 actually started a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3196486/Forthwith16][Code Geass crossover with that exact premise]] recently. Two of the three chapters posted focus on Kallen in Hermione's body, but it is an excellent start.

With that said I /so/ want a good Derry Girls/Harry Potter crossover, because that can only result in absolute hilarity. Even something as simple as replacing James Maguire with Harry and adding a bit of magic has so much promise.

** What I basically want is the ultimate cross-over, and it's something that I've been daydreaming about for quite some time now.\\
It's a mixture between Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Doctor Who, Sherlock, Outlander, the OA and the Marvel Universe. Perhaps even a bit of Lucifer, The Crown and Black Sails thrown into the mix. All of it made possible because of the exitence of Doctor Who, making all universes plausible while I use the Harry Potter universe as my main base.\\
I'm very close to finishing up my longfic so I think it's time to start giving this idea a more thorough brainstorm session.

*** this might sound mean

but honestly too many franchises at once and it gets a bit messy even more so with power scaling how would you justify the people from black sails keeping up

I feel it would honestly be fucking horrific to write and balance all the charcters make them contribute to the plot

Unless you where doing a travel story, where harry spent time in each of the worlds before being whisked to the next which would allow you focus each segment on the core charcters of franchise

**** No you are absolutely right. I know those are far too many and I'd have to go through some process of elimination in order for it to work. The initial idea started with combining just HP, Sherlock and LOTR, which are some of the biggest fandoms out there anyway (although Sherlock had dimmed down quite a bit.)\\
Just the very idea of it working though...it would be really cool if it did.

*** I think this could be cool, but you should write it in a way where readers aren't required to be familiar with all of these fandoms/universes otherwise the audience will be too small.

On the other hand it's a passion project so might as well go all out even if not many people get to appreciate it.
