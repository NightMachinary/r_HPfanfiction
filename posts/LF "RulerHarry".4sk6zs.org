I'm looking for stories where Harry ends up ruling over/leading an island/nation/whatever (or dealing with similar issues on behalf of the actual ruler).

Unfortunately, they're rarely any good. They're usually (badly-done) harem stories, 'politics' seems to consist of threatening people and making outlandish statements, and the character development is often dubious.

I know a variety of those stories have been mentioned on here before, but the search terms I'm using don't seem to be bringing them up.

I've read and mostly enjoyed Emperor (Marquis Black), The Queen Who Fell to Earth (Bobmin356), Resistance of Azkaban (Shezza88) - probably (I can't actually remember much of it).

I can just about manage Lord of Caer Azkaban (Rorsach's Blot) and Muggle Summer, Wizard's Fall (Canoncansodoff) - though the last qualifies more on technicalities than anything else.

I tried and couldn't finish Hero, Villain, Saviour, Conqueror (Lady Smoothie), Earl of the North (Lord Silvere) and Child of the Storm (Nimbus Llewelyn).

I've read others, but they were either so awful or so bland I've forgotten them.

I'll read anything if it's good, including the aforementioned huge harems, though slash has to significantly better than an equivalent het fic for me to keep reading it.

Thanks.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire.]] Mild crossover with another series, but you don't really need to know anything about it (I certainly didn't). It's less a story and more a broad outline of events through a multitude of different perspectives, but it fits what you're looking for pretty well.

** Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution) not too much Hermione and plenty of Ruler!Harry.

Edit: My bad, apparently this doesn't fit the bill. I haven't read it in ages though.

I don't think I agree with that. Harry is one of several protagonists, and overall is 'in scene', so to speak, for well under half the story - and whenever he is, Hermione usually is as well. The story is more about taking power than using it iirc. As soon as an area has been seized, the plot moves to a new set of characters elsewhere who are also trying to depose the current rulers and replace them. I don't remember exactly, but while it technically has ruler!Harry, that's not the main focus of the story.

[[/u/Starfox5]]'s input would probably be useful.

*** I thought it's just the opposite: Hermione was clearly running the show in this fic, Harry basically played a supporting role, while Ron led troops in the field.

*** Hermione is the Minister for Magic, Harry's the Chief Warlock, though they work as a team. The politics are mostly discussed between them, and after chapter 10 or so, deal with the war strategy. There are a few speeches and meetings with the Prime Minister, but "Ruler Harry" wouldn't be the first thing I would think of. It's a story about toppling feudal regimes.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
