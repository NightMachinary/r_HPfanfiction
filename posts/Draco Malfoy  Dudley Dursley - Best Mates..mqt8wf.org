In which Draco met Dudley in the muggle world for whatever reason and they got along famously.

Bonus if Lucius and Vernon make a business deal.

I can see Draco saying "You're not too bad, for a muggle."


** Isn't Dudley the perfect example of the way bigots like Malfoy consider Muggles to be though?

** Linkao3(Harry Potter totally sucks)

This one is hilarious. It's Drarry, but it happens at the very end. There might be a kiss, but that's it.

  Draco Malfoy has three excellent reasons to get sloshed- a father who won't accept him, a Harry Potter he can't stop crushing on and that damned hippogriff that tried to eat him. And he is going to tell them what's what, because clearly that is a good idea. Fortunately, his new muggle friend seems to have a beef with Potter too.
