** In the Duelling Club, Draco Malfoy cast "Leosortia" at Harry Potter. The lion roared , "What the fuck is going on here?" Harry replied, pointing at Snape and Malfoy, "These idiots brought you here." The lion pounced on Snape and crushed his windpipe before he could take out his wand. His last words were reported to be Sectu- something. Draco Malfoy whimpered, "My father will hear abo-" when the lion who found Snape too oily for its liking, turned its attention to Malfoy and crushed his spinal cord with a bite and started feasting on it. The Gryffindors were torn between disgust over a student being eaten, and elation over the said student's identity. Harry Potter was deemed the Heir of Gryffindor and the Chamber of Secrets was never opened again as the diary was trying to figure out as to how can someone speak to lions while quietly draining Ginny's life. The diary gets his body of his own and traps a wayward wraith in Albania, takes all of his memories and traps the said wraith in the Diary. Lord Voldemort has returned as a sixteen year old.
