A pretty depressing story, to be honest.

** Harry Potter and the Summer After the War and its sequel Harry Potter and the Winters After the War are so far the best fanfics I've read that are canon compliant.

I'll also recommend looking at anything from little0bird and Northumbrian on fanfiction.net

*** I can't upvote Summer After the War and Winters After the War enough. Simply brilliant!
