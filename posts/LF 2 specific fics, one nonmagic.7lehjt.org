So, a while ago I read a story where harry was a gamer.

He lived with Lily and James but Sirius and Remus were over all the time.

He is a high school student.

He enters a gaming competition and meets Tom Riddle, an experienced gamer, who offers to help Harry get to the nationals of the competition as a member of his team.

It was a HP/TMR fic but I don't think anything had happened between them other than sparks.

The other one is a magic fic where harry is the reincarnation of one of the founders, Salazar, I think, and finds out he is descended from both


** The first one sounds like something from RenderedReversed. She's written one very similar fic, but it isn't exactly the same, linkffn(8366987). Perhaps it's another one by her: linkffn(10502800). I'm not sure about the second link, because I haven't read it yet. From the summary it sounds very similar to The Game, so it could be this one.

  !MAJOR NON-MAGIC AU! VolDeMort, an infamously vicious PvPer. Scarred, a ridiculously lucky warrior. HBPrince, their unfortunate priest (sage, but really, who's keeping track?). Together, they're the smallest of the top 10 teams on CoS Online, and probably the most dysfunctional as well... Eventual TMR/HP SLASH, pairings inside.

  !VRgameAU! Voldemort was supposed to be the bored necromancer with a slightly creepy obsession with the undead. Scarred was just supposed to be a berserker, but things never work out that way. For one, he's not a berserker. He's a bishop. For two, he's the renegade High Priest of Gryffindor. For three, well... let's just say Voldemort's obsession isn't on the undead anymore. TMR/HP
