He can be whatever color you want him to be


** Interesting concept. Sirius' death could be traumatic enough to ignite a planeswalker spark in Harry, though by description it would probably happen in the moment, not while asleep. Ignitions usually happen in painful, emotional, powerful moments that are, in general, shitty enough for a person to literally RIP themselves out of their plane and fling themselves into the multiverse. Not so much of a in your sleep occurence.

Harry attempting to deal with Sirius' death and not being on his home plane anymore/unintentionally abandoning his friends while adapting to a new plane could make for a very fun read. Could play well as a two part story. One of an adventure on another plane and then part two being a fully realized planeswalker Harry returning to Earth with allies to lay the smack down on Voldemort.

Also, Fifth year Harry, dealing with Dumbledore all year, the dreams, the occlumency lessons with Snape, and then Sirius' death would almost certainly be a red or red white planeswalker. This is the Harry that not 15 minutes later would attempt to curcio Bellatrix

*** One of the funniest ideas i thought of would be him waking up in a new place and just assuming its Americas magical world only for someone to look at him like "the fucks an America"

**** Easy enough to just have him black out immediately after his first planeswalk and then wake up. Could work pretty well

***** God damn Jace and his eternally wiping mind. I stopped with Magic for a couple of years and when I came back and checked on what was going on, what do I see? Jace has had his God damned mind wiped again. That and they killed off Elspeth, which isnt cool.

*** A planeswalker is a card type in magic the gathering. In universe they are extremely powerful people or beings with the ability to travel to any "plane" or universe they want to using methods ranging from teleporting or other means like being able to explode through the planes like Chandra does, or ripping portals between dimensions etc.
