I see many fics portraying Tom Riddle as ruling his group of peers in school with an iron fist and they are genuinely scared of him but I often think that that's not realistic. I mean he still slept in the same dorm as a bunch of kids who thought of themselves as having a superior status to him. If he would have been with them such a shithead as most fics depict him, what would have prevented all the other students, at least the ones who were in his inner circle, to turn their wands on him? I am talking from the perspective of someone who was in high school in a group that was fairly 'popular' and was sort of lead by a guy who could be a bit of a bully towards outsiders, but in the group he was really charming and charismatic and was always sticking out for you. We followed him around because he could throw some of the coolest parties and get some of the prettiest girls, but no one was really scared to challenge him if he stepped out of line. We followed him because we respected him and not because we were scared that he could beat us up (maybe not I, but I did have a few other friends in the group who could have easily kicked his ass).

So I am wondering, before Voldemort started showing his tyrannical tendencies, how do you think he was in his early days? I think he would have been quite charming or otherwise he would have just scared away potential followers. Also, while I think a lot of his peers liked him, he was definitely not as revered by them as by the Death Eaters. We know the Blacks backed out when they saw he was a terrorist and they were in the same generation. Also it's my headcanon but I don't think Abraxas ever joined him given that Slughorn remembers him fondly and he doesn't like Death Eaters. Finally, I think we get a biased view of him from Dumbledore. Voldemort, while interviewing for the DADA position does refer to the Death Eaters as his friends. We never really see things from his perspective except when Harry looks into his mind but those don't say much since it's usually when he is very angry.

Anyways, what are your thoughts? Also if you think that Tom Riddle was indeed such a dick to his friends, do you happen to know any good fics which focus on how he recruited the first members of his gang?


** Unfortunately no recommendations, as I don't read many Riddle-era fanfiction, but I think you're right. I always imagined him to be a sort of charismatic, good leader esque boy who people were drawn to. I'd imagine that's how he attracted the first round of death eaters, before they became fanatical. This is really interesting food for thought though, because now I'm wondering how things devolved from charismatic leader to megalomaniac, and how the death eaters became as we know them in canon. I'm sorry, I don't think I really answered any questions - it's just really interesting to think about! ðŸ˜…

*** I see what you are saying... I think for most of us it's really difficult to write a charismatic leader since many of us aren't charismatic leaders. It's easier to write a tyrant because deep down we all think of all the bad things we would do to those who piss us off. I think even Voldemort was intended initially to be the evil antagonist in a children's book who happened to have some servants. However, I like how Grindelwald was written. If you are on his side, he is a really likable person but he won't hesitate to kill you if you stand in his way. I'm a bit sad that Johnny Depp was fired because he really did a great job at that rally in the Lestrange Mausoleum.

**** I agree! I loved Grindelwald's characterization, and I'm disappointed about that as well. I suppose on some level my theory may just be because I happen to like intelligent charismatic villains in fiction, and trying to paint my preference on a time period we don't know much about in Potter lore

***** The thing is there are few fics about Voldemort in his early years of school. Regardless of whether it's time travel or not, most of them start in his fifth year when he opened the Chamber of Secrets and by which time he already had a following. It's either that writers are too lazy or because such a process is hard to write (I'll be the first to admit I'm struggling with it) but no one focuses on how he got people who think they're superior to him to follow him. I wrote the other day a comment about having read a story in which Tom Riddle seduces, manipulates and eventually rapes a professor who is also the wife of the first muggle-born head of the DMLE and then uses it to blackmail him to resign. I can't remember for the life of me the name of the story. However it's one of the few stories that depict him really charming and pleasant at first and gradually he becomes more and more abusive (and I think that's the most consistent depiction of Tom Riddle).

****** A super quick cop out would be him revealing that he is a Parselmouth and the Slytherins knowing what that means. But the charming, blackmail type is probably a lot more realistic. I've dabbled with writing in the past, but I don't think I'd be able to do a Voldemort coming of age justice in the slightest. I'd suppose most writers feel the same way. That depiction I think is the most accurate, or logical. I do think speaking Parseltongue and descending from Slytherin would play a role, but short of the Indy!Harry Goblin blood test trope I have no idea how a young teen Ridde would discover that. Or potentially a Slytherin family tree similar to the Blacks?

** No, he needed to gain a following somehow.
