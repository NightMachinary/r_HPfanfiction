  Lily Evans has spent years despising James Potter. He has spent just as long worshiping her. When seventh year pairs them Head Boy and Girl, each comes to realize that their judgment isn't quite what they thought it was. This is the same story that was over on Checkmated, but I completed it here. Prequel to Heroes for Ghosts. Warning: this story is a strong M rating.

I hope I linked that right, it's Hermione's Furry Little Problem. It's a good story, with a lot of fluff, a lot of smut but with a very intense storyline overall anyway. It does end up with a large multiway relationship, but it's not Harry/Harem due to the relationship between all the girls involved being just as developed if not more.

Does get dark at times but I think it's well worth the read and the dark themes are handled tastefully in my opinion.

**** Yeh I'm not sure if I did it wrong or something. But a quick google of the title easily finds it :) It's on Archive of our own, and I think the author is GandalfsBeard

***** E-rated usually means "Everyone" which means "even kids can read this". I guess where you're from the ratings are a bit different :P

****** In fanfiction, different sites have different rating systems.

None of them use E to mean Everyone.

On FFN it's K, K+, T, and M. IIRC anyways, I don't really pay attention to ratings.

On AO3 E means Explicit. I also don't pay attention to ratings on AO3, and I'm far less familiar with it so I'm not even going to try to list them. Afaik, Explicit is basically a smut tag all it's own. Could be wrong, though, gore/violence and very serious topics could also warrant an Explicit rating. Not sure if it's just for porn or what.

I actually don't know of anything that uses E aside from the ESRB, and they only do videogames. Maybe your country is different, though? I'm actually not even aware of a rating system for books here.
