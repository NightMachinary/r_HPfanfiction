Is there is a fanfiction where the fact that Harry was raised in the muggle world close definitely some doors ? For exemple the heir and lordship rings refuse him and consider him unworthy of his lineage. For example he lose definitively his Wizengamot seat(s) and vaults related to his lineage. His kids barred from the Vaults and entitlements. Impossibility to hold a job in the Ministry of Magic that isn't the Centaur Liaison Office or other degrading post. Dumbledore can consider it a sacrifice for the greater good and towards Muggleborns. I am sick of all those fanfics where after the OWLs or similar he can be a Lord and seat within the Wizengamot without being raised in the wizarding world and trained from birth to those positions.


** Not quite the same, but linkffn(The Intricacies of Magical Etiquette by MayorHaggar) has Harry unable to accomplish anything in the Wizengamot until he gets coaching.

There's another story whose name I can't recall in which the Potters had a blood feud with the Weasleys that Harry didn't know about. At some point, Neville tells him that he never told Harry about it because he thought Harry was rethinking/reworking the Potter family alliances.

I think I remember another story in which Harry suffers (politically) after graduation because he never made friends or developed relationships with anyone other than Hermione and the Weasleys.

  When Harry needs Daphne to tutor him so he won't make a fool of himself in the Wizengamot, she suggests a very unique method of compensation.

**** 1. A little outside the criteria and even a little cliche with Daphne, the girl used by authors when lordship exist and want to go the easy neutral road.
2. It is a little outside but much inside that outside, a yes Neville assuming, they all assume that he knows and yet they have eyes to see that his stature is not of someone raised to be a Lord.

** I can't remember any details, but I know I read a fic once where Harry was adopted, and magic considered that you have forsaken his blood right, which made him weaker magically.
