Or a self-raising Harry that is not the typical homeless one, one that starts early learning about the WW. Even Wilding Harry (I read about mostly feral Harry believing he is a forest elf and that was awesome). Anything like that?


** If you liked /Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them/, you might like linkffn(To the Waters and the Wild). Also, closer to your request and also very awesome, linkffn(Escapologist Harry).
