i especially want to know for those of you who have "out there" or silver trio or 'smaller' OTPs - Drinny, Nuna, Georgina, whatever raise your hands! and you too, canon OTPers. mine is Dramione and the hands down option is 'Isolation' by Bex-Chan. The next, I have to say is 'Heavy Lies the Crown' by luckie1.


** My alltime otp, although not one that is seen very often, is GeorgexLuna... And the fic, hands down, is Love and Leviety.

*** Because Luna is insanely difficult to write well as is, let alone as a romance lead. You have to keep Luna Luna (genuinely unhinged to a certain extent) without simultaneously making it seem like Harry is just taking advantage of her. "Scam" Luna doesn't count. It /can/ be done well, but it's cheating.

**** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3205163/][Arpad Hrunta]] wrote a really adorable fluffy one, and a more serious sequel, both set in fifth year. Titled /Protection from Nargles/ and /Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor/ respectively.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6862426/1/][/The Quidditch World Cup/]] by TheEndless7 is a great story, although I haven't read it in a while. It's set after the Deathly Hallows, but the epilogue is disregarded. I'm not sure if I can do it justice in a summery, just read a chapter and you'll be hooked.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371934/1/][/All The Dementors of Azkaban/]] by LifeWriter is hilarious. Luna get's sent to Azkaban, so Harry sets up camp outside her cell. It's purely humor, but well worth reading.

There are others, but I especially like the first two because they portray Luna in a believable way, rather than trying to justify her oddness by making her an all-knowing seer, or a descendant of some Egyptian goddess or something. And the third because it's just so funny!

** For Dramoine my defining fic would be a tie between [[http://dhr.accio.nu/rec/id:484][Parade of the Sun]] by Everythursday aka Sage ... or The Bracelet by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1353450/AkashaTheKitty][AkashaTheKitty]]

Basketcase by attica would be a close second behind those 2.

Also a fan of Hermione/Severus but there is way more available of good quality fics for that and it is very hard to make up one's mind.... probably [[http://mirrordance.net/aashby/bnw/ChaosIndex.htm][Chaos Is Come Again]]

** I love anything Remus related. I sometimes dabble into Sirius or Severus fics too.

Picking a favourite is difficult. I've been reading and rereading for years and it can depend on the mood.

/Here's a quick off the top of my head list/

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6966600/1/A-Little-Flip][A Little Flip]] In this story HG goes back in time to protect LP because a death eater has traveled back in time to kill her before HP can be born. It's quite well written and I like the portral of RL in it.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4407394/1/A-Murder-of-Crows][A Murder of Crows]] In this story SS is in a kind of coma rather then dead, but is never expected to wake up.HG has become the potions master of Hogwarts after running away from a company she hadn't known was run by LM. She accidentally almost helped create a way to rid the world of muggleborns and it's haunting her. - While the story sounds mad, this is very well written and remains true to character throughout. I really like it. I think there is a bit of a strange portrayl of DM. but it's still ok.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4390076/1/Dating-Remus-Lupin][Dating Remus Lupin]] Is the first slash I ever read. I had no idea what to expect but I love the authors depiction of the characters even though they might not be truly cannon I particularly love RL in this story. It's hilariously written. I felt weird reading slash at firsy, but [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/866426/Children-of-the-Shadows][Children of the Shadows]] changed that pretty quick and *she's now probably my favourite author.* A lot of Remus fans love [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857261/1/Momentum][Momentum]] by her. It's fairly epic and long and has some memorable scenes. But I just really like how every dipiction of the characters is so well established but different in each of her stories.

FYI- all the above stories are rated M

** I don't really have a "one-true-pairing" but I recently recommended [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/os7ng/tonksremus_fan_fiction_consequences/][Consequences]], which is Tonks/Remus with a history between Tonks/Charlie. It's a great story, even if you're not into the pairing. It's very well-written adult story and shows a deeper look into the life of an Auror.

** Harry/Hermione and Harry Potter and the Last Horcrux... Probably, even though it isn't focused on romance that much. I love H/HR pairing, yet I can't find many /good/ fics. For example, I have read a few H/HR stories from robst recently, and while they're decently written, the romance parts are absolutely unsatisfying. They basically become soul bonded in the first chapter or two, and engaged soon after. Afterwards they swear true love to each other all the time and so on. Even weirder that in one story that happened when they were 11 or 12 years old.

*** Aside from Methods of Rationality in the past I read a ton of H/Hr stuff. If I can find anything in my favorites that is still good I'll edit this and link you if you want. ^{_^}

Can't think of one fanfic that set it in stone for me. Just a lot of good stories plus the fan essays arguing why they thought things would happen a certain way set in stone my OTPs.

***** BC is a great one. Now I'm not sure if you are looking for something really serious or not... and man looking at my fanfic history makes me feel old. Anyway! I'll suggest some stories that may not have been SUPER popular, but I liked then enough at the time to add them to favorites... hopefully my tastes back then weren't too terrible.

*** While I was never a huge Harry/Hermione fan, Paradigm of Uncertainty is one of my all time favorite stories, not even just fan fiction. [[Http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ParadigmOfUncertainty/]] This is the yahoo group to all of the stories in that universe. In a few ways I prefer this story to how post GoF canon worked out.
