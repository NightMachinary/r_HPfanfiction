As the title says. A fic where they work together towards any goal but without slash. On background i have no problem with slash, i just don't want to read a HP/LV love story (the thought of it actually makes me cringe).

Thanks in advance.

The Unwinding Golden Thread is a unique time travel fic. It uses the normal 'time traveling Harry gets sorted into Slytherin with Tom Riddle' idea, but it sends the story in a direction I was not expecting.

  In his fifth year Tom Riddle discovers his destiny and meets the cold, alarming, and bizarre transfer student Harry Evans. But sometimes things unravel in ways we do not expect. Time Travel.

The worldbuilding is fantastic. Great mystery plot. Fights are pretty good too, IIRC.

  Part 1 of 'The Wandering Devil'. Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. Harry and Voldemort took oaths to end their long and bloody war. Over a century later, a convoluted plot forces the two (slightly out of practice) immortals into an adventure together.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux)

Harry's Horcrux befriends him and teaches him dark magic. Harry works together with him, not main Voldemort.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Well there's a fic called Pygmalion (idk the author or the link) on FF.net which is basically Tom travels through time and lands in 1997 and forms a very strong bond with Harry and Hermione and a lot of others. It's Hermione x TR but it's really good.

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.
