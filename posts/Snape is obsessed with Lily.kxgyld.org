Just a quick thought. Why does everyone think of Snape as obsessed with Lily? People love someone who died all the time. He wasn't so obsessed he refused to ever anger her. He did his own thing. He swore to protect her child because he saw Lily's death as /his fault/. Regardless of how he treated Harry. I just can't see it, so if someone could explain that would be nice.


** I think it has a lot to do with his patronus and the fact that he refused to move on and kept carrying it with him.

That and the "Look at me" to Harry as he died.

The "Even after all this time?" "Always" bit doesn't help him much either.

I think the most damning evidence towards the obsessive love bit is with his actions slightly prior to her death, after her death ( if you put stock in what the movies portrayed ) and when he goes to Grimmauld Place.

His feelings towards her weren't healthy and his actions were concerning as well. He was obsessive because he refused to let go of her even after she was married and with child. He only sought to protect her. He didn't care for her husband or child. His only priority was her.

If you loved someone and they were with someone else, as much as it hurt you, you'd tend to care about their feelings and respect it too, he disregarded it.

His memories in Grimmauld place, where he tears the photo of lily with her son and husband, keeping only her part, and tearing the part of the letter with her love and signature, also show cases that he really didn't care about the sanctity of anything or anyone else.

It was always about him and Lily for him.

So I suppose that's why people imagine him to be obsessed with her.

I vaguely recollect some writing of JKR regarding Patronii and how obsessive and unhealthy behaviour tends to shape the corporeal patronus into a particular animal, but I can't recollect it fully or cite it. You might have come across it at some point maybe.

*** Yeah he never loves Lily just the idea of her, if he truly loved her he would never treat her son like shit.

it doesn't matter what any one says I will always believe Lily never forgives Snape in the afterlife for being the one responsible for their deaths and for the way he treated Harry there should be no forgiveness for that, and at the time of Lily's death they have not been friends for around 6 years

**** Probably because in real life that behaviour results in a restraining order and a case for harassment, stalking etc.

If a person says they want nothing to do with you, and you still keep following them around or troubling them or keeping tabs on them, it isn't romantic. More unsettling and worrying rather.

** Healthy people get grip of themselves after death of their beloved. I am not saying he has to move on, he may decide that Lily was the only girl for him and he would stay single for the rest of his life, but he should get his act together. Person, who after eleven years is still so mentally unstable, that he hates the son of his rival, is just unhealthy, and it seems his love was not the true love, but an obsession.

** He defected from a terrorist group solely because he endangered her, specifically, and he spent the rest of his life fighting against Voldemort /just/ to protect her son. He says it outright, immediately before getting angry at Dumbledore for asking if he cares about Harry, and implicitly stating that what he's doing, he's doing, to his mind, for Lily.

#+begin_quote
  "You have used me."

  "Meaning?"

  "I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter's son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter-"

  "But this is touching, Severus," said Dumbledore seriously. "Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?"

  "For /him?/ shouted Snape. "/Expecto Patronum!/"

  From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe: She landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.

  "After all this time?"

  "Always," said Snape.
#+end_quote

I can think of no other word for a man who outright dedicated his life to a woman with whom he hadn't been friends, or even had a meaningful conversation, since they were sixteen and in the equivalent their sophomore year of high school, than "obsessed."

(Also, he ripped a photograph of her family in half, and took the piece that had her in it, while discarding the piece with her husband, along with "the page bearing Lily's signature, and her love." Y'know, like a not-obsessed person would do! /s It's further very telling that he /didn't/ take the rest of her letter, which contained the bulk of its contents and of the thoughts she expressed in it, almost like he wasn't interested in what she had to say, only in possessing a token of her love, which was (platonically) given to and intended for someone else, something of which he cannot be unaware given the context in which he took these things.)

**** The people who think Snape was obsessed.

I have a c+p answer to this argument.

Goody, I get to copy/paste this again.

Let's end this obsession theory forever.

We have three interactions between Snape and Lily from the time they're not children. In one, he says they're "supposed to be friends", and she confirms. Interestingly, she does accuse him of obsessing - over Potter and his mates, so not over her. In interaction 2, he calls her a mudblood, in interaction 3, he attempts to apologize. At no point does he ask her out or say she owes him anything or act entitled to her, unless apologizing is an act of entitlement. Further, Harry goes through his potions book with a fine tooth comb, and nowhere does he find a scribble of her initials or anything like that.

Sirius and Lupin, meanwhile, as adults, never say Snape tried to pursue Lily or stalked her, or that they ever spoke, including in the context of listing reasons why Snape was jealous of James. You KNOW they would have. When she asked him to, he left her alone.

Then she is put in the crossfire. Well, wanting someone not to die is not obsessive. I know people read a lot into Dumbledore's "you disgust me" comment, but that comment only proves that Dumbles is manipulative.

Then she dies anyway. Snape is feeling expressly suicidal, as many non-obsessive people do when someone they love dies and it's their fault. Dumbledore leverages his guilt into recruiting him to spy. He proceeds to keep his love/"obsession" a secret from everyone but Dumbles for 17 years, and in fact talks a lot about James, so it still looks like his obsessions are toward those he hates.

People say the "always" line is obsessive. Nope. If Dumbles had to ask "after all this time", then clearly Snape very much shut up about Lily even when speaking to him. People say it's obsessive that he stole the letter and the picture. Having one lousy souvenir of a dead loved one isn't obsessive. As for tearing the photo up, ofc he won't walk around with a picture of James. Ofc he won't carry a letter that says "dear Padfoot." So in summation, no evidence of obsession in his behavior, only of love, remorse, guilt, and grief.

Magical evidence: the Patronus is a symbol of positive feelings, not obsession, unless Harry was obsessed with his dead dad and wanted to bang him. Further: he managed to hide his "obsession" from a mindreader, Voldemort. Obsessions are something you can't control by definition. You /KNOW/ Voldy questioned him about that, probably in a way that involved torture, since Snape asked him to spare her, thus directly causing his first downfall. When Harry occludes Voldy successfully for the first time, it is at a moment of grief, and love - over Dobby. Was Harry obsessed with Dobby? No. He felt responsible for the little guy's death though. Snape's unequalled talent for occlumency should prove that he loved and grieved Lily which is precisely the thing Voldy can't access and understand.

The author herself denied that Snape was obsessive, but frankly, even if she had said he was, what she wrote is very different. It also makes no sense that the big reveal and Voldy's downfall is because of some obsessive incel who wanted to bang Lily, in a CHILDREN'S BOOK about the power of love.

Let's stop talking about the supposed obsession forever and instead wonder why fans cannot wrap their heads around any explanation of anything that isn't gross and irrelevant.

***** While I agree with this for the most part, including the conclusion (I consider Snape's love for Lily to be unhealthy, but true), there are 2 things I want to mention. One thing that you don't seem to adress which is in fact a plausible argument to make towards obsession, and one thing you said that I disagree with outright. Not because I think he's obsessive but it's a reasonable argument those people bring up.

- In the aftermath of werewolf prank, Snape says "I wont let you...". He's cut off, but to my understanding, it's implied to be something like "I wont let you get close to James". This is a clear sign of jealousy which can be taken as a sign of obsession -- he wants her for herself. If he loved her, wouldn't he want her to be happy with anyone? To me, this has a simple response: he doesn't want Lily to end up with James, not only because it isn't himself (I headcanon him with a romantic interest in her like most, but not all, do), but mostly because James is a Marauder. Yeah, if Lily ended up with some Ravenclaw OC or whatnot, it would break his heart, but he'd be able to recover. With a Marauder, however, there is a real chance that it ultimately forces them apart completely (even as friends) due to the constant bullying.
- I disagree with your thoughts on the Grimmauld event. Taking trinkets from a dead love interest, without their consent, is a poster sign of obsession. I have no good argument to make towards this, but I usually rationalize it as him using it to hold onto his mission and goal in a world where he's entirely alone. This, however, doesn't really excuse the action, it only makes it understandable.

****** One moment right after someone he loved died, Snape took some pieces of her with him. I agree it's weird, but I generally abide by the rule. If it happened within five minutes of someone's death and doesn't violate any law, then it's probably them just being in a bad place and not really thinking.

Fairness to Dumbledore, I'm pretty sure that he meant the fact that Snape only ever saw the war as personal. Revenge on Muggles like his father, and then changing because someone he loved might be hurt.

Everything else seems logical.

***** Sorry, late to this, but I have /thoughts./ The tldr of this is that I do think he's obsessed, but I think too many people paint that obsession as somehow gross or inappropriately sexual. It's an obsession because it's the biggest factor in his life, perhaps the only thing that influences his decisions, but it doesn't mean it's gross the way half the fandom paint it (or indeed as noble as the other half do). It's a bit weird, a bit unhealthy, and the sign that Snape, regardless of what else he is, is actually a sad lonely man who only ever managed to connect with one other human. He's not fixating on memories of how hot he found her, he's mentally self flagellating because he made such a balls up of the whole thing and blames himself for her death.

If you can be bothered, do read on for my detailed thought process caused by your post (which is excellent, even the bits I didn't agree with).

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Someone can still be obsessive quietly in their own minds about something without telling others about it.

Most obvious examples being eg serial killers and stalkers, who are "obsessed" with committing the perfect crime, or they're obsessed with watching this one other person; they don't tell people! When someone is arrested because it turns out he kept a collection of women's ears in a bucket or something, the first thing their friends and colleagues say is "no one knew."

Or on a more innocent level, someone can be utterly obsessed with a band, a show, a book or whatever and never talk about it at work. Snape doesn't have friends. He has colleagues from his two jobs (ok, one job, one membership of a murder cult. But still, colleagues!), so he doesn't talk about his personal feelings, his likes or dislikes to them. Plenty of people don't really "know" their colleagues at all. But just because someone isn't talking about their obsession to their boss, it doesn't mean they don't have the obsession.

#+begin_quote
  unless Harry was obsessed with his dead dad and wanted to bang him.
#+end_quote

Harry was obsessed with his dad. All he ever wanted was to be like his dad, to hear stories about his dad, to feel close to his dad. But I think this is the root of what you're saying (and tbh I think this is more the fandoms fault than yours)- you're reading "obsession" as "sexual obsession." It doesn't have to be. Obsession can be innocent. Some people are obsessed with, idk, classic cars and it's all they ever talk about and spend all their money on. It isn't healthy or normal, but it doesn't mean they want to stick their dick in an exhaust pipe!

I always read Snape's obsession as originally (when Lily was alive, like) a crush that was probably a bit weird and sprung from her being the only person to really give a toss for him. He deffo fancied her, the thought of her getting close to James in their fifth year is, reading between the lines, really painful for him. But by the time of the books? No, not sexual. He's not constantly jacking it over a dead lady 20 years on. He's obsessed with honouring her memory, he's obsessed with what might have been, because he's repentant and he knows his own fucked up actions cost him something that could have been good. He blames himself (rightly, tbf) for her death and he is determined to set that right even if he dies trying. He wishes they could have had a healthy relationship, where those words of love on a letter /were/ for him, and he obsessed over that possibility, over the ideal life with the ideal woman he wishes could have been real. He's obsessed with Lily because Lily personifies the human cost of every mistake he ever made. He loves her, but it's shallow. He loves a vision, a memory, a possibility.

And that's why it's obsessive, because it's pining for something not grounded in reality. I don't think it's "dirty" or "weird" the way others seem to, it's not gross, but it definitely controls his life rather than him controling it. When every decision one makes is down to a single factor, that single factor is an obsession.

#+begin_quote

No. He felt responsible for the little guy's death though. Snape's unequalled talent for occlumency should prove that he loved and grieved Lily which is precisely the thing Voldy can't access and understand.
#+end_quote

Harry's love for Dobby (or for Sirius which is what he draws on with the possession in OotP) is not obsession, no. But, that proves nothing really. First, Snape doesn't occlude by using strong memories of anything, not even Lily. He empties his mind, he's totally in control. Harry is different, he wears his heart on his sleeve and it's /painful/ for Voldy to witness that. That's why the lessons don't work- Snape and Harry think in completely different ways and Harry can't use the empty mind technique, it's not in his nature. But, Snape can't use the "push him out with strong emotions" approach that eventually works for Harry, because then V would know who his loyalty really is to. All Snape's occlumency talent proves is that he's in control of his mind, at least for the short periods he's in V's direct presence. And controlling an obsession doesn't make it go away- it's literally what you're taught to do if you go to therapy and say "I'm obsessed with x," they'll teach you to mentally wean yourself off, or at least control it from bubbling up in inappropriate contexts like at work.

Secondly, no one is saying that just because Harry loves Dobby (and others, basically everyone he's close to really) so fiercely that it must be obsession. And just because /Harry/ can love in a non obsessive way, doesn't mean /Snape's/ love for Lily isn't obsessive. Harry and Snape are different people and thus have different mental triggers. Snape had one significant close relationship in his life- with Lily. Harry had tons- Hermione and Ron, Dobby, Hagrid, Dumbles, Ginny, Molly, Sirius etc. It makes sense that Snape fixates on the one he had, because it's an outlier, an anomaly, whereas Harry can feel powerfully about his friends without it controlling him because good, deep friendships are, by the time Harry is 15 and learning occlusion, the norm for him. It also makes sense that Snape would hide his obsession and love for her from Voldy, not use it, because it's the one thing he's got left that isn't tainted and he wants to control those memories and emotions so they're all purely just for him.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes. This is so not the message! Something that has /pissed me off for years/ is this fandom retconing of Snape as an incel. He's not an incel. Incels blame /women/ for the fact they're sad virgins living in a basement. That often starts with resentment of one individual woman. Snape does not, at any point, blame Lily, or any other woman, for the fact he's a sad (presumed) virgin living in a dungeon. He blames himself, and to an extent the Marauders. He's a misanthrope, he's an asshole, he was at one point and may still be a bigot, he spends so much time living in the past that he's forgotten how to build a life in the present. But he's not a bloody incel.

It's not about "wanting to bang her" and you're right the people who paint it as that are grim. Snape's love for Lily is obsessive, out of hand, too much, and something he should have got over. But it was about an emotional connection to the only person who ever gave one solitary shit about him, and his self loathing for fucking that up so abysmally that it led to her death, not just "wanna bang the hot girl even after she died."
