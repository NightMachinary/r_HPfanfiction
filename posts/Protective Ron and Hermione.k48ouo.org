Are there any fics where Ron and Hermione are fiercely protective of Harry? Like, they're not in a triad or anything, they just really care about their friend. Bonus points if they treat him like he's their son. Preferably Hogwarts-era with no pairings, but beggars can't be choosers, so I'll take what I can get.


** Linkao3(Sing a Requiem by Continuedinterests) is a Harry/Hermione set in sixth year where Hermione (with Ron's help) kidnaps Harry and gets him away from Hogwarts and Dumbledore when she realises that's he's a horcrux and is being set up to die.

  Harry is a Horcrux, isn't he? Hermione reads over what she has of her essay so far, ignoring the way her hands have started to shake. She circles some sentences here and there that she thinks might be stronger in a different part of the paper. Don't be silly. What a strange thought to have. Anyway.  Anyway.  During 6th year, Hermione has a realization that Harry is a Horcrux while doing some homework in the library. Things spiral out from there.

** There's one of my favorite fics linkao3(there will come a time you'll see) that has a great protective and lovely Ron and Hermione.

“A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione”

I reread it every couple of months lately. I'll be keeping an eye out for other recommendations!

** This has a time-travelling Ron and Hermione who adopt Harry. Not sure if this is what you are looking for. Author is a friend and is writing. Not abandoned.

  A failing marriage becomes the least of Ron and Hermione's worries when they are thrown into the past in the aftermath of a tragedy. Unsure of themselves, and trying not to succumb to grief, they decide to be parents to the best friend they ever had. Post-epilogue. No Cursed Child. ADULT R/H in a "do the best we can with what we have" situation.
