Unlikely, I know, but imagine: Fred (or George) is the one who thinks Harry is a liar, around the time of the fifth book. Meanwhile, Percy believes in Harry -- perhaps, they have a stronger relationship in this AU?

How would the other twin react, especially if they believe and support Harry?


** Ehhh, it's not 100% directly related.

But in one fic, one of the Weasly twins does an Itachi and become estranged from the family as a spy.

It was well written and decent.

Lemme try and find it.
