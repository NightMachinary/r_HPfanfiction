ie women catcall men etc etc hoping for smutfic but im fine if it isnt


** Oddly specific request but maybe the firebird's son trilogy by Darth Marrs? Not remotely smut but a powerful matriarchal society that has wizards as rare and valuable resources that witches at hogwarts try to "poach" (i.e. bond them through sexual acts). Like I said, not smut but definitely multi- and where wizards are the oppressed minority. Very AU and pretty cool world building.

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.
