I've seen my fair share of Severitus, and was curious if this particular idea has been explored -- basically, something like Harry being under glamours that never actually end up failing (the most common plot device to describe it from what I've seen), but their first son turns up looking like a mini-Severus. What are the reactions in the family -- the initial awkwardness from him/her not looking like his father (was Ginny being unfaithful?), Harry ending up having a /talk/ with Severus' portrait (does Severus even know?), and so on.


** "Let's take an unlikable bastard and randomly make him the father of the MC. Never mind what that says about Lily, who seemed to have despised Snape, betraying her husband with someone part of a movement out to kill her and her son."

I'll never understand certain tropes.

*** You are right, the trope does have rather disturbing implications. Really though, there isn't really any /other/ people that writers like to choose as Harry's not-James father.

**** ???

The Thief's Downfall removes glamours, polyjuice, transfigurations, even the imperius... so unless you have Harry never going to his vault..

***** No no, see, he'd still look like James without the glamours. All that happens is his eyes change color. Only a few people would even notice!

God, what a horrible image.. /shudders/

Still, you are right, and that glamour could be replaced by however made it during the rest of the summer so perhaps only his relatives would really notice.

** This is the typical original plot idea that is downvoted here. There are a lot of folks around who adore Lily and James, do not take it personally. I think it's a great idea.
