** Harry Potter/Fate Stay night crossover [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swords-and-sorcery-fate-stay-night-harry-potter.399084/]]

"This will be a GWL story, taking place in the Harry Potter universe, but mostly seen through the eyes of Emiya Shirou."

** "Tomorrowland" by winterfool is only available on AO3. It's the /creme de la creme/ of Harry/Luna fics. Even if you don't like or don't think you like the pairing, you need to check this one out.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1075603/chapters/2160140]])

I wouldn't know where to begin with recommending fics that are only on FFN. That site was around for ten years before AO3 even existed, so there's definitely a larger number of FFN-only fics than there are AO3-only fics.

** Новое Начало - Альтернатива isn't on any websites other than fanfics.me AFAIK.

Basically, it's edgy Harry done right.
