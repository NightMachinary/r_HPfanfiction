Sort of like how Daphne is in Contractual Invalidation. Would really like them to be long!

** Checkout the Downward Spiral Saga. Linkffn(12867536). It has a super dark Harry that's paired with Daphne later on. Not much of a spoiler, but both are on Voldemort's side. The writing in the first few books isn't the greatest, but they get so much better in the third and after. 10/10 for this series. You should definitely give it a try.

** Well, !linkffn(Living Dangerously) is another Haphne fic with a blood purist Daphne. The sequel was recently published, actually.

!linkffn(Power is Control)

This one has a female Harry/fem!Voldemort pairing, which actually frames their relationship in an interesting way with respect to the war. Its sequel is almost finished.

*** Ugh. I remember I read Living Dangerously shortly after a breakup when I was just looking for happy endings and the fact that it ended on downer note to set up the sequel really jaded me to it. I'm in a better place now but unfortunately I doubt I'll ever go back to it.

**** Yeah, that's fair. I tend to look for a fair amount of drama in my romance fics, and Living Dangerously was a good fit for that craving.
