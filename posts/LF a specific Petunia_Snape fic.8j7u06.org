One of the scenes had Professor McGonagall refusing to leave Harry on the Dursley's doorstep with just a note because she remembered her own sister dying and thought it would have been too cruel.

Snape and Petunia end up running away to Canada with Harry and Dudley.

I think at the end things have fallen apart in the British wizarding world and someone goes back with a time turner?
