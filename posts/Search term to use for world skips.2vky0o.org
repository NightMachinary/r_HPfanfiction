** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10524028/1/The-Observer-Effect][The Observer Effect]] is fairly interesting, though not updated for a few months.

After Tony Stark outs himself as Iron Man on live television, he acquires a magical stalker in the form of a bored (female) Harry Potter, who has emerged from the Veil of Death in a world without wizards. A cat-and-mouse game ensues when Stark's curiosity drives him to ever-increasing lengths to capture his invisible benefactor, who struggles with maintaining her distance.

It's a HP/Firefly crossover where Harry ends up in the Firefly universe. If you don't like FF too much, consider giving it a try anyway. I was never a big fan, but the story has some original ideas and plays it fairly straight. I actually really enjoyed it, after putting off trying the fic for /years/ because I didn't like the premise.

  The world is breaking; war and technology are pushing on the edge of the unbelievable, and S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately attempts to keep the peace. The soldier and the scientist are not the only lights that push back against the darkness, however; magic will encompass the world again as the last wizard makes himself known.

#+begin_quote
  Life's a lot easier when no one knows you and your only worry is whether or not people in each world speak the same languages you do. Harry can attest to it; he's been jumping for years. He knows how to keep his head down and not get invested. On hindsight, with his track record, Harry supposed it was only a matter of time until he did exactly that.
