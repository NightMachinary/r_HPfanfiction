Hey, i'm looking for any good fanfiction with alive Potters. It can be completely AU (no war, no Voldemort) or a fic where they surive Halloween '81 or where Harry isn't The Boy Who Lived. I would like to see a dynamics between family members. I prefer longer fics but oneshots are also welcome. So far I read /HP&TBWL/ by The Santi, /Blood Binding/ by SphinxScribe, /Like Father Like Son/ by DarthMittens, /Everybody Lives/ (HP rewrite) by AidanChase (Ao3). Oh, and please no slash.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)
