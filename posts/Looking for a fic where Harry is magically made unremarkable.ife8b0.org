:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A somewhat short story made up of six, or there about, chapters. Dumbledore puts a spell on baby Harry, but does it wrong, I think, which makes everyone forget about Harry until he turns seventeen. Harry doesn't really interfere much with anything, but helps Theodore Nott, and they later become a couple.
