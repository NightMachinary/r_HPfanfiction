:END:
Hi everyone I am looking for one I read back before 2014 I cannot remember the name just bits of it and that i was a really emotion one

it was based around the Dursley abuse being worse Harry went to school made friends with a girls and a female teacher who both left after a while and promised to stay in contact with him but the Dursleys blocked it

the abuse got the point where Albus moved Harry to the Burrow and he had massive trust issues and only let Ginny in and at one point the twins played a prank on him and in mollys words he did not lol but blew himself out of it

later on in the story I remember he was attacked at school and ended up in a sort of coma the last thing I remember is harry being asked if he wanted to be there when he punished Draco and others for the attack but he said no and Albus saying to McGonagall that Harry would take over for him someday
