I have read fanfifcs that either featured Susan Bones as a friend/ally and as one of Harry's girlfriends but I realized that I have never read any Harry x Susan (exclusive). So I am hoping that you guys can suggest really good Harry x Susan fanfics.

**** It's not a story, as much as a collection of trope-y ideas mashed together.

The cake is taken by Wormtail reading muggle self-help books and quoting them to Voldemort, in a non-crack fashion.

Yeah. That happens.

***** It's been some time since I've last read it, but as far as I remember it had a very strange logic, which required severe mental gymnastics to follow. For example Harry can make portkeys for some reason, he stops Voldemort's raid on Bones Manor, they get to Grimmauld, which becomes a refugee centre for some reason. Dumbledore shows up and berates Harry but he isn't really sure what to berate Harry for. At first it is endangering himself, then killing Death Eaters, then it is going against Dumbledore.

A story advertising "Gritty realism" has a Machiavellian mastermind getting beaten in a verbal spar by a sixteen year old teenager. By chapter 3 or 4.

***** The technical side is good, specific bits are good, but overall it's split between a crack fic (self-help-book Wormtail is not even the worst) and a straight drama (the Ministry fighting an actual war), and both elements suffer.

It's not the worst fic, but it's best left for boredom.

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

** Well, if you have no issue with fem!Harry, there's The silent world of Cassandra Evans, which is by far my favourite crack story in this fandom. The first few chapters are tedious since there is very little dialogue (Harry is left mute after some exaggerated Dursley abuse) and the reading flow suffers from that. But once Susan becomes a friend of Harry/Cassandra things get better since the tone gets a lot lighter/happier. From a technical point of view, the story won't be winning awards, but the plot and execution are decent enough.

The story subverts a lot of tropes like Harry having a half sibling but they actually get along. OP!Harry, but it is not cringeworthy, politics, but it is actually left to the adults, a stigma about lesbian relationships but the protagonists don't care since really, what is social pressure compared to fighting Voldemort?

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

Admittedly, now that I think about it, I do remember thinking at the time that the "Harnevra" stuff was dubious at best and nonsense at worst, so there's that.
