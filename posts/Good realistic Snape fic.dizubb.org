By realistic i dont necessarily mean he has to be good or bad or cant grow as a character and must stay ecxactly like book canon.

Just that his reasons to be different than canon have to make sense.

Did he decide to not be a dick to Harry? Well there should be a reason that would appeal to his canon counterpart. He cant just wake up and be like wow im an ass I think ill stop doing that.

I want i guess fairness in his potrayal and the potratal of others

I dont want a Snape bashing story or a story that coddles him or makes everyone who has issues with assholes. James and Sirius arent dicks just cuz Snape is MC

I guess more nuance is what im saying.

Snape centric naturally with him as MC

No Snape/OC, No Snape/self insert, No Snape /any minor chatacter who was only ever name dropped briefly and not expanded on at all and same applies to others. Replace Snape's name with those of other Canon characters too same restrictions .

No Snape or anyone from his generation or older / Anyone from Harrys gen even with time travel

No genderbending.

And no Snape adopts Harry story or becomes a parent to Harry. He can mentor but he cant adopt or be a parent and he still has to be MC not Harry.

No hate against the trope ive just seen too much

Apart from that all ships are fine het slash fem slash is all good . No ships is also fine

Preferably takes place in Harrys time line or at least after Snape graduates hogwarts.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11622306][Puzzle]] linkao3(11622306) is from Lily's POV, but Snape plays a major role, and his characterization in this fic is the best I've ever seen - it's nothing but nuance and complexity. Snape/Lily, canon divergent, dark.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/147439][Into the Fold]] linkao3(147439) is from Snape's POV, alternates between his sixth year at Hogwarts and two years post-graduation, and is also really thoughtful about his characterization. Mostly gen with some unrequited Snape/Lily, canon compliant.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6693841][I Know Not, and I Cannot Know; Yet I Live and I Love]] linkao3(6693841) has a premise that I admit I was skeptical of at first - Snape slowly developing a sort of friendship with Luna over the years as her teacher - but the execution sold me. Gen, canon compliant.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** This fic is tagged as Snape/Hermione (it takes place after the Second Wizarding War), but honestly, they never even kiss. It reads, to me, like a Gen fic (no pairings). The backstory the author gives to Snape is fitting and realistic. I especially love the descriptions of Death Eater life and the nature of Dark magic. Unfortunately, it's a WIP, but I felt that it stopped at a place that allows it to stand on its own as a complete fic. I'm a complete Snapetard, and I adore this story:

** HP-era, gen, mentors HP (but does not adopt him nor is the fic heading in such a direction): linkao3(The Hogwarts Potions Professor). Main issue given your restrictions is that, while the fic doesn't "coddle" him and retains his serious demeanor, the reason he behaves a better person is left unexplained.

I considered linking a Marauder-era fic but couldn't figure any SS-centric out that I remember reading that doesn't bash at least one of the Marauders since I don't read "bad!Snape" fics (flawed yes, but never truly dark), and while they are bullies in canon, fics like to go overboard, especially when they want to make James look bad because reasons. The closest one that comes to mind (which only has some very minor bashing) had several OCs instead, which you expressed a dislike for.
