Essentially I want a Harry so unbelievably powerful that the Wizarding World means nothing to him in comparison. He doesn't have to be able to blow up stars, that was more of the scale of how OP I want this Harry. I don't care if it's because he's an Ancient in a Stargate crossover, or a DBZ character. I'm just in the mood for an absurdly powerful Harry.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** If you are into Marvel crossover s A third path to the future fits the bill! It has OP!Harry and at some point he sets mars on fire. Has Heram Harry/Storm/Jean Grey/Emma Frost.. And a lot of arcs from Marvel universe. No wizarding world though.

** /The Awakening of a Magus/ seemed to have the potential for such a thing; alas, it was pulled down for a rewrite before Harry could actually wield the full power.

** Ummm so this one is a bit of a series [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21993898][pacify]] and its Snarry, so if that disgusts you I wouldn't read it. Tbh this is the only series that i've become relatively okay with it. It's really well written and has a good build up to an ObscenelyPowerful!Harry. It's on its 7th part now, each one is about 100k so you have to stick with it. It is NSFW
