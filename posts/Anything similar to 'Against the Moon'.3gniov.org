I enjoyed reading 'Against the Moon' however it has not been updated for a long time. I was wondering if there are other canon stories out there about the Marauders during their school days, or a during the first rise of Voldemort.


** This is a difficult one, because so many have been abandoned. I've heard that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3503913/1/][You Want to Make a Memory]] is good, but I haven't read it for myself yet. It's on the list. Same with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8236381/1/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-Stag-and-the-Doe][The Rise and Fall of the Stag and the Doe]], though I did try to start that. It wasn't immediately captivating, but a lot of people like it, so I may try again.

Ones that are not completed: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=256874][In My Time of Dying]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3325624/1/The-Age-of-Inertia][The Age of Inertia]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]]. All are very good, and they stayed with me long after I gave up hope of them ever being updated.

I think one of the issues is that Marauder stories are often synonymous with Lily and James romance stories...and while I do enjoy that, I also like the humor and playfulness of "Against the Moon" just as much.

If you want the other side, a lot of people like the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][The Snape Chronicles]]. I thought it was very good until it wasn't. Kind of disappointing for me, but you might still like it.

Also, can I do a shameless plug of my own? It's hardly worth any effort because I literally just posted it yesterday, but I've been working on this story about Lily Evans for a long time. It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11440239/1/Flowers-in-Winter][Flowers in Winter]]. I can't make any promises so early in the game, but the "plan" is to get through the war.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

**** I thought his turn to the dark side was too abrupt. He was doing well just trying to get by without too much attention, and then his grandmother dies and suddenly he thinks Muggles are scum? There was no mourning, no trying to argue with himself...also, and I didn't get past that part, but he seemed to drop Lily like a hot potato. I don't know...I guess I just expected a little more emotion and pain.

***** They'd been recruiting him for a loooong long time, and he hadn't been opposed to them since way back in maybe third or fourth year. By the end of fifth he was almost completely taken by them (especially the whole scene at the lake with James), never mind all the tutoring and spellcrafting he'd /already/ been doing. I'm not entirely sure how you read his Hogwarts years and saw a normal kid who was just doing well trying to get by; he spent the latter half of school almost /thriving/ on the Slytherins' attention.

Beyond that, you must have never had your last family member lynched before. That's the kind of thing that drives entire peoples to war, much less one 16/17 year old kid. Humans are composed of a lot more rage and a lot less pain and angst than we like to deceive ourselves into thinking.

Also at what point does he drop Lily like a hot potato? Before or after she drops /him/ like a hot potato?

****** No, I can't say that I've had a family member lynched before. I'm sure that would be horrible...but he didn't even seem angry. Just sort of, "Welp, guess I'm doing this now." And when I say he was doing well, I meant he was going on this particular track. I mean, he liked the lunar landings and he was considering rocket science. You can still be a smart and create a bunch of spells...but still want to do rocket science. And he dropped all of it without so much as a second thought when that happened. Not so much as a second thought, pain or anguish. Felt like the grandmother thing was a bit of a cop-out to make him evil. And yeah, Lily dropped him...but I wanted her to play a bigger role in his life. Up until the point I read, she just seemed like a friend...not someone he would risk his life to attempt to save.

Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like the story. I thought it started out amazing, and then it fizzled down to the point where I got bored with it. In the books, we were led to hate this character with a passion until all this strife and anguish came forward. I guess I just wanted more strife and anguish. You /did/ ask for my opinion. I still thought it was written well.

But...that's exactly what happened in canon. She was barely more than a friend and then she dropped him. What particularly large role did she play in his life? The fic even tries to expand on their relationship, giving them shared moon-watching hobbies and birthday rituals and making her the only person he couldn't Occlude against.

It isn't supposed to be an AU with everything fixed, or an angst trip, or even a "let's revel in the darkness" thing. It's just canon with the missing years filled in. Plenty of people don't like that, I know, and that's a perfectly valid preference!

Well, he begged Dumbledore to protect her and managed to get the darkest villain in the world to offer her a chance for life. Then, after she refused to step aside, he devotes his entire existence to protecting her son. Wtf? Did we read the same book? I'd say she was very important to him.

Look, don't ask for my opinion just to satisfy some urge to fight on the Internet. I liked the idea...heck, I recommended it to someone. I just didn't think it was interesting enough to continue reading at the moment. Doesn't mean I won't pick it up again...but honestly if you'd rather me like it, be a little bit more convincing. I WAS looking for canon with the missing years filled in. That didn't have enough information for me.

Yes, but /prior/ to him coming out and doing all that, how extraordinary was their relationship? In all the scenes we have of them as children, what's the insurmountable role she played that would justify his reaction? That's why I mentioned their birthday rituals and so on in the fic, because it actually gives much more justification for him to up and risk his life beyond "well they started talking to each other before Hogwarts". Like their mental connection, for one; in this fic it's clear right off the bat that unlike everyone else (even his mother) he can't hide anything from her and he idolizes her for it.

And I'd say you weren't looking for /information/, but rather /emotion/ (or to be precise, a specific sort of emotion). Which is personal taste and there's nothing wrong with that, but Snape's defining emotions were never the softer, angsty kind.

EDIT: Also, where did you leave off in the fic? It just struck me that I might be speaking with hindsight bias.

********** Okay, if you promise you're not fighting. I think it was the good and evil bit that rubbed me the wrong way. Although I do think Snape is not a "good" character per say, I really wanted to believe his turn toward Voldemort. He's a relatively new interest of mine. I started work on a story myself, and I read Snape Chronicles back in April-ish to see what was already out there. I only got to chapter 19 or 20, and then I got busy and wasn't interested enough to finish.

The emotion bit makes sense. I think I picked it up looking for something like Against the Moon as well, and it's not like that.

*********** Well if you want an angsty take on Snape, then I can't in good faith recommend this fic to you, especially considering its length. I haven't read Against the Moon but there are very good angst!Snape fics out there!

What the Snape Chronicles is on the other hand is a very frank, plain and unapologetic take on his life. It coincides pretty well with how I see him - as someone with a troubled past who nevertheless made terrible choices that he more than paid for in full - which is likely why I get a little defensive of it, haha. I think the problem with it is that it neither justifies nor condemns him, and most people look for one or the other in a Snape fic. But in that regard it's quite true to life: most times our actions are unjustifiable, but they don't brand us as anything other than human beings. Personally I found his eventual initiation completely believable, maybe because I've known people who've done much the same thing and I've long since come to terms with the fact that /believable/ doesn't equal /right/ or even /sympathetic/.

Plus I don't think there really is a "good" or "evil" in TSC's world. The only character I'd label as evil in that fic is Voldemort, and that's largely because the author deliberately kept him a shadowy, mysterious figure. In fact, the Death Eaters tend to get more and better characterization than the other secondary characters. You get the clear sense that they're just people at the end of the day, albeit people prone to violence and prejudice in one form or the other. And future defection aside, Snape /was/ one of them of his own accord, and likely was friends with quite a few; the fic doesn't try to cover that up at all. So you're not going to find air-tight excuses in The Snape Chronicles, or even be able to put yourself in his shoes. You'll probably disagree with a lot of the things said and the choices made. I'm willing to bet you won't even like it - I definitely didn't the first time around.

But it's a story worth reading, and its post-Hogwarts chapters are a fascinating take on the sort of man that could so deeply loathe a child while giving up everything for him; that could treat his students with clear disdain one moment and genuine concern the next. The hero the wizarding world deserved, but not the one they needed right then. So they hated him, because he could take it. Because he wasn't a hero. He was a snarky guardian. A watchful spy. A Dark...

...wait, wrong fandom ಠ_ಠ

************ Against the Moon is basically 105 chapters of little Remus tugging at your heartstrings. It's the story of him becoming friends with James, Sirius, and Peter. I recommended TSC because they have a similar premise (e.g. "This is the story of ____."). Other than that, AtM is more emotional and focused on detail (105 chapters over the span of 2 years)...and from my limited experience and your words, it seems as though TSC is more an explanation of events. Does that sound correct?

Perhaps I need to approach the story with that mindset. I knew going into TSC that I wasn't going to like his choices in the war, but I did want to feel sorry for him. Guess I can put that into my own story, and stop looking for it. Got to admit, though, I'm looking forward to some Death Eater characterization. The HP books are a little lacking in that regard.

The "good" vs "evil" comes from too much Marauder fanfiction, I suppose. It's all join the good side, fight for what you believe in, die before you're 22 in that side of the fandom...a la Les Mis.

So it sounds like I need to put it back on the reading list and try again when I'm in the mood for something edgier.

New AU, Snape is Batman.
