** There are definitely WAY more gay male fics than gay female fics.

I'm a data nerd, so here's a fun comparison. Of the 103k+ Harry Potter fics on ao3 right now, there are about 50,000 tagged with "m/m" and 5000 with "f/f". Now, some of these could have both tags for whatever reason (background ships, or a multi story, or something like that) but the fact that there are literally ten times more with m/m is WILD to me. And that on ao3, m/m ships make up half of all of their fics in total. It's a lot harder to say on ff.net, because even though they have 747k+ fics right now, there's no good way to filter out specifically for m/m or f/f any pairing, and it's a lot of hassle to look up every single possible or likely pairing and add them up.

But yup, some food for thought anyways.

*** I think this is very interesting. I decided to take a look at this on ffn, since I had a readily available dataset from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3jmxv0/i_analyzed_the_character_choices_from_200000_fics/?st=irr1gxgt&sh=393040e3][here]] so it wasn't much trouble.

I looked at fics from that sample of ~200k from ffn that had 2 characters listed for the fic . Then I labeled the category (M/F, M/M, or F/F) of the most popular 150 pairings (that's all I was willing to do by hand). This is about 90% of the fics with 2 characters, though, so it's probably a good representation of the sample.

Anyway, around 60% had M/F characters, 32% had M/M characters, and 2% had F/F characters. The rest had an "OC" label, so I kept these separate. This suggests the discrepancy between M/M and F/F is possibly just as bad (if not worse) on ffn than ao3.

The limitation to this analysis is that two characters listed does not necessarily mean a romantic pairing. Also, this is just from a sampling of fics from ffn to begin with, so take those values with a grain of salt.

**** This is so wild! Thanks for doing all this hard work. I love seeing these numbers.

It's wild though. Ffn has more m/f fics than ao3 does in this specific sample but the discrepancy between m/m & f/f is as you say just as bad if not worse.

Clearly, we need more f/f fics out there!!

*** That's actually incredible. I have no idea how you manage to collate that kind of data but I'm crazy impressed.

Do you have any theory's as to why there's such a big difference? JK Rowling prominent characters mostly male? Gay Harry bossing it?

**** Well that particular data is pretty easy - on ao3 you can filter for fics by a variety of tags, and there are tags for both m/m & f/f! But as I said there are so many factors that I'm sure those numbers aren't entirely accurate, but they're very interesting nonetheless.

I don't really know! Pure speculation but I wonder if it's because there are a lot of fic writers who are teen girls, and a lot of teen girls seem to have a "thing" for gay males?? It's probably something to do too with having two "strong" characters (personality and body)? I think Harry/Draco is one of the most popular ships on ao3 as well so maybe it has something to do with the whole enemies to lovers trope and those just generally being liked characters? Ao3 also is very ship (& smut) centric so that has to be related as well.

None of those were coherent thoughts - sorry! I'd love to hear other peoples thoughts too.

***** I think you're right. A lot of the authors of gay Harry Potter fanfiction are females. For some odd reason, girls do have an obsession with gay males... it's rather humorous. The issue with that is that girls get gays wrong. Well, not wrong, per se, but very stereotypical. I'm not talking about hand gestures and waving around like the stereotype. I have read more 'gay Harry' fanfics where Harry has cried over the silliest things. I'm ranting.

And yeah, Harry/Draco on Ao3 is by far the most popular, probably because a lot of people see Draco as a hot suave guy who hates Harry because they're enemies.

Also, try searching for lesbian Hermione instead of gay Hermione. Lesbian, for females, is the proper term. Gay is for males. :) (Before you all mass downvote my post for it, LGBT, pl0x. If gay and lesbian were the same, it wouldn't be listed twice and it'd be GBT!)

****** I definitely agree with you on all of the above points! I have read some amazing Drarry fics but I've also read far too many that are so stereotypical or badly done I can't finish them.

My only small issue is, as the OP already mentioned, the whole "lesbian v gay" argument. I'm a queer woman and generally among most of my younger friends "queer" is the most popular term of self identification. That said, I have many friends who are women who are attracted to women who use gay and lesbian interchangably. The nice thing about language is that it's pretty open especially as it regards to identification in this case.

Besides, some people use LGBT, others use even longer acronyms (LGBTTQIAAPP+) so, again, pretty open.

That all said - I agree that searching for "lesbian" if that's how you're looking through tags may be a good plan! I searched using the ao3 tag function for f/f so numbers wide that isn't a concern for me, but could help the OP find fics.

***** Hahaha that was all very coherent. I agree with all your statements, it actually makes a lot more sense now that you've said them.

Harry being the main character (and the most popular for fanficton) is in itself a solid reason for there to be more male slash than female. Combine it with a love for the sexy dark side - Draco, Snape, Tom/Voldemort (Tom was a gorgeous guy before the Voldemort things happened) it's a little clearer about how there are such discrepancies.

I guess when you add in real world portrayal within media - there tends to be more stereotypical male homosexuals portrayed than any not cis heterosexual group. Which makes sense to also be reflected within the communities writing? I guess I just never guessed the difference to be so large!

****** Yeah! I totally agree about the media portrayals. There are finally some good representations of gay males on TV but we're still sorely lacking in queer women (who don't get killed off as plot devices).

I remember first noticing a huge discrepancy when I found thequidditchpitch years and years ago. The category for f/f had 63 stories in it and over the few years I checked that site it never changed. I don't remember the number for m/m but it was definitely much, much higher.

**** Yes, as with most fandoms, the vast majority of the prominent characters are male, and the same for the characters that are most in-depth described. The only exception I can think of to that out of the biggest fandoms would be Buffy, probably.

Harry Potter might seem quite equal, but the only female characters we get any depth on are, I believe, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, and then Bellatrix, Tonks, and Mrs Weasley. Lily Potter too, but she's pre-narrative and out of the above, only Bellatrix and Mrs Weasley would have been alive when she was. We don't get Ginny until book 2, and not as a character until book 5, likewise, no Luna or Tonks until book 5. Fleur also pops up in book 4, but we don't get a lot of information about her other than that she's beautiful and haughty.

By contrast male characters; Harry, Ron, Neville, Draco, Snape, Dumbledore, Fred and George, Hagrid, Voldemort and plenty other supporting male characters pop up a lot in the first three books. In pre-narrative there's James Potter, Sirius, and Remus who we get a lot of backstory on, and Sirius and Remus make their comebacks into main cast in book 3 too. The only supporting female characters really in canon are the three quidditch girls, Lavender and Parvati, and Cho Chang.

So its not surprising that a lot of pairings are M/M, there's just more options for it, and the greater presence of male characters in the first books - where fanfic authors start, to learn about the world - suggests them as more likely options for a pairing, especially based on someone Harry has known a long time.

When it comes to F/F, there just aren't that many female characters that interact with each other. Hermione and Ginny don't meet until book 4, Ginny and Luna don't appear onscreen together until book 5, and none of them meet Tonks until book 5. So your pairing options are really limited to side characters who you then have to make into OCs, and I guess a lot of authors don't want to go down that road for various reasons.

I think, when I think about it, the female character Hermione has the most screentime with before book 4 is Moaning Myrtle!
