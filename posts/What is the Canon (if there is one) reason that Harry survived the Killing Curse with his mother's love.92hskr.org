The "Mother's Love" thing was a bit "Yes, she loved him enough to die for him, but so do most mothers. What made Lily different" was there ever a "Lily did some kind of Ancient life for life ritual" or some kind of Ancient magic, Love Magic is a thing, but it manifesting as actually burning evil seems a little bit Holy. I've seen several fanon reasons, but the "Lily did a Dark ritual and loved Harry enough to say fuck morals, I'm saving my son from that monster" and that's why it manifested offensively" was the best one.


** I'm not sure if this is canon or fanon but one common theory is that when Vokdemort agreed to Snape's request to spare Lily he truly meant it because he was pleased with Snape and Voldemort didn't care either way if she lived or died. So when Lily says "take me instead" and Voldemort says "very well" the terms of the vow shifted and he was required to spare Harry instead so when he tried to kill him magic punished him.

I am a little unclear how Voldemort made a binding vow without meaning to but I have heard this theory a lot and I quite like it. After all Lily wasn't the first mother to die for her child that alone doesn't seem enough but Lily's sacrifice when she didn't have to die and actually said "take me instead" when accepted by Voldemort may have been enough.

That's exactly it. The magic isn't /completely/ unknown to Voldemort since he mentions it in the graveyard, but the offer (and acceptance) of a life in exchange for other lives seems to be accepted as binding by magic-as-an-entity. The series makes a big deal about how much /intent/ matters in magic, especially in this sort of weird esoteric magic that no one fully understands to begin with.

The best mundane analogy I can think of is some sort of magical EULA. "By killing the person who has willingly offered their life for the safety of others, you have accepted the terms and conditions of the contract below."

*** Ehh that doesn't really make any sense to me. People would be accidentally making binding vows all the damned time. Every time you mean any promise, you're magically bound?

Hell, Voldemort never even had any intention of only taking Lily.

"My word is my bond", the penalties for breaking /geasa/, the exact wording of promises made - however unintentionally - to the fair folk and the duplicitous wordplay of spirits are common themes in the folklore of magic. It's not beyond plausibility that a lord, granting a boon to his liegeman, might incur /geas/ thereby, bringing disaster on himself in the breaking of it.

** The key is not that she died, but that she was first offered a chance to live. She therefore freely chose to die *in exchange for her son*, not merely in addition to her son, as will be the case with most murders of entire families.

** As far as I understand it Lily didn't do any specific ritual. She just invoked some mysterious ancient magic that activated when she willingly traded her life for her son's. Lily herself most likely wasn't aware of such magic, nor did she know it was going to happen. Though whether or not that sort of thing should've been common or not, I don't know.

** Firstly, it can't have been a deliberate ritual, because Harry did it as well at the end of DH.

Secondly, here's how I understand the sequence of events:

1. Voldemort kills James. He does not offer to spare James, so no special consequences.
2. Voldemort offers Lily to step aside and be spared (as a favour to Snape), creating a situation where Lily could survive if she allowed Harry to be killed. Most child-murderers don't do that.
3. Lily refuses.
4. Voldemort kills Lily. Sacrificial Protection for Harry against Voldemort and his agents is created.
5. Voldemort tries to kill Harry, Sacrificial Protection makes the spell backfire.

Notice that if Voldemort hadn't offered to spare Lily, or if he had merely incapacitated Lily, there would have been no Sacrificial Protection.

*** That's exactly it! You see, intent is the big thing here. The exact same thing happened at the BoH when Harry walked to his death. He was ready to die even though he could also run and live. The fact that both Lily and Harry chose to die for others is the key thing.

** My favourite fan theory is the one in Potter Who And the Wossname's Thingummy, where it turns out that Tom Riddle /also/ had the mother's-love protection, which kept him and everyone in Wool's Orphanage safe during the blitz. It also protected him from the consequences of all the dark arts malarkey he did to himself in pursuit of power, except that as he went on his mother recognised her son less and less and less until he turned his wand on a baby, his mother's love finally gave up on him, he lost the protection and just popped like a bubble.

** It's symbolic magic. Lily was offered a way to avoid being murdered in place of someone else, yet still gave up her life. Hence symbolic magic was cast. The murderer could no longer harm their intended target. Lily took the cup, so to speak.

*** The Bonds of Blood Charm was what Dumbledore cast according to that information, the "Nope, Voldemort can't hurt you here so long as the Dursleys is your home" thing. It just called Lily's spell "Sacrificial Protection" and the Bonds of Blood charm was something Dumbledore did.

**** Fair enough.

Honestly though it all seems to be another example of the power of symbols and gestures in HP magic. The love it takes to sacrifice your life is more powerful than the deadliest curse.
