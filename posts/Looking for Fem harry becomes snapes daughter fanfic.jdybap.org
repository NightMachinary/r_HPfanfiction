:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay, I read this story not too long ago. In it, Harry has to go into hiding, and as such, the OoTP asks Tonks to teach him how to become a new person; most of the story is him learning from tonks, but eventually, he decides that the best disguise would be as snapes daughter. I'm pretty sure it is incomplete but I would be grateful if somebody knew what I was talking about.


** I believe you're talking about

"Shedding lion skin" by beacon hill [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shedding-lionskin-harry-potter-au.862342/page-6#post-69588121][link]]

Also, beacon hill is a fantastic author and everything shes written is amazing so if you've read worm and you haven't read nemesis you are a shame to humanity <3
