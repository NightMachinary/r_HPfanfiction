** Michael was the first. He had a lot in common with Hermione, if Ron thought about it--overbearing, arrogant, and dismissive of Quidditch. Ron couldn't see what Ginny saw in him. Was it his nose, or his pretty brown eyes, or his soft-looking hair?

Dean was less forgivable. For him to date Ginny when he, Ron, was right there, had lived in the same room for the past 6 years? It hurt. And it wasn't that they had lived together for so long--Ron knew /for a fact/ that Dean and Seamus had /something/ between them. No, it just seemed that Dean preferred Ginny over Ron.

But Harry was the most painful of them all. They were like brothers--closer than brothers. They had been through life and death together, and they would be happy together. And Ron was happy for them. Harry and Ginny were good for each other. They had a shared darkness no one else knew. But Ron sometimes wished that he'd seen more of the darkness in the Locket, as much as he hated himself for it, so he could be the one sharing his heart with Harry.

Hermione knew. At the end of it all, they had been through much and shared much, and they loved each other in their own way, but the one secret neither of them spoke in their marriage, shared as it was, was that their two was not three.

** I love the idea of this prompt, but I'd like it specifically just about Harry. The other two are just the normal, Ron is an overprotective prat, but with Harry, Ron feels what Hermione felt with him and Lavender.
