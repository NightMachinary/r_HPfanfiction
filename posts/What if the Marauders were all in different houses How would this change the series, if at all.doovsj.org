Assuming that each marauder is in a different house for each scenario, this creates 256 (4^4) alternative timelines. How would this change the series, especially using atypical combinations?

E.g. James = Slytherin, Sirius = Hufflepuff, Peter = Ravenclaw, Remus = Gryffindor

** There's little to no chance they become animagi and I doubt James and Sirius befriend the other two. I /can/ see those 2 staying friends no matter what, though. James and Sirius appear to be as nosy and daring as their son, so they might befriend Remus after somehow guessing he's a werewolf.

No James and Sirius = no Death Eater Peter, unless Slytherin bc he has no backbone. Otherwise he's hightailing it like Zacharias Smith. No Peter = a 1980s Voldemort takeover until an 11+ or old Harry Potter enters the chat.

If Sirius or James is the Slytherin this might affect Regulus, especially James. They're pretty much two sides of the same coin. That potentially impacts Regulus' end and Harry's camping trip.

If Remus is the Slytherin...he probably dies a lot earlier and that's not my hatred talking. I just don't see him surviving in that climate. He'd be a poor, friendless werewolf.

I realize you're probably referring to Harry with this, but it sounds like a weird mpreg situation.

** Well with atypical combinations you have different characters, and just take some background infos and call your OC by CC names... but ok, lets try and base it on the canon characers

Remus = Slytherin (because he had to be secretive all his life that it becomes second nature), Sirius = Gryffindor (that your Slytherin has well, but we already put Remus there), Peter= Hufflepuff (because in the end, Hufflepuff while valuing some traits was willing to teach anyone) , James= Ravenclaw (he was described in the book as very bright and clever with good grades with little effort)

​

Now I think there is a good chance that Snape would have figured Remus out and actually convinced him together with his other death eater buddies to become one as well, making him at least as dangerous as Greyback but in a different way, he would be the example for other werewolves who they could be if they trust Voldemort and claim their place in magical world.

​

Peter could have lived an unremarkable life without friends all too eager to join a war, so he could have kept his head down and would be meaningless to history.

​

James would be shocked to not be in Gryffindor, but with time come to terms with it, maybe he and Sirius would have picked up a friendship never the less. I could see them having a private little prank war with each other. But with being occupied with each other they wouldn't be much of a problem to the rest of Hogwarts about bullying or at least until the mini death eaters stay low. Would they become nasty towards muggleborns, I think James would strick a deal with Sirius to focus fire on them. He would still play Quidditch and be an ace in it and maybe would have got together with Lily sooner

​

Sirus would feel lost in his new home and all too happy to have this prank based friendship with James, that for years stayed on the lighter side until, things turned dark for Sirus and James steps in to hear him out and help him, offering his home to Sirius once again

***** It's only arithmetic, don't let it bother you. It would be easy to come up with 4^{4} alternate timelines (or infinite, really), based on seating arrangements on the Hogwarts Express! Or a Hilbert hotel where first-years James and Sirius take prime seats on the train, only to be told to move to the next compartment by some bossy second-years, and the second-years in turn displaced by third-years, etc.

** Remus tells the hat that he's obviously going to Slytherin because he's a dark creature, and the hat is like, sure, whatever. Remus befriends Severus, his fellow poor, unpopular Slytherin, and they're inseparable friends. Severus obviously figures out Remus's furry little problem. Severus becomes an animagus so he'll be safe around Remus.

Everything's OK until Severus's jealousy over James, that bloody Gryffindor, harassing Lily. Severus sends James into the Shrieking Shack, where Remus eats him. Remus is sentenced to be put down like Buckbeak. Lily, who loved Remus all along, never forgives Severus, although she does try to rescue Remus with unauthorized use of her school time-turner and gets expelled. Severus spends the rest of his life in bitter regret.

Peter in Ravenclaw and Sirius in Hufflepuff are glad they have nothing to do with this.

** 256 permutations...but really only 3 probable scenarios:

1. *All of them are in one house.* Here, most of the situation is relatively similar. Despite the more outlandish examples of each house (e.g. Malfoy, Diggory, the Weasleys), most of the houses are likely similar in social function to one another. Or rather, kids end up friends with people who share similar interests regardless of the environment. I don't buy any of those fics (see practically every Slytherin!Harry fic) where there is some rigid social structure/hierarchy/rulebook in place for how each house functions. They are preteens and teenagers.
2. *Two or more of the marauders are together.* The thing about this is it only really matters in the case of James-Sirius being in the same house, as these two are the relationship the whole group actually centers on. Both are outgoing and reckless personalities, which is why they both hit it off even on the train during 1st year (see DH Ch. 33). Peter is submissive and would simply cling to any group that he could be a part of and/or get protection from. Remus is to scared of ruining what is, in reality, a ridiculously good but risky thing that is letting him attend Hogwarts as a werewolf. Unless there are people as nosy (or reckless depending on your perspective) as James-Sirius around, nobody is likely to care or invest that much time into figuring it out or doing anything about it.
3. *All of them in different houses.* At this point there is literally no point trying to guess what would happen. The truth is they would most likely /not/ be friends, considering it seems like most Hogwarts students form a social group mainly within their own houses, unless they are (1) considered outsiders in their own house (ex. Luna, Albus Severus) or (2) part of some non-house related group or team (basically everything but Quidditch).

What affect would all of this have on canon? This is something that actually annoys me when people quote the whole "butterfly effect" but never really consider the true ramifications of it. If James isn't in the same house as Lily, odds are he would probably have not ended up with her (or he could have dated her earlier and she couldn't deal with his immaturity or what-have-you), and thus Harry wouldn't have been born. Thats just the tip of the iceberg too.

- We don't know who or how the Map was created, so taking even one away from the group could or could not mean the Map is never created.
- If Peter wasn't friends, he probably would never have even been in the Order, much less the Secret Keeper.
- No animagi for the Marauders unless they are in the same house as Lupin, as they would need to be to learn his secret and want to help.

I could go on and on. Basically the answer to your question though is "In about 95% of the possible permutations, nothing would be predictable to any reasonable degree and would depend on lots of factors not known in canon."

** i think there are many answers to this question

if all four are in different houses, i don't see them all becoming friends except james and sirius; their personalities are similar enough that i can see them sticking with each other no matter which house they go in. the only exception to this is if james goes to slytherin and sirius doesn't, because sirius is so anti-slytherin due to his upbringing that i can totally see him cutting james off just like all the Harry's Obnoxious Twins do to harry in WBWL fics.

if two of them are in the same house, they'll become friends as in canon.

if sirius is in slytherin, i can see him either getting his ass kicked by the purebloods or falling in line with his parents beliefs and prioritizing survival over rebellion (i think that's a slytherin trait anyway). if he's anywhere else i imagine he'll end up the same as he did in canon, fighting for the order and rebelling against his parents

if remus is in slytherin his secret would probably be found out, but i can see slytherins using it to their advantage. i can see them blackmailing him and otherwise using him for his intelligence in a similar way to how they used snape, but remus' consequences for not complying would be /much/ worse. if he's in ravenclaw he'd probably be more respected for his intelligence and get the recognition he probably deserves, but otherwise he'd end up the same.

i can't see james going anywhere but gryffindor; i honestly don't think his personality remotely fits any of the other houses.

peter would probably just be the same anywhere he went, falling in line behind his peers, but we don't know very much about him so it could be different. i guess i could see him becoming a death eater if he went to slytherin, but only if he's a pureblood which i'm not certain he is.

​

as for the effects in the far future, other people have mentioned them and you can probably guess them anyway. i don't really feel like explaining them because i don't really find harry's generation interesting
