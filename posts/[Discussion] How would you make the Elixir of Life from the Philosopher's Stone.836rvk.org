So I'm currently writing a fic where one of the subplots is centered around the Philosopher's stone and the Elixir of Life. I know that the Elixir of Life is a potion produced by using the Philosopher's stone but my question is how do you get the potion?

The Philosopher's stone is exactly that... a stone. So how would one essentially extract a potion from a stone?

** Ingredients:

1. Water, about four times the amount of potion you'll be making.
2. A *thick bottomed* cauldron
3. The Philosopher's stone
4. Ashes from a resurrected phoenix

Pour water in the cauldron and boil it for at least 10 minutes. Set fire to simmer. The water must be, physically and magically, ABSOLUTELY sterile. Therefore, cast the strongest *finite incantatem* you can. Now you have an empty cauldron, and no fire, because you used Aguamenti and Incendio earlier. I wouldn't have expected anything more from a dunderhead like you. Put actual water in the cauldron and light a non-magical fire and stop being an embarrassment to the noble art of potion making.

Once the water has been boiled and magically cleansed, add three measures of phoenix ashes and simmer for 7 days. Cast a filter charm to keep contaminants from entering the potion during this time. And by contaminants, I mean dust particles or any stray magical energy. Like the one from the filter charm you just cast. Throw it all away, start anew and this time have the presence of mind to cover the cauldron with a dragonhide lid before you start casting willy nilly around a potion that needs to be MAGICALLY STERILE! 10 points from Gryffindor.

After 7 days, the potion should turn a light shade of silver. Now it is ready for the finishing phase. On that night and no later, using a carefully calibrated hover charm, use the Philosopher's stone as a lens to focus the light of the full moon on to the liquid surface for exactly 394 seconds. A quick change to a blood red colour means that the potion is ready. Pour it into a thoroughly scourgified glass vial and cork it with an oak cork, nothing else.

And now that you have figured out that your 7th day of simmering did not coincide with a full moon, throw everything away and start again. Detention with me for the next...hmmm...14 days.

** I would assume that makeing the actual stone is the hardest part of makeing the elixir of life.

So I would go with useing the stone on water or the persons blood while running magic threw the stone the wat they channel it threw a wand.

** Well that depends on exactly how you turn lead into gold in your story.

Do you hold the stone and touch it to gold and will it? Is there a process? Is the wand involved at all?

I remember vaguely some theory that Harry only survived Voldemort first year because the stone was in contact with Harry.

So perhaps being in contact with the stone let's you manipulate things with alchemy? As well as with your wand, or even potions?

Permanent Transfiguration works perfectly, makes Lead into Gold possible

Some involved process with some kind of vitality potion 'upgrades' it to the Elixer of Life.

You could Transfiguration a dead price of wood back into living wood and grow branches from it.

Kill a Phoenix with it, create one from the ashes of a dead bird.

Growing younger is actually just a aging potion, or de-aging potions brewed with the stone in the cauldron.

The stone added permanence (wink) or perhaps a way of purifying effects of Magic. It's up to you my friend. Personally I like the idea of the stone Unlocking types of magic while holding it, similar to how the Elder wand works

**** Interesting, I'd have gone with holding the stone in the off hand and using wand or main hand using willed magic to make the change happen. Probably a very tiresome process as well.

Perhaps the automatic process with boiling lead and the stone submerged within. Maybe some pieces of a magical creature to provide the magic? It would be like potions experimentation. What kind of dragon gizzards make the change faster?

****** Ohh? That's pretty smart, immortality begets immortality. I find it too limiting though, since most magical creatures seem to have been created at some point in the ancient past.

They just developed into sub categories over time. Like some ancient fire bird was created leads to the Veela race, and the Phoenix, and the Anzu. Dragons had an originally made single ancestor race, they eventually became the races that exist today. Basalisk from regular snakes. Dementors by that necromancer guy who kidnapped muggles on the island before it became Azkaban.

I figure the creation of immortality could be used to make a new Phoenix, or a new Stone. But using the Stone itself could be used as a substitute for making a Phoenix and vice versa.

** it was belived that you could use bezoar to create antidotes for poisons by puting it in a glass of water. you could probably do that with the philosophers stone.

I like to think that you wouldn't use water but rather mercury or something equally poisonous and use the ability of the stone to transmute metals into gold, to ennoble it and turn it into a healthy golden fluid. Basically turning poison into elixir of life.

some ancient European beliefs were that one needed to store the elixir of life in clocks so that it would restore life to the user. so that could also be part of the method to create it.

** I like the concept that only death can pay for life. So the Stone is this powerful alchemical device, sure. But to create the Elixir you need the base Stone and an exponentially increasing cost in lives. So the first time, you need one life. Then, two. Then, four. Then, sixteen. So on until you kill everyone.

** There's a few other steps to it, of course, but the gist of it is that it converts the blood into the elixir of life. The stone soaks up the blood, all that you can offer it. You then heat the stone and a critical component of the elixir oozes out. Too cool and it doesn't come out. Too hot and it evaporates into nothingness. Too much blood, and the stone dissolves during the soaking process. Too little blood and the stone burns during the extraction process. Leave blood in the stone for too long and it explodes. Leave the stone bloodless for too long and it crumbles into dust. (this is why Flamel is the only one known to have successfully made one, you have no idea if you made it correctly until you get /all/ the steps right!)

The ... I dunno, "vital essence" it distills could be used for both elixir of life and turning lead into gold. How dark you want it to be would determine just how much blood you have to use and under what conditions you can obtain it.

Fairly light: Can only use the blood of the creator of the stone.

Really dark: 1 pint of blood forcibly taken from someone who is not alive at the time of absorption per day of vitality (for those keeping track at home, a perfectly harvested and newly made corpse would grant around week of life. Less if them dying partway through the extraction ruins the batch).

Cheeky Bastard: Can use any human blood, runs a medical waste disposal company and cheaply disposes of expired blood from blood banks.

** This is one of those cases where I can't remember if it's something from a fic or canon. I can't remember where I read this, but it's a potion, yes, and it's supposed to be super easy and everybody knows the recipe. The problem is not the potion as such, but the first line of the instructions:

“First, take a philosopher's stone.”

I assumed it was just a catalyst, something you leave in the potion while you make it. In a way that's the joke: making the actual potion is irrelevant, the hard part is the stone

** Well, if you want to go with the actual history of the lapis philosophorum, the actual stone is a red herring. It's a code-word for being so enlightened and transcendent through knowledge of alchemy that you can inherently transmute elements and live forever. ISTR a fic where Riddle manages to get resurrected rather saner than he'd been up to that point, learns this, and due to his experiences of death-and-rebirth (also a feature of old alchemical texts) coupled with already knowing a lot of alchemy AND being a genius is able to complete the Great Work of Alchemy in a matter of weeks. Since I can't recall where the fic went from there I'm going to guess it was in one of the many abandoned fics I've sworn at.

The only catch is that step one is "first you make a philosopher's stone". But once you did that, it's actually quite a simple potion that does not require any other special stuff.

I mean while we don't know how it was created and is used, it would be stupid to assume there would be no safeguards.(reasoning for blood would be that the blood while not necessary for the creating is like a security check to keep the uses limited to only the creators.)

**** You make a good point but we need to remember it isn't outside the realm of possibilities that one who has made the stone once can't actually get the procedure down exactly as its intended to be therefore making it 'comparitively' easy each time the creator makes one more stone......this would also be good in a way as you could pass having one single newly made stone contain from 700 to 800 years and then one would need to recreate the stone so if someone against all odds manages to use the stone he or she still wont ever be !truly! Immortal unless he or she can create a new stone, which also happens to be the pinnacle of alchemy and we can be reasonably sure that its probably Extremely difficult to create the first time.(as we have no idea how exactly one managed the feat simply because as shown in canon we don't really have many stones lying around)
