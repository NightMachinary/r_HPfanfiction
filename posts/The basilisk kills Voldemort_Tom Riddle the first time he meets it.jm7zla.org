Just as the title says: The basilisk doesn't obey Voldemort despite his ancestry and parselmouth ability and simply kills him, which means he's truly dead as a doornail as he's killed before he can make his first horcrux (murdering Myrtle using the basilisk).

Edit: Accidentally killing him with its deadly eyes is also OK.


** Yes please. Let his arrogance kill the idiot as a teenager.

** The basilisk then absorbs all of Riddle's magical powers and his lust for world domination. Oh, no! But somehow, after a long series of wild AU adventures, Luna eventually transforms it into an adorable vampire puppy. Dumbledore/Umbridge HEA.
