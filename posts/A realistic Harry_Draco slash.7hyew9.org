I haven't read good slash in a long time. I'm not looking for porn or fluff. I just want to read something with real life problems & issues, with all characters acting like functioning adults instead of the love besotted fools slash usually depicts them. If the slash part is kept secret in the plotline, then even better.

Or Hey! Just tell me your fav slash fic & why it is your favourite?


** So, sadly, there is a lot of hate for slash on the main sub. I highly recommend [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]] , lots of good drarry posts there!

**** Yeah, it's probably best if you post slash requests there from now on.

Edit: Not sure why this got downvoted. This place hates slash so it's better to post there for proper responses instead of snark and downvotes.

****** As opposed to the awe-inspiring quality of most heterosexual fanfiction, I'm sure.

But whatever, I have no interest in rehashing this argument for the thousandth time. This place does hate it (for whatever reason) so it is better for someone to post in the slash sub where they can have their interests met.

** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7429542/27/]])

Had plausible reasoning for their relationship, beautifully written but angsty until the end. Best I've ever read

*** LOL by realistic I meant a story rooted in the practicalities of life where the relationships of the characters are not the focus, no matter what their orientation. Basically, a story with meat on its bones. And we all know, slash or not, a good fanfic may not always need to be canon to be dubbed a worthy read.

**** The issue with Harry/Draco is that there is no way this pairing could work. Draco did horrible things to Harry and his friends (Katie Bell, Hermione) and was only "redeemed" after he was personally suffering from the choices he made. He had the evidence that the pureblood cause was bullshit right in front of him for 6 years (Hermione besting him in everything, the "mudblood Evans" blasting Voldemort out of his body) and ignored it. He demanded a muggleborn genocide since he was twelve. How could Harry be attracted to that, especially since Draco ought to serve at least a lifetime in Azkaban for his crimes?

***** That's true but then again pairings like Harry/Bellatrix, Draco/Hermione ect extra exist and would no way happen either and yet people ship them. Not meaning to be rude of course, everyone ships different things after all.
