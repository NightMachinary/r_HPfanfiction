I have read a lot of post war fics and next gen fics, but I realize I never read something about Harry's first years on being a father. Anything from Harry finding out Ginny was pregnant or when they first had James, Albus, or Lily. Or just fatherhood in general. Probably something involving how Harry never really had a constant father figure in his life and how he had to deal with that. Any in the family genre basically.


** Strangers at Drakeshaugh isn't exactly what you're requesting, but it is an entertaining read about Harry and Ginny moving from London into the country and how they handle family life while Harry is working on a stressful murder case as an auror.

What sets the story apart is it's told by a muggle neighbor that's way too nosy for her own good. Jacqui is a fantastic OC and her interactions with the very strange Potter/Weasley family are both humorous and very genuine, propelled by Jacqui's own flaw(?) of not knowing when to mind her own business.

At first Jacqui forms a friendship with Ginny based on both of their sons attending the same muggle school and as a defense against the local gossip queen, but as Harry's murder case becomes puts more and more stress on the Potter family and spills over into the muggle world, Jacqui becomes a lot more involved than she ever expected.
