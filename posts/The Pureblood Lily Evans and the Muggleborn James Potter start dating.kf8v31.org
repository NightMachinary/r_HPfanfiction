** Now I have questions. Is Vernon a Wizard? Is he a Blood Purest? Does he support Voldemort? Do Vernon and Petunia take Harry in? Do they go behind a Fidelus for 10 years? Or do they go Mugler? Would Vernon even consider that? Is Harry treated better then cannon because his Aunt and Uncle have magic? I realize this is a prompt about Lily and James switching magical lineage but it changes everything!!!

*** Vernon is a blood purist. James potter is mocked often in the household.

Sirius black was kicked out much much earlier in canon for daring to become best friends with a filthy muggleborn.

he still ran away to the potters, who where rich due to owning a haircare company.

James potter would be a figure of scorn in pureblood circles, afterall he managed to cause a rift in the house of evans and the house of black.

you could also have snape be a childhood friend of James, only for them to slowly lose the friendship at hogwarts.

or you could have the snapes live close to the magical evans family.

*** and yet.. it does not

Vernon hated his nephew. forced to live as a Muggle by Albus dumbledore, his wife was a pure blood for Merlins sake. so he made sure his nephew suffered.
