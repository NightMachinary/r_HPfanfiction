:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
From memories it's a Time-travel, Fem!harry(not sure on this point), where Professor Merrythought organizes duel practises and Harry conjures her Patronus and order it to ram Riddle Jr. I think this the only fiction I ever read where a Patronus could be used to do some physical damage.

Does it ring a bell to anyone?

Edit: If it help I think I read it on Ao3.


** The only story i have read with a Professor Merrythought is Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart

**** Actually it's a great fic to read if you want to read almost every single trope that exists in a single story.

Of course, i've started it several times but never yet have gotten too far let alone "finish it".

this has a time-traveling fem!harry who can produce a solid patronus. i'm not sure if she ever used it to attack riddle though.

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership.

**** Thanks for the help, but that's not *When Harry Met Tom*. I just briefly reread it and there is not such kind of scene in it.
