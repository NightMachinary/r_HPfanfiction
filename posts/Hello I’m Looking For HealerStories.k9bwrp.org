Either gen or drarry

Long or medium in word count range, so nothing below 20000 words unless there‘s reason

I‘m doing this because I want to write a Healer!drarry fic, and am doing ‘research'

more information available if needed

** I'm really sorry that I can't remember what it's called, but there's a /great/ oneshot about why the Death Eaters never attacked St. Mungo's. All healers take a modified version of the Hippocratic Oath, and it allows them to magically reverse any and all treatment someone has recieved via magical means.

** Think there might be one called Practicing Liars where it's also Severitus in addition to Drarry? By Lomonareon (I'm so sorry I can never spell this author's name right! They're one of my favorite authors, too!)
