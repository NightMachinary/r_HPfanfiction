  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** "A second chance at life", it's sequel "Changes in a time of war", and the last book in the series sadly incomplete and not having been updated in a decade I think it's safe to say it's been abandoned, "A magical world".

These are written by Miranda Flairgold [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/100447/Miranda-Flairgold][(FFN)]] and can be found on her profile.

** If you don't mind HP/LV, then [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12228520/1/Consuming-Shadows][Consuming Shadows]] fits your request very well.

Lilly escapes with Harry on the night of Voldemort's attack at Godric's Hollow. She raises him in France in secret, teaching him to maintain a false identity so that Voldemort's people, who hunted them for years, will never know that they are still alive. The Triwizard Tournament eventually forces Harry back to England along with his Beauxbatons classmates. Lilly is disturbed when she begins to realize that Harry no longer thinks of his false identity as a mask.
