Could you perhaps point me in the direction of stories where the Death Eaters get conclusively stomped?

Lord of Caer Azkaban and Old Soldiers Never Die by Rorschach's Blot for example.


** The question is: By who? Are they just generally incompetent and hanging on Voldy's coattails to get by, or is Harry going Super Sayan?

Both are rather delicious crack.

*** The latter (linkffn(11634921)) 'Itachi, is that a baby?' is so hilariously funny, with the most unique (and outright /best/) Dumbledore characterisation I've ever seen in fanfiction. The author's own note at the end of chapter two sums it up best:

'Some of you (and I hope this is everyone) have noticed a certain cavalier attitude in Dumbledore. This is partly the result of the somewhat crack-ish nature of the story and partly a decision I came to as I was writing Dumbledore's intro-speech. I decided Dumbledore is just seeing how far he can go around the bend before someone calls him out. So far, he's disappointed in them.'

You don't need to know much about Naruto to enjoy this fic, just know this: specialised/powerful shinobi superpowers occasionally come in handy-dandy body parts (like eyes), and some of the upper-level techniques in their universe can one-shot cities. Harry's not quite there, but he has a few of those people as his 'uncles': a band of batshit (although that seems to be quite common among higher-class Naruto shinobi), super-powerful shinobi who want to take over/subjugate/introduce an era of terrified peace to under threat of MAD/destroy the world (depending on who you're asking, and whether they're letting you live or not. Some are also just in it for shits and giggles, or money).

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** In my story "Uncle Quentin's Spy", Dumbledore shows them why he's the only one Voldemort ever feared. That's the Death Eaters, though - Voldemort himself is not quite that easily stomped. And it's not that the Death Eaters are incompetent - Dumbledore and others like him are just a class or three above them.

*** I loved this story. Have you ever considered writing a sequel with Harry and Hermione showing up in Sunydale post Hogwarts graduation? I'd really like to read that, being a huge BtVS fan.

**** I'm planning to write the sequel with pretty much that plot (set in Season 3) after I finish "Richard Castle, Watcher".
