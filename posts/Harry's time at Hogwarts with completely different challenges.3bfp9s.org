Can anyone recommend stories detailing Harry's wizarding school years with no Philosopher's Stone, no Chamber of Secrets, no Triwizard Tournament, etc.?

Re-hashing the same challenges over and over again is somewhat tiring and takes away from the surprise and suspense.


** linkffn(The Temporal Beacon)

It's a time travel fic that involves multiple trips through time in what is without a doubt the most original and well done time travel story i've ever read. The original tasks are different from Canon and change each trip. (Just realised that you didn't just refer to the TWT but i'm leaving this cause it's awesome).

linkffn(Death Before Dishonour by SuperNova26). Harry in Slytherin, only 30,000 words and starts in 6th year but involves Harry running an underground trading ring,

linkffn(The Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19)

*If you only read one of these read this.* Slytherin has taken over and is immortal and it involves a warped canon with castes instead of houses, the caste mascot is tattooed on your arm like a dark mark, seriously this is stupidly good.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]] (W: 194,707; Complete) --- all the vanilla quests still happen, but mostly in the background because Harry (who isn't the prophecy-boy) has other things to worry about.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][The Firebird Trilogy]] (W: 494,107; Complete) --- the magical and social systems, as well as many characters, are in complete overhaul in this story. Some parallels still exist, but the story fits your request.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][HP & MoR]] (W: 661,619; Complete) --- similar to Firebird, the story goes on an original development almost from the beginning.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

***** The trope of Lily and James ignoring Harry and siblings and only focusing on the BWL!OC. It's jarring, unrealistic, lazy, and immature to write that way. It's bad enough in the fics where Lily and James forget about their other kids, it's even worse when they're actively hostile.

Sure, there are people in the real world that act this way towards their kids, but the characters of Lily and James Potter as presented canonically would never act this way. This trope is just a lazy way of putting some conflict and angst in the story in a manner that is neither successful nor original.

From a meta- standpoint, I'd say that the it is simply trying to focus on other things, maybe regarding the general starting background not important enough to divulge into it deeper than your slightly above-average hand wave.
