Hedwig? Swap her for Archimedes the Highly Educated Owl.

Scabbers? Swap in Reepicheep! No, I don't know where Peter Pettigrew would be then.

Crookshanks? How about Garfield?

The Hungarian Horntail in the First Task? How about Spyro?

The basilisk?...Maybe Kaa from the Jungle Book?

Firenze the centaur? Chiron from the Percy Jackson series (who, yes, I know, is based on Greek mythology).

Dobby the house-elf? Austin Powers' Mini-Me!

But yeah, that's just what I'm imagining. What the heck happens to the plot when you have a bunch of characters from completely different books/films/games drop in?

...But seriously, this kind of fic does have some precedent.

The Infinite Loops series had a lot of cases of some characters replacing others or in other cases entire settings being fused together, in between its countless incidences (literally, there's thousands) of Peggy Sue.

One occasion had 13 dragons from different stories (and Leah Clearwater from Twilight) replacing the dwarves and Gandalf in The Hobbit. They claimed Erebor had been taken over by a giant mecha-dwarf.
