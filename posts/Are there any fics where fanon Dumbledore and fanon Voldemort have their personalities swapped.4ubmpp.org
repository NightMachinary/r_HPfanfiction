What I'm looking for is something where Voldemort is now rambling, incoherent and incompetently manipulative and Dumbledore crucio's students for being late to class, not bowing low enough or brushing past him in the hallway and teachers for their students errors.


** Oh boy.

/"I forgot something from my dormito-"/

/"Crucio!"/

** I know of one that sounds similar but it's Dramione. Essentially Riddle is leader of Order style opposition and Dumbledore is the big baddy. Let me know if you'd like me to find it ðŸ˜Š

** *Inverted*, linkffn(4849382): Dumbledore was the insane dark lord who wanted to brainwash everyone for his 'greater good', while Tom Riddle the Headmaster attempted to resist him. Weasleys and Hermione were very evil; Potters and Bellatrix were good.

*** There's a little button under posts labelled "save" that I've found really useful for this sort of thing. It adds the post to a giant list of everything you've clicked "save" on.

You can access the list by going to your user overview and clicking the "saved" option in the list of tabs where you click "submissions," "comments" and "gilded."
