Why hasn't there been a time travel or any kind of relationship between Harry Potter and Alice long bottom it's legit never been done before there's Narcissca, Bellatrix Andromeda Amelia Bones even Lily there's a lot of things you could work with


** Is there really that much potential though? She would just be an Order of the Phoenix/Auror OC as she is only name dropped in canon. Also while we don't know how old she was, you would have to go back to before she was married (unless for some reason you wanted to do an adultery plot) so even the couple of things we know about her from canon would have to be retconned.

** Here's another not done time Travel idea. This is actually a prompt I made a while ago. Basically Harry and Dumbledore time travel to the Marauders 7th year and this is in peggy sue style so Dumbledore is in his slightly younger body but since Harry doesn't exist yet he is in the body he originally was.

Harry barges into the great halls and yells at Dumbledore while everyone else freaks out and Dumbledore is very calm. Then calls Harry his apprentice.

I would link the prompt I made but I'm on mobile
