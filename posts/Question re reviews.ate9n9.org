I guess this is two part. I recently posted my latest fic and got pretty good reviews/comments. I usually don't pay attention to bad ones unless it's constructive. Today I got one that was a flame and it was down right cruel. It was creative I'll give them that. I think it came more down to the pairing than the fic itself but who knows?

My questions: To writers - when getting a review like that how do you bring yourself back and say f*** it and keep going? To readers - When leaving what prompts you to do it? And if you have ever left a flame like that why did you do it? (Not looking to judge just understand)

TIA

Edit: new chapter new troll good stuff


** If someone leaves a flame, I assume they're an arsehole and keep writing because the opinion of arseholes do not matter.

Alternately, you can do it as a matter of spite. They don't like your writing? Make more, just to piss them off!

But really, unless there is anything actually constructive and pertinent in the review, just ignore it. Even if something they said seems constructive, step back and be sure that [a] it truly is constructive, and [b] you want to take the advice of someone who couldn't even manage to be kind to a stranger on the internet.

Anti-pairing flames are entirely too common. You'd think people who have time to trash on their NOTPs would have time to find and read fics they actually like. Seems a less stressful use of their time, too.

*** I have been writing on and off for years now so I'm no stranger to a negative review but in one line this person told me to skin myself. To say I was a tad shaken is an understatement. Just seems like a waste of time to even write it really.

**** That is unpleasant. Sorry you had to endure that. And yes, a total waste of time.

** I try to look at the bright side, which is that it increases my review number in the end.

** I sulk and think about how unfair life is for a while, And then I find that I move on pretty swiftly. Something I've definitely learnt is to never respond. You'll never reason with someone like that and they won't feel guilty. Just remind yourself of what a bitter, lame ass person they must be.

** I don't understand why anyone would post a flame as a review of a piece of fanfiction.

There are a few times I've posted a review that was mostly negative but those always concentrated on what I thought was wrong with the story and had nothing to do with the author. If there's literally nothing I can find positive then I just won't post a review.

As for receiving reviews... if I started to get a majority of negative comments then I'd sit up and take notice but if it's just a one-off then I'd ignore it and move on. No point trying to please all the people all the time.

** You get used to it after a while. After a few of them, there's no need to do any emotional pick-me-ups on yourself because even the most creative troll just makes you roll your eyes and think they're pathetic.

** I've got a pretty tough skin courtesy of my job, so I usually see if there's legit criticism in a bad review and if not, I ignore it. Life's too short to let trolls ruin my day.

If it's a pairing criticism, I sometimes take a flame as a compliment, especially for an oddball pairing - if somebody's that afraid my fic exists (and might get people to like the pairing), I'm probably doing a good job with characterization and storytelling.

** As a writer, I'm not sure my methods would help anyone else. I'm a very critical person, so when someone, violently or otherwise, points out all the flaws or calls my choices cringe-worthy or idiotic, there's a good chance I've already seen the flaws myself. And if not, if they're ranting about pairing or the base premise of the story or something that's set in stone and not going to change, then I'll tell them as much. 'Thanks for your feedback, but this is what the story is about and it's not going to change. Hope you find something out there more to your tastes.'

I won't say I'm immune to negative feedback, but so far the positive has outweighed the negative sufficiently that I have a good mental buffer of 'this person just isn't the right audience, good riddance while I write for the people who are.'

​

There is no such thing as a universal story. What one person loves, another will hate. There's no getting around it. And the better you are at it, the more focused your writing becomes, the more polarizing it will become. That's just how it works.

​

​

As a reader, I can think of very few times when I was inclined to violently depart a story, and I don't think I ever actually followed through. The fact is, my kind and encouraging critiques destroy enough writers as it is, I'd hate to see what happened if I stopped holding back.

Thankfully, I'm really not the sort of person who'd deliberately destroy lives. Only accidentally.

** 1. You've got to have thick skin. Putting stuff out there on the anonymous internet is always going to come with the possibility of undeserved negativity.

2. I try to reply to each an every one of my reviews. I think the readers tend to like seeing the author engaging with them, but even moreso, it helps me deal with some people that can be rather vicious. However DO NOT feed the flames! Don't try to argue with them. Say something like, "Sorry you didn't like the story, but nothing is going to please everyone. I hope you find something that's more to your liking."

3. Write for your own enjoyment first and foremost. If you're looking to get affirmation from the internet, you're going to be disappointed and it's going to drain your enjoyment. Write for yourself. If others happen to like it, that's just a bonus.

** I've never had any difficulty in ignoring the 'go kill urslef' type of flame because they are completely irrelevant, have nothing to do with the story and say more about the reviewer. But I did have a couple of well aimed and cruel reviews which absolutely ripped my writing apart and I never have really got over those.

I'm writing more than ever, but not fanfiction anymore, and to this day those reviews are like little devils on my shoulder telling me I can't write and shouldn't bother trying. That reviewer came from Reddit. I sometimes wonder if he ever thinks about the damage he did and if he's proud or ashamed of it.
