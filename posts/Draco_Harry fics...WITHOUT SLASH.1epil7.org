It has a sequel as well.

** The sequel to HP and the Psychic Serpent is AU with Harry and Draco as best friends who grew up together. I'm on the last leg if the series (not including the prequel) and it's fantastic! Not to far off from canon either, aside from the sequel anyways. I would link by I'm on my phone.

** I have never read any dramonie since I generally don't like reading about the amazing bouncing ferret, so obviously I can't recommend anything with that pairing.

However, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6518287/1/Growing-Up-Black][Growing up Black]] is a great story, that I would heartely recommend. It is currently a WIP.

** "They Shook Hands" is a pretty good rewrite of 4+ books with Slytherin!Harry.

Some shorter ones with grown up Harry and Draco:

** Dramione. Heh. I forgot about that pairing. Reminded me I was planning Luna/Draco and Hermione/Xenophilius stories before I started writing in a different fandom . . .

** I haven't read any HP fanfiction, really, but if you're going to try any web-searches for this thing I'd highly recommend typing it as, "Draco/Harry Friendship."
