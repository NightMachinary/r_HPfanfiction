I think a lot of people think Phoenix are the animal of the Light. Mostly because he was the pet of Dumbledore.

Is that true ? Did Rowling said something like that ?

Voldemort has a wand with Phoenix feather. So if this animal is virtuous it should not have been possible ?


** Fawkes is definitely a good character. Much like Hedwig is a good character. Fawkes helps Harry slay the basilisk and heals him. Fawkes helps his master escape and weeps when Dumbledore dies. This phoenix is definitely a virtuous and loyal figure.

The phoenix of mythology, however, is a bit different. It really depends what era or what worldview you'd like to take as basis for your interpretation. The very first mention of a phoenix was as a "Benu" in ancient egypt. The Greeks would then continue the mythos with the phoenix and the creature continues to be a part of everyday vocabulary (and stories).

The original interpretation or symbolism of the phoenix was as a herald of cycles. The cycle of Day and Night, of the moon, of the year or even longer cycles. The Benu represented the coming of the harvest after the flood of the nile in August. Once the egyptian lands were fertile again, the Benu came reborn from his stay in the north. The phoenix was eventually seen as born from Osiris ashes (note: Osiris is the god of the afterlife, rebirth and the nile) to live a long life and then build a nest from where it is reborn again. Late ancient Greeks saw the phoenix as a symbol of rebirth, rather detached from the god Osiris. The Christians later saw it as a symbol for resurrection, as seen on many depictions in medieval churches and drawings. Note that Rebirth and resurrection are two different things. The one makes the cycle start again (as a baby), the other lets something continue from where it ended.

Knowing that we can deduct that the phoenix in HP is more a greek interpretation than a christian. Fawkes too is transformed into an egg and reborn as a small phoenix-hatchling, rather than resurrected.

So, *tl;dr:* Phoenixes are neither good nor bad, inherently. They represent rebirth and the continuum of cycles and time itself. They also represent a form of eternity of being, something Dumbledore also believed in so much that he gave his life, knowing that he would find something beyond the realm of the living, where a new cycle of his existence would begin.

*** Thank you for your a swear.

So the Phoenix is an animal, powerful one. The chosen wizard don't have to be the parangon of vertue, like dumbledore was.

It's true that with DH we learn that dumbledore made mistake et was remorseful. He was a manipulative git on the name of the greater good.

** u/kyella14:
#+begin_quote
  The phoenix is a gentle creature that has never been known to kill and eats only herbs. Like the Diricawl (see page 9), it can disappear and reappear at will. Phoenix song is magical; it is reputed to increase the courage of the pure of heart and to strike fear into the hearts of the impure.
#+end_quote

Excerpt from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (the book).

I would say they are creatures of 'Light' from this description. Inherently good, they never kill, and are symbols of purity of heart at the very least. Very 'Light-based' traits.

As for Voldemort, here is an excerpt from Pottermore about phoenix feather cores:

#+begin_quote
  Phoenix feather wands are always the pickiest when it comes to potential owners, for the creature from which they are taken is one of the most independent and detached in the world. These wands are the hardest to tame and to personalise, and their allegiance is usually hard won.
#+end_quote

It doesn't really suggest anything about whether the witch/wizard that a phoenix feather wand chooses is good or bad. If you read the descriptions of the other two wand cores (unicorn and dragon heartstring) on Pottermore, you'll also find that the phoenix feather wand core appears to be the most neutral of the three cores. At least, that's how I saw it.

Either way, wandlore seems to often be very vague and open to a lot of interpretations. The wand chooses the witch or wizard but I don't recall anywhere mentioning that the wand is a reflection of the witch or wizard it chose. The way Ollivander talks about wands, it's almost as if they're alive and have some form of sentience, and looking at Pottermore, there is also a suggestion that wands can cultivate personalities of their own--not very distinct ones, of course, but enough so that I doubt that wandlore ever boils down to a certain core equating to an impossibility, only an increase or decrease in the likelihood of a wand selecting a witch/wizard.

Hope this made sense.

*** Gentle creature? Didn't Fawkes scratch out the basilisk's eyes? Given the circumstances, that sounds more like 'virtuous hero' than 'gentle critter'.

** As far as wand lore, you can't just take the core as gospel; you must also consider the wand wood. Voldemort has a yew and Phoenix feather wand, the yew's connection to death strengthening and emphasizing the Phoenix's rebirth aspect to make a wand good for necromancy. In contrast, Harry's holly wand is more aligned with the light and healing embodied by the Phoenix.
