:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi I'm just trying to find a fic that I read quite a while ago. It's the graveyard scene during 4th year and it's just fine over and over again bit Harry is different each time.

One time he has the same brain and personally as Sherlock Holmes. Another I believe he was like Moriarty. Those are the only two I remember but I'm pretty sure there were many many chapters and each some was basically 'how it should have ended' 4th year.

If anyone has any idea that would be great.

Thank you!

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.
