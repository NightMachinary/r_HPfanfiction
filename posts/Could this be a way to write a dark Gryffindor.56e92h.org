I see alot of Gryffindor's being douches but not evil. I wonder if since the trait of a Gryffindor is courage. A Gryffindor who is dark would have the courage to openly act as such. I mean that is courage right or am I messing up that word with what I'm trying to say. Instead of being a subtle Slytherin one could write a loud Gryffindor but just as dark.

Basically my point is I am tired of dark harry being blatantly Slytherin. Why not make him still show that Gryffindor courage but be dark at the same time.


** Gryffindors and Slytherins aren't all one way. That being said Slytherin is about ambition and cunning subtlety has nothing to do with it.

One of my favorite dark Harry fics is The Sum of Their Parts which is Gryffindor Harry.

** being open about there dark magic habbits is more of a fan cliche that sets it up as a separate culture and power. 'dark wizards have a reasonable reason for what they do,' and such. in cannon a dark wizard is someone who kills and tortures to get there way, or wants too. i imagine a dark-griff would be someone who went to war like a general, or possibly like a bunch of vikings. just go off and kill and pillage the people who don't want to work for you. less speeches and games.

** So you want a version of Harry that decides to emulate Genghis Khan or Attila The Hun by leading from the front and killing everyone?

** I think that while a Gryffindor (dark or not) is far more likely to lead from the front than a Slytherin, that's not the critical distinction. We see unsubtle Slytherins (e.g., Draco) and Slytherins who lead from the front (e.g., Voldemort); and we see subtle Gryffindors who can scheme with the best of them (e.g. Dumbledore and Hermione).

In my opinion, the critical distinction is a that a dark Gryffindor would do dark things to make the world a better place (whether the world wants it or not), whereas a dark Slytherin would do dark things for personal power, social position, and just plain stability and comfort for him and his or for her and hers.

To make a dark Gryffindor, take Dumbledore at 17, and kill off Arianna in a way that, rather than filling him with guilt and fear of his own power, reaffirms his belief that wizards should rule over the Muggles, so that he joins Grindelwald in their plans for the Greater Good.

Or, take Hermione and show her vividly that the wizarding society in general and the Ministry in particular is fundamentally rotten, with no hope of fixing it by working within the system. (Once scenario I like is a divergence in CoS, where Hagrid does not survive his stay in Azkaban, and there are no consequences for Fudge for sending him to his death: most people just shrug about it --- a penniless, wandless, uncouth half-giant who wasn't that great a wizard even before he was expelled evokes pity, but no action; Dumbledore regrets it deeply but isn't willing to take the matter into his own hands since he sees it as retribution; and even the other Gryffindors just want to move on.)

*** Even postwar canon facts could support a 'Dark Gryffindors' takeover.

It's very likely that their generation was totally fed up by the failures of their predecessors, and wanted to do things THEIR WAY. Core DA members had to come to an understanding after the War, that things in Magical Britain were no longer sustainable and revolutionary changes had to take place. This mindset provided the ideological underpinning of their movements, which centered around Hermione and Harry.

I don't think they would just become your average corrupt politicians, but ruthless revolutionaries who gave up an almost perfect public image (model families, modest living). They ran on great sounding platforms (equality, justice, love, peace, and prosperity), had hordes of hardcore followers (DA, Quidditch fans, Hogwarts graduates, werewolves, fanboys/girls), turned the military/police (the DMLE) into their private army, became filthy rich (confiscated Death Eater wealth, memory charmed Muggles, Weasley owned businesses, royalties from their 'heroic deeds'), dominated the public media (Ginny was the real force behind The Daily Prophet, Luna owned the next largest publication), were utterly merciless to their enemies (real and perceived), and most importantly, firmly believed what they were doing was right and necessary to protect their 'loved ones'.

Once you have control of the police, the media, and the street, there are lots of options in how you can deal with your enemies. You don't even need to get your hands dirty, just let your followers know whom you don't like, and they will take care of things for you. Meanwhile, Hermione would be the calm, thoughtful, considerate leader who seemed really nice, while Harry would be the brave, energetic, and powerful hero who kept everyone safe.

As someone said eloquently, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

** One of the fics I loved when first began reading was Lord of the Werewolves, which is a Canon Divergence from Bill and Fleur's wedding and follows a darker Remus.

He goes from follower to leader of the werewolves in a convincing manner, but I can't remember more beyond him preventing Kingsley to sit at the minister's chair before complying to his (and the werewolves') conditions.
