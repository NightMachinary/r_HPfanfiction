#+TITLE: Forget crumple-horned snorkacks - are there any stories where Luna's *conspiracy theories* turn out to be correct, and not just her belief in cryptids?

Was the Rotfang Conspiracy a real group absorbed by the Death Eaters in Voldemort's rise to power? Was "Stubby Boardman" an alias Sirius used while he was on the run from the law? Has Cornelius Fudge been consuming goblin flesh in the hopes of absorbing their supernatural authority over the economy?

Anything goes, crack or otherwise!


** Years ago I remember a crackfic set in OoTP where they met/ended up having to run from an army of heliopaths (I dont remember if they just saw them or turned and ran)

I have no idea of other plot points and a quick search doesnt show me anything I recognize.

** Try Harry Potter, Unexpected Animagus by DWDuck. It has Sirius as Boardman and the King of the goblins with a stage name of David (as in Bowie) which also works in a Labyrinth reference.

  With the love of a good woman, Harry becomes more confident and learns to handle the embarrassment that comes from being a teenage boy as well as an unexpected animagus.  Set during the Tri-Wizard Tournament.  Severe Ron bashing ahead.  Rated M for crude language, even cruder humour, and sexual situations

  Harry letting himself get hit by Voldemort's killing curse had slightly different results in this particular AU!

** I remember a fic with her father being sort of a spy/opposition informant and while the conspiracy theories from Quibbler were not true they were secret messages about real things.
