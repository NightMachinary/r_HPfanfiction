  If you are afraid of death so much, why don't you make your Horcruxes (OUT OF RANDOM OBJECTS!), hide them (IN RANDOM PLACES!), and go sip margaritas on a remote island under the Fidelius?
#+end_quote

I strongly suspect that the receptacle for a piece of your soul would need to be something so valuable to you that it could be considered as part of you. Even if Tom Riddle wasn't fond of collecting trophies, he wouldn't be able to create a horcrux out of some mundane, one-of-thousands item.

As to where he was storing them, at least half were placed in guarded locations with limited access. The only one he missed using was the Chamber of Secrets, and he may have felt that it was too obvious- a legendary place at the legendary school, known to be associated with his ancestor and the founder of his House. By contrast, the Room of Requirement would have seemed ideal. No one knew of it aside from the elves (or so he thought) but even being stored in there, it was masked by the surrounding thousands of enchanted items that would confound anyone who didn't know exactly what they were looking for.

As for his ambitions, Voldemort was on a quest to prove himself greater than any other. He sacrificed elements of his humanity to make him stronger, less vulnerable to common frailties like emotional attachments or aging.

Another possibility is that Voldemort just didn't have time to get to the Chamber on the visit he deposited the Diadem in the Room of Requirement.

2) Power

EDIT: And I'm not sure I would call canon Voldemort /insane/ outside of the whole splitting his soul thing. Yes, he has temper issues and is very ruthless and cruel but he is still highly rational. I mean, after Dumbledore dies, it takes less than what, three or four months to take over Wizarding Britain and would have succeeded forever if Malfoy the Elder wasn't an absolute shit and slipped the Diary-horcrux into Ginny Weasley's school books.

** If he had come across a rare and extremely dark magic to make him immortal, why would he use random objects? Voldemort habitually found the best of everything, from knowledge to magic, and even his death eaters, and either lorded it over his followers to inspire fear and awe, or if it was very valuable, kept it close at hand. And since this was the catalyst to making his ambitions a reality, of course he made it as significant as possible. He wouldn't have put his soul in a box marked do not open and dug a hole six feet deep. He chose powerful and/or very significant items, which he felt were the only proper items to hold his soul. I don't think of Voldemort as insane. He is driven, cruel, sadistic. He fears, I think, losing the power he has attained and his influence, more so than the act of dying. He has risen so far and could not stand to become less, to become obsolete. He's delusional, maybe, and has a skewed view of value, but that's why he is a wonderful juxtaposition for Harry.

**** I almost wonder if, half-dead and half-Quirrell as he was, a big part of the incompetence during the first book was just a lack of processing power. His soul was still around, but his brain didn't come along with that, and sharing with Quirrell can't have helped. Of course, think too hard about the nuts and bolts of life and death and souls and magic, and how all of that interacts with our scientific understanding of the brain, and you'll end up in Methods of Rationality-land.

******* Doesn't young-adult mean twenties? Wikipedia (I know, not much of a reliable site but I'll rest my case this once) says that "young adult" ranges from 20 - 39 (and sometimes 40). However, it would've been really interesting to see how the story would've played out if Voldemort tried to take over Wizarding Britain in a peaceful way.

** There is a reason Tom Riddle is my favorite character in Harry Potter. He is the most complex character in the series. Period.

His motivation is actually complex. He craves to be the most powerful. He craves to be the most important. He craves attention. When he was a child he was one of many. He was bullied, teased, and he eventually grew to be different. He was never respected as a child, but he felt what it was like to be feared. He grew to associate power, to safety. He associates fear with respect.

Just like every other orphan on earth, he wants to be safe, and respected in a world he feels has abandoned him. Fast forward to Hogwarts. Even there surrounded by those with the same abilities as him, he is an outcast, an anomaly. What takes others weeks to understand he gets in hours or days. At the same time his muggle raised status makes him a target of hatred. He is teased... Tormented... Until he lashes out again. Suddenly people fear him. They respect him.

However he discovers that once you are dead... All of that disappears. No one cares about you if you arent around. Its part of the reason he has his death eaters swear undying loyalty.

He craves to never be alone, never to be unrecognized, never to be powerless. That is why he craves immortality. Voldemort never dismissed love, he never understood it. He didnt see the point in it. Fear and respect and hatred served him well for 70 years. Why the hell would he need love? And if he did, well he can find it when he is ruling the world as he has eternity to search.

#+end_quote

It's plausible within HP canon that making horcruxes out of powerful items, binding portions of one's soul to them, provides benefits beyond simply being soul containers. This could provide a rational explanation (beyond Dumbledore's observations of his temperament, which I've never found particularly compelling) for Voldemort's seeking out Founders' relics.

As far as motivation, Voldemort sought power above all; his comments to Harry in /HP & the Philosopher's Stone/ underscore this. Power comes in many forms, but it's safe to say that his stranglehold over the Wizarding world's government and culture, with him at the top, evinces a high degree of competence. His creation of horcruxes were a means of exacting power over death. Even some of his seemingly irrational actions (e.g., casting the Cruciatus on his own followers) can be understood if one views them from the lens of his establishing his power base and striking fear in the hearts of those who might be tempted to betray him.

Ego is required of one who would seek such power. (See every politician since forever.) Ego is also required for a mastery of magic at the level that he presented.

** It all comes down to power. Voldemort's life has been nothing but a chain of events where he has been shown by everyone and everything around him that those who have power over him will use it to hurt him. Every time this has happened he's retreated farther into his hate and anger as a means of self-protection, to be able to drown out the feelings of humiliation and weakness he filled himself with hate and anger and the desire to destroy everything that could possibly make him feel like those in his youth made him feel.

Think about it, in his youth he was bullied in the orphanage, he was ignored and scolded and possibly punished by its staff. nobody was there to show him love as far as we know. Then Albus Dumbledore comes around and dashes the small hope of acceptance by treating him essentially the same as the staff of the orphanage. Worse, he shows him that to truly be powerful he will have to overcome the tremendous command over reality that Albus Dumbledore holds. No wonder that until his death he was the only one Voldemort was ever afraid of right? He was his measuring stick from the beginning, one he could never quite overcome.

His life from that point onward has been set in stone more or less. Sorted into slythertin where the only way to overcome his disadvantage was to cultivate power over others, and then when he had it, of course it became an addiction to him, one he reveled in. One he felt the need to change his name for to signify that he was now the one who held the strings.

That's Lord Voldemort.

The horecruxes are him extending this to death itself. Without death, he imagines that no power can possibly become his downfall anymore, and that's all he cares about.

** Regarding horcruxes, I like the interpretation that the value of your soul is great enough that it is impossible to create one with an insignificant (for you) object, through an insignificant act, and that it basically must be stored in a place with a meaning for you. Creating one through murdering a random muggle, using a rock and hidding it at the bottom of the Atlantic is basically not possible.\\
Your horcrux is an anchor for your immortality : the kill used must have a meaning in your pursuit of immortality, the item chosen an origin that represent another form of immortality (for exemple : the last relic of a founder of a thousand year-old school, in which each year the nalme of said founder is given to a bunch of 11 years old, that's a form of immortality), the place you put it, and the defences around, must represent your path to immortality. It is not a sock used for portkey (which is already easier to create with an item representig a form of travel).

** I think he had a plan that was never explained. He wasn't *supposed* to turn into a weak shade like that, barely able to possess Q. Clearly Voldemort didn't expect what happened after trying to kill Harry, and his followers didn't either. They were prepped for...something, we're never told what, but V was meant to return much, much faster.

He told his followers /something/ that made them believe he'd be right back, even if it /looked/ like he'd died.

And that didn't happen. Whatever thing went down with Harry wasn't the plan. Voldemort /expected/ to die at some point. He feared death too much not to plan against it. Maybe he did die, and his followers saw the aftermath and his resurrection. Maybe it happened multiple times.

But in any case, V surely planned for his own potential "death". And that plan didn't work.

My guess is, he was meant to do the same thing the diary did, just much, much faster, and maybe with his follower's help.

Like this:

- Voldemort dies. Oh poo.
- PowerfulShade!Voldemort finds a follower, takes them over/tells them to find a horcrux.
- Voldemort instant resurrects, possibly killing a follower in the process, possibly not because he's a PowerfulShade

I'd like to think Voldemort had some sort of plan. And that plan requried the horcruxes to be accessible to his followers--and possibly other people if all his Death Eaters were arrested or killed.

Otherwise, it's just a story of Death Eaters being stupid, Voldemort being really stupid, and the Good Guys getting absurdly lucky.

Like, a lot.

**** Having a Horcrux doesn't keep your physical body from dying in canon. I can't emphasize that enough. Voldemort had to know this, as he doesn't tank magic spells to the face for fun. He knows his body can be killed, even with Horcruxes.

But being stuck without a body forever would be a fate worse than death, especially for someone like Voldemort.

The point of making Horcruxes isn't to prevent yourself from dying in the first place, or even preventing your soul from passing on to the canon afterlife, but to allow you /as you/ to come back to life *immediately*. He needs to be at least near them to come back to life.

Both times, first year and the ritual, he is near a Horcrux--one in the castle, the diadem, the other at the hut down the street from the graveyard, the ring.

Voldemort isn't fleeing from death itself, he's fleeing from /consequences/. The Horcruxes are his way back, to avoid consequences. He needs them safe but accessible for a reason, and I think that reason is that they are key to his resurrections.

** 1 word. Control.

It sounds odd considering its Voldemort who is considered somewhat insane, but at the end of the day he wants to control everything. He wants to control whether someone lives or dies, who is in charge, who has power and who doesn't, and so on.

It likely stems from him feeling a lack of control of his life early on, not knowing who he was, what he was, and feeling controlled by others before entering the magical world. And then upon entering the magical world, while he discovers a new life and things become more clear in terms of who he is, that control from others still exists, gates are still closed to him.

Wanting power comes out of wanting control. Using purebloods under an agenda that covers up his true goals is the very essence of control on his end. Hes a half blood controlling purebloods, taking their money for a cause they dont fully grasp, killing those who would disagree under the guise of the fake goal.

Fear of death is likely less a fear of death, and more a fear of loss of control. The unknown can not be controlled.
