We read about it in cannon all the time. Little things like "me dads a muggle. Moms a witch. Bit of a nasty shock when he found out." But why was it a nasty shock? A shock for sure. But a nasty one? Sure I'd be floored if my my wife suddenly turned our coffee table into a terrier. Having your whole world view turned upside down will do that to you but i don't think it'd be a nasty shock.

Also we know the ministry is a branch of the British government not a self contained government. Does that mean that it has an overseeing muggle authority? Are wizards bound by the same laws as the Britain as a whole?

Also, is there a wizarding primary or elementary school? Where do they learn basic skills like reading and writing? If it's the parents what happens when the parents are shit at maths or terrible at spelling? Are you just shit at it to because your parents are shit?

How is the wizarding world so isolated from the muggle world? Have wizards just never seen a plane fly over Hogwarts or diagon ally? How do they keep planes from flying over dragon reserves? There would have to be some kind of interaction between wizards and a flight authority for that.

There are so many little things that need to work together for the wizarding world to be able to be in state that it's in that it just seems impossible to just hand wave it away with 'magic' as an explanation.

*** To be fair, canon is wildly inconsistent with how in tune wizards are with muggle culture, technology, etc. Arthur Weasley is supposed to be somewhat of an expert -- he turned a car into a flying machine -- but is dangerously incompetent with regards to most muggle technologies (which he calls artifacts). A lot of that is Jo waffling between silly children's humor while trying to tell a serious story with big themes, but it is something. I think there's supposed to be world building elements woven in to explain how out of touch wizards are with muggle society, yet we also get these random tidbits form Malfoy, who should be far more sheltered and close-minded than Arthur, dropping the helicopter line.

As far as everything else OP raises, it mostly comes down to magic: wizards know about planes, but muggles can't see dragon reserves because dragon reserves are protected from muggles by magic. Wizards flying on brooms are hardly a threat to air traffic (which is typically 20,000 ft or higher) and probably wouldn't even register on RADAR (modern drones can broadcast a signal as a required safety feature for certain agencies like the FAA).

I suspect it's nearly impossible for muggles to find out about magic due to some variation of the Fidelius charm. I have a suspicion that it's possible to be told "the secret" of magic by one who knows, since the original secret keeper during the establishment of the Statute is certainly dead by now, but there was a Fidelius raised on the secret of Magic's Existence and this causes magical creatures, areas, etc. to be easily hidden from muggles stumbling upon it without being first told the secret directly by a secret keeper (a magical person). The internet, CCTV, cell phones, etc can not "uncover" evidence of magic because magic itself is protected. Notes in canon kind of spoil this idea, but I'd rather think a limitation of the Fidelius is having direct speech contact. Fidelius is already a powerful can of worms.

I have a theory that is precisely what the Statute of Secrecy actually is. One of the most powerful spells ever created, it was collectively cast by the entire membership of the ICW - each member of whom represented their own country/people, allowing the spell to be backed by the collective will of all wizards and witches.

It would have to have a more subtle mechanism than the Fidelius. Overtime slowly changing the nature of muggle books and manuscripts to remove reference to magic, encouraging muggle minds to ignore unusual experiences, etc.

You would still need Obliviators for the large incidents, but even their job is made easier by the Statute smoothing over the edges of their Memory Charms and discouraging muggles from even thinking about the event. They would also be a necessary part of the spell - if wizarding society as a whole stops making the effort to maintain secrecy then the spell would break.

***** Yes! Muggles get incredibly confused when a wizarding brawl breaks out and obliviators are called in. "The Statute" is a spell as much as it is a law. Breaking the law is also breaking a spell, which is why it is so dramatically punishable.

Bonus is some guy named Fidelius turning "The Statute" spell into a small scale charm for private use.

***** That could also work in reverse: to ensure that society separates, wizards and witches become increasingly unable to comprehend the mundane. That's why Arthur can't remember how to pronounce things, but is able to enchant a car to fly (he isn't stupid); his closeness to the Muggle world as part of his job also increases his exposure to the confounding aspects of the statute.

**** I don't think it's inconsistent. Imagine you're studying a civilisation on an untouched island through a telescope. You can see everything they do, but only when they're outdoors, and you can't hear anything they say. So you'd get a pretty good idea of some aspects of their society and material culture, while having no idea about others.

Same applies to wizards and muggles. Stuff like cars, trains, planes, and helicopters, or even rockets and military vehicles, would be well known (and therefore easy to adapt with magic). But they don't know how to use household appliances, or the postal service, or the precise cultural implications of a rubber duck.

**** Look at the first chapter of the Half-Blood Prince, and it's pretty clear they consider themselves separate. Fudge's message there starts "To the Prime Minister /of Muggles/." The whole interaction that the PM remembers from Fudge's first introduction also shows 0 indications of even nominally being part of the same government.

Now, there apparently /is/ a rule that the PM had to be notified when the WW imported dangerous creatures (dragons/sphinxes in book 4), and they meet up irregularly when big events happen, but the PM seems to be consistently referred to formally as 'of (the) Muggles', compared to the 'Minister for Magic'.

  The Muggle Prime Minister has no part in appointing the Minister for Magic, whose election is a matter only for the magical community themselves. All matters relating to the magical community in Britain are managed solely by the Minister for Magic, and he has sole jurisdiction over his Ministry. Emergency visits to the Muggle Prime Minister by the Minister for Magic are announced by a portrait of Ulick Gamp (first Minister for Magic) that hangs in the Muggle Prime Minister's study in number 10 Downing Street.

** I think a lot of that tends to be within canon-adjacent setups, even though you're somewhat off on the details (the ministry isn't a branch of the British government, wizards do seem aware of the most obvious muggle vehicles - cars, buses, and trains are obvious, and choppers get a line about them - I'd imagine that planes would be likewise impossible to hide). What they don't know - or mostly seem to care about - is /how/ they work. I'd also expect that less visible aspects - like computers and other electronic technology - would be a lot harder for wizards to keep track of, particularly in the 21st century.

However, those types of things to try to figure out - without contradicting canon - is a pretty specific thing. In a lot of cases, when someone is interested enough to look at some of the details that seem weird, it's more to /fix/ canon than to try to keep it intact. There are certainly a lot of people who take both of the approaches - but just that for some, the way the WW has strange/fraying worldbuilding at the edges/details of the world can make it seem like too much trouble to try to not contradict.

About the Wizarding primary school there has been some fics, some where Teddy goes to some kinda school with all magical children, most of the times is Drarry and Scorpius goes to the same school, but years younger. Other take is the one where parents teach them children to read and write and all of this things. They are usually about Harry being raised by someone like Sirius, who convinces Molly to teach Harry too, and then Ron and Harry becames friends and all of that.

And the one about the separation of muggle and wizard world could be interesting, I have seen some fics with this as a tiny sub plot, but I haven't seen anyone developed the idea to a bigger scheme. It would be nice

I bring this up all the time, but then you have all of the canon stans that will misquote, misuse, or just shout NUH UH at me because I'm clearly wrong AKA don't mesh with their beliefs. Oblivate only works on people. Once something reaches bureaucracy/computers, you can't obliviate that.

​

Now here's a question of my own: *What happens to all of the Muggleborn once they find out they aren't wanted or won't be appreciated?*

They go back to the muggle side, maybe network with other disenfranchised muggleborn. Develop their own underground society. OR, they join the government. Because they have to know. Molly Weasley alone is a threat onto the Statute of Secrecy herself. Then you have King's Cross. Muggleborn/Halfbloods disappearing for ten months of the year, that don't get any of the *required* schooling, don't pay taxes, no death notices, etc.

​

Or, they go to another country that's less racist.
