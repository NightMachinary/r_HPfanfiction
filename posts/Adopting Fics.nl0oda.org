And I don't mean fanfictions where Harry is adopted. I'm curious as to the general view of adopting a fic. I know authors put their fics up for adoption when they're done with them I see it in all caps in enough descriptions, but I'm wondering - is it acceptable to adopt an abandoned fic from an author who seems to have abandoned the site all together? There is a fic that was last updated in 2008 that I'm having serious ideas for, and was wondering if I would get crucified for trying to finish it.

In my opinion, it's basically fanfiction of a fanfiction. I'd be writing the first chapter as though it was the next chapter of the abandoned fanfic, and making it very clear at the start what was going on, but I want to know what people's views on that would be.


** In addition to what others have said, I recommend that you don't repost what the original author already wrote, unless you have their explicit permission to do so. Either pick up where they left off or rewrite those chapters yourself, but don't plagiarize them.

** I say go for it. If the fic hasn't updated since 2008, I'm not even assuming the author's alive anymore... although I tend to make that assumption about any unfinished fic these days. Even for fics where I've seen the author posting on this subreddit, when I check for updates on FFN or AO3 when I see the story still doesn't have a new chapter since 2020 or earlier, my first thought is always "Damn, I hope Covid didn't kill them", not "I hope they regain interest in writing this story".

** Do we ask the OG authors for permission?

The only time I would even consider asking permission to work on another fic it'd have to be a point of divergence of a fic that is currently being updated. And even then, it'd be more for playing nice than it'd be for legitimately asking for permission.

** Absolutely reach out first and give it a reasonable time before you go forward. But from there, as long as you are highlighting where the original idea and works comes from, go for it.

** If the profile is still there (not deleted that is) I'd suggest sending them a PM and leaving a comment asking for permission - give it maybe a week or so, and then take a lack of response as permission.

Heck, some authors are rather against fanfiction of their work though that hardly stops content from being made so yeah.

*** I'd suggest waiting at least a month (maybe even longer) for a response.

Not everyone monitors their profiles very closely, especially if they are taking a break (however long) from fanfics.

** Certainly ask the original author. Although I personally think it is silly, some authors are apparently very sensitive for it. Northumbrian let me be kicked out of SIYE for linkao3(13363083). So, when I was planning linkao3(23267857) I was trying very hard to get in touch and ask for permission, but I have never got a reply.

  This is suggested 17th chapter of "Aurors and Schoolgirls" by Northumbrian. We were waiting for the continuation of the story for so long I have decided to take matter in my hands. The truth is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with caution.- Albus Dumbledore

** Unless you get explicit permission or there is a notice saying it's up for adoption, it's theft.

Writing your own continuation from the point it was abandoned, with a link to the original story... Eh, that's tricky.

** since 2008? I have no idea how to reach that person, if they haven't been on the site since. if you wish to continue a fic, then you could, but make it obvious that it is ''a continuation'' of the fic, an alternate ending, not a rewrite. You could say it was inspired, though. Last but not least, don't copy parts of that fic, although referencing them, imo, is okay.
