** What really /GRINDS MY GEARS/ is when the characters develop into caricatures.

#+begin_quote
  Snape /sneered/.

  Ron scoffed down the food of four men heartily.

  Dumbledore's eyes /twinkled/ behind his /half-moon glasses/.

  Hermione read books and became really useful that one time or turned really hot instantly with /sleekeazy/.

  Draco /"My-father"/ Malfoy suddenly developed a more angular face, is a ferret animagus, called ferret -frequently.

  Tonks = "I CAN CHANGE MY APPEARANCE AT WILL, BUT NO ONE LOVES ME FOR WHO I AM - BECAUSE I CHANGE MY APPEARANCE AT WILL."

  Mad-eyes /Electric-blue/ eye.

  I, Lord Harry James Potter-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Black-Peverell-Weasley-Granger, henceforth challenge thy estimable blehblahbluh.

  Seamus makes sex jokes.

  The /Order/ are useless, Dumbledore is a dimwit, and Harry can sense magic with a spell ^{^{Super}} ^{^{difficult}} ^{^{though,}} ^{^{not}} ^{^{even}} ^{^{/Dumbledore/}} ^{^{can}} ^{^{do}} ^{^{it!}}

  I Parsel-necromantically-magic you alive from being dead, /beloved./
#+end_quote

Not that I'm /overly/ fibbed-off about it all, just really annoying seeing the same insults (hurhar, ferret-face - where ur parents scar-head potty?).

I'm guilty of a few, though I end up changing the characters when I write /just/ to make my story original. E.g. my Snape is some hunch-backed, limpin' mofo who likes no-one . . . not even /Slytherins./

*** I'm surprised how often Harry ends up with a snowy owl.

No matter how much the story is twisted and changed, he /always/ ends up with the same snowy owl. And she's always named Hedwig.

Step away from the canon rails.

**** I like how nonjon played off this trope in /A Black Comedy/: not only was Hedwig not in the shop when Harry looked, but the owl he ended up buying would only answer to "Kid-Killer McGee."

*** The sneering, I think, is due to a desire not to repeat words. Ever. I notice that with people saying stuff. In my life, people just say things. In fan fiction, people intone, proclaim, declaim, sneer, smile, and pantomime instead.

** u/SuddenlyALampPost:

  I don't know of any thirteen year olds who talk like that, so eloquently and it's so unnatural.
#+end_quote

Does anyone ever feel that way when a kid is introduced into a fic? Why's the kid always gotta be so damn observant and smart beyond their years? Most 5-10 year old kids don't know the intricacies of adult life or have an expansive vocabulary.

But back to your question, I've definitely given up on stories halfway through because of dialogue and the inner monologue of characters. There was a book on goodreads that got pretty good reviews and some friends recommended it. The dialogue was horrendous and I could only suffer through about a third of it before giving up.

How'd you feel if you visited one night just to see a topic bashing a story you clearly spent forever writing? I left enough info that people might be able to find it themselves, since the length itself may identify it.

**** Its a valid and constructive criticism. You aren't saying "this story sucks, the writer should go die", you are pointing out where exactly the writing falls short, and even highlighting well written parts. It is more helpful to the writer to hear that, if they ever want to get better. I say post the name, because the author could benefit from this.
