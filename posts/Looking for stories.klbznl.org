I'm interested in just about anything that may have independant harry, time travel, gray!harry(or dark), breaks-the-mold, etc. I just need some good fics to occupy my mind. Preferably no fem!harry or Mary Sue Harry Other than that, I'd love to have a look at anything and everything anyone has to recommend.

** Have you read Nightmares of Futures Past? It's a classic, not complete but not actually abandoned either. I always enjoy it because it focuses on the people, how Harry tries to build up his friends' confidence and support them better than the first time, so him having unusual power and skill doesn't derail the story, it's just one element.
