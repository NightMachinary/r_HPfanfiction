Hi all, new user.

I've been scouring fanfiction sites for good Harry/Daphne fics and found a few good ones. I was wondering if anyone knew of any really good ones? Don't mind bashing or Harems. Help is appreciated.


** Boy have I got a list for you. I'm on mobile so I can't link them, but I can give you several titles and authors and as soon as you pop them in Google, you'll have links. List: Thanks to a Snake by lucky14now James Spookie (all of his work basically) The Grass is Always Greener by kb0 Partners by muggledad Unexpected Assistance by SymphonySamurai The 8th Year by Holz9364 Angry Harry and the Seven by Sinyk To Be Loved by silentclock Myrrdin Emrys Returns by (General Kenobi SIYE) Runic Animagi by Kassien The Prisoners of Azkaban by (The Unusual Suspect)

I enjoy Harry/Daphne the best. They are the BEST ship on fan fiction. I hope you enjoy these. By all means, let me know if you need more recommendations :)

**** Started reading The 8th Year. How far into it does Harry/Daphne start? Trying to decide if it's worth reading through a Dramione relationship to get to a pairing I like.

***** It's quite slow because it started with the canon pairing. Starting from Ch. 10 it will be quite different because the author decided not to go with canon pairing anymore. Harry and Daphne will have some relationship, but not yet dating. They will be Friends with Benefits. And, from Ch. 20 above they will start dating.

****** Yeah I read it up until Hermione and Draco had a kiss in the library. I thought I could deal with Draco and Harry being friends but the Dramione pairing just creeps me out. I started reading the Grass is always Greener story instead; the romance between Daphne and Harry starts pretty much straight away, and Draco gets put in his place and humiliated like he deserves.

  They are the BEST ship on fan fiction
#+end_quote

Since essentially they're Harry/OC. Daphne (and Tracy, and other characters are name only, without any personalities) are blank state, so you can do anything you want with the character

**** Absolutely true! If you read several of the ships, there are several almost accepted rule-like things about Daphne. She has a base slate people can use based on ff but you have the ability to change her however you want

**** To be fair, there are a lot of assumptions about Daphne/Tracy that are fairly accepted by most readers/writers of the fandom, so I wouldn't call it really that much of an oc.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3807777/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Acts-of-Betrayal][Harry Potter and the Acts of Betrayal]] is H/Hr/D and contains love potion bashing. It also deals with some mature themes so be ready for that.

**** I'll have to check, but there are definitely some stuff like it. Would you prefer it be Harry/Daphne? Because it narrows down the search for me. It would be easier to compile. If you want any other ships just let me know, I'll compile lists :)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned]]

What I believe to be three excellent stories. The Pureblood Princess is probably closest to what exactly you've asked for. I should warn you that Betrayal is pretty dark and is also relatively short at 21 000 words (well, compared to the other two).

Or at least a sequel to what Harry's reaction was to being deceived.
