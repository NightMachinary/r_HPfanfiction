:END:
Harry is a abused in the fic, because of that he suddenly becomes an animagus.

He runs away, stumbles into the Grangers and they adopt him.

Him and Hermione learn wandless magic.

Voldemort in their 3rd or 4th year merges back with his horcruxes because spilting his soul made him insane. He does it with the help of a foreign dark witch.

** Misread that as 'Harry adopted by Gingers' and wondered why you weren't calling them the Weasleys. :D

Anyway, yeah. Ace-Socialist is correct, you're looking for The Accidental Animagus. All credit to them for the find, I'm just linking. :)

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.
