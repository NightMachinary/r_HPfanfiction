Hi, so I have been working on a Harry-Has-A-Twin! story but I intend to make it very different from the other stories in this trope. I hope you guys will read it and let me know what you think. There's only one chapter posted at the moment.

So here's the summary and the link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13308468/1/]]

Living with the Dursleys might have been a terrible experience for Kate Potter and her twin Harry, if it hadn't been for their godfather and his wife. The twins also hide a secret from the ordinary folk of Little Whinging - they are both magical. Join Kate as she attends Hogwarts, struggles with her dyslexia and her status as the sister of the Boy Who Lived, and goes up against deadly enemies, all of whom have one goal - kill Harry.
