:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The delacours show up at the dursleys after 4th year or maybe 5th year to tell harry either he has to marry gabby or by saving her they're bonded and married. I remember theres a good bit of wizard politics. I think there was a part about Ron gain gaining the memories of a couple old powerful witches or wizards after the incident with the brains in the DoM which is what makes me think its after 5th year but I could also be mixing different stories. Thanks in advance


** I don't know the title, but I know exactly which fic you're talking about. To add some detail, Ron turned about to be an Heir of Ravenclaw, I think. His intelligence was awoken by the brain attacking in the Ministry. Pretty sure Harry also tells the goblins he pulled Gryffindor's sword from the hat and they don't believe him, so he shows them the memory. And something about them occupying a castle at some point.... idk, I stopped reading at about that point.

*** Sounds right. I think there was a bit about hermione being Harry's sister. Not by blood but by choice. Lots of archaic language was why I quit

**** Yeah, that sounds right. I think somebody may have upset her and he lost his shit, thereby claiming her as his sister. I couldn't finish it and I read it like.... porably two or three years ago, so sorry I can't help with the title. Figured if I added more details it may help others.
