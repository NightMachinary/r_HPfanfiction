I'm surprised no one commented on Voldemort's appearance after the Battle in the Ministry of Magic, as far as we know, that is the first time Fudge has seen Voldemort after his rebirth. Why did he instantly identify him as Voldemort?

/"He was here!" shouted a scarlet-robbed man with a ponytail, who was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall, where Bellatrix had lain trapped moments before. "I saw him, Mr. Fudge, I swear, it was You-Know-Who, he grabbed a woman and Disapparated!"/

/"I know, Williamson, I know, I saw him too!" gibbered Fudge. (Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix)/

Before dying in 1981, what did Voldemort look like? Did he look like Tom Riddle (as described in the Chamber of Secrets)? Or did creating Horocruxes alter his appearance? Why did these two random wizards identify him as Voldemort if his rebirth supposedly changed his appearance?

I don't think there's a canon answer but I would love to hear your theories.

Yes. By 1981 he, no doubt, looked very similar to, albeit a little better than, what stepped out the cauldron in GoF.

Lord Voldemort's Request, HBP:

#+begin_quote
  Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snake-like, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders.

That was very late 60s-1970.

Bathilda's Secret, DH:

#+begin_quote
  Nice costume, mister!‚Äù

  He saw the small boy's smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the cloak, saw the fear cloud his painted face: Then the child turned and ran away

Voldemort's memory of Godric's Hollow.

Just a point: Fudge wasn't a random. He was Junior Minister in the Department of Accidental Magic and Catastrophes and was significant enough to be at the scene after Peter blew up the street. And Williamson was an Auror, I think, so chances are high he saw Voldemort before.

*** I would add one caveat to this: the evidence from HBP seems to be that making horcruxes progressively changed Voldemort's appearance. Voldemort lost a piece of soul to Harry on Halloween 1981, and then made another horcrux out of Bertha Jorkins' death before his resurrection. So in GOF he's 2 soul fragments further along than he was when he turned up at Godric's Hollow, so you might expect his appearance to have become more extreme. But it's progress along a scale, so he'd still be recognisable.

*** Thank you! That also explains why almost no one made the connection between handsome Tom Riddle and Lord Voldemort.
