All of the ones I could find had Tom kicked out after about 5 minutes, and it was never mentioned again (Exlcuding Seventh Horcrux).

Only a oneshot, but I remember it being okay

Also linkffn(10677106) of course

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all? (OotP AU. Go inside the mind of Severus Snape as he tackles several beguiling mysteries, and risks everything he holds dear.) COMPLETE.

*** I recently read this after it was recommended here in another thread. It's really good although the first half was a bit slow and I ended up wanting more chapters when it ended (a bigger epilogue mostly).

Finding fics like this is why I hang around here.

** linkffn(Strange and Invisible History) is fantastic. It's very well written (and complete). Harry gets possessed by Voldemort in the Philosopher's Stone debacle, and Voldemort basically takes over. It's written very GoT-esque. Unfortunately the sequel seems to be abandoned.

Hermione is the main character. Harry doesn't recover, he's permanently Voldemort.

** linkffn(10677106)

Harry basically is Voldemort in this one, though it's a crack comedy. Some people don't like it, but it's the funniest thing I've ever read. I don't remember, it might not even have been specifically said, if Voldemort's soul completely took over Harry's body or if it's just that Harry gained all of Voldemort's memories at an age where he had no personality of his own, but it comes out to the same thing.
