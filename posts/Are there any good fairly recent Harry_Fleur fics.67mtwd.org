I would say fairly recent meaning within the last 6 months

  FD/HP [Post-GoF] Unfortunately, sharing a cell with Fleur Delacour isn't as delightful as it sounds. dark!Harry/dark!Fleur. Pairing with a plot.

*** FYI "Whispers" is very, /very/ angsty. It's decent if you can stand overly emotional characters but it was very hard to read for me. (One scene that specifically stuck with me was Harry randomly having a nightmare about Susan and Amelia Bones being raped by Death Eaters for no apparent reason. IIRC Harry hadn't even had any contact with DE's at that point in the story and it came totally out of the blue and the rest of the chapter was stufed with everyone crying and comforting each other and assurances that everything is fine yada yada)

As for Resurgence; It's average, not great, not even really good but overall readable. So far this is definitely Harry/Daphne only although Fleur does play a rather important role and the latest chapter gave a bit more insight into how things between them might progress.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.
