In my personal opinion, most fight scenes in Harry Potter fanfiction after boring as hell. This is fine in most fics, where combat isn't the focus, but in fics that have a lot of fighting, it's especially annoying. It usually just comes down to two characters shooting the same three spells at each other while the fight is determined by who can dodge better. If you took away the names and just added the names of two other random characters the fight would make just as much sense because there's no individuality in how different characters fight. Why is Bellatrix more dangerous in a fight than someone like Crouch? I want answers to this question that are better than "she can cast spells better" or "she has faster reactions".

My proposed solution: add anime superpowers, or just make different characters very good at different things. Like if you have Ice Queen Daphne, just go ahead and make her Elsa with her ice magic and all that stuff. Let Neville control the growth of plants to help him in fights. Give Hermione Sharingan if you want. In linkffn(Deprived), Harry fights with a shape shifting wand and a fucking shadow knight. That's cool as hell! In linkffn(The Denarian Renegade), Harry can use hellfire and transform into a dragon. If there's a duelling tournament arc, I want to see more shit where the fights feel very magical.

I realize that this fucks the power scaling a lot. I also realize many fics shouldn't do this; linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) could never do this without abandoning much of the strategy.

Maybe I've been watching too much anime and this is actually a terrible idea.

*** I think she noticed she'd made magic very point and shoot so she mostly focused in cool fight environments; like, the finale of TPS was a Wrestlemania Cage Match, COS was a swordfight against a giant snake, POA was steamy furry action, and the only real big duel in GOF was in the graveyard and the rest was about cool puzzle solving.

OOTP was the first book with an actual big climactic duel BUT the duel happened in the freaking Department of Mysteries with the wacky shit, the prophecies, the brains, the sand and all that shit. Then HBP went back to mostly being about mystery solving, and in DH the characters went /out/ of their way to avoid getting into direct fights, there were really like 4 or 5 battles in the whole book, and even the Battle of Hogwarts had a big element of people using indirect tactics; Peeves throwing bullshit at people, the Acromantulas breaking in and slaughtering combatants left and right, I think Sprout threw deadly plants at one point even.

**** Also in HBP (which I think handled ‘realistic' fights very well) every battle Harry gets into is both brutal and short. When he fights Draco, they trade a few spells and then immediately turn to maiming and torturing, and the real tension is in Harry's response to the violence. When Harry & Dumbledore return, he's forced into being a bystander while Dumbledore is killed and then sprints through the aftermath after Snape. When he catches up with Snape, he's so hopelessly outmatched that he doesn't get a single spell in and has to watch him get away. If you're going to uses canon magic and want to show gritty combat, JKR shows you the way to do it.

** In general, I think people just misunderstand how to write a fight scene. Nobody gives a shit about the protagonist's proficiency with the stunning charm or their favorite variation on the blasting curse, and two people shooting 70 spells at each other is nothing more than two people shooting 1 spell at each other but 70 times more boring. What matters is tension and resolution, just like in all storytelling, which is generally going to be done by setting an external goal. If the goal of a fight really is nothing other than to subdue the opponent, the way to make it exciting is to contrive a set of secondary goals which lead to that ultimate goal.

Rowling made fun of magical dueling as early as the second book, fanfic authors could stand to learn a lesson from Lockhart

** The best fight in the books by far is Dumbledore vs Voldemort for one simple reason- Dumbledore is fucking inventive in how he duels. Granted, his tactics would probably be wastefully showy against most opponents, but the fact that he's against someone who can and will spam Avada Kedavras and can't die means he has to get trickier in how he fights. Animating statutes to act as minions, apparition-dodging, having Fawkes take a hit for him (about the only creature that could take Avada Kedavra and walk away). And the way its written, there's a sort of calm elegance to how Dumbledore duels, almost like a dance. Reading that, I really felt like Dumbledore was in control for most of that duel- that for all the claims of how powerful Voldemort was, Riddle was dueling out of his league for perhaps the first time in that fight. A magical blunt instrument vs a magical martial artist.

One of my biggest disappointments with the films is how generic the film duel felt in comparison. The spells were bigger and flashier, yeah, but it lacked that sense of creativity and elegance from how Dumbledore dueled in the book, at least to me.

To be fair, it's not like Dumbledore "needs" to duel most opponents. In the Chapter preceding his duel with Voldemort, we see the "normal" reaction of most people when facing him : "Run like hell and still get caught by a wave of his wand".

*** I swear people love boring stories where Harry has no fighting ability and wands are just fancy fireworks sticks.

I want to see a purple light turn someone's conjured rabid wolf into mud while the owner of the wolf turns the ground into burning quicksand only for opponent to apparate behind and...

Harry going to school when he can levitate an island wandlessly while deciding to learn martial arts is stupid, why would he learn martial arts in this case?

However a far more competent harry fighting a more magical duel using transfiguration, charms curses and even divination to help him fight against voldemort is a lot more interesting to me.

No, yes, and no again:

- /No, you haven't watched too much anime---/ It's entirely true that combat scenes should be written as more than lists of “X cast a spell. Y dodged, then cast a different spell.” I'll go so far as to say that dynamic fight scenes are /objectively/ better as a matter of quality.
- /Yes, you have watched too much anime---/ There are plenty of ways to have dynamic action scenes without abandoning canon, or canon-flavored, HP magic in favor of anime stuff.
- /No, you haven't watched too much anime (Take 2)---/ Folks have different tastes and canonicity isn't objectively better. Sharingan!Hermione isn't my cup of tea but it's a big world and there's room enough for my canon-flavored AUs and your animesque reimaginings and everything in between.

** I think this is a misdiagnosis. Action in fanfiction isn't bad because of spell choice. It's bad because it fails to fulfil all the many requirements of an action scene when it comes to character, plot, pacing, etc. and in particular resolution of conflict (most fanfic has no conflict).

*** Partial disagreement. I agree that context of action can be a big part of the action, but I don't think you don't necessarily need to set up the action scene very well to make the actual scene enjoyable. I think that the first big action scene in Deprived is fun to read, even though there are parts of the fight that are cringe that I don't like. The set up to the fight is kind of stupid and Harry is annoyingly edgy.

I specifically just want to see grander fights with more cool shit. The more cool shit I see, the more I tend to enjoy reading the fight.

**** It's not about setting up the action scene, it's about remembering that fights have purpose. Nobody in narrative really fights just to fight, they fight so they can accomplish something else. Maybe they're trying to fight through a horde to get to safety, maybe they're trying to fight off an ambush that's trying to stop them from testifying in court, maybe they're in a war and trying to take a strategic point. That's one reason a lot of fanfic fights feel boring and meandering. There's no real objective to them, so there's no real tension or investment. People relate to "I want to fight to protect the people I care about" or "I want to fight so I can go take down the bad guy in a big speech" or even "I want to fight to prove I can" type tropes, but they don't relate to "I want to fight because I want to fight." as much.

I do agree with the cool shit thing though. Point and shoot fights get real dull, unless you find-replace all the incantations with the word "PEW!". Then they just get hilarious, and that's probably not the feeling most writers go for with fight scenes. :D

It's why I like good Duelling Fics. Like formal competition Duelling I mean, not just a fancy word for fighting. There's a lot more "I throw a water spell, they freeze it and throw it back, I heat it with fire and gust them with boiling steam" type back and forth in the fighting. It's still not fantastic, but it's a lot more creative and interesting.

** You can blame the source material on that, even if JKR did her best to include tension and flavor up the fights.

I disagree that "cool shit" or "superpowers" solve that, I have seen many fics from HP and other fandoms with cool superpowered stuff and the battles were still boring.

And you can still get cool fights even between two normal humans with swords, it's just the way you write and the tension.

Written fights, unlike fights from visual media, require more tension and other things to make them different and cool to read. Many of those "boring! they just throw spells at each other and dodge" would not be considered so boring in a movie.

I do agree people need to spice up duels and fights, but you have to see that's very similar to fencing or sword fights, where the fights tend to be short and intense, unless armor is involved.

HP magic already has cool stuff and even anime-like "powers", they can conjure fire constructs, animate statues, use elemental attacks, all you would need to do is add some tension and flavor and it's done.

See Katana duels or their Western equivalent, Quick Draw duels in classic movies, they generally ended fast, but the built-up, the conflict, and the tension involved are what made them interesting.

Then, we have the fact most stories are with people in school so it's safe to say, they are not supposed to know that much.

What makes Bellatrix more dangerous in a fight? Well, what makes Oberyn Martell more dangerous with a spear than one of his daughters? He has more experience, he's faster, he's probably more brutal.

What made Jaime Lannister more dangerous than Robb Stark?

What made Darth Maul more dangerous than young Ahsoka Tano?

All of these use similar weapons, with similar ways of attack, but their fights are very different.

I imagine Bellatrix to be fast to cast, unpredictable, and brutal, to make a good fight with her, just make her spells varied and dangerous, her to move fast and taunt and dodge or shield almost anything. Make it seem she's playing with the fight, and make the situation seem hopeless.

Good written fights have little to do with how 'showy' they are, it's all in presentation and tension and how much can you immerse the reader in them.

** Magical fights are, for the most part, an unknown entity. For one thing, we don't know (a) how fast a spell travels from origin to target or (b) if something like wind/weight changes the relative accuracy of each spell. More confusing is that Transfigurations don't seem to have a visible spell path (“a jet of green light”). So how can a wizard know if they're about to be changed into a teacup unless they know the EXACT transfiguration being used? I'm aware, fyi, that Rowling does say quite a few times IC that human transfiguration is incredibly tricky. Still, as Victor Krum managed a partial human transfiguration at seventeen, I don't know how difficult it can really be.

I like to imagine wizarding fights move at around the speed of a professional game of dodgeball --- a top speed of ~60-70mph with a declining rate of accuracy based on distance (fyi there's a hilarious amount of research on professional dodgeball players if you're interested). While I realize this idea is pure conjecture, it works for me because it keeps dueling fun (“rule-of-cool” stays intact), provides a reasonable explanation why most wizarding fights only last about a minute (Dumbledore v Voldemort, for example), and doesn't break any of the rules Rowling established IC as they're interpreted in DLP-headcanon (which is the one I use because it's the best explanation I've found).

There's also the nature of incantations themselves. It's logical that in a wizarding duel, it really benefits a wizard to use spells with as few syllables as possible. If two wizards are standing across from each other during a duel, and Wizards 1 says “reducto,” while Wizard 2 says “Wingardium Leviosa,” Wizard 1's spell will already be firing before Wizard 2's is done (assuming they both start their incantations at the exact same time). In this way, the biggest drawback of “Avada Kedavra” is simply how long it takes to say because, honestly, it's a fucking mouthful. Also, if a wizard has a speech impediment, or if they're from another country with a different set of phonetics, does that impair their ability to cast spells? The Triwizard Tournament says “no”, but canon explanations seems to say “yes” (winGARdium LeviOWEsah).

** I don't even like watching action scenes much less reading about them. But when they're short and to the point and they have a purpose, it's bearable. Sometimes action movies/ books focus too much on the fighting and not what the fighting is supposed to accomplish for example in Percy Jackson, Rick riordan has a lot of fight scenes where Percy stabs some monster and defeats them but when they had the big battle at the end with everyone fighting, there's no need to describe each fight and each and every single move someone makes. A better way to go about it would be to write the important things that happen like for example lavender cast expelliarmus at a death eater but the death eater easily rebuffed her and cast acasa kedavra it's a simple line to say that lavender died without going through the whole fight scene where she probably cast other spells at the death eater before dying.
