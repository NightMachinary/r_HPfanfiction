I have read the fanfiction Crosswinds of Fate recently, which is a crossover between Fate/Stay Night and Harry Potter, and at the end of it, there was this plot about making bloodlines actually matter in a non-Mary Sue way, throwing out ideas like passing down Wands through generations like the Elder Wand is, integrating outsider blood in pureblood lines to avoid negative traits, crossbreeding what are considered magical beings with wizards/witches to gain a measure of appreciable magical ability, and attempting to breed true magical talents like metamorphmagi, parseltongue, and the inner eye (talent for divination), and it was interesting seeing the likes of Draco Malfoy's reaction to the idea that "his bloodline is declining" if he is doing worse in school than his father did... but it was never really completed in a satisfying manner due to the story going dormant 3 years ago.

I was wondering if there were any good stories that covered this sort of plotline, preferably ones with minimal mentions of the likes of magic cores or magic circuits.


** In linkffn(The odds were never in my favour) some characters come from pureblood houses that chose to breed with magical creatures instead of, you know, doing the Lannister dance. Incestuous pureblood families are also portraited as magically (and kinda all around, really) declining due to all the inbreeding.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

*** I love this fic! The writing style is a bit of a hurdle, but it does a great job of making Alexandra feel both ridiculously powerful and badly outmatched.

  "You should think of this as an opportunity to learn about a completely different method of applied thaumaturgy," Zelretch explained. He then sighed and lamented, "For shame, to be cursed with such an ungrateful apprentice..."
