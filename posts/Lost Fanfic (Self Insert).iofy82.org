Hi guys. I read this self insert fanfiction a few months ago somewhere on Wattpad or Quotev I don"t remember.

It was in the first person, the MC was a female. She was a huge fan of the HP series and had like a crush on Tom Felton too. She goes to an event that JK Rowling is supposed to attend. She meets her and is overwhelmed. She tells her how much she wishes the HP world was real. Then suddenly she is transported to the HP World in Harry's 4th year. Harry, Hermione, and Ron find her either before or after the Quidditch world cup. The characters look the same as the actors who play them (Dan is Harry, Bonnie is Ginny etc.).

She tells them that she is a transfer student from Ilvermorny. She is then sorted into Gryffindor.

Also, for some reason, all the characters think that MC is Merlin's descendant.

Does anyone know about this one? Please tell me if you do.
