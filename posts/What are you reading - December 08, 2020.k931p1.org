** I'm reading Soul Scars by ShayaLonnie. It is a collection of connected one shots about soulmates being attached by scars. I haven't read much soulmate AU before, but I really like it so far. Each story has been well written and fun to read! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12035442?view_adult=true&view_full_work=true]]

** Just got done reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5791522/chapters/13348279][The Bet by SleepingHookah]]

It is Jily (my OTP i love htem so much) and this one is so amazing. It is a story set in James and Lily's seventh year of Hogwarts over a month, starting with James and Lily making a bet, Lily betting she can prank better than James and James betting that he can be a better model student than Lily.

Tbh it didn't interest me at first, (even the author admits that it starts off weak in an author's note towards the end of the story) but I stuck with it, because I read a lot of Jily and this one is really long and recommended so I wanted to give it a fair shot. It quickly improves and really grows on you, the characters really improve and grow. If you like James/Lily together this is a must read. Plus its like nearly 500k words so it will keep you occupied for a while.

** I have been reading and re-reading True Romance linkao3(11547009) It's set post Hogwarts. The basic premise is all the characters move on from the girlfriends and boyfriends that they exited Hogwarts with and start new relationships. I really really like it except for the bits I really don't (which I skipped over during the re-read)

The pros: It's very close to my head canon of most of the characters' personalities. It also reminds me a lot of me and my friends' messy post school years. There are two interesting sub-plots about the war reparations and revamping the Quibbler which I found engaging and believable. It's also quite sweet, no-one is a horrible person, no-one's perfect either.

The cons: It's explicit and there's a lot of it and it's boring because there's no variety - every character seems to get it on in exactly the same way - I just got really tired of it but ymmv. Also some characters (Fleur and Neville) did seem out of character but I put up with them because I enjoyed the others. I couldn't put up with Luna though who is written as really loopy and I always hate it when she's written like that.

** A Second Coming [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4426112][A Second Coming]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Icarius51/pseuds/Icarius51][Icarius51]]

What if Harry Potter had a much more mischievous side, one that was locked away thanks to everyone's favorite manipulative old geezer. It starts at the end of Harry's fourth year, as the shock and stess from the events in the graveyard forces him to enter into a magically induced coma. For twelve hours, he's asleep, the trauma of seeing Cedric die and seeing the ghosts of his parents, not to mention the return of Voldemort, breaks down a thirteen year old magical barrier in Harry's mind, awakening a part of Harry long since thought lost. Suddenly, its chaos. the Boy-Who-Lived vanishes with a magical motorcycle and an ancient snake, the death eaters are being harassed in the worst way (You know, fire and destruction), the Ministry is being its usual cowardly self, and Dumbledore is trying to find how it all went wrong. And then, at the start of 5th year, a very different Harry Potter shows up, with an Agenda in hus mind designed to flip the Wizarding World on its head, and the determination to do it. They never saw him coming.

** Right now I'm focusing on finding some decent and non-banal fanfics with a good, slightly manipulative and quite friendly Dumbledore with a healthy dose of common sense and responsibility. However, recently I became interested in fiction about intelligent and creative Harry, for example yesterday I read an interesting book about Harry who was a natural legilimens and he was perfecting this skill. He wrote a few studies that were published and traveled to the Beauxbatons for exchange, where he was maneuvered into the Triwizard Tournament and in the first task he defeated the beast they had to face with other champions. He also interviewed Gellert Grindelwald, who helped him a lot (probably out of boredom, but I'm not surprised, half a century behind bars without talking to anyone? I would go crazy). Could someone recommend a fiction similar and meeting the requirements to the one I wrote about earlier?

** Am on a Fred/Hermione kick. Reading "What if" by fairylightinthenight which is amazing, recommended to me in a post I made yesterday. The pacing is great and it's a fairly realistic portrayal of teenage wizard romance, think its' a good portrayal of Hermione as not soppy but also not shrill/zero fun. It's not "X realized he'd been in love with Hermione since the day they met on the Hogwarts express" and then three paragraphs later "want to be my girlfriend?"

** I'm currently reading Promises Unbroken, linkffn(1248431). It's part of an AU universe where Sirius doesnt switch being the Potters' secret keeper. I like it so far, including the writing. Though I feel the author could have added some lighter moments in the fic. The length of the fic and its sequels are somewhat daunting. I might have to take a break before reading those. I also read the prequel Promises Honored, linkffn(4881348) which I really liked.

** - “Magical Creatures Will Get Me Killed (Again) by Anubis Enfield” linkffn(13640390) ... the main hero (who is NOT Harry, although he is Harry's friend, he is one of the few fourth members of The Golden Trio, who are not obnoxious) was in his previous live veterinarian (in our, i.e., all Muggle universe) died killed by one of the animals, and now he is born again as a son of cruel and altogether awful merchant with magical animals (and their parts). He starts in Hogwarts the same year as Harry, and ... the story continues. The character is really interesting, his additional stories are lovely, but it is one of those stories. First the author feels firm obligation to repeat all The Stations of Canon (up to The Prisoner of Azkaban), which is horribly boring. Also, couple of times the main hero (who is supposed to have some very little memory of the HP books) completely misses the point just to keep The Stations together. If you know ANYTHING about PoA and you remember one thing, it is that Lupin turning into werewolf destroys everything, and you just cannot ignore it. However, I am now in GoF and it seems getting more creative and more interesting.

- “The Other Gryffindor Girl: Lavender Brown by JamRolyPoly” linkffn(13704240) ... one shot, completely against my headcanon, but really really nice, and really sad. Highly recommended.

- “To Face What He Denied by Tygershark” linkffn(13672918) ... My review on the story itself: I really wanted to like this story. I am disgusted with the amount of Snape whitewashing and confusing quite horrible character in the books and super acting of Alan Rickman. So, when finally somebody tried to write a story of true Snape's redemption, I eagerly jumped on it to read it. Unfortunately, I am afraid, that you fell into the other trap. So, it is not an apotheosis of Severus Snape, that's good. But than in the beginning you throw all the guilt on his back (including adding more bad acts, when the canon is not dark enough) and whitening everybody else. I really truly believe that he was an awful person, but it doesn't mean that James Potter and Sirius Black were not jerks as well, or that Sirius had to be under Confundus to create a stupid prank with Moony, or assaulting him after OWLs. It is not excuse for Severus, but there is no reason to make James and Sirius saints, and it makes his persona less believable. And then the trend switches from blaming everything on Severus to full steam Dumbledore bashing. Why? It is pity. This story had such promise.

- “Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure Part 1 by dunuelos” linkffn(9824342) ... Albus Dumbledore, real leader of the good guys in one universe, who lead England through terrible war with Voldemort to clear victory and restoration of the British wizardry, is now sent to the other universe (the one of HP books) to fix mess left behind by his other self. Brilliant.

- “It's My Life by Fyreheart” linkffn(6234089) ... Yankeewank: everything British is horrible and only by running to America (and becoming US citizen) Harry is saved, and then with the help of FBI (and British Muggles) he manages to save his life and defeat all evil British (i.e., all British magicals). Really not much more than that.

  Summary: The end was only the beginning for Severus Snape. After that, there is a clarity to be found and one can see things as they really are, not how one imagined them to be. This story picks up during the Deathly Hallows at the scene where Snape has just been bitten by Nagini and has been left for dead by Voldemort. This will be more of a character study of Snape.

Yes, she was probably shallow and annoying at 16, but so are many teenagers, and she was also as brave as any Gryffindor.

** Title: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] by Mizuni-sama

Summary: /Ten years ago, Voldemort created his kingdom. Now a confused young wizard stumbles into it, and carves out a destiny. AU. Nondark Harry. MentorVoldemort. VII Ch.8 In which someone is dead, wounded, or kidnapped in every scene./

Rating: 5/5

I've always considered this one of my favourite stories. And after re-reading it I would still say it's my favourite of the "extra-long" fanfictions. It is an absolute epic, with really interesting and very original world-building, good strong enemies, intriguing original characters, with a clever but unpredictable plot. The scale of the fic is enormous, encompassing international politics, strong and believable individual character development, religion, paganism, "fae", life/death/afterlife, vampires and werewolves, and a whole bunch of other stuff that other fics fail to execute well on, but this fic combines them all and does it very pleasantly.

Voldemort is suitably scary. And it features a well-written Snape, which is always very entertaining to read. Harry develops into quite the powerhouse but it never feels forced or rushed (to me). There are valid reasons for powerful characters being powerful. The magic feels more magical than in other fics. And there is a sense that things can go wrong very horribly.

Disclaimer: it is an unfinished/abandoned fic. But you have 1million+ words to get through before you get to the end, and even after reaching the end I didn't feel unsatisfied. I could take a few guesses at where the rest of the plot goes, though it's a crying shame we won't see the original author complete it. I did notice some typos and stretches of text that seemed ... misplaced, somehow? But they were few and far-between, especially in light of how enormous the whole thing is. I can't say they detracted from my reading experience, but then again I am fairly lenient compared to some.

It also features one of my favourite portrayals of Ron, who I tend to view fairly neutrally, but in this story the boy has heart and is really gutsy. If I had some money to spare I'd want to crowdfund the completion of this fic as well as have art commissioned for some of the really epic scenes.

You get the POV of Harry, Snape, Voldemort, Dumbledore, Ron, and a few OC's. It's really quite impressive how it's all pulled together into a satisfying narrative.

10/10. I'd consider this a must-read.

It's really good, although it's dark as well, and you might have to take a break during some of the worser parts. It's rated M, so if you're not okay with reading about blood, gore, rape, etc, please don't read. This is my second time reading it, I'm on the 8th chapter currently.

There are some grammar mistakes that I've noticed, but they don't take away from the story (at least I don't think so). Also this is my first time using the bot so... I hope this works.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18549484?view_full_work=true][Another Bend in the Road]] is a fic where instead of dying at the graveyard, Cedric lives. It explores the events that occur right after this change in canon. The story is still ongoing. So far, it's still on the day right after the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament.

I immediately liked it because it did something I had never seen before. Cedric apparated himself and Harry out of the graveyard. This solution simply blew my mind and left me thinking why I haven't seen a fic with this idea before. After all, Cedric was at the age where people got their licenses to Apparate. It was simply amazing.

This small pebble dropped into the pond then causes a lot of ripples to take place. The author is still exploring what those changes are. Things won't be the same so kiss the stations of canon goodbye. I am dying to know what Fudge's stand over the issue will be.

  I don't think that's the first time that was the Apparition was directly mentioned. In GoF I remember the older Weasley sibs apparating and then Amos Diggory at the World Cup saying he'll be glad when Cedric passes his Apparition test (it's my favorite HP book so I can recall moments easily lol). Then in Book 5 Fred/George annoy everyone with their Apparating. If Harry took Apparition in the 6th year, Cedric as a 7th year would have probably taken classes.
