** Oh I know that one. When Snape realises Lockhart has been tampering with memories he starts trying to see past any blocks in his own and in doing so discovers a long buried memory had been altered by Dumbledore - a memory which revealed him to be Harry's father right? Oh crumbs what was it called let me see if I can find it.

*** If it's the one with Lockhart, then it is In Name Only by E.M. Snape

Edit: Read it a few years back, and highly recommend. Doesn't sugarcoat Snape's character, which is a common issue with Snape-as-parent fics.

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]
