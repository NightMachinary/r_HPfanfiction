** There is exactly one way if you don't want time travel. After she is broken out of Azkaban, BEFORE the DoM battle, Bellatrix defects because she never wants to go back there, ever. Which leaves her exactly one option, betting everything on Harry (or running for the rest of her life, but that seems more of a Lupin thing).

So you now have a seriously unhinged magical destruction machine with only one way forward. Taking down Voldemort. But since he's a bit too far up the food chain, that means dealing with the other Death Eaters.

If you want that plot to turn into a romance, have them slowly develop feelings as they spend years fighting together. Have them save each other lives, starting in the DoM. But it should really be a lengthy process since I don't think that Bellatrix would be trusted quickly.

****** Alright, so the initial meeting should be outside of Grimauld place since Bella might actually remember the neighbourhood even if she can't find the house. So that would probably be the first scene, and Harry does not buy her change of heart at all. He'd demand some proof, but would unsure what exactly.

So Bellatrix reluctantly leaves and eventually returns with some Death Eater captured/dead, which starts a series of such acts. Have her join the DoM battle on Harry's side, maybe replacing Ginny, Luna and Neville. Speaking of Neville, he would immediately lose all respect for Harry and the only thing stopping him from informing the authorities would be a lack of evidence.

Maybe have Bellatrix sneak into Hogwarts to give the trio lessons.

Maybe have an attack on Hogsmeade with her defending the place with the limitation that she cannot be seen/identified.

As for the romance, maybe get some alcohol involved to start things, but afterwards it's a struggle between "we should not be doing this again" and "I want to do it again".

******** Some Bella&Sirius bonding is always good, as is a Bellatrix&Andromeda reconciliation. If Bellatrix starts taking out Death Eaters, Voldemort will need more manpower, so maybe some of the darker magical creatures appear as enemies more frequently.

Also, keep in mind that Bellatrix might reject Voldemort, but she won't suddenly be a good person.

And because she's like 30 years older than Harry. Even if you accept that witches and wizards age slower than muggles, it's going to be pretty creepy for quite a few years. Not that actually stops some people.

**** u/Hellstrike:
#+begin_quote
  creepy
#+end_quote

We are talking about Bellatrix Lestrange here, to be honest creepy would be a given even if they were the same age.

As for the age, actually it would be a mutual dependency, so I'm not really sure how the power imbalance would work out since Harry could sell her out at any moment.

It would definitely be a little challenging to do such a relationship justice.

** One possible way is something I've been searching for in a fic and only found in one fic in a believable way (well, as believable as wizards, witches, and magic can be). The circumstances would have to have an evil/dark/grey Harry who somehow convinces Bella that he IS the Dark Lord reborn because seriously, I don't really think it'll take much to convince her that greatest Dark Lord of the time wasn't, in fact, defeated by a baby but actually took over his body.

It's later in the story but overall, the story is pretty interesting.

This fic is Wizard Kingpin by Odin999:

** I have gone through 14 million scenarios without staying too OOC and I have narrowed down to 3 valid ones:

1. Harry hits his head with a bludger. Goes insane. Escapes to marry Bella in secret. They set on a lovely cottage where they can fill the walls with the heads of all their unfavorite elves.

2. Harry gets hit with a lust potion. Shags Bella's brains out. Gets her pregnant. Out of selfless obligation to the kid decides to stay with her. Names their child Rudolph Severus Potter.

3. Bella gets cursed with a "If you ever do a dark spell again your clothes will turn pink forever" so has to step down from being a Death Eater. ATTENTION. This scenario requires a secret-dark-drunk bethroyal Contract signed by James and Sirius.

** It is later found that the Lestranges kept Bellatrix under potions keeping her unhinged and deranged and out of her mind because she was an excellent dueller and they wanted someone like her in the death eater ranks, no questions asked.
