Additional points if includes: 100k or more words. H/Hr. Ron/Dumble bashing. Being Talented, capital T.


** Even though it's dead or abandoned the Travel Secrets series is a good read.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

  Yr 2: Harry has returned in time after one too many things went wrong, his careful plans have been messed up, so he's trying a few new things. He's searching for the diary, but while things are similar, his presence has altered enough to keep him on his toes! No pairings. Dumbledore/Goodguys bashing. 2nd in series. Rated M because I'm paranoid. Everything belongs to Jo!

  Harry's now going into his 3rd year again & it's getting complicated. Sirius still escaped & Harry has to deal with Slytherin politics & some extra timetravel on top of old drama. Rescuing Sirius is the number one mission, but things keep reverting & Harry is worried he can't change a Thing. Dumbledore/Goodguys bashing. 3rd in series. Rated M coz I'm paranoid. It all belongs to Jo!

  In the station between Life and Death Harry makes a different choice. Now he is eleven again, nothing is going the same as before, and people are starting to ask questions, especially the Malfoys, the Hogwarts professors and, most worryingly, Mad-Eye Moody. Harry is beginning to suspect that he might not be up to this Master of Death business and everything that goes along with it.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.
