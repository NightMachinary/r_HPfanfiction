So I was wondering how continental European muggleborn witches and wizards receive a magical education

- Hogwarts got the British Isles covered decently
- Beauxbatons presumably take muggleborn from Portugal to the Netherlands
- Durmstrang according to the Wikia explicitly don't take muggleborn. Presumably, they cover an area from the Scandinavian countries, via the Baltics over Central and Eastern Europe until the Balkans.
- Italians go where?
- Koldovstoretz take the Russian students and we could lump in the Ukrainian and Belorussian students too because of a shared cultural past. Perhaps they even go as far as the CIS countries

That leaves us muggleborn Scandinavian, Baltic, Central and Eastern European and Balkan students.

I read somewhere that there are correspondence courses available, but I fail to see how this could be organized efficiently. As a teacher, how does one detect the errors in pronunciation or swish-and-flicking or stirring from afar? And how would students find the time to dedicate to it next to mundane schooling? Perhaps there's wizards popping over from time to time to go over stuff, but who would they be? Presumably they could be educated at Durmstrang so there could be some anti-muggleborn bias.

Secondly, what happens to these children after they've been introduced to the magical world? Presumably a ministry chap comes along, tells them they can subscribe to courses such and such and warns them ... Not to perform magic at home? And if students don't develop themselves properly, they're all little obscurials waiting to happen.

Lastly, in Beauxbatons, what would the instruction language be? All these sprogs first learning French quickly to hopefully catch up?

I would love to hear your thoughts on the matter.


** The idea that Durmstrang covers almost all of eastern Europe plus Northern Europe is ridiculous. Krum is Bulgarian, Poliakoff sounds Russian-ish, I say Durmstrang is in Ukraine or Belarus or Bulgaria or Hungary.

I want to see a school that looks at pre-christian beliefs of Northern Europe. The Vikings had tjeir magical beliefs in plenty; seiðr, völva, runes etc. I'd love a magical community where runes is a popular way of casiting magic, where there are creatures from Nordic mythology (giant wolves, eight-legged horses, non-human beings like draugr, elves or wights, etc)

*** Durmstrang presumably is in Scandinavia, since Dumbledore greets Karkarov as a friend from the North. Compared to Scotland, there's not much more North in Europe.

Furthermore, we have three other magical schools that each cover a continent.

I don't think the scale of these (or Durmstrang) is well thought out but this what we have in the "source" material.

**** Karkaroff is not a name you'd find anywhere in the Nordics. Large parts of Russia is much further north than Scotland, even past the arctic circle. I don't consider JKRs interview canon.

** The canon is quite straightforward. There are eleven /permanent/ schools of magic. Everyone else is either homeschooled, apprenticed, or goes to more temporary institutions. These last would essentially be one person who decides to be a magic teacher and gets students during the course of their career. When they retire, that's the end of that school, and new students would have to find someone else. This is how most schools operated during many periods of European history, so it's a historically accurate idea.

  This is because the wizarding populations of most countries choose the option of home schooling. Occasionally, too, the magical community in a given country is tiny or far-flung and correspondence courses have been found a more cost-effective means of educating the young.

  There are eleven long-established and prestigious wizarding schools worldwide... Smaller and less well-regulated institutions have come and gone, are difficult to keep track of, and are rarely registered with the appropriate Ministry (in which case, I cannot vouch for the standard of education they might offer).

They probably go to a bootleg school.

** Honestly, the schools seem bit weird. I would expect that the oldest school would be in Greece or Italy.\\
For the rest, I would say you need to look what the areas of influence were when Statute of Secrecy was established (1689)

+ geography doesn't really mean much here, look at historical ties.\\
Lithuania, Poland + Belarus, Ukraine likely would have a common school from the commonwealth times, since the commonwealth would be older than the statute, so I wouldn't see a reason why they wouldn't be together after statute which was established while commonwealth was still going strong\\
Estonia and Latvia would be bit odder case. During establishement of statute, they were either fully (Est) or partly (Lat) under Swedish rule, however, the ruling class was always Germans. So I suppose that they both could have gone for either some school in Germany or Sweden, but I don't really see that happening as they were looked down upon. So I would say here it was more apprentice-ship until more recent history.\\
Scandinavia is likely to have it together, yeah, I would say their school would be likely in Sweden (or maybe Lappland in Finland, hm), since Sweden controlled FInland at the time. Denmark and Norway at the time were together. So my guess is that there are two Nordic schools since I don't see them cooperating to make a single school in the region at the time. + Iceland is likely to have had apprenticeship system.

Well, I don't really want to comment on other places as I am less familiar with their poltics during the time.

** Some points to remember:

Of the eleven schools, several are still unnamed- they could also be in Europe, though that would leave large parts of the globe uncovered.

Those are only the schools registered with the ICW- smaller schools and correspondence courses are confirmed to be things.

Tutoring and master/apprentice relationships might be options for some, especially those with wealth, though they are likely to be more accessable to wealthy purebloods than muggleborns.

** Technically, it could be anything. The eleven schools are just the ones that got registered with the ICW. So, there could be equally large schools run by and for Muggleborn throughout Europe, for all we know. Hell, could just be that Beauxbatons takes every Muggleborn in Europe. Floo and Apparition are readily available, so transportation is a non-issue when it comes to 'catchment area'.

Probably the most likely option is like the magical equivalent of Ragged Schools or Pop-up Education Centres. Few teachers, low funding, little more than the basics, just make sure that you aren't gonna break the statute or kill anyone type places.

** I headcanon that Durmstrang and Beauxbatons (and the rest of the eleven) are only the boarding schools. There are plenty of day schools, possibly with dedicated Floo networks or assigned portkeys for the students to go to and fro each day.

I simultaneously headcanon that "no Muggleborns at Durmstrang" is a mistranslation. In East Europe, they still practice changelings - Muggleborns are swapped with Muggle orphans if identified young enough, and if not then their parents hexed to believe them killed. The young Muggleborns are then adopted by pure blood families and raised as their own. Durmstrang's policy isn't based on blood status, but on family status. No Muggle /raised/ at Durmstrang, meaning Harry wouldn't be allowed either.

**** Isn't it? /shrug/ Well, then I headcanon the Pottermore eleven are the only ones recognized by the ICW. Or the only "Ivy League" ones. The point is that elitist snobs pretend they're only ones that ~°~matter~°~.
