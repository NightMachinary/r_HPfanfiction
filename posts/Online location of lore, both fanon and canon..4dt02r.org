For some reason I caught the fan fiction writing bug and want to write a short fan fiction story tentatively titled "The Sorting Hat's Dilemma". So I fire up ywriter5 and start adding some characters and suddenly realize that I have no details on Helga Hufflepuff or /gasp/ who is in Harry's class. Now I don't know about you, but I suspect having the names of every first year student of Hogwarts that year /might/ be useful.

Long story short; are there wikis or other resources online for looking up background details? I'd like my first try at writing fan fiction to not be completely horrible!

It's not great. You have to be careful because not only do they mix movie and book canon up, they also include games, theme parks and so on.

[[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/index-2.html]]

A bit more reliable but hard to navigate.

*** I'd add that the wiki also frequently dips into fanon (e.g. the Draco Malfoy article). The Lexicon is absolutely brilliant, though.

**** I used to use the wiki but it's wrong or uses random sources too much. Like it says Lavender Brown is dead.

***** it's because they use the films as cannon if it doesn't contradict the book.

*** Thanks for the link to hp-lexicon.org, I didn't know that yet.

I agree about the wiki. It's mixing all sorts of sources together, and it's often not clear from which source the information comes from. For example the wiki says Armando Dippet was over 300 years old, using the screenshot of a Daily Prophet shown in one of the early movies as the source.

**** Yeah it'd be fine if they referenced stuff but they hardly ever do, it drives me bonkers. And there's been times when people have said stuff in my fics is wrong and linked me to a wiki, only for me to find out, through a lot of digging, that it's from the movies or a game or something, even when it's directly contradicting the books.

The lexicon is pretty great, it's very old now, I used it, gosh, must be ten years ago. I think the owner got into a bit of legal trouble with Rowling over an encyclopaedia at one point, and then the whole site sort of got forgotten about :(

*** Thank you for the lexicon link! That really looks useful.

Hopefully I can keep my canon/fanon screwups to a minimum. :)

**** Even if you mix it up, don't let it bother you. :) I have a very strictly canon-compliant fic, and I still made a couple of mistakes. It was only like, one or two people that stamped their feet a bit, they got over it.

** For canon, your best source would be in your bookshelf. After that, HP-Lexicon and Pottermore maybe. Then the Wikia but you have to verify its data.

For Fanon, that's all you. You want spell x to do function y, then do it. Just look for the latin or greek root of your word, add a little -ius or something to it and you're good to go.

*** Thank you :). This story won't have any spells cast. The fanon I care about boils down to which houses it's appropriate to place various characters into as my story explores the impossible constraints placed on the sorting hat.

** As others have said, HP Lexicon is your friend. The HP Wiki may have articles that are longer on the same subject, but they frequently devolve into including movie "canon" and games, due to the fact that pretty much anyone can edit it. Not so with HP Lexicon.

It's also has many very well-written essays, such as the one trying to pin-point the exact location of Privet Drive, the one describing the Dursley's house, etc. I truly recommend it.
