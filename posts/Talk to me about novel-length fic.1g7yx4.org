** I would recommend the Alexandra Quick series; they're stories (four at present) set in the American Wizarding world with none of the original cast. I find them highly enjoyable.

Here's the first one: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]]

**** Not to give anything away, but Alexandra is a seriously headstrong character. So headstrong, in fact, that she makes me actively angry at times. The author of the fic lets her learn from her mistakes, but she makes plenty of them. I say read the first few chapters of the first book; if she makes you really mad, stick with it. If you find her to be really uninteresting, then it might not be what you're looking for.

For me, she's fun to read because she is very engaging. Give it a shot!

Over a million words. Complete AU. Does book 1 till 7. Book 7 is a WIP. It really is a good solid read. It has some minor language errors in there but I read around them :)

**** Prince of the Dark Kingdom is an interesting read. Very slow and extremely long, to the point that some would call boring, but it packs in as much action as possible.

Extremely AU while being Potterverse compliant (as in there aren't magical flying robots and moon bunnies invading the Earth) with a hint of the mythical. Fairies may also make an appearance.

I recommend it if you have the time! There's a naked Luna in it!

**** It was intended as promotion of author's favorite ideas (see title), but it was done well - the other side is not described as stupid, evil and sinister. Main problems are that all children behave like 20 years old and status of WIP with glacial updates, but in this case it is unlikely that story will end abandoned.

Both Harry and Voldemort are replaced by OCs (interesting, well done, better than originals but still OC). Not a problem but it is something that people should know before start of reading.

Some criticism is also available at [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=15594]] (warning: DLP, thread ends as case of extreme flaming, trolling and stupidity. I disagree with almost all opinions, but it is the best link to show what is disliked by some in this story).

But I think that this story is one of the best, with great humor, characters, interesting plot and multiple great ideas and I recommend it to everybody (it convinced me that fanfiction may be readable).

******* To be fair, it was actually interesting in a lot of respects. Long as hell (maybe 900k words altogether), and pretty plot-heavy. The basic premise is that there's a Potions accident and Harry and Draco accidentally swap bodies. Big cast of characters, lots of time travel, Founders stuff, Malfoy backstory, Polyjuice shenanigans. I'm not 100% sure, but I think the main pairings were Harry/Hermione, Draco/Ginny, and Draco/Hermione, with the slightest /hint/ of Draco/Harry subtext.

I thought the size and scope were ambitious and admirable, but I could not deal with the characterizations. Draco wears leather pants and is very suave and witty, not at all canon-compliant. The author hated Ron, so there was a lot of Ron bashing that I didn't like (lots of Weasley dislike in general, really).

This fic was a big deal in the fandom ten years ago. Like, /huge/. If you've got a ton of free time, it's probably worth reading just to get a sense of fandom history (if that sort of thing interests you). It's since been taken off the internet so the author could pursue Writing Real Books, but if you're interested PM me and I'll hook you up.

************* Ok, it sounds like our taste is fairly similar. Here are some older fics I remember reading a long time ago and being impressed by. Since they were written while the books were still in-progress, they're not canon-compliant. Some of them are kind of dated in terms of characterization and tropes that used to be "in vogue" but now aren't, but IMO the writing quality is pretty high.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=619&chapno=1][After the End, by Arabella and Zsenya.]] This one is set after that version of the final battle, with /mostly/ canon-compliant ships (Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione). I re-read this one recently and still really liked it, and it's quite heavy on the plot.

[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=2226&chapter=1&font=&size=][A Thousand Beautiful Things, by Duinn Fionn.]] This one builds to Harry/Draco, featuring a redeemed Draco who spies for the Order. Basically Lucius Malfoy puts a nasty curse on Harry that Draco has to break by taking a vow of silence.

[[http://trickster.org/res/transfig.html][Transfigurations, by Resonant.]] Another Harry/Draco, this one is about everybody gathering to clean up and reopen Hogwarts after the final battle, and they discover it's been magically booby-trapped. Some of the characterization is pretty wonky, as a lot of redeemed!Draco fic tends to be, but I think the innovative magic more than makes up for it. There's some really fantastic and detailed magical stuff in this one that I love, including the author's perspective on Native American magic.

[[http://www.mediafire.com/download/s8i73ufeu939dg0/TCWoM.7z][Everything written by Maya.]] This is a link to a pdf download of her Complete Works, which have been mostly wiped from the 'net because she too became a published author. I especially recommend Underwater Light, Quality of Mercy, and If You've a Ready Mind. Underwater Light is her Harry/Draco "classic"; read that one if you want to cry. Quality of Mercy is her version of Book 7 and is basically a Horcrux-hunting fic. If You've A Ready Mind features Ravenclaw Draco; read this one if you want to laugh.

[[http://shoebox.lomara.org/category/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][The Shoebox Project, by Rave and Lady Jaida.]] This is the only Marauders fic I've ever enjoyed, but it is a goddamn delight. It's a combo of fic and art and it is so, so funny and sweet. Endgame pairings are James/Lily, Remus/Sirius, and Pettigrew/bitter loneliness.

EDIT: All of these are long and plotty as hell, btw. I don't really read stuff that's just romance.

After the End seems soppy but readable. Will give it a try.

Thousand Beautiful Things... noticed the "Slytherin's" instead of "Slytherins" errors quickly, but it looks nice besides that.

Transfigurations sounds interesting.

My internet network is blocking that download site, is there any way you could email me the PDFs directly? I can PM you my email address if so. I'm not really into crack/comedy, but the others sound intriguing. Underwater Light - happy ending, sad story, or sad ending?

*************** After the End is a bit soppy at times for sure. It's definitely got that feel-good, "One Big Happy Weasley Family" sort of vibe by the end. But there's a lot of plot that isn't romance-based, including some really cool stuff with Dementors, magic we don't see in the books, and that kind of thing. I really like that it gives Ginny and Hermione a /lot/ to do and doesn't make Ron useless.

Sure, I'll send it to you, just PM me your email. Maya's pretty funny, but none of her novel-length stuff is crack!fic. Shoebox isn't either, save perhaps one memorable chapter where the Marauders are learning to become Animagi. Underwater Light was one of the four HP fics featured in Lev Grossman's /Time/ article about fanfiction. Haven't read it in ages, but I'm pretty sure it has a happy ending, it's just that the getting there hurts like hell. I can probably dig up some /super/ tragic Harry/Draco stuff if you like sad stuff, though.

This one's interesting if you like the odd ship and a noir-like feel, it's a time-travel Moody/Lily II fic, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=297210][Out of Time]].
