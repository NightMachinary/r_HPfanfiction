Looking for fics with a protective Harry that has a sister. A great scenario would be that Harry goes to Hogwarts before her and she has to stay with the Dudleys until she gets her letter (or she is a squib). Thanks.

*** I was thinking about this one too, but I'm not sure it's really "well-written". My big problem with this story is that Harry and Emma enter school as ridiculously mature children and then stay exactly the same as they grow. I think I got to around chapter 30 before calling it a day.

** The second story in the /Psychic Serpent/ trilogy features a younger sister named Jamie. In that universe Lily was pregnant when killed by Voldemort.

So in the end of the of the first story, Harry is manipulated by Voldemort: they go back in time during the attack on Godric's Hollow. Harry uses the imperius on Lily and orders her to to promise Voldemort that she will raise baby!Harry as his servant. This unmakes the previous universe and creates the AU where Lily is alive and married to Snape, and Voldemort never fell. Harry regains his memories of the previous universe when he turns 16 (the age where he went back in time with Voldemort).

Anyway convoluted explanation aside, it's actually a good story, even as standalone. I certainly view it as the best Barb has written. The AU is extremely interesting; the repercussions of Voldemort not dying ripple, altering the world in dramatic ways: although Voldemort did not take over directly, he all but controls the ministry and his agents have been destabilizing the muggle world for years - the Soviet Union hasn't fallen, for example, and the European powers are preparing for war among themselves.

Good stuff.

**** Seeing that this was written in 2002, the backstory of Snape, Lily and the Marauders is completely different. Snape is not the character you know from canon in this - although he did a lot of bad shit, he never called Lily a mudblood or gave the prophecy to Voldemort - in fact the "as the seventh month dies" prophecy does not exist in this universe.

The [[https://pastebin.com/Wfh1Mvph][triangle prophecy]] was given by 6-year old Peggy Weasley (OC, yes the Weasleys actually have 9 children, lol) in front of her family, Trelawney, Remus and Peter. Pettigrew was actually the one responsible for Voldemort learning the prophecy.

** "The Lesser of Two Evils" has an interesting spin on it. It's a crossover with Buffy the Vampire Slayer -- and if you've watched that you'll know the story of Buffy's sister Dawn. Well, in this story, Dawn has been made Harry's sister instead, and pretty much the entire wizarding world has had their memories modified into thinking she's been there all along.

Sadly, the fic seems to be abandoned, but it is very well written.

***** Not really. Harry Potter is basically the protagonist of Mahouka: he's ludicrously overpowered even when there's no reason for him to be, he's disrespected and unjustly attacked by bad caricatures so that the author has a thin veneer of justification to write him inflicting ludicrously disproportionate violence, every woman in the story is either attracted to/has sex with Harry in suspiciously degrading ways or gets /maybe/ one line. (Harry's sister is the latter, and her single line is "Harry...?" When the premise of the story is to resurrect Harry's sister, I'd rather hope we'd actually see her talk with him after being resurrected, not literally sit in a chair while the narration tells us how good it is that she's alive.) And the way the author treats women in general is really, really creepy.

******* Consider Selena, the vaguely Eastern European detective-mercenary. The highly experienced detective-mercenary that has spent years at her job and is among the best in the world, worked on many dangerous cases with many dangerous people, and generally should be a grown-ass woman. You know, one that does not plausibly see an eleven-year-old as seductively dangerous, to the point of going into an extended kiss with him on their first meeting and having sex with him in later ones.

But Harry is a power fantasy, so she does.

You say that "you realize why everybody acts the way they do", but:

The reason is literally that Dumbledore accidentally mind-controlled the Potters.

It doesn't explain many /other/ character inconsistencies and other warpings of characterization, plot and setting alike towards building up the power fantasy.

It comes in the second-to-last chapter, much like HPMOR's explanation-of-bad-characterization reveal comes in the final chapters, and is subject to the same criticisms.

And, of course, it doesn't change the Doylist critique that the author just wants people unlikable enough to justify Harry doing violent and degrading things to them and generally acting like an asshole.

************* Oh yeah, I've been at [[/r/MGTOW]], following your post history. I would think that is what I ought to look up, isn't it? The stuff that is posted there and on it's sidebar? You never clarified, so I just assumed that is where your ideas about women fester and find positive feedback.

Its an interesting read into the minds of people whom I will never understand. The subreddit says "cutting through collective ideas of what a man is", but for all this independence talk, most of the users seem to be caught in their identification over their collective idea about women and how much they dislike or even hate women, and how women need to know their place and how women are this awful breed of lower humans.

Its just a cringefest of a circlejerk. If this was not what I was supposed to be looking up, go ahead, link me. Enlighten me. I'm not above admitting that I am, as everybody else, caught in a bubble of information. Please, go ahead. Pop it for me.

But I doubt you could ever step out of your little safety bubble yourself, to acknowledge that your perception of reality is just a whole bunch of self-protective whining about how twisted the world is because it doesn't cater to you.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
