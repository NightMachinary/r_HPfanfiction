Or "How I helped the Chosen One defeat the Dark Lord, but get no credit"

Basically a different version of the manipulative trope. Dumbledore, recruits Ron and Hermione to help Harry survive. He can be a genuinely good dude still, or a total nob. But he's absolutely one of the most incompetent wizards ever.


** Hermione sobs in the corner watching Harry's mangled limbs. It took the combined effort of her and Ron to hold the troll long enough before the professors and prefects arrived. While Madam Pomfrey has assured her that this isn't much worse than the usual Quidditch accident, watching your fellow student being thrown around like ragdoll is still traumatic. Ron is conversing with the Headmaster and likely memorizing yet another set of runes. At this rate, with how many runes Ron needs to discreetly trace on Harry's bed every night just to give Harry enough protection from all the magical mishaps during the day, the Weasleys might have their second Curse-breaker soon.

Reminiscing the day when she was visited by Dumbledore right after McGonagall left, she wondered what made her accept the assignment. The Headmaster's explanation is solid, and of course, there's no way for someone like her to just let evil won, but she should've asked more when Dumbledore suggested she learn various healing spells, to be readily used on short notice. And use it she did. Snape never managed to finish his year-opening question because somehow, an empty cauldron /could/ explode merely due to careless wand-waving from idle Harry. Most of the flying shrapnel contained by the Potion Master quick reaction, but without her first non-practical spell ever, Harry would've bled out right there. At least he can't even get his broom to hover, he probably would just rocket and crash face-first to the castle.

Dumbledore said allowing the three of them to face life and death situation is necessary to create a strong bond between them, but she knows Harry already hold the entire school in high regards due to the various times they saved him from certain death. Even Malfoy has stopped him from accidentally straying to the Whomping Willow. She hopes the plan to bring Harry facing Quirrell alone is shelved. Making convincing chaos to justify why the various prefects aren't watching him when he split from the crowd with Ron going to the bathroom is hard enough, there's no way Harry won't be suspicious of being left alone or even going to the third floor at all. Students from pureblood families have told her their plan of adopting Harry into their family so their house-elves will always hear him and disapparate him away from the first sign of danger, with this incident it's very likely the required paperwork is being signed right now.

** Wasn't there a fic where Harry was a handsome, good natured himbo and incompetent but also super powerful? Like a less self centered and superficial Lockhart, but with real powers.

So he could cast a patronus right away, but he'd make it too large and too bright and basically blind himself temporarily and shit like that. And it drove Hermione nuts that someone so powerful could also be so dumb, but she still cared for him as a good friend.
