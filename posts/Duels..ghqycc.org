A fic that have amazing fight scenes and duels. I'm also looking for fics wherein hogwarts have a dueling class or a dueling tournament for every year because i think the fact that theres none really leaves out a lot of creativity that can be done with hogwarts.

I've read linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) So something similar to that i guess.
