Ancient Runes. In canon, they're only treated as an old language and a source of convenient symbols for personal identifiers or other markers. In fanon they're often treated as a vehicle for powerful wards and enchantments.

What do you think is the /best/ angle to come at Runes from, and why?


** I'm so fed up of them being used for warding/enchanting and of Harry switching to Runes and Arithmancy to show how awesome he is that I now prefer when Runes are just a useless dead language. I did Latin in school (cruel parents) and I prefer runes to be somewhat like that.

*** Agreed with this except for the useless part. Like you say, I imagine it as like Latin in the Muggle world, i.e. something that allows you to read old texts. But I imagine being able to read old texts as more useful in the wizarding world than the Muggle one.

Also, since we know that Tales of Beedle the Bard was written in runes in the 1400s, runes continued to be used by wizards long after Muggles had abandoned them. So it isn't even really old texts.

**** That would be an interesting story, a rune-savant Harry, able to comprehend Runes excellently. He does all the cliches, testing into 4th year, blowing everyone out of the park with his knowledge. But, in the end it's just a dead language. In the war against Voldemort he is unable to kill Voldemort.

Maybe at that point they flee Britain, and spend time scouring ancient ruins and old tombs, Harry only really has his one true skill, reading runes. Maybe he can find old secrets, or rituals that resolve the plot.

I don't know, it just sounds fun to have a 'Smart/Rune Harry' who wins by research.

*** I don't agree about preferring them to be a dead language, but I agree that they shouldn't be an /Level of Badass/ or three in a can. I also agree that Harry would never give a fuck about runes. He spent far too long having intellectual pursuits discouraged growing up and hanging out with Ron. His strength is in direct evocation and dueling. Adding something analytical like runes doesn't fit him. Now, I find lazy-ass, unintellectual Harry a disappointing character to read about, but that doesn't make the portrayal an inaccurate one.

This discussion is preparation for a Jumpchain SI that's being forced through a series of jumps by a Random Omnipotent Being. Already an analytical person, and very much of a mind to build things rather than just shoot on the fly and hope for the best. Given that, and the sorts of runic magic I'm discussing elsewhere in the comments, what do you think?

** I treat Runes in a similar fashion as Potions in the sense that while Runes is a dead language, I prefer them to be usable for certain types magic. Granted, not just ANY magic of course but very specific magic. Runes would never be used in duels but they would only be used for one of two things: to fortify a person, to fortify an object, or to fortify a location.

What this means is what Runes would be used in order to imbue certain effects onto objects or places. It would not be used for anything that a wand or Potions could replicate but the magic that it is used for is situational. Therefore the average wizard may never use Runes to their full potential since Runes are just a bonus and are not mandatory. It would take at least thousands of Runes drawn out in a very specific format (e.g. like programming) in order to make use of their magic properties, and even then, the vast majority of Rune magic would be stuff that spells/Potions do easier (e.g. Rune-made Muggle-Repelling enchantments on a house versus the far easier Muggle-Repelling Charm). The Rune magic which isn't outclassed by Spells/Potions would be capable of things Spells/Potions aren't capable of, that would not common knowledge (i.e. similar to the knowledge of Horcruxes pre-HBP), and with effects that would be considered Dark Magic.

In that sense, Runes is like a programming language. The average person may never need to learn how to program since everything is done for them. It can also be seen as the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower][Magikarp Power]] trope of magic in that Runes would be nothing more than a dead language for like 99.9% or wizards and with trash-tier magical abiliteis. However that 0.1% of wizards who are skilled enough at magic in general (i.e. Dumbledore) would be able to use them to their full potential, which is also like [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome][this trope]] and also [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter][this one too]]. Similarly with rituals, Voldemort's rebirth is what rituals at their full potential would be capable of and thus would be far outside the reach of the average wizards. Any rituals that regular wizards know of would simply not be worth using.

Runes in a sense are like rituals. They are old, out-dated methods which are outclassed by both spells and Potions in almost all situations. Perhaps in like 1500 B.C when many good spells and Potions weren't invented till later, Runes would be more powerful than both then but as time went on, Runes just became redundant.

Speaking of rituals, I see Runes in the same light. Wizards don't do rituals or chants, they use spells and Potions. However the most powerful of rituals would vastly outclass anything one can do with spells or Potions. In fact, Voldemort's rebirth is the perfect example of this. I think that those style of rituals are what rituals would be used for in the hands of a skilled wizard, that for every supremely powerful ritual, there are 1000 ritual that can be done better by spells/Potions Perhaps Runes were once used to place enchantments on buildings (i.e. Muggle-Repelling Charms) but they were made redundant since spells and Potions outclassed them by being far easier to use with a better effect. So for every supremely powerful Rune-created enchantment, there are thousands of ones that are useless or made redundant by spells/Potions.

*TL;DR: Runes were made redundant by spells and Potions. 99.999% of Rune-related magic are either too worthless to ever use, was outclassed by a spell/Potion that is easier to use. That 0.001% of Runes that are still useful in recent years are the types of magic that aren't taught at Hogwarts (or perhaps anywhere for that matter), and/or are far too difficult to perform, and/or are considered Dark Magic on the lines of the ritual used to revive Voldemort at the end of GoF.*

** I'm doing it as runes being prohibitively slow and inefficient for almost every daily task. Even if you take the time to learn how to use written language as a magical tool, it's so much more involved than just using a wand. There's only two real reasons to learn it. First, it's so obscure that you could very easily catch somebody off-guard. Second, you can automate spells with it that otherwise would require a caster. Doing a complex transfiguration with parallel spells, for instance. Nothing even a highly successful wizard really needs to do.

As for the class itself, it really is mostly just learning the runic alphabets and studying old magic which used written language, not necessarily learning to do it for yourself. Ancient Runes is basically History of Magic, but focused on an actual stage of magical development in history, not the events in the magical world. The full name is actually /Ancient Runes and Pre-wand Magic/ (itself a misnomer since wands did exist), but it just ends up shortened to Ancient Runes.

Part of the reason for doing it this way is that, if the class really is just about a dead languages, why does it exist at all? Just to be a parallel to Latin in the muggle world? Could they possibly have enough students to justify it? If it's culturally relevant enough to study, why doesn't it appear anywhere but one in-universe book?

** My understanding here is that HP magic heavily builds on the "magic of language". In a nutshell: A pig-latin incantation works because it sounds mystical and old and therefore resonates like that in the wizards brain. /Stupefy!/ works while /Stun!/ doesn't, even though there isn't much difference between the words. I even went so far once in a short fic that I said that by giving meaning to a spell by social stigma or by making it sacrosanct, a society makes the spell even more potent. I used the Unforgivables and the Patronus to showcase this. By making the Unforgivables unforgivable, you create a myth and legend around them which makes them even more dangerous. Expecto Patronum is hailed as this ultimate magic against fear itself. By the belief alone that the Patronus can shield you against fear, a society boosts the spells potency itself. From another angle, creating a spell is much less about wand movements and the like - they're important too since they're rituals and rituals make people belief in things - but the most important factor in spell creation is believing in it. Which is why I'd argue that people like Luna Lovegood could be masters of spell creation and magic itself by their nature alone, while people like Hermione Granger, for example, need a ritual to believe in the potency of magic, like in this case, reading about it in a book.

But anyway, Ancient Runes, I think, are magically powerful due to their extremely Old&Ancient^{^{TM}} nature. People think they're powerful, therefore they are and a repeated learning of Runes solidifies that sentiment of Proto-Germanic, Egyptian, Sumerian and Etruscan being especially powerful. Its the same with an alphabet that is perceived magically potent as it is with a spell. You can't get a spell by inscribing something with the modern italic alphabet and arabic numerals. But you can get magic by using Futhark and cuneiform.

** I'm incorporating runes into my fic in a fairly unique way -- at least in Harry Potter fanfiction wise.

If you've played the MMORPG game called RuneScape, then a lot of this will make sense, as that's where I'm pulling some things from.

Firstly, you must go out into the wild and find a mine that you can than carve small square pieces of rock from. The rock has never lost any of its former size, nor has it crumbled. It is essentially pure magic. As the rock is pure magic, you must obtain the pieces by hand and not by spell.

Once you have your piece of rock, you must then enchant it with various things. Once you've enchanted it, you have a few minutes to draw your symbol on, which will make the piece of rock into a rune. A flame for fire, a tornado symbol for air, a water drop for water, a rock for earth, and a brain for mind. There are more symbols, complex and easier, but they have long been lost.

After your symbol has been completed on your rune, you must then repeat the process another three times creating additional runes. The more runes you add, the more powerful the spell. You can combine two ‘fire runes' into one, saving carry space.

Basically, the process takes 4 -- 6 hours to create one rune and you need 3 -- 4 runes to cast a spell as a fire spell requires 2 fire, 1 air, and 1 mind.

In the current times, most wizards are impatient and hardly anyone takes the class, bar for 5 or 6 people. Most of those people are simply curious and drop it. You can't actually go out and start making runes until you're fifth, sixth, and seventh year at Hogwarts. Year 3 and 4 are purely theory.

** i always liked the idea of runes being used to make things simpler, but not actually add anything. like notations for spell maintenance. perhaps having a spell you can place on runes that turn red in the presence of certain spells, so you know if something goes wrong with the magic you placed on the object or place. or spells that can work like switches for other bits of magic. in warding you can use rune marks to help identify where the edge of the protection spells should be. since lots of magic is usually invisible, but the whole lot'd work without it. in fact, you could just use english, or drawings of bunnies. i always preferred the idea of beating the bounds for protection spells. even in cannon the black house seems to have been protected by sirius dad himself, so chances are that strong protections are more about repeatedly casting spells over a place than complicated maths puzzels. i think it's cannon that two people casting those spells in the same place makes it stronger. or, else the order could just get a nice house and cast those spells again. with 20 odd people it shouldn't take much time, but it'd not be as powerful as black spending decades doing it in the one place.. and, cursbreaking is more about setting up shields so you don't get cursed to death while spelling the counter charms down.

in my head cannon writing magic books in common english is probably a modern cultural change. so even books 50 years old are possibly written in superior magical languages. they use to do that with the bibles right? only in latin because god-magic! i always like parselscript in fics because fuck everyone else, stay away from my secret magicz; right up until super-harry translates the lot. bugger.

** In my writing, Runes plus Arithmancy is 95% of enchanting. (The rest is metallurgy, spellwork, astronomy, that kind of thing.) Wards are just quick and dirty enchantments. Some spells have similar effects to some wards, so terminology has slipped away from rigid, concrete absolutes.

You can enchant with runes alone. This tends to be inefficient compared to using runes with arithmancy. The amount of effort you need to put into them, how long they'll last, how effective they are, how hard they are to defeat, that all depends on the precision that arithmancy can provide.

You can't enchant with arithmancy alone. You can use it to analyze spells and construct new ones.

But doing either is a lot of work, which is why people memorize tons of spells instead of inventing them on the fly or sketching runes for what they need.

** I think many people feel that Hogwarts (for being touted as the premier school for magic) has too many useless subjects and I agree. So the subjects that we don't really see 'on screen' in the book are used as substitutes for stuff that is actually helpful. We see 6 years of of education and there doesn't seem to be anything in there that would be useful for being a Curse Breaker (and I don't see how knowing a dead language would entirely fill that gap)... so either Bill Weasly learned everything that's actually required for his job at Gringotts or there has to be more to Hogwarts.

There's too few AU fics that make Hogwarts competent... subjects like Herbology, Astronomy, Divination or even History of Magic could be awesome, but they seem borderline useless in canon.

In the books it mentions Ancient Runes as a requirement for Curse Breaking IIRC? So, maybe its used more like a language and not lie how anyone else says.
