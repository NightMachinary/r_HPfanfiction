I was trying to do the math, I'd imagine a boarding school would have more students then a public school (also depending on the timeline, after the war, who died/didn't have children, et cetra).

I'm horrible at math... but even I am questioning if it's even possible for the Professors to be able to teach as many students as they are, each day?

Now; to put it simply, I know that the houses are divided, Say Slytherins with Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs with Ravenclaws, or a variety of different possible outcomes there.

Let's say Harry and co have Defence Against the Dark Arts on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, or some other variety.

Even when Harry and Co aren't in Defence class, the Defence Professor is still teaching to other classes, even if they do let's say Gryffindor and Slytherin, and Hufflepuff with Ravenclaw, that's still a lot of students, in all four houses, in all seven years...

What would you say (roughly) is a good number of students, of course changing depending on different things.

Man, I'm surprised that there aren't more people like Snape, lashing out of the students, I'm trying to come out with the math (which I suck at), but just imagining the teachers having to teach so many students each hour (most likely), and each day (definitely each day). It just... crazy.


** Let's assume that the 'core' subject professors always teach 2 houses together for the first 5 years, then the NEWT classes are small enough that they can teach all 4 houses together. If their class meets once a week, that's (5*2+2)=12 classes a week, 24 classes a week if they meet twice a week, 36 if 3 times a week. That seems doable if classes are 1 hour long, since iirc, in canon, most classes meet once or twice a week.

There's 40 students in Harry's year, so if that's the average amount of students per year, that's 20 students per class, a reasonable amount.

Scheduling all that so there aren't overlaps would be super complicated, but presumably there's some magic way of doing that.

*** 36 hours a week is too much for teaching, especially considering teachers have quite a lot of responsibilities outside the classroom. I guess 24 would probably be fine.

However, if you only have the 5 subjects (later 7 with the electives), and they only meet for one hour (including break), I'd expect most of them to meet 3-4 times a week, or you'll end up with 2 one hour periods a day.

*** You also have to keep in account of Double Potions as well, which Double means longer, so that'd be two hours as well.

It wouldn't surprise me if some other Professors also had Double, but Harry never made mention of it, since he liked those Professors.

Though it would be just like Snape to make Double Potions because he'd think that they were all inadequate, that they'd need an extra hour on it.

There's also Quidditch to think of as well, how do the students find the time to go to class,do homework, and play Quidditch, that's a lot of work.

**** Iirc, Harry had double potions, but only once a week, so that works out the same as two regular classes a week. Quidditch did seem to take up a lot of time, especially Wood's team, but I guess Quidditch players just spent less time on homework than model students like Hermione.

** As a teacher, I don't see the same problems you do. Let's say the first 5 years you have 2 houses together and in the last 2 you teach all four houses at once. So you teach 12 classes. If they all have 2 lessons per week (some years they might only have one and some they might have three) that's only 24 lessons to teach, which is exactly what I teach as an Austrian teacher. With 50 minute lessons that's only 20 hours. Every other profession has to work 40 hour weeks, so that's still 20 hours short. That time is for preparation and corrections and I assume head of house duties and so on. Even if they have three lessons (one single and one double), that's still only have 36 lessons a week, with 30 hours of work. If the lessons are 45 minutes it would be less. And I'd assume they don't have 3 lessons a week every year. They might only have one in first year. Who knows. Overall it's definitely doable and not too far off what any other teacher has to teach.

Here you can find the time tables: [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/hogwarts-classes/]]

Edit: classes are 45 minutes and double is 90 min

Harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher's hands this subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain disengaged, and he spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye.

** There are between 800 and 900 students.

In Prisoner of Azkaban we see during a Quidditch match that Slytherin alone has over 200 people in it and even specifies that they make up a quater of the spectators.

#+begin_quote
  They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Three quarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like “GO GRYFFINDOR!” and “LIONS FOR THE CUP.” Behind the Slytherin goal posts, *however, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent of Slytherin* glittered on their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very front row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile.
#+end_quote

Also in the same book we see that there are over hundred carriages transporting the Students to Hogsmeade

#+begin_quote
  Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track, *where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students,* each pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.
#+end_quote

In Goblet of Fire during the Yule Ball there were also about hundred tables with a dozen seats each.

#+begin_quote
  The walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost, with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling. The House tables had vanished; instead, *there were about a hundred smaller, lantern-lit ones, each seating about a dozen people*
#+end_quote

This is all consistent with Rowlings statements that there are about a thousand students at Hogwarts and that Harry has considerably more than 40 students in his year(though she admitted that she only created backgrounds for 40 of them).

This results in the Problem about the numbers of teachers since the ones we know couldn't teach that many students without Time Turners, I reconcile this by imagining there to be a larger number of Teachers who Harry simply didn't pay attention to(similarly how he ignored the teachers of electives until it became Relevant for him), that fits nicely with various Departments for the Subjects of Hogwarts existing, for example Harry explicitly mentions Aurora Sinistra to be part of the Astronomy Department.

#+begin_quote
  Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside Professor Sprout, the Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray hair. She was talking to *Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department.*
#+end_quote

Rowling also mentioned on Pottermore that Mcgonagall applied for a job in the Transfiguration Department.

#+begin_quote
  Finally, after two years at the Ministry, she was offered a prestigious promotion, yet found herself turning it down. She sent an owl to Hogwarts, asking whether she might be considered for a teaching post. The owl returned within hours, *offering her a job in the Transfiguration department, under Head of Department, Albus Dumbledore.*
#+end_quote

Its not a stretch to assume that these Departments have more People working in them than just the Heads.

**** We don't know enough about the period before the first war. Or more specific the Maraunders era. I think it is safe to assume there were more teacher back then tho. Because we know at least at the time Minerva starts teaching there were enough teachers to have department heads.

As for after the war has settled. According to the Harry Potter wikia Neville becomes a herbology teacher under professor Sprout (who was dep. Head at the time) and took over as head when she retired.

So it seems it was only the period where Harry goes to school that there was only one teacher in each subject.

Although it does now come to mind that the position of d.a teacher is always described as THE d.a teacher. Sounding like there was always only the one. Perhaps it depends on the subject and how many pupils take it at newt levels? Like at my highschool not a lot of students did their finals in history so we only had one history teacher who did the upper years. However every student had to take Dutch, so we had 3 Dutch teachers.

** Canon has seven class periods/day. According to 5th book, Harry's Monday is double History; break; double Potions; lunch; Divination; double DADA; dinner

Main subject Professors teach 6 periods for the first five years of students- 3 periods per year-group, for two houses at a time = 30 periods. The remaining 5 periods cover NEWT levels- 3 for all of the 6th years and 2 for the surviving 7th years. In order for there to be Professors with ANY off-periods, there must be a Time Turner involved, but really they only need one, which all the staff gather regularly to use as a group.

One Turn at noon to start a second cycle of 7 AM-noon periods. Second Turn at dinner to restart afternoon periods. Third Turn at 10 PM if the Professor is a glutton for punishment.

Associate Professors (who teach electives) have an easier schedule- four periods to cover for years 3-5, 2 periods for NEWT levels. 16 periods- barely half of the Main courses.

Professor Sinistra has a different issue; each year needs telescope time. One can assume that the night can be double-booked or that NEWT-level students come out to spy the heavens whenever it suits them, such that they can proctor classes if Aurora is having a bad night. Also, since cloud cover is a constant issue, there may be make-up observations happening every night that it's viable. Also, winter observations may be cut short for student safety.

On the student side, their lives are a bit more open: 3 periods for seven classes for the first five years = 21 of 35 periods scheduled. 3rd-5th year adds 4-10 more periods of instruction (2 per subject, minimum two electives). If the electives also get 3 periods per week, that's 6-15 more classes, or one period more than exists in the schedule. Hermione actually would need a time-turner to attend all 5 electives, and there would have to be schedule overlap then. Thus we conclude that electives only require two periods per week.

In a psychotic (Spiral) world, additional non-OWL electives might occupy the other two-period openings. One student could take all 5 OWL electives and two more non-OWL electives, such as Languages, arts, literature, muggle sciences, theology...

Of course, since the population is captive and entirely secular, there's no reason why Saturday and Sunday couldn't be scheduled with classes as well- they just weren't in the books.

The Time-Turner solution also explains two other issues: how High Inquisitor Umbridge could both teach her classload and audit the other professors; and why the professors weren't upset that Hermione was using one in her third year - it's considered an educational tool.

** From what we can somewhat infere from canon, there are 2 lesson hours (45 minutes each) of each subject for each year, and below OWL students have 2 classes per each year, while 6th and 7th years have one classgroup per whole year (so, all houses together).

If we consider canon the number of 40 students in Harry's year (and similiar amounts in other years) it is perfectly doable for 1 teacher per subject to deal with everything.

If we were to consider bigger amounts of people per each year, perhaps in different times or somesuch, there would be a need for more teachers due to classrom sizes. But as far as lower years go they could be taught by NEWT students for a fair share of their lessons with an occasional chekup by the head teacher of the subject (i.e. if not for the plot of the books Harry could've been tasked with teaching DADA to 1st or 2nd year students as a part of his coursework in his 7th year).

** In canon, Hogwarts is fairly empty for its size - it's not quite clear how big the student population is, because JKR is terrible with numbers. You could probably make an argument anywhere from 300-1000 students from canon, though I'd trend towards the lower end with how small the houses and classes are described day to day. It seems.possible with how the students are organized that all classes can be taught by the professors.

I personally like the idea of a larger Hogwarts - and introducing junior professors to fill in gaps, making it partly function as a university.
