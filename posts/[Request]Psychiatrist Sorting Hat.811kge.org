  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP

** I don't know what angle you're looking for in that, but in Catechism by dreamfall, the sorting hat acts as a sort of therapist to a ritually abused Harry.

** Happens a bit in The Power of the Mind which is a rewrite of The Sorting Hat's Stand. The Power of the Mind only covers up to chapter 43 of The Sorting Hat's Stand. The Sorting Hat's Stand goes up to Chater 45, 46 and 47 are Author's notes.

  What if the founders built in a safe guard to protect incoming students from abuse at home, in the form of the hat? How would the hat react to Harry's so called childhood? Rated for language and expected violence. As complete as it is ever going to get. Revised as another story.

  The Sorting Hat serves more purposes than is apparent. One of them is as a safe guard against abusive families. What changes might be wrought from this? Rated for coarse language and mild violence.
