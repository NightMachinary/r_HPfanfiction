I have the theory that Voldemort choose to use the left arm for the dark mark because of your wedding band goes on your left hand and the fact that our ring finger has a vein that leads to the heart. It was his way of making a claim over the "heart, soul, and love" of his followers since he would never be able to have that while trying to achieve his goals as dark lord and while growing up he never had such commitment and therefore "ensured" that he would with his followers.


** Alternatively, it might be a reference to the Left Hand Path, traditionally associated with the occult, black magic, and sometimes satanism.
