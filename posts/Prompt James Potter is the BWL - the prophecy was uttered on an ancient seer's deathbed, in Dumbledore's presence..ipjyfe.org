Marauders+Lily replace the Trio.


** In that story I think it would be more the Maraurders and Lily would be a side character, love interest of James (quite like Ginny for Harry).

James is the BWL because he is born during an epidemics of Dragonpox that kills his parents and Abraxas Malfoy, as well as several prominent wizards. James also has it but he survives it with nasty scars. Using his dad's notes on cosmetic potions research to find a cure for healing scars resulting even from the darkest of curses.

** Who was the one spitting the bean and who is the dark lord he survives? Still Voldemort? And which James Potter, the first or second? Would the first one be an older kid when he was nearly killed? Has everybody keep their shit together and search for a way to bring this savior into the world and then Harry has to be protected because it becomes clear that he would be the father of the savior and everybody keeps it from him until he already knocked Ginny up?
