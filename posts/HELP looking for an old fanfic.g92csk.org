:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey, so I have no idea what the Harry/Drago fanfic I used to love is called, but the only thing that I can pinpoint is that the phrase "amour credo fides" is used by one of the Weasley twins and that Harry and Draco has access to a secret room at Hogwarts that only Harry had access to. Also I don't think the fic was ever finished.

If I can remember more information or the name, I'll update.

Please help because this isolation is hell and I need something that brings me joy.

Both of these involve a secret passage room type of thing. Maybe try posting in [[/r/HPslashfic][r/HPslashfic]] too? Sorry I couldn't have been more help and I hope you find what you're looking for (:
