:END:
First of all posting from mobile sorry for the formatting

So what I remember of the story was that it was 1) after voldemorts defeat 2) Hermione got her parents back from Australia 3) they are not happy with her because she sold their house and practice under value and they got in trouble in Australia because she faked their credentials 4) Hermione sort of expects Harry to help her

Any help is appreciated.


** Haven't read that but it makes a lot of sense. I always did wonder how, if ever, Hermione's parents could ever feel safe again around her. Or if they could ever feel certain in their own minds and perceptions. It's worse than mind-rape, if you really think about the implications - it's some "And I Must Scream" shit, to be made into your daughter's puppet.

*** Plus it was almost condescending of her, wasn't it? Like "I know better than you"

**** If that isn't running through her mind constantly then I will be shocked. Of course the thing is, most of the time she is right. (Being an author expy will do that for you.)

I love Hermione's character but she really is never wrong.

#+begin_quote
  The war is finally over and even though Harry "saved them all" it seems he isn't allowed to have a life of his own. Everybody thinks he will continue to be the hapless pawn, but Harry has other ideas - and a lawyer. Bashing galore of just about everybody except Voldie because he is dead. Completed
