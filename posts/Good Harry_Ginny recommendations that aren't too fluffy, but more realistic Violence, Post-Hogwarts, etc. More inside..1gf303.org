Hey, everyone!

I tend to go back and forth with fanfiction. I'll go months without reading it and then there are times like this where I go from reading my current novel to reading fanfiction in between.

I usually enjoy Harry/Ginny, with other canon pairings making appearances, where Harry and Ginny have a more normal relationship -- not one that is overly fluffy or unrealistically happy. Just normal, but maybe with their fair share of "problems." Also, sometimes fics where Ginny has to marry someone else instead of Harry, but thye find each other and Harry "saves" her. I have only found one fic that has done this successfully. (It's called "Come Ready and See Me".)

I like violence, drama, and angst. Post-DH, Post-Hogwarts, and AU if the story is good enough. Stories where Harry is an Auror going on missions, anything of that nature where violence/action might be involved. Also, dark/horror is great too. As long as there are canon pairings, anything goes, really -- assuming it's mostly canon. I don't enjoy time-travel fics.

Often I'll find myself searching Fanfiction.net for SOMETHING, but usually there is something wrong with the fanfic that turns me off. Good grammar is basically necessary for me to actually like the fic. Even if the story is good, bad grammar and pumctuation will kill it for me.

If you guys need anymore info, please let me know!

*** I'd second Northumbrian's work, an extensive and well written vision of canon-compliant, post-Hogwarts worldbuilding.

** Another of note is Deadwoodpecker's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose: Always and Always]] (and sequel). It has a few moments of fluff, but has plenty of drama and angst. Excellent writing all around, one of the gems of the fandom. Post-Hogwarts, time-travel.

At the risk of posting a self-rec, my (Perspicacity's) story [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] may fit your parameters as a non-fluffy, "more realistic" Harry/Ginny novelette with a dark/horror theme. As a warning, the story is told in third person, present tense, which puts some people off.

*** I got about halfway through this one and for some reason I couldn't finish... I just couldn't buy the whole Hermione plot twist, if you know what I'm saying. I'm reading Grave Days right now.
