Ok so I have an idea about a fanfic called Magical Tavern. Basically it is a Tavern that is in diagon ally and is its own pocket world and can show up any where. Time does not pass when in it and when you leave all you remember is that you want to go there and when you have a meeting there with someone. You remember when you go back in. I have a couple things figured out.

Ghosts can enter and exit while keeping their memories but can't tell anybody.

Merlin is the barkeeper.

It takes place between TOotP and HBP.

I want it to be about conversations between the characters.

I need help with conversations. It can be about anything but it has to be an entertaining conversation. Thank you for your help I will post the link to the first chapter when it is written.


** Sounds a bit like the Restaurant At The End of The Universe or the Red Dragon Inn.

Also, unlimited crossover potential.

**** The sequel to Hitchhikers Guide. The titular restaurant is literally at the end of the Universe, as in when the Universe ends,

Red Dragon Inn is a tabletop game about what the adventurers do between their quests while staying at the Inn.
