So in manipualtive Dumbledore stories, he is often screening Harry's mail to make sure nothing gets to him and to see who he is talking to. But Harry is one day dared by a Gryffindor to write a love letter to someone in another house (Daphne, Susan, Cho, whoever) and send it right there and then, in the great hall. So he does so ... and the letter goes to Dumbledore instead. Everyone around Harry would know who he was meant to send it to, and would be utterly confused about why Dumbledore got it instead.


** Better that they don't know who was the addressee and just assume he was hitting on good ol' Dumbledore.

*** I can totally see a teenager boy actually sending the letter to Dumbledore in the middle of the hall for a laugh, even more so as Dumbledore seems like the type to just laugh it off along with him instead of feeling hurt or offended.
