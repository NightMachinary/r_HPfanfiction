I dont want none of those ones where it turns out Hermione was under a love potion or just so happens to regret her decision out of no where. Basically i want there to be consequences and that they cant fix it with her just crying in front of Harry and Harry forgives her right away.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** The point of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244813/1/A-Champion-s-New-Hope]]) is that Hermione goes along with Ron and does not believe Harry after the Goblet of Plot Holes.

In linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure]]) both Hermione and Ron help go along with the Order manipulating him for their own reasons.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
