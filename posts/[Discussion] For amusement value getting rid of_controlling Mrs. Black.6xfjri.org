Just saw this in a fic last night. Again. What are the favorite methods you've seen of dealing with Mrs. Black's portrait in Grimmauld Place?

I enjoyed Hermione stabbing her with a basilisk venom-infused Goblin knife. Particularly nice that a Muggleborn did it.


** "Is this a load bearing wall?"

Favorite quote before they got rid of her. Had me all giggly.

  Challenge response. Danny and Danielle are in England and happen to witness an introduction to a world they never knew existed when they see Harry Potter face Dementors in an alleyway of Little Whinging. When the Order of the Phoenix finds out that the Phantoms could somehow also see dementors, despite being muggles, secrets of the Wizarding World and their upcoming war unravel.
