I've never self-promoted on here before, and I've never been super interested in AU before, so yay for getting out of my comfort zone. I wrote this short story (~20k words, completed!) in response to a challenge, and I'm sharing because I ended up being really proud of it. Link at the bottom.

It was a fun and thought-provoking exercise, translating these characters to a Muggle school setting. Who would they be? Which cliques would they inhabit and where would they fall in the school social hierarchy? This was easier for some characters than others. (Some aspects of Harry's life, for example, there are parallels for; but there's no dark wizard constantly trying to kill him, no ‚ÄúChosen One‚Äù prophecy or savior status, no adjusting to a secret wizarding world.)

I didn't rehash /The Breakfast Club/ exactly or align the characters with those specific cliques --- I used it as a general guideline: Put 6 teens who would typically not interact (or if they did, it would be awkward/dismissive at best, but maybe even downright hostile) in a room together for 8 hours, and get them arguing, exploring their differences, and confronting how they see each other and themselves. I don't start out even with the trio being friends --- Harry and Ron get along decently but aren't best friends, and there's no troll in the bathroom incident to have united them with Hermione (who, as you can imagine, is in a different social sphere to them).

I kept their canon birthdates, so it's set in the 90's and I got to throw some nostalgia in there (pagers! Green Day!) I also sprinkled in some /Breakfast Club/ jokes and other John Hughes references (but you don't have to be familiar with the movie specifically to get the fic).

Anyway, I'll stop rambling --- if anyone would be interested in checking this out, I'd be thrilled. <3

(PS --- Because it's inspired by /The Breakfast Club,/ I decided to set it in America, but to be clear, I'm perfectly aware these characters are canonically British and I'm not just carelessly/lazily Americanizing them here.)

** AAAAAHHHHH I LOVED IT!!!! god it's so hard to find muggle aus that don't just go straight into romance and this fic was just perfect I loved how the different characters had their distinct personalities and like you really kept them in character! (Ok maybe except Draco cos in the books he would have never talked to Neville voluntarily) but i really loved this different version of draco, he has rich boy problems but also got the nosy attitude that book Draco has.

I mean basically I love high school au so this was just perfect for me! Thank you for this great fic! It was well written, the pacing was just nice and the characters were just evenly and nicely fleshed out. Loved it üíï

*** Wow, thank you!! <3

Yes, I admit that with Draco I had to make certain modifications, and hopefully it makes sense why I had to. He was the perfect antagonist to propel all the interactions, but I did have to dial back some of his canon traits because I didn't have 7 books to be able to redeem him, I had 8 hours and 20k words. XD Therefore, I couldn't make him a raging bigot, but I could take the fact that he's a spoiled, obnoxious shit-stirrer and identify that it comes (at least in part) from insecurity and a parent who is a dick, forcing him to be something maybe he isn't all that enthused to be.

** I feel like I pop up whenever you mention this fic, but I promise it's because I love it and not because I'm stalking you.

The characterisation, humour and pacing in this fic are all incredible. I thought I was pretty firmly in the camp of 'non magical aus are boring', but this has singlehandedly changed my mind. Really recommending it to anyone browsing this thread!

*** I think I might be too much of a gremlin for validation to have any problem with you popping in to say nice things about this fic. XD But really, thank you so much for your enthusiasm!

I was in the same boat as you, sort of thought of Muggle AU's as boring because, well, what's the point of HP without magic, right? That's why we love it. But I'm on a site where I've interacted with a bunch of people are into Muggle AU's, and I started reading them and I can see the appeal in playing with the characters that way. <3

*** Enjoying so far.

Finding myself getting bored by the backstory/lore explanation about Harry's past. I really really don't need the diversion into Harry's past. I can put two and two together to figure out that you'd kept it cannon when Harry had told Draco not to talk about his parents. I could further put together that he's probably sitting on a bunch of money from the speculation that Draco gave. Luna musing about it is causing it to drag, and frankly bludgeoning me over the head with something that you've quite clearly alluded to already.

Then the action picks right up again, and it's good again. Until we go more into a character's musings after the 10:15 time marker. I can figure out that Harry is annoyed at the interruptions, and just wants to space out for a while. You've already made that clear. I don't need to see a detailed accounting of what's going on in his head, because we've already been through it. Mentally waving my hands, and going "ok get on with it already."

That said, this paragraph of exposition was perfection. /chef's kiss/

#+begin_quote
  Luna tensed but did not give him the satisfaction of a response. She had been written up for kissing Padma in the quad at lunchtime -- apparently that was ‚Äòcausing a scene,' while Michael Corner and Ginny Weasley doing the same thing twenty yards away was totally normal -- but that wasn't what had landed her in detention.
#+end_quote

Perfect amount of what's going on in Luna's head without a ton of diversion from the action. Perfect balance right there.

Here's another spot where you goddamned nailed it:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúI don't need you to speak for me,‚Äù she said curtly, staring Harry straight in the eye, somehow more upset with him sticking up for her than she'd been with Malfoy. Harry didn't know why, but was certain he didn't deserve it.
#+end_quote

Exactly the right balance of glimpse of thought, and moving it along.

This bit is good, the rest is dragging:

#+begin_quote
  His dad had never been harsh with him, but there had always been a certain frustration in the way he tried to manage his son's concerns, with suggestions like Just try to make friends and Just stand up for yourself -- like Neville hadn't already thought of that. And then there was the one that his father never said directly, but which Neville heard loud and clear anyway: Just try to be more normal.
#+end_quote

It's a really powerful moment that you're diluting with the rest of the musings. Especially when you follow up with this line:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúI think...‚Äù Neville swallowed. ‚ÄúI think it's the first time he's ever been proud of me in my entire life.‚Äù
#+end_quote

You have extremely powerful writing, but you're watering it down with repetition.

I really really really like the characterisation of both Ron and Neville. You've done a fantastic job with them, and I love how you're seeing their characters unfold. It's cannon, but it's not trite, you know?

This right here. This is GOLD.

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúAnd I'll bet you complained about it, didn't you? And told him exactly what you'd done.‚Äù
#+end_quote

Overall, EXCELLENT story, and very enjoyable to read.

**** Hey! I'm happy to know you enjoyed it and very much appreciate your thoughtful comments on it.

I think you're right in particular about that very lengthy section in Luna's narrative, and I can see I need to go back and ask myself what I'm trying to accomplish there.

I'm really happy those bits from Neville's section in particular moved you -- I think that may have been one of my favorite parts in terms of the overall story and character interactions.

Thanks so much for your comments on the characterization; I'm very happy it seems to have worked out! Particularly Ron, he was a great challenge as he doesn't really fit into a particular stereotype, and he has a lot of very real traits, strengths, and weaknesses, and it was important to me to preserve his... Ron-ness? XD ... in translating him into the "real world."

***** You had just the right mix of humour to balance out how grim the story's backdrop was. 1990s was a pivotal time. Politics were going bonkers. Computers were rolling out. You were rapidly going from tapes to CDs, VHS to DVD, and any number of other major shifts all over the place.

You caught the sort of climate of the time of a teenager in your typical suburbia school, as well as the mood of the students. Everything from feeling powerless all the time, down to how arbitrary things were in general by people in power.

I would fully support a sequel.

*** Haha! Actually not Tom Holland even though that pic does kinda look like him. It's a model named Linus Wordemann, whom I use sometimes as a Ron (and/or Percy!) face claim, because as much as I love Rupert Grint, he is not my mental image of Ron. :) As you can see, I also used a different face claim for Harry.
