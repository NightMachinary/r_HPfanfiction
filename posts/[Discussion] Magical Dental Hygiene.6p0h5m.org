Bit of an odd topic, but I find myself writing a scene where a magically-raised 7yo Harry abruptly has to spend the night away from home, and I mention that his parents have just thrown some clothes and a toothbrush in a bag for him.

Which got me wondering if wizards even use toothbrushes. More importantly, if they don't---if they just rely on spells---does this mean wizard children have to get their parents to clean their teeth every morning and evening? Alternately, are there magic toothbrushes? Or some other magical teeth-cleaning device? A potion you rinse with that does the whole job?

What do you guys think? Do you have a headcanon about how wizards clean their teeth?


** In POA, Hermione does consider buying her parents some Toothflossing Stringmints in Honeydukes. Presumably, those do exactly what it says on the tin, which is flossing your teeth while you eat them.

One thing I have noticed is that even when witches or wizards have a magical method for doing something, it's usually just employing magic to do something manually for them. Like setting dishes to scrub themselves as opposed to just using a spell that instantly cleans them. Or, the stringmints above.

So, I figure that everyday toothcare may involve magical implements that marginally speed up the process or allow a person to do it while focusing on something else (e.g. eating candy to floss your teeth). Anything that would involve pain or discomfort is going to fall under the take a potion category of healing. See cleaning, whitening cavities, etc. Any physical adjustment would involve spell work (e.g. Hermione's buck teeth being shortened). See straightening, aligning, etc.

Although, I imagine that magical folk generally have worse teeth even if the overall fixes are easier, because they don't take the regular precaution of a dentist's visit to catch problems before they necessarily become visible.

*** Yes and no, there are also spells that do stuff instantly.

For example OotP, see Tonks:

#+begin_quote
  She pointed her wand at Hedwig's cage. 'Scourgify.' A few feathers and droppings vanished.
#+end_quote

The same spell can be used differently on humans, James Potter uses it to fill Snape's mouth with soap.

So yeah, it seems to be an weird mix-thing to me.

**** Hence the use of the keyword "usually".

In the same scene you referenced, Tonks fails to make Harry's clothes fold and pack themselves neatly into his trunk. And, Scourgify is a bit ambiguous on its own, since it isn't just 'zap! instaclean!'. There are apparently bubbles involved as some sort of physical act of cleaning occurs.

** I am sure I have read (and thought it logical) a fic where there was a mouth cleaning/refreshing charm, but it was considered a quick convience thing that one might use in a pinch, the same way we use mints/gum or a drink to get rid of a bad taste or feeling. Wizards still have baths and showers and do laundry/dishes - though they have magic to enhance or speed things up - so I suspect that there are variations on toothbrushes. I think they use manual methods for a lot of things because no one wants to set their dishes on fire when washing up in a bad mood, or sleepily scour the inside of their nose instead of cleaning their teeth. There is a lot more margin for error with magic.

A toothbrush that sings and lights up for little kids, grown up ones that do extra things like flossing...

I'm sure Fred and George would also have a line of ones that turned your teeth blue, made your breat smell like farts, or repeatedly bit your face.

** All of the above I assume. It's safe to say that Magicals have had several more industrial revolutions than Muggles.

** I've always thought one's magic fixed their teeth for them, unless they got blown up or knocked out.
