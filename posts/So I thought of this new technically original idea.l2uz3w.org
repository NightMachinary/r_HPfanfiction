What about a Harry potter X Hoi4 TNO fanfic Ok wait don't leave it can work and as crazy as it sounds it could be an interesting story, And you ask what is TNO well I'm happy to answer TNO is a Hoi4 mod based on the alternate history what if the axis won ww2 Great Britain is divided Russia is balkanized and half of France was given to the SS, so how would it work:

1.main events in Harry potter either happen earlier or it simply happens after most of the interesting stuff happens, the global wizarding war(Grindelwald) starts at 1889 and ends around 1920/19 and the 1st wizarding war (Voldemort) starts around 1932 and ends around 1941 (note:all characters are either born earlier than they actually we're in canon or something like that) Harry is born around 1940

1. How the wizards are affected by the way things happened a) Voldemort goes to Germany after his defeat instead of Albania(burgundy also works)

b) wizards in Russia have varying levels of acceptance ( some governments would start anti wizard hunts and things like that )

c) the German ministry of magic has a somewhat Voldemort/Grindelwald worldview and they are highly influenced by the Germans

d) french wizards either live very well or very badly depending on which side of France they live in (remember wizard ministers present themselves to Muggle ministers/presidents/Emperor's or dictators so it makes sense)

e) the weird resistance in Bohemia could be lead by a wizard secretly ( explains how they are so well organized and know almost all German supply movements )

f) the German and the British ministries have a rivalry ( maybe a border conflict ) in Cornwall as it is a German puppet but it is in mainland Britain

g) wizards in western russia and inner West Africa don't live well and are extremely hard to find (cause: German Luftwaffe "target practice")

h) Jewish wizards are not treated badly until the German/burgundian influence kicks in the German/Burgundian ministries.

I) wizard around the Mediterranean don't live badly and they're lives aren't too different after the end of the world war ( except in regions like turkey, the Levant, the gulf states, Greece and Iberia )

j) Japanese wizards have a more advanced view of the world (Japan went through a large modernization after the world war)

I will answer any question you guys have about the concept and I hope you all have a great day/night.

There's a better explanation down in the comments


** You're not getting much feedback on this because the entire first part is an incomprehensible mess of acronyms and jargon. I have no idea what Hoi4 is supposed to be and your TNO explanation didn't clear that up at all. Alt history hp fics can be pretty good, but maybe don't assume people know what your crossover source is.

** Hearts of iron 4 is a world war 2 strategy game in which you can control any country that participated existed during that era

There are a lot of mods for that game one of which is TNO (The New Order) as mentioned earlier is a what if the axis won scenario

What happened was that the axis won descisive victories agaisnt the allies including:

Succesful German invasion of the Soviet Union Successful Japanese attack against pearl harbour crippling the Pacific fleet and destroying US naval capacity in the region

Germany conquered Moscow and Ireland joined the axis

Germany created the 1st nuclear bomb and tested it on Hawaii ( they shipped it to Japan obviously )

The UK fell soon after US troops retreated from mainland Britain after the nuclear attack the US opted for conditional surrender

The UK was balkanized into different collaborations those being: England, Wales, Cornwall and Scotland

A pro axis regime was established in France aswell as the re-establishment of Brittany

Japan took most of eastern Asia aswell as Hawaii and ports in the US Pacific coast

Spain gained a puppet regime in western Algeria and took over Portugal and Morocco

Italy created the Triumvirate an alliance of nations in the Mediterranean including turkey (axis member) and Iberia aswell as Saudi Arabia the gulf states and the Levant

Some years after the war Heinrich Himmler commander of the Waffen SS started plotting to take over Germany and exterminate all Jews, Mr Hilter and other German commanding officers decided to give him Belgium and part of eastern France since they thought it would be an easy way to get rid of him... It wasn't

The last democracies are the US, South Africa, Australia, Guyana, Iceland, new Zealand and Canada

Meanwhile Himmler managed to created the most secretive state in the world, his goals are to get a hold on nuclear bombs and hide Aryans in bunkers underground until the radiation discipates as a way to exterminate all non Aryans

The Soviet Union collapsed after the Germans took Moscow a second time after the Soviets tried to do a second offensive, now there are many Russian factions fighting between each other for the scraps of what's left of the USSR

The western russian states are bombed regularly by the Luftwaffe to make sure they never get the chance to reunify Russia

Nothing much happened in South America as always

Inner west Africa is an anarchy because of German bombings too

The Germans did the atlantropa(drain parts of the Mediterranean sea) project and Italy is messed up as well as Greece and some of northern africa

The main threats to German dominance are the SS Ordnenstaat burgund, inner politics and the OFN (organization of free nations)

Albania, Greece, the Levant, the gulf states, iraq and Ethiopia are Italian puppet states

The Levant is a highly unstable region because of Arab insurgents and Turkish border skirmishes ( the Turks weren't happy with what they got after the war )
