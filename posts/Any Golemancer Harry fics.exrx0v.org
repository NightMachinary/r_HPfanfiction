Anyone know of any good Golemancer Harry fics? I've been looking around for them but I've only found abandoned ones from 2008 that end up having little to do with golems.


** Seconded. I read one recently(ish) that felt like a crossover with Warmachine maybe? Harry had been banished to another dimension where he became a child soldier with these steampunk magic golems. Eventually he and his golems were sent back, and absolutely decimated Death Eaters. I believe it was abandoned though. I'll look through my follows/favourites and see if I saved it, but I want more.

  The spell that should have killed sent its victim to a world where man bound machines to their will. Warcasters commanded and warjacks obeyed, and the Fates that had meant for the boy to carry a burden found instead a girl who stared at them beside the empty crib of her twin. Fifteen years have passed and the Dark Lord has returned. The Light must have a champion, but who?

** There's an excellent story that just finished, with a lot of golem construction in it, but it's not HP; it's an original work. linkfp(Mother of Learning)

  Zorian, a mage in training, only wanted to finish his education in peace. Now he struggles to find answers as he finds himself repeatedly reliving the same month. 'Groundhog Day' style setup in a fantasy world.
