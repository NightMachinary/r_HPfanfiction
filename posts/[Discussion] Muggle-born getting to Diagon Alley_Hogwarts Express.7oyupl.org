When a character is a muggle and has never known anything about magic and wizards/witches being real, how does this affect their school prep? Like for instance, would the acceptance letter even be taken seriously? How would they know where to get their school supplies or how to get their platform to get to school? Would a professor or someone from the school come and talk to the family?


** For Harry's year, and up till she became Headmistress, it was McGonagall's job to visit the first years and introduce them to the magical world. :)

I presume it's the job of the Deputy Headmaster/mistress. :)

*** Thank you for the info! I was pretty sure someone had to come, because if my parents got a letter saying that I was accepted into magic school, I'm pretty sure they would have just thrown it away with the junk mail!

So then, I guess she was busy with that when Hagrid had to go get Harry? Or was that just a special case?

**** I think they presumed Harry already knew about his magic, so they just sent the letters. Dunno why they sent Hagrid though, unless both McGonagall and Dumbledore were busy...

Damn, now I want to read a fic where McGonagall or Dumbledore turns up on the island instead of Hagrid...

One of the many points of departure in Dumbledore bash fics. Clearly they sent Hagrid to keep Harry ignorant of his inheritance and under the thumb of Manipulator!Dumbledore.

He already had to go to Diagon Alley to get the Philosophers Stone from Gringotts and they probably thought he could just stop by and take him.

Or he simply wanted to see Harry again and asked Dumbledore.

***** There's a fic where Septima Vector introduces Harry to the magical world. He also runs into Luna in Diagon and there's a nice friendship dynamic going on.

The story is technically abandoned but the "last" chapter is them boarding the Hogwarts express so it actually has a nice cliffhanger ending. The author thinks about calling it done at this point.

Intimidation factor. The Dursleys were being difficult, so Dumbledore sent his most intimidating staff member who wouldn't hate Harry on sight.

****** Which is really stupid. If he even suspected that Intimidation would be necessary then the Dursleys are no suitable guardians.

Coming to think of it, Dumbledore knew and simply did not care about such trivial things as laws. He admits that he knew that Harry was living through "10 dark years", which would count as an admission of guilt for a whole lot of crimes.

** We know from canon (books + Pottermore) that a professor (or Deputy Headmistress/master) is sent to introduce muggleborns into the Wizarding World. However, we are introduce to Hagrid who was probably supposed to tell Harry how to get onto the platform.

Many fics, usually either Muggle wank fics or just independent!Harry fics usually have him find out there are several brochures about everything in the Wizarding World. However, due to the wizards having the Statute of Secrecy, I doubt they would give muggleborns what most fics make out to be everything everyone needs to know about wizards.
