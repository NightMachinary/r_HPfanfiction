Mostly it is Dumbledore Or Snape who are arrested for use of legilimency on Harry. It is mostly in powerful Harry fics.

I know that reading the mind of a minor is serious violation of privacy and not exactly moral. But according to canon, in the wizarding world, is legilimency punishable by law and a criminal offense?


** I think the canon approach is that it's kind of not widely-known enough for anyone to really care aside from specialists, in the same way that things like TEMPEST Shielding for electronics are basically really concerning to the espionage and security community but us regular folks don't really need to care about it, so we don't.

Hopefully someone with more canon knowledge comes along with a more specific answer for you. :D

** I found it in couple of stories, for example Snape in “A Switched Chance by LunaStorm” linkffn(6685668), which is very nice story with good setup, but unfortunately it has been abandoned exactly in the moment it started to be really interesting. Oh well.

** There's definitely no indication in canon that legilimency is illegal. Generally speaking, the wizarding world seems to have a much higher tolerance for violent and mind-altering magic than a criminal justice system like ours would, and conflicts are rarely handled through the formal legal system, except in extreme cases. Fanfics that change this are probably my biggest pet peeve in HP fanfiction--'and so Harry sued Rita Skeeter for libel/Snape for legilimency/etc and won in the Wizengamot' is an incredibly boring way to resolve conflicts in a story.

*** I wouldn't mind those stories nearly as much if they at least tried to make it realistic. And if they didn't have Harry trying to clean up a corrupt, nepotistic society via corruption, nepotism and waving his metaphorical cock around while throwing a tantrum.

Hell, in half those fics the case would be dropped or at least delayed pretty much indefinitely because Harry either a) enticed (baited) them into doing whatever got them in trouble; b) has a severe lack of evidence; or c) obtained the evidence in an unsanctioned way.

Like I'm not expecting fanfic authors to have a law degree but damn if you're gonna center your story around the courtroom at least briefly google how one works.

** As someone said, in canon, Legilimency and Occulumency are not that popular, so some people would not even hear of them, but Lords, Ladies, Heirs, and most Purebloods should, in my opinion, know about them, and at least know their basics. I mean just from the moral perspective you can say that 'reading someone's mind' is kind of a dick move, and then as a Lord/Lady/Heir/whatever you have to take into account that someone could steal some family secrets or something.

But yeah, I don't think it was ever mentioned that it is illegal, but considering how much power Purebloods hold in courts, it's safe to assume that attempting to 'read their minds' would result in severe punishement.
