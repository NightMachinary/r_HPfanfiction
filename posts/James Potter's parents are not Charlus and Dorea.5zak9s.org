I was reading this fanfic where Harry goes back in time and gets adopted by Charlus and Dorea (didn't really follow it because of the cliches and writing style) and that made search James Potter's parents, because they mention that Fleamont Potter already has a son (James). So I am wondering how many people knew this.


** His Parents are Fleamont Potter and Euphemia Potter, i think people just use Charlus and Dorea because either the fic is older than his actual parents names (Like in Naruto where Minato's name was Arashi till it was revealed to be Minato) or because they like them better, I don't care either way since James' parents don't play an important role in the story they can be OC's for all i care.

** It was once presumed that Charlus Potter and Dorea Black, who appeared on the Black family tree, might have been James's parents (since it was known that Charlus and Dorea also had one son). However, J. K. Rowling revealed via Pottermore that that is not the case. It is still more than likely, however, that Charlus Potter is some sort of relative of Fleamont's.

** Charlus and Dorea were the only known Potters beyond James and his family. So it's fairly understandable that people wanting to keep to canon characters used them since James's actual parents weren't named until recently.

** Dorea and Charlus were assumed to be his grandparents. Rowling "corrected" this assumption with a Pottermore article about the Potter family, making Fleamont and Euphemia Potter his grandparents.

What I think made Charlus and Dorea so popular is the connection with both the "good side" and the "bad side". Charlus was a Potter and Dorea was a Black. In addition to this, it also gave Harry a familiar relation to Sirius. If Dorea would be Harry's granny, he'd be a cousin to Sirius.

But in the end, at the very least Charlus would be a close enough relative to Fleamont to warrant him adopting Harry. In general, the generation before the Marauder era is an almost complete free-for-all of OC's. Do whatever the hell you want.

** Fleamont is just a terrible name so I'm willing to forgive any absence of it.

** My headcanon was that it was Charlus -> Fleamont -> James -> Harry as the line of decent. Not sure if that's accurate, but whatever.

*** It's not, Charlus is not a direct ancestor of Harry. Harry's great-grandfather was Henry, so we can assume his name is partly a nod to him.
