** "Draco," Hermione cooed, "/You/ are my Grindelwald."

Draco sneered. "What on earth are you talking about, Granger?"

"And that is why," Hermione continued, "that I must do this. You're too petty, Draco, to be a lover-turned-enemy for me. You need to think grander than serving the Dark Lord and bullying Muggleborns in the hallways."

Draco was getting concerned. Hermione had a bizarre twinkle in her eye and.. was she /licking/ her wand?

"So what would you have me do, Granger?" he sneered, sounding far more confident than he felt. "Make plans to 'kill all the muggles' or something utterly moronic?"

"That would be a start."

"Absolutely not," said Draco. "For one, I'd never be stupid enough to say it out loud, and secondly, there's no benefit in it whatsoever!"

"I thought you might say that," Hermione sighed, shaking her head sadly. "Draco, my boy, it's for the greater good. /Crucio!/"

The Super!Hermione in the Arithmancer is basically GreaterGood!Hermione anyways.

*** I just want something that pokes fun at fanon Hermione. Is that too much to ask?

I might have a slight dislike bordering on neutral for canon Hermione, but it's still by far the best version (barring Seventh Horcrux's Hermione).

***** Canon book Hermione? I mean I wouldn't be friends with someone like her in real-life (way too high strung), she has very little development, and her character gets away with things that Ron and Harry couldn't, but yeah, the book Hermione actually has positive qualities and is obviously a flawed human.

Movie Hermione is a $$$ grab though.

Hates a bit strong of a word. Umbridge gets everyone's hate. Voldemort does. Bellatrix does.

******** [[/u/jakky567][u/jakky567]] knows the drill, as do others that post Hermione-critical posts. The OP is literally asking for drabbles or stories that have Hermione deluding herself into thinking she's the next Dumbledore, which is critical to Hermione. Hermione stans downvote the thread, as expected. I post my little blurb (as I have several times before) and everyone gets a quick laugh, or downvotes me (which proves my point). It's just a joke you took the wrong way or too seriously.
