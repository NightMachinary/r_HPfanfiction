I saw a thread asking for 'best fics' the other day, and I started thinking: if you had a friend who had just joined the fandom, what fics would you have them read, not necessarily because they were 'the best', but because the stories would be a good introduction to a broad variety of tropes and staples of the fandom. Like, maybe 3-5 fics that were solid examples of /why/ the Harry Potter Fanfiction scene was one worth getting into.

For instance, my list would be:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] - this is crack! The story is silly, but also occasionally thought provoking.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] - give this one a look over; the first few chapters are pretty funny, and the story is generally engaging. Once you've finished it we can talk a bit about the mistakes the author made.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]] - this is a strong example of the 'Ground Hog Day' scenario, a very popular powerup. Despite this, you'll note Harry doesn't become ridiculously overpowered which is a problem lots of stories have.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] - here we see the elusive 'non-retarded manipulative!Dumbeldore' in its natural habitat. Also a decent example of how some authors approach the idea of nuanced conflicts and characters who act more like people. Also, dreams do come true, but hope is a disease of the soul.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse]] - delicious power-wank which looks at the problem faced by Harry as Master of Death, a being unable to die.

What would your set of stories be to serve as a primer for new Harry Potter fans? Remember, it can't be too long or your friend will get annoyed by the perceived workload!


** I think some time travel story, like Nightmares of Futures Past, maybe. To be honest, if someone gave me your list few years ago when I just got into fanfiction, I would have been disappointed back then, I feel like this is a list for a more experienced fanfic reader.

** It depends entirely upon the person who is asking. There's no general introductory fics since people have very different expectations when starting with fanficton. Some want stories that explain the great mystery of Hermione's marriage. Some want stories where the reader is put through 400k words of angsty teenage miscommunication where the any reader knows how it will end by page and age 5. Some want a certain character bashed to hell and back. Some want smut, harems and/or marriage contracts. Harry/Cho? Sure, we got that covered. Canon rehearsals with an OC that changes absolutely nothing? Harry/Hermione? Harry/Fleur? An absurd amount of slash that os entirely disproportionate to the real percentage of homosexual relationships in real life and in canon? 16 year old Harry getting raped by a twelve year old girl? Soulmates? The +magical Waffen-SS+ hot actors being the good guys? A Friendship story featuring Luna and Hermione that turns into romance? 2.000.000 words? 500 words? Logical inconsistencies pointed out? Plotholes fixed?

Well, whatever the person wants, we have it. It is important to consider the person's interests before recommending stories. If somebody introduced me by giving me a list of slash or a "Voldemort did nothing wrong" fic then I'd be out of here faster than you can say fanficton. I can give some recommendations but I cannot say if the person will like them since I don't know their preferences.

[[http://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/cho/hho/a/0/The+Headsman%C2%B4s+Hostage/Mantis%20FA/14]["Headman's hostage" is a nice Harry/Cho story that is not on FFN.]]

"Baby it's cold outside" by Potato19 is a cute Harmony story set in an AU OotP.

"Summer of change" is a classic that did not age well because many of its tropes became overused since its publication. Harry/Tonks.

"Why are you in my house? " if you want a MILF Lovestory. Harry/Narcissa.

"Rune Stone Path" for massive AU including reworked magic, somewhat accidental necromancy, polyamory and a believable legal system.

"Power of love" for fem!Harry that faces an uphill struggle.

The list goes on forever, entirely dependent upon the recipient.

** If they're new to HP /and/ fanfiction, I'd give them something short enough not to scare them off like Cauterize by Lady Altair. It's also good enough for them to potentially be motivated to seek out more.

I remember being new to fanfic. I'd only read one shots. Long fics were okay, but time-consuming and easily forgettable if I had to stop reading. Abandoned fics were a nightmare.

** Weres Harry is one of my go-to recommendations.

On the Delights of Drinking Blood and other works by Quatermass are also some of my go-to's, particularly for comedy.

White Squirrel's works, particularly The Accidental Animagus and The Arithmancer.

One World, for an expanded Wizarding World.

Recently, The Chessmaster: Black Pawn is my person favorite Slytherin!Harry.

Rebirth of the Founders is my go-to reincarnation fic.

** I've read all, but Harry Potter, And The Methods Of Rationality.

On a similar vain, can someone explain HPMOR to me, because all I get is 'science Harry' or 'OP Harry' if anyone would be willing to PM me important details or some plot points of the story so I can work out for myself if it is worth the read, that'd be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Warryn.

*** How to explain HPMOR?...

- Its "Harry" is not Canon!Harry+Science, but more of a new character entirely. He's a precocious child (for a very good in-story reason) who has read a lot of books on rationality and ends up in Ravenclaw. He often has internal monologues or dialogues which most people find very funny and some people find annoying.

- It's a heavy AU that "fixes" a lot of the "irrational" elements of canon. The Philosopher's Stone doesn't work that way, the Wizengamot doesn't work that way, the Horcruxes don't work that way, Pettigrew is not Scabbers, etc.

- The main element in the above changes is that Voldemort is /massively/ upgraded. HPMOR!Voldemort is a /genius/, Moriarty-level, and he is showcased a lot because throughout the story he is /actually possessing Quirrell/ --- not sticking out the back of his head, but using Q's body as his own. So we have DADA taught by Genius!Voldemort, and it's awesome. "Quirrelmort" (for a reason that gets revealed progressively) tries to mentor Harry, and Harry isn't too reluctant... at first.

**** Interesting, but i've also heard that Harry is too OP in this story, and while I don't mind a short, novel length OP Harry story, in a story with over a million words it would get old fast. Can you assauge my fears a bit on that, or at least that it's so good that you can ignore his OPness(haha(I know immature, but I was reading it back to myself, and chuckled)).

Thanks,

Warryn.

***** He is not what I'd call OP. He feels OP, certainly --- if such a character was dumped in the canon universe he'd curbstomp through it --- but the writer created a motto: "If you give Frodo a lightsaber, you've got to give Sauron a Death Star". Harry himself is much more skilled and powerful than the norm, but Voldemort is orders of magnitude ahead of him, especially when it comes to plotting, and to an extent so is Dumbledore, so it's by no means an easy victory.

****** Ok. That assuages my fears a bit. I might get around to reading it when i've finished my current stories.

*** HPMOR is an example of what is called 'Rationalist Fiction'. Essentially, everything must make sense, everything must obey rules, everything must occur as if it was a real person doing it. Voldemort is not evil just to be evil. Dumbledore does not act like a mad old fool just for fun.

I don't think it's really fair to label it an OP!Harry story though, because nothing Harry does is something special or unique, in principle anyone could do it, they just never think of it. The major problem is that Harry acts a bit like a spoiled brat and ends up getting away with a lot of stuff he really shouldn't have. That being said, the story is very funny and quite engaging, with lots of good characterization, and some good subtle but pervasive AU elements. I recommend it, just be aware that it is not the absolute pinnacle of fanfiction.
