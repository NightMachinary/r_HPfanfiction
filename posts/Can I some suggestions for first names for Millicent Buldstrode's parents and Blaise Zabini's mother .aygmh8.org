** For Blaise' mother most fics will go towards something Italian with the heritage and making her more exotic. For Millicent due to her appearance in most popular fics I'm imagining German names like Klaus and Greta.

That does not fit because Bulstrode is not a German name, nor even near to one. And it is also not one of those English conversion names from the First World War like Windsor (from Saxe-Coburg) and Mountbatten (from Battenburg).

** I've been using Barnaby Bulstrode and Magdalene Porpington-Bulstrode for Millicent's family; there are many fanon takes on Mrs Zabini, though I'm partial to Constance.

** I looked up the history of the name Bulstrode and found a cool story:

#+begin_quote
  "When William conquered English ground, Bulstrode had per annum three hundred pound." The Conqueror gave the estate to the Norman follower, "he and his adherents, mounted upon Bulls, resisted the invaders and retained possession. Afterwards, accompanied by his seven sons, mounted in the same fashion, he went under safe conduct to William's court, and the Conqueror was so much amused wit the strangeness of the scene, that he permitted the stalwart Saxon to hold his lands under ancient tenure, and conferred upon him and his heirs for ever the surname of Bullstrode!"

Millicent was a popular British name in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Going off of that, and because Bulstrode is a traditional British name, I'd go with classic names like Edward or Richard for the father and Elizabeth or Edith for the mother.

** I never understood why fanon is so enamoured with an Italian Mrs. Zabini (or whatever last name she currently has). Unless I've forgotten some canon detail, Blaise's surname would come from his father, not his mother. As Blaise is a French form, I would suggest either a French name (if you wish her to actually be French) or a French form popular in England (if you want her to be something like the Malfoys, i.e., presumably descended from French transplants).

If you want a name with some meaning, for the former I'd suggest Isabella (for Isabella of France, Queen of England and eventual regent for her son, one of the most famous beautiful and talented 'femme fatales,' who has been thought responsible for the death of her husband (Edward II of England).\\
If you want her to be Italian, you could name her for the notorious "femme fatale" Lucrezia Borgia.

** Adelaide for Blaise's mother.

I'm pretty sure I got this name form a fic I read, but I can't remember which one

** Blaise's mother would definitely have a name that sounded like Italian upper class. Sophia, Carlotta, Vittoria, Valentina ....are a few suggestions. Millicent is British but a bit old world. I'd picture Maud for her mother and William for her father.

** Morticia Zabini. Sure, its the same name as the Addams. But it kinda fits.

Norman and Patricia Bullstrode. Somewhat reasonable names, and Millicent isn't terribly strange if somewhat uncommon.

That's perfect for JK Rowling school of names, since she's a serial murderer.
