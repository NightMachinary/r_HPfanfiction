I found an intersting line in PoA and wondered what people thought.

#+begin_quote
  'Yes,' he said, straightening up. 'Black must have found a way to fight them. I wouldn't have believed it possible... *Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long...'*
#+end_quote

Could this mean that long term exposure to Dementors was originally meant to strip a wizard of their ability to wield magic entirely?


** I think it meant "energy". Like: "I have no power left in me to..."

And seeing that Bellatrix, Rodolphus, Rabastan and the other Death Eater were still dangerous after Azkaban, I think it's unlikely.

** I think it's meant to explain how wizards could be kept in a prison without them rediscovering wandless magic simply out of boredom. The statement sounded more like a poetical reference, as usually heard in hymnals and songs by A-Ha.

** Some forms of magic are clearly connected to the casters emotional state (see Neville gaining self-assuredness and getting better at casting spells, Tonks inability to transform when depressed, Merope losing her meager abilities after being abandoned). Now connect that to Dementors' effects on the human mind. And bang, you have a power sucked out.

** My feeling is that it is extremely difficult to do magic /around/ a Dementor. Combined with the fact that learning spells would presumably count as a happy memories and thus be taken by the Dementors after a while, meaning wizards freed from Azkaban wouldn't be as good at magic as they started out, it's easy to see how the misconception that they actually drain the magical ability from you could have arisen.

** I suspect that prolonged Dementor exposure results in a mental state not dissimilar to depression. As such, people so Demented might have problems with willpower itself....

Consider even the will-sappingness of straight-out despair. It is likely that 'normal' people respond to Dementor exposure like that. It seems rather plausible that that data is from evil people locking up innocents, though.

I suspect that the type of people that the Death Eaters imprisoned in Azkaban are... they might respond rather differently. Especially the ones who seem to actually have issues to begin with.

*** I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that Rowling based Dementors on depression, which is why one of the temporary cures was chocolate. So you're probably on the right track there.

** I think it means more of drain a person of his/her strength, make them weaker. Not magically weaker just weaker in spirit, body and mind.

** I'm in agreement with what others have already said but I will say I find the idea of Dementors slowly draining a wizard of their magic over time to be a really interesting one.

It makes me wonder how long it would take...? Would the prisoners effectively become squibs afterwards...? Or would they be more akin to muggles...? Also, would it be possible for them to "heal" and regain their magic...? If they could, would they gain it back over time or would it be a flood of power...?

Makes me wonder what would've happened with the Death Eaters in Azkaban; would Voldemort have even bothered to break them out? Would he have considered them on the level of muggles without their magic?

Edit: for clarity and grammar.

Squibs are muggles.

** To our knowledge, every Death Eater broken out of Azkaban fought again in the second war. So did Sirius Black. We don't know about any other prisoners, so I don't think an entirely bullet proof judgement can be made.
