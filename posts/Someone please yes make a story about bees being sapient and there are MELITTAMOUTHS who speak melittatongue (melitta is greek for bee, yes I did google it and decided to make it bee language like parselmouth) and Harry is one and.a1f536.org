Yes please see the title! And also please comment too if you love bees, because I love bees they are cute and like flowers and have honey and hives and also they buzz a lot! :)

And also Harry can name a bee MELISSA because it is derived from Melitta, google told me that and I thought it was very cute because if you love bees you can be named Melissa or also be a bee named Melissa! :)


** If anyone is going to speak the secret language of bees it is going to be Dumbledore hands down.

**** And his name literally means "Bumblebee" - if there's a hereditary talent for talking to bees (which is waaaay more useful than talking to snakes) that'd be the family it ran in.

****** Yep, it's an old word for "bumblebee". Rowling said she chose it because she liked the idea, when she first started envisioning the character, that he'd hum to himself all the time.

******* :o It would work perfect because it would be like Remus Lupin meaning wolf and he is a werewolf. :) Yes it would be like JK Rowling naming methods to make bumblebee name talk to bumblebees.

** Very cute idea! Hasn't happened yet that I know of, though. And wouldn't calling a bee "Melissa", since it is indeed derived from a word meaning "Bee", kind of like calling a dog "Dog"?

**** That reminds me of a crackfic where Snape is trying to convince everyone that Snuffles is clearly Sirius Black in Animagus form. He calls up that Sirius is the dog star. Remus interrupts to say you can't judge people on their names. Leading to the response "SHUT IT, WEREWOLF McWEREWOLF!".
