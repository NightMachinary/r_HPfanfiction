Young Harry, after watching the original Star Wars trilogy thanks to a rare moment of generosity of Dudleys comes to the conclusion he is force sensitive.

This frightens Harry, as the empire hunts down force sensitives. Furthermore, after hearing Petunias ravings about his "no good father", he comes to rhe conclusion that his father is Darth Vader.

All this false revalations cause him to shy away from magic and when his Hogwarts letter comes, he doesnt want to go.


** Basically the premise of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7104491/1/Force-sensitive][/Force Sensitive/]].

**** Almost exactly as you described, except for the "Luke Skywalker" bit.

I wouldn't be too put out about it. Given that there's over 500k fanfics for Harry Potter, you can bet if there's an idea, that some fanfic author has at least touched upon it. I've read more than one where Harry is convinced he's force sensitive, but that was the one that most closely resembled your prompt.

** And here I thought my idea of having Harry learn basic wandless magic(basic telekinesis stuff) by thinking it's like the Force since he's five and practicing for hours would be original.
