Anyone have a dark or evil slytherin harry fanfic were he is with a woman and has any type of bashing.


** The slytherin reformation by spectre4hire is a really good one, chances are you've already read it but still, it's worth mentioning.

Edit: Forgot that it is the sequel, first one is A Chance Encounter

  Harry and friends are set to start their third year at Hogwarts. Harry's hopeful for a drama free year, but with his godfather being an escaped convict, his plans to reform Slytherin House, and Hogsmeade weekends, he has low expectations. The sequel to 'A Chance Encounter.'
