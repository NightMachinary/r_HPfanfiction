It is said that facts are stranger than fiction. But Snape has to be the strangest spy I have ever read about and I am not talking about the first war but the second war.

After the first war ended when Snape was accused of being a death eater Dumbledore publicly said that Snape was a spy in the presence of both the Barty Crouch whom Voldemort had access to for almost an year. The fact that Snape somehow managed to get back into Voldemort's good graces and believed to be a loyal death eater instead of getting killed the instant he was in Voldemort's presence boggles my mind.

But then he was not able to get any intel for the Order other than Voldemort trying to kill Harry. The Head of the DMLE is assassinated, a bridge is collapsed, giants attack, nothing.

I want to if Voldemort was just keeping him around so he could mislead the Order or was he actually a spy and just a really bad one.

*** Yeah wizards are not good at war at all. Voldemort regime was literally running concentration camps and nothing was said over the radio about rescue efforts made people rescued nothing. It was like the entire population was sitting on their butts and going along with everything the regime asked waiting for a 17 year old to save them. It was disgusting how neither the DA nor the Order did anything the whole year.

** It's ultimately just bad writing on JKR's part. You just have to /believe/ Snape was a good spy and /believe/ that Snape wasn't quite as bad as he seemed, it was the "Harry-goggles" that made it seem so. (AKA Snape was really more like movie Snape, mean but not that mean.) Because I think this is what the book is trying to present, but it just lacks all logic and good writing to make those ideas believable for us who have brains and aren't children.

***** So in a lot of Fanon, both sides believe that Snape is working for them, but also know that the other side thinks the same thing.

Voldemort commanded Snape to go to Dumbledore and offer to become a double agent so that Voldemort would have a spy in Dumbledore's camp.

Dumbledore, knowing that Snape really does want to switch sides after Lilly's death, would tell Snape both true and false information so that Voldemort would believe that Snape's work as a spy was going well.

However, the confusing part is in the 2nd war. In that conflict, both Voldemort and Dumbledore believe that Snape is really on their side. When Snape went back to Voldemort, he was able to convince him that the reason Dumbledore claimed he was a spy for him was because of his work for Voldemort, namely being a double agent. He told Voldemort that, of course he took Dumbledore's protection after the war, so he could stay out of jail, gather intel, and maintain his cover. Voldemort was convinced because he was the one who originally told Snape to go to Dumbledore and pretend to switch sides in the first place, so it wasn't a stretch to believe that his loyal spy was returning to the fold.

Meanwhile, Dumbledore was continuing to rely on Snape to be a spy in Voldemort's camp, so he told Snape to play up this side of the story..

So basically, both sides believe that Snape is their double-agent, but (and this depends on the specific fanfic) Snape is really on either: 1) Dumbledor's side, 2) Voldemort's side, 3) his own side, or 4) playing both sides and waiting to see who wins

Hopefully that makes sense. Let me know if I did a terrible job of explaining it.

I agree that in Canon his role doesn't make a lot of sense. But, like in a lot of things, I feel like Fanon saves it. I've read some great fics where their explanation of the situation makes so much sense. I hope i conveyed it in a similar manner

And I don't think it's too far from belief that he would sacrifice some select members of his organization when he spent several years testing & training Harry just to tell him "oh btw you have to die for Voldemort to die".

^ I personally don't believe it's possible for Dumbledore to know Harry would have survived: Harry was the first to survive a killing curse so the phenomenon couldn't be studied. And I'm pretty sure the study of how to deal with a living horcrux is also extremely limited.

HOW? They never talked to anyone, because, you know, "secrecy". There's all sorts of people/places that potentially know infinitely more about the matter than Dumbledore on it. St. Mungoes (they have to research dark magic for cures and whatnot), Department of Mysteries (because only researching love, prophecies and time will not get them funding), and Bill- A freaking cursebreaker who worked mainly in EGYPT. The place where everybody was concerned with immortality, curses, and traps.

Remember, Dumbledore has that character flaw of him thinking himself always being right. I wouldn't put it past him of thinking "If I couldn't find anything about it, that must mean it doesn't exist!"

Wouldn't it be just as dangerous not to? I've seen fanfics where the goblins/DOM turn around and tell Voldemort. I've seen them when they don't. And who says they have to ask Domestic people? Dumbledore is the supreme whatever of the ICW, he could pop over to a far-away foreign country and ask these questions.

I mean, hindsight is 20/20, but Dumbledore barely tried here. Seriously, the ICW is another Chekov's gun right there. It was never used, mentioned like four times. Especially with all the terrorist acts Voldemort did, that endangers the statute of secrecy. That's a topic for the ICW. They could have assembled a taskforce and force Britain to do something.

#+begin_quote

Chamber of Secrets gives it relevance. Say... down in Egypt on a dig, a horcrux jumps ship during the job to one of Bill's coworkers, they notice right away and stun him. They take him to camp and get him the look over. "Oh, horcrux possession... SUPERAWESOMEHORCRUXSMITINGSPELL!! Okay, get back to work. Time is galleons. Peon."

Seriously, Gringotts most likely spends a lot of time training up their cursebreakers. If they can research something that can reduce employee turnover (due to deaths or crippling injuries)? That's an investment that keeps on giving returns.

** In the graveyard Voldemort says about Snape “One who I believe has left me forever... he will be killed, of course”

Almost immediately after that Dumbledore tells Snape “you know what I must ask you to do. If you are ready. . . if you are prepared. . . "

We also know that by the time Half Blood Prince occurs Snape has Voldemort's full trust. Snape knows of the plan for Draco to kill Dumbledore, something Narcissa and Belletrix are surprised to learn.

Going off of these three context clues I'd say Snape was able to convince Voldemort of his loyalty to him upon setting out to find him at the end of Goblet of Fire. Assuming Barty Crouch Jr or Wormtail told Voldemort that Snape turned “spy” for Dumbledore it seems Snape uses that to his advantage. He tells Belletrix and Narcissa “although the Dark Lord is pleased that I never deserted my post: I had sixteen years of information on Dumbledore to give him when he returned, a rather more useful welcome-back present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban is. . . " Clearly Snape turned his proximity to Dumbledore into an asset for Voldemort.

Snape goes on to further the trust of Voldemort by killing Dumbledore and by giving the correct date of Harry's departure from Privet Drive. He is then given the title of headmaster at hogwarts, and assigns two death eaters. Voldemort clearly thought Snape was all in for him. I'd say Snape was very good at what he did.

The second is more relevant, yes, he seems to be quite ineffective as a spy. Of course, we don't know about any disasters he did avoid, because they didn't happen after all, but that's the difficult life of spies. After all, we don't know really how many true terrorist attacks on the United States have been avoided for the same reason.

And to enable Harry to complete his mission. If Voldemort had captured and interrogated an order member who didn't believe Snape to be a spy and had actual proof of why, Snape wouldn't have been able to carry out those objectives.

Dumbledore was basically throwing Snape away and throwing the Order away, because nothing mattered to him but Harry's mission of killing Voldemort, to make it all stop.

i also don't see why this follows. they /know/ snape was a DE before, they know he has a nuclear talent for occlumency, and they believe he murdered albus, who many of them revere, in cold blood. there's also a meta trend with how gung-ho the narrative is with perceived traitors (lupin and sirius ready to kill wormtail, hermione scarring marietta)

As for OP: I always figured that Snape's intel only went directly to Dumbledore. After all, you want to minimize the risk of a leak revealing that he happened to give actual useful information. However, with this being said, there is very little excuse for his behaviour as a Hogwarts teacher. While you do need to engineer a dislike for Harry to avoid getting an impossible request ("All right Snape, so bring me Harry the next time I summon you, who trusts you implicitly."), that is no excuse for generally behaving like an asshole to everyone and ruining Potions for non-Slytherins.

She didn't love you back, you went and joined a terrorist group that targeted her people, and when she fought back and was targeted herself, you asked for her to be spared while turning a blind eye to the other muggleborns who were killed! Come one! I get that Snape was remorseful and didn't really care about muggleborns, but he switched sides for the wrong reasons.

***** I totally get your point, and while I have more sympathy for him than you, you bring up very much valid points. It's possible that one of the reasons I have more sympathy for him in general is that I'm more familiar with the movies than the books, where Snape isn't nearly as cruel (I have read the books, but it was in the early 2000s). I just want to point out one thing: I very much doubt Severus genuinely believed he'd ever have a second chance with her in that regard afterwards -- he'd /want/ to of course, but he sees it as unattainable to the point where he doesn't consider it an actual possibility beyond his fantasies. That doesn't mean that he wouldn't want her safe, however. I've read some people's arguments that Snape wants to swoop in and "save" her after James and Harry are killed, but I think more than anything he just wants her safe and happy in the end. This is why he went to Dumbledore, rather than bothering Voldemort about a more coherent plan to get her for himself over just "don't kill her please". a request made out of desperation more than anything. Not only did he want Lily unharmed, but he wanted her well.

And it's not like he could have asked Voldemort to spare Harry or James. It just wouldn't make any sense. Possibly James temporarily in a "I want to have personal revenge on him" but never Harry, and even then, I doubt Voldemort wouldn't want to witness his revenge on James, making the entire thing moot.

However, with all this said, you are definitely right -- Snape would likely never have turned had Lily somehow escaped harm (it's likely that she'd come to be harmed eventually anyway which would turn Snape, but still). This is also why I have no interest in reading 1978-1981 fics with him, even if I typically read SS-centric -- I believe he eventually turned for the "right" reasons, truly overcoming his power desire to become a better person, prodded by Dumbledore, and his vow to protect Harry after Lily's death, but for the entire first war I have no sympathy for him whatsoever.

****** I don't know man. I get that he probably knew he could never be with Lily, but he still doesn't want her happy with James. If Lily being with James was the only thing that made her happy, he wouldn't stop it, but he wouldn't go out of his way to make it happen. And I'm not saying that he could have asked VMort to spare Harry and James, just that he didn't really WANT Harry and James spared, even if it would make Lily happy. When he went to Dumbledore to ask for Lily's protection, this happens:

S: "You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down-kill them all-"

D: "If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? *Could you not ask for mercy for mother, in exchange for son?"*

Snape doesn't understand that Lily loves James and that he grew up and now makes her happy, because he wasn't able to do that same thing- grow up. He's in denial.

Only because of Dumbledore's illogical machinations (or call it JKR's plot railroading). I completely agree with you on the rest.

- The entire /Idiocy of the Seven Potters/ was instigated because Dumbledore wanted Snape to reinforce his position as a spy. There were much better options available including side-along apparition after getting Harry some distance away (like Mundungus did). Moody died for that stupid, illogical plan that absolutely could've turned into a disaster.
- Passing on Gryffindor's sword which could've been done anytime during Harry's sixth year. Including informing Harry about how to destroy horcruxes (and harvesting the basilisk carcass).
- Protecting the Hogwarts students? One instance of detention with Hagrid weighed against the Cruciatus bring practiced on students, students being beaten and handcuffed, eventually dozens of students in hiding to escape persecution? The only reason students weren't murdered outright was because they didn't /want/ to kill purebloods.
- And finally, informing Harry that he must commit suicide by Voldemort. This was such a lame coincidence. It was dumb luck that Harry encountered Snape in time and could view those memories. That he even bothered to listen or believe Snape.

It is just a severe case of bad writing.

****** It is. I agree, JKR was a great world builder, but her writing and reasoning skills leave much to be desired. I understand making adults seem dumb so that the kids looked smart and succeed but it could have been better. Also, I get making things seem like it's all going south and then having the memories come in at the last minute, but if you look at it sort of as if it's real, that would have NEVER happened. She needs to learn how to make things seem more plausible. But in the end, it wasn't plausible, and so in the world she created in the end, with its almost impossible plot devices, Snape was indespensible.

Now, looking back, the only useful thing he did that made sense was telling Dumbledore about the prophecy. Otherwise, all of Dumbledore's plans involving Snape could have been achieved through different, much less risky ways.

******* You mean, telling Dumbledore that he'd told Voldemort about the prophecy and that Voldemort was after the Potters, right? Because I can't say that was an entirely good thing on Snape's part since he'd set a genocidal maniac after a child.

******** Yeah, he did tell Voldemort, and that was a mistake. That wasn't what I was talking about. I was saying that the only useful thing that came of that situation was the Dumbledore also knew. It wasn't a GOOD thing, but it made Dumbledore aware of the fact that the prophecy would come true. It would have been even better if he didn't tell Voldemort, but in no world would he have been able to keep it to himself

****** For the last point my head canon is that the stone was for that as a backup plan. Like all Horcuxe are destroyed but Voldemort still won't die. That is as much the end as it can be, so he gets the stone and calls Dumbledore, who tells him and there you have it

******** yes, but Dumbledore believed in it and lets be real there were hint for Harry being a horcrux so the stone would just inform him of something that was sitting in his mind already. I imagine him calling him in Hogwarts and the stone-Dumbledore just reminds him of his connection with Voldemort and ends in front of the chamber bathroom and how he told him back then that a part of Voldemort transfered to him... Until Harry says the words himself
