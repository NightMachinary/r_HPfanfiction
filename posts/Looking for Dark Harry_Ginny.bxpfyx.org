I'm looking for a fanfiction with a Harry/Ginny pairing which features them both being dark


** This is the darkest H/G story I know, and they're not really that dark. Just Slytherin.

*** It's my least favorite of Brennus's works. It's too uninspired. The only notable thing in the story was Grindelwald raising Harry, and it had little to no impact in the story

**** It impacts the story actually as Harry always doing the reverse of anything Gellert adviced/said.

**** Speaking of a good [[/spoiler][Grindelwald mentoring Harry]] fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929), is so much better. Harry and Ginny feel surprisingly dark here as they really enjoy profiting from wars.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** linkffn(Aspirations) Probably this Author's greatest piece of work. Which really doesn't say much.

*** I've gone through the cycle a few times of seeing someone recommend this, saying "Hey, this fic looks awesome! I wonder why I've never read it?" Then actually opening it and remembering that the reason I've never read it is because the writing is straight-up terrible.

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.
