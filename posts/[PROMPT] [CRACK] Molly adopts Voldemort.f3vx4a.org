  Voldemort has been going fruitlessly back in time for several cycles to try and prevent Harry Potter from winning the war, but nothing works. At last he decides that, since Harry only really won because of his friendships with Ron and Hermione, he will seduce Molly Prewett and ensure that she doesn't give birth to Ron Weasley. Genius!

** I could see this as a great emotional and healing drama too. Tom probably grew up wrong because he didn't have a loving mother, so if this was fixed by the ultimate mum in the series, it might be beautiful. It wouldn't be easy, but that's how dramas work.
