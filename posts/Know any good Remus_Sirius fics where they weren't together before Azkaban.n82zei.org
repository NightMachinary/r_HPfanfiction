The only ones I've found are AU's where they hadn't met yet & that's not what I'm looking for


** there's this Sirius back from the veil one, but it's popular enough that I think you've probably come across already. linkao3(7424563)

also, linkao3(20059978)

It's incredibly well written, but incomplete (recently updated tho), and has Sirius escape azkaban earlier than canon, so not exactly what you're asking.

  Nobody warned Sirius how awkward coming back from the dead could be.In exchange for saving him, Hermione gave Sirius only one instruction: “We can't interfere,” she insisted. “If anyone finds out you're alive before the right time it will ruin everything.” Too bad that Sirius Black was never very good at respecting rules. Of course, if he had followed the rules, he wouldn't have discovered that Remus Lupin has apparently taken his death rather badly.

  It's probably the most foolish, reckless, dangerous thing Sirius Black has ever done in a lifetime of foolish and reckless and dangerous things... but he takes one look at Harry and knows it's the only choice he can make.(or: 'sirius escapes azkaban early & accidentally kidnaps harry' au)

  in which Remus Lupin has an unexpected reunion with a presumed-dead schoolfriend on the way to his new job, and Peter Pettigrew never gets the chance to escape.((or: harry has a very eventful train ride to school, followed by the most normal year ever))
