What if, Merlin created a group of muggles who had found out about magic, to be the Guards of King Arthur, Hence, why the Symble of Assassin's look like an A. Because the symbol was shaped like an A, because of King ARTHUR. Just a thought I had that would be pretty interesting to explore the possibilitys that could come from this.
