*** Wow... there should be a rule 34 equivalent for HP fics. If it exist, a crossover fic with HP has been done.

**** I put this proposed rule to the test.

As far as I can determine, there are not any Harry Potter and Jonny Quest crossovers (thank God).

EDIT: Ah, I see what happened. The way my searches were set up accidentally excluded The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest. Whoops.

******** "Harry Potter" +"Jonny Quest" +fanfiction -fanfiction.net -archiveofourown.org

Yours was a much better search.

EDIT: Wait, shit. That didn't exclude the Real Adventures. It just had the result way buried. I swear I'm a better Google searcher than this failure implies.
