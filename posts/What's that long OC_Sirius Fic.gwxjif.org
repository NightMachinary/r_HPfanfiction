:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a series of fics that started in the Marauders era from an OC point of view who eventually ended up with Sirius. She was muggleborn, but had some long lost wizarding relatives (I think), was younger than him by a bit (not in the same year), was a really good ballet dancer, and eventually had some crazy super character powers. The last fic in the series was some crazy multiple timeline bouncing stuff where the main OC was old. I think she also lost a leg at some point...?

I remember a fair amount of semi-smut between OC and Sirius once they were married, and she was definitely short.

Any help finding it is appreciated. The crazy timeline stuff in the last one put me off, but after reading the rest of it, I'm hoping to go back and see how it ended.
