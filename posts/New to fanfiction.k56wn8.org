I started reading those small fics on Instagram and I love them. Now I wanna read some big ones with chapters etc. On which websites do you guys read fanfics?

I love jily and hinny very much so if you know any good ones please recommend me!

Thanks!


** Websites depend on preference. The two main ones are fanfiction.net (ffn) and ao3.org.

I personally prefer ao3 because of the user interface, but there is a lot more smut posted on that site than ffn. That being said, it's easy to exclude any weird tags because their user interface is so easy to use. You can also narrow it down by relationships as well, such as James/Lily and Harry/Ginny, or by word count. Since you're new, I would arrange it by kudos or bookmarks to get the most popular ones and find the best authors that might have more.

As for your ships, they're not my favorites so I don't know many, but I do know a few.

This isn't a long fic, but it is a great series of “what-ifs” that sticks to canon relationships. Fair warning: you will cry.

“The Changeling” isn't canon in that Ginny is sorted into Slytherin, but it's super well written and she does end up with Harry. It's more of a character study/drama than a romance though.

** Yeah ao3 and fanfic are the best I find wattpad to be very lackluster in quality writers and story tellers As for pairings ao3 is probably easier but fanfic does have a new character pairing box but it is new (inthe last couple of years) so for any old ones you might miss I'd recommend going In the communities section

** My favorite fics with Harry/Ginny pairings (their relationship may not necessarily be the main focus though):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]]: Harry, Ginny, and Ron time travel to the First Year from a rather dystopian future

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]]: 4 years after the Battle of Hogwarts, a Hermione from another dimension is asking for help. The Trio and Ginny enter the breach once more.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]]: The fic is Trio centric and a rather dark war epic, but action scenes, ops planning, and politics are very well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5648259/1/Elemental-Harry][Elemental Harry]]: A cute story featuring a super Harry/Ginny pair

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]]: It's the only completed Ginny (alone) time travel. She accomplishes her primary mission objective efficiently, but faces some unexpected problems.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]]: Year 6 canon compliant fic from Ginny's POV. Very well written, that's story that got me into HP fanfics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]]: Sirius-raised Harry never attended Hogwarts, hires Ginny to accompany him on some postwar adventures.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13618513/1/half-awake-and-almost-there][half awake and almost there]]: It's set in a non magical AU (alternate universe), but it's one great Harry/Ginny romance. This Harry has an interesting background, while Ginny has a tragic one.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Another non magic AU, but this one has superpowers. This fic goes through all 7 years and mirrors canon loosely, although Year 7 is significantly different. It's Hermione centric, but Ginny is far more involved than in canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10132530/1/His-Mother-s-Love][His Mother's Love]]: Harry forces the truth out of Dumbledore during one of their private lessons in Year 6, and things turn out much better afterwards.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13096373/1/In-Case-of-Emergency][In Case of Emergency]]: Well written postwar Harry/Ginny smut fic with a plot

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]]: This is a typical indy!Harry (independent Harry) fic with lots of cliches, but nevertheless very entertaining.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]]: Best Year 7 canon compliant fic from Ginny's POV

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]]: Grindelwald breaks out to avenge Dumbledore and joins forces with Harry. Ginny (and Hermione, and Luna) are ecstatic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]: The most popular fic on this sub by a wide margin. 'Harry' and 'Ginny' are rather different here, but the story is totally hilarious.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]]: Probably the best canon compliant postwar fic, depicts Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009, from their Muggle neighbor's POV. It's fun to watch how Ginny deals with those Muggle Karens.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]]: Lucius Malfoy won after Halloween 1981. Dumbledore and his followers evacuated to France, where Harry grew up under Sirius and went to Beauxbaton with the Weasleys. But they would have their revenge 18 years later.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][Tne Voyage of Starship Hedwig]]: Pretty much the only completed, non crossover "Wizards in Space" fic. It has some great ideas, but also some great flaws.
