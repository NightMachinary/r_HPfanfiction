This sub is geared primarily towards Harry Potter fanfiction -- of course, AU fics are a lot more openly welcomed. Even so, it seems as soon as you suggest anything that defies/challenges canon on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]], it gets downvoted and sometimes treated with derision, as does alternate ideas/theories opposing canon.

Could someone please explain why [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] appear to adhere to canon and be derisive to more AU elements? A lot of concepts fit a lot better -- plugging in plot holes -- and/or different AU ideas can sound fascinating to ponder.


** I don't really go on the HP subreddit, so I can't really speak for that, but I would assume it's just the difference of a fanfic focused sub vs that of one for the official books/movies/media.

One is pretty much all about exploring things not found in canon, and given how long its been since they came out, it makes sense we dive far into AUs to try and find something different. If we wanted non AU canon things, for the most part, we can just go read canon - it's just hard to find new fanfic that explores things in canon and stays fully canon without it feeling stale after a while imo.

So [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] will stick more towards canon and non AU just because they're about the canon media.

** Er, shouldn't it be obvious? /HP is about discussing canon. /HPFF is about discussing fanfiction.

**** No? He didn't say anything whatsoever about that. This is what he's asking:

The question practically answers itself.

** Is this seriously a question? You're wondering why a sub based on an IP is more concerned with discussing established canon over a sub based on fan fiction of said IP? I mean... look, I'm honestly not trying to be an ass about this, but how the hell is that even a question? When I want to discuss something, I go to a place specifically about that to discuss it. When I want to discuss endless what if?-ism's, I go to a place about that. I'm not going to go a mathematician and expect them to humor me about how things would be if 2+2=5.

[[/r/HPfanfiction]] is /specifically here/ to discuss anyone and everyone's AU's based in the Harry Potter universe. [[/r/harrypotter]] is /specifically there/ to discuss what happens in the Harry Potter novels/movies. Just as nobody cares here if you're insulted that someone would write a fix that doesn't include your OTP, nobody there cares if you think everything would have been much better if Snape was actually Harry's mentor/father/love/all of the above.

** For the same reason [[/r/starwars]] hates legends. Its a canon subreddit. So only canon matters to the people there. They care less about the universe and nore about the main story.

** Because we know the canon stuff, we have read and seen it countless times, both the originals and in fanfic. And while the concept, the very idea of Harry Potter is genius, the early books are written for children and the last two were simply shit and rely too much on the idiot ball and ex-machina to make the plot work. Hell, the existence of the magical Bulgarian government in Goblet of Fire raises more questions than it answers because Rowling's worldbuilding implies that the borders were drawn in 1707 (a year that works very nicely for the UK, but not for mainland Europe).

But if you come up with something new, or simply manage to take the plot of another franchise and tailor it to fit Harry Potter, you get a new story that most people have never read before. Even simple ideas, like giving Harry Anakin Skywalker's arc from the prequels (with magic replacing the SciFi stuff), give you a completely different reading experience.

Tl;Dr: We like Harry Potter for the general world and some characters and use that sandbox to play in.

** because those who have only read and obsessed over the harry potter canon books are the hermione grangers. if its not explicitly stated by a reputable author, it's made up and useless, according to granger. And fanon lovers are the luna lovegoods who have read between the lines and talk about nargles because we feel like it and like the idea of their existence more than we are concerned of their actual existence. Luna lovegoods drive hermione grangers crazy. And while Luna Lovegoods can appreciate the knowledge that hermione grangers impart, life is dull if you only read the daily prophet
