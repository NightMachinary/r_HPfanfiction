Preferably fem!Harry or a female character who doesn't play a major-ish role in canon as the lead. Lavender, for example, literally everyone from Hufflepuff. OCs are allowed too if done well. The rating doesn't matter, I'm not easily disturbed.

Any hidden gems you can think of are very much appreciated.

What I don't need are the usual suspects, like /Victoria Potter/, etc.

Thank you guys in advance!üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü•∞

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up.

** Self-rec: my Luna-centric AU might interest you. Luna/Ginny background pairing. Luna grows up a Seer who never goes to Hogwarts and starts a girls' blood magic school. Pretty divergent from canon and fleshes out some parts of the world that I wish got more attention in canon. If you give it a read I hope you enjoy it!
