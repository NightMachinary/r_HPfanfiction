I read this fic a very long time ago and can't seem to find it again, I'm hoping it's not deleted. It's one of those kinds of situations that would never work in real life but was definitely a nice lighthearted read from what I can remember. Though frankly I don't remember much about it, and the things I do remember are kind of fuzzy.

The thing I'm most sure about is the summary says something like "So what happens when each member of the Dursley family is pulled into the wizarding world?" though it's probably not that exact wording. In the story itself Dudley is a wizard, Petunia ends up having magical powers too and Vernon is a squib? Or something like that. Sorry if the info is too vague, but that's pretty much all I remember.


** Is it the one where they go to Hogwarts for the third task? Vernon isn't magical or a squib in it though

*** No this one happened either before or during Harry's first year. Maybe even before that.
