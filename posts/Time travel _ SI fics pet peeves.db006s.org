I love the concept of time travel and I am always on the search for more. SI, while nowhere near as interesting, can be quite entertaining when done right.

However, about half of available time travel fics and almost all self inserts are, at least for me, unreadable.

Why you may ask? Well, either I am picky, or most authors are incredibly lazy and use at least one of the below clichês of The gente and that pisses me off everytime.

Here are the absolutely worst vices of time travel/ SI gentes:

1) " I cannot alter the timeline"-

oh yeah? No shit! So why the fuck did you travel back oe was thrust into another reality? You know, a time where you Mere existence or future Knowledge is already a game changer factor?

This is particularly popular with Hermione, who, in most of this fics, just travelled back to have sex with Severus/Sirius/Remus etc, because apparently, the only reason she had to Go back was to get laid.

2) time traveler/ SI keeps getting sad because cannot change anything.

Oh...the angst! Being forced to live among the marauders knowing they are ALL screwed! Paragraphs and paragraghs dedicated to the suffering of the time traveller.

Either give me a good reason for not being able to come up with a smart plan in regards to change the timeline whithout many negative repercutions, or cut the crap. If the point of the story is just having Hermione thrust into the Marauders era to fuck whoever she gets to fuck before Dumbledore inevitably sends her back to "avoid disrupting the timeline"then by ALL means, focus on Hermione' sex aventures. Being treated to pages of a character lamenting his/hers failure to act is boring.

3) time traveller, SI does have a plan- makes a list BUT is unable to do It for stupid reasons.

I observed this happening mostly with Sirius. Many stories are set up in a way where It would be incredibly easy to solve the problem( like being sorted into Gryffindor, having easy access to both Pettigrew and Macgonagall) but instead the main character keeps busy with things like Quidditch, xmas shopping or staring at Quirrelmort and It is even worse when Said characters keeps " oh i must find a way to Free Sirius"

For fuck sake, Just stun the rat, take It to Macgonagall and say you Saw him turning into this ugly guy and that he started smelling the boys underwear!

4) Time traveller/ SI is fucking everybody.

This could be resumed to : Harry Potter and his harém... Lord Potter Slytherin Gryffindor Peverell needs one spouse per title... Hermione becomes super hot during time travel, goes from Sirius to Remus to Sirius...or dates Severus but is the object of Sirius lust and suffers from It ALL...

Ugh...


** I can see several possibilities why this happens:

1. Authors have an unhealthy attachment to canon plots, or are incapable of developing their own plots.

2. Authors like contrived drama and want to see good guys suffer, because in their mind, suffering leads to ‘good' stories.

3. Time travel mechanics disallow changing the outcome. Time Turners are such examples.

But like you, I really fucking hate the “preserve the timeline” thing. Canon good guys only won through an atrocious amount of Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and multiple “Lucky Hero” tropes. Even then, the bad guys completely took over, carried out genocides against Muggleborns, murdered who knows how many Muggles, tortured hundreds of Hogwarts students with Cruciatus, and finally killed off another 50% of the good guys before losing to JKR's (Words of the God) many shenanigans.

Good guys had it best a Pyrrhic victory. It's just awful.

Anyone who wants a repeat of that total cluster fuck is one big fucking coldblooded negligent shit head. That's why I hate fics such as “Debt of Time” and “Cursed Child” with great passion.

*** If we are talking about a " do-over" fic, I was really impressed by " Six pomegranate seeds", where Hermione goes back in time with not only a purpose but a plan and a new identity. It is well written, well thought of and it presents an indirect approach on how to do things differently, without interfering with the main [[https://characters.My][characters.]] [[https://characters.My][My]] only criticism is that the Hermione in this fic is so emotionally dry that Marcus Flint becomes the most sympathetic character. TBH though this only annoyed me by the last third of the fic. I strongly disagree with the dramatic choice the author made when dealing with the issue of Hermione´s virginity and there is some sort of a sequel going around that it is nowhere near the original fic in terms of ideas and quality, but I do rec it nevertheless.

Now, if you are interested in the genre " Hermione goes back not to change anything but to get laid" and in good smut , then I recommend the " To relieve boredom". Why I rec this? Because it is honest in telling us the premise of the fic is not about changing anything, but to simply pair Hermione with as many Malfoys as she can. You see, I have no problem if time travel is just used as a way of getting laid- my problem is with stories that do not say so from the get-go.

*** Here are some time travels that throw away the "time line" completely:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): Hermione sent her memories and power to her two years old self. Voldemort was easily taken care of, but that was the easy part.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry was thrown back to 1975 and had to team up with Bellatrix. After a slow start, things looked up until an accident hit. This is my favorite time travel fic, and the characterization of Bellatrix is excellent.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8669569/1/][Don't Waste It]], linkffn(8669569): Wormtail time travel. He did well and remained in character.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/][Doubting Thomas]], linkffn(5492188): Luna raised Tom Riddle, who still couldn't escape the fate of becoming a dark lord. But he would at least have Luna at his side this time.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107): The only completed Ginny lone time travel. She accomplished her primary mission objective efficiently and painlessly, but had to fit in this new reality.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717): Unique Hermione time travel to Marauder Era from James Potter's POV, and she wasn't paired with anyone.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): Time traveling Harry killed them all again, but without getting kids involved. Hermione wasn't too happy though when she found out.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Time traveling Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan killed most of them even before going back to Hogwarts, and also did the Goblins in soon after. But they were unable to get Snape and Karkaroff...

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998): Powerful Harry somehow ended up in 1970 and began fucking over Death Eaters immediately. Bellatrix became very impressed.

  " I cannot alter the timeline"
#+end_quote

Thinking about it, it's actually almost impossible not to do so, considering how the Butterfly Effect works. Even seeminly minor changes can lead to massively drastic alterations to the future. For instance: let's say the time traveller/SI is able to get Neville to let go of his broom before it goes haywire on him during the Flying lession in Book 1. Seems like not a big thing, right? Except now, he never lost his Rememberall, which means that Draco never used it to taunt Harry about it, which means Harry never has to fly off to catch it, which means he never gets added to the Gryffindor Quidditch Team as a First Year, which means that he never has a near-death experience during his first match, which means he has one less reason to be suspicios of Snape, etc.

Also, that earlier lack of a confrontation between Draco and Harry means that there's no challenge of a midnight duel in the Trophy Room, which means that Harry never gets chased from said room to the room that Fluffy is being kept in, which means he never asks Hagrid about the Cerberus, which means he never learns about Flamel, which means he never learns about the Philosopher's Stone, which means the entire plot of Book 1 has just unravelled from one seemingly minor incident not happening.

Presuming, of course, that this isn't a world with a Manipulative!Dumbledore, or some other Machiavellian character in it, which means that an outside force is likely going to keep attempting to shove causality back the way it played out in canon.

** Time travellers and SIs should smash canon so thoroughly that by the time two years have gone past, it's a completely different story, other than the fixed events going on /in the background/.

I doubt canon Riddles would be as accepting, but once you buy into that its a very well written fic. The characterization of the Riddles is different, but its consistent internally. Hermione's spot on too. Hermione tries to change things (I think she's on the road to accidently causing Ron's mother to have never been born). I also think the author does a lot of great research on the time period.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
