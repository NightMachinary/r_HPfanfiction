Also, if any of you start off a reply with "I'm probably gonna get lots of downvotes for this" then I'll make it my priority to hunt you down, cos every unpopular opinions thread on Reddit has someone who says that.


** Harry is not 'poor, fragile Harry' who needs the guidance of Slytherin political genius' or stereotypical OC Americans. He's not incredibly feminine-looking. (Why slash fics claim this, I don't know.) Harry's not a saint-like martyr. Not everyone who dislikes him is evil or a stooge. Not even the boy-who-lived can push around everyone in the Ministry. He is not hiding his intelligence level or power level. He's not an overly-polite kid whose terrified of the Dursleys. He can honestly wipe his nose without Hermione, Dumbledore, or Snape to direct his hand. He doesn't need 1000 different rare abilities to be a badass. (He already is one.)

I could go on and on. Harry is my favorite character. The amount of fics out there should mean I have a ton to read. In reality, it just means I have to wade through a ton of ooc behavior, wish-fulfillment, and - granted - legitimate opinions I just completely disagree with.

It's hard to be a Harry fan. (Maybe that's the unpopular opinion.)

*** I love Harry too, but I prefer him at his weakest in general. I always found him way to grounded for someone with his upbringing, that's why the fics I love the most are the one where he deals with his abuse. It's a damn shame there aren't many good fics that take a realistic point of view on what Harry's character might have been.

**** My problem with those types of stories is that I think Harry is messed up in canon. Regarding the Dursleys, he's wary around them, alarmingly dismissive and accepting of their neglect, and has continuous issues with trust. Instead of building off his canon problems, fic writers tend to change Harry so much that he's not recognizable anymore. They strip him of all his anger, bitterness, and fatalistic humor regarding his childhood in order to start what becomes a kick-the-puppy plot. I can't get into that.

**** Unless you can quote chapter and verse, I think that's fannon. The only time Harry's pre-hogwarts life is ever mention is at the beginning of the books when it's mentioned -briefly- that Dudley's bullying and the Dursley's rumor mongering isolated Harry from everyone else. The exact specifics or what they did is never mentioned. I think that the Dursleys punishing Harry for grades -good or bad- is incredibly out of character for them, these are the people who wanted Harry to be invisible, obedient and silent. They wouldn't care what grades he got, so long as it was never their problem.

******** Did we read the same books? I know Harry was not academically driven and that he procrastinated but he did work harder then I would expect a child his age (11-13) to work. The trio worked their ass's off in the first book researching Nicholas Flamel, in the second book Harry and Ron worked even harder after Hermione was petrified to try to find the cause of the attacks. In his third book Harry learned how to cast a Corporeal Patronus through sheer force of will and by facing off against an apparition of the living embodiment of fear MULTIPLE time. The fourth book wasn't his greatest showing, his procrastination was particularly awful in the lead up to the second task but for the final task he really showed what he was made of by drilling with hermione and learning everything he could as fast as he could. In the fifth books Harry spent his year attempting to master the vanishing charm -Evanesco I think-, learning Occlumency AND teaching defence against the dark arts to a lot of students. I know Harry failed spectacularly at learning Occlumency but he didn't fail because there was something wrong with him, he failed because a small part of him wanted to have those visions. This goes on for the rest of the books.

And before you say "Hermione made him do it!", Hermione pushed him HARD but ultimately Harry on multiple occasions made the decision himself to or not to do his work.

#+end_quote

You won't find it in any book, I'll have you know that now.

He didn't need to be “bullied” to stop getting better grades or anything, just not getting acknowledgement for doing well would suffice for most children because when they try and nobody cares it often discourages them greatly. But there's another side of it, the fact that if you stop exercising your mind you won't get that much better with it as time passes.

So yes, Harry did have the potential to be smarter than he was and stuff like that. But that did not happen, because of lack of acknowledgement from the Dursleys. And there's no hidden intellect for him to hide, it's just something he didn't get.

**** Using Dudley as a measuring stick for intelligence in elementary school doesn't mean much... for all we know Dudley could have been getting C's and Harry was getting B's. Actually, Harry often says Dudley is the dumbest of his gang of friends. On Dudley's 11th birthday he struggles adding "two more" to his number of presents.

When Harry gets to Hogwarts and he's still a B-student, reflected by his OWL grades mostly E's with an O in his favourite/best subject and failing grades in classes like Astronomy, Divination and History of Magic where he either didn't care or there was a distraction during the exam itself.

Besides, if a teacher ever said Harry did better than Dudley, the Dursleys would insult the school system for not seeing their son's 'brilliance.' Punishing Harry for it and forcing him to do worse would be acknowledging that he was better. They wouldn't do that.

** I find most HarryXDaphne are just male fantasy stories where Harry's set up with someone hawt. I imagine HarryXFleur and HarryXTonks are the same cause Fleur's canonically beautiful and Tonks can make herself look however she pleases, but I honestly haven't read any of them. Daphne often seems to be little more than a pawn for her father or husband-to-be and has no control over her future. I was reading one HarryxDaphne marriage contract one and I kept rolling my eyes that Daphne's father sent nudie photos of his daughter to Harry like she's some piece of meat. I wondered at some point if the story was meant to be taken seriously or written as a parody. Daphne's often a stereotype of a girl and doesn't feel real. I just keep thinking in some fics “this author HAS to be a guy”.

Even most people who wouldn't read a Harry/Luna would probably enjoy a fic where Harry does something cool while developing a closer friendship with Luna. And when the relationship turns romantic, it's less of a turn-off because the reader is already invested in your fic and your version of both characters. You're always going to lose readers when you introduce a pairing, but if that's what you want to write then write it and let people make their own decisions.

There are so many fics out there that everyone who reads fanfic has a really high bar for vetoing fics. So if you put your niche pairing in the summary, it can turn off readers who are basically looking for a reason to veto you.

*** I think it's perfectly plausible that the average level of attractiveness would be higher in the magical world due to magical make-up and other magical life-aids. I mean, we basically know of a single fat wizard (Slughorn) and he's described as absurdly decadent. Everyone else is, at worst, a bit pudgy or stocky. That's a considerably lower obesity/overweight rate.

This seems to be somewhat borne out by Hermione, who is said to have completely transformed in attractiveness level the first time she actually put effort into her appearance.

**** That's possible - not to mention Veela and whatnot - but my issue was more with attractiveness being unnecessarily emphasised rather than whether people actually are. In battles. In Death Eater meetings. When learning a spell. It's fun, I like sexual tension as much as the next reader, but after a while its distracting.

I suppose if the average level of attractiveness is higher, attractive people won't be as unusual, so there's even less reason to keep mentioning their appearance, if that makes sense.

Because if someone were to ask me if mine were, I'd look down in confusion, and then probably reply “fuck if I know”. Well, that's if a friend of mine asked, in any case; had it been a stranger I'd probably do some harm to them because it'd be a really creepy question.

So really, to me, saying “character X has perfect breasts” is tantamount to saying “I am a loser virgin and I want to molest my delusion of what character X looks like”. Which is also creepy, by the way.

He is a bitter, loathsome man who obsessed over his childhood crush and held a grudge against a dead man for the better part of twenty years. Even when he was dying he helped send Lily's son to his own grave in order to kill a dark lord and avenge Lily.

Caring about one person to the detriment of /everyone/ else is obsession, people.

*** I feel the same exact way. I don't mind when people make him a redeemable character /if/ they're going to re-write his entire existence, which happens with Marauder-era fics.

But if you're gonna leave his entire childhood, adolescence & young-adulthood the same & then try to paint him in his mid-thirties as this man who has magically seen the error of his ways, that's bullshit.

Like he displayed such unhealthy behavior, what with obsessing over Lily & bullying a child. That's gross. He's one of the most selfish characters in the entire novel.

***** Because he didn't die for the sake of others. He died for the sake of his obsession. That's what the doe Patronus and "always" meant - he's still doing everything for Lily. Not for Harry, whom he genuinely detests, not for the wizarding world, but for Lily.

Or at least that's what he thinks. But of course if he was really doing it for Lily, he would respect her enough to, say, not treat her son like dirt. So he's not doing it for the actual Lily, he's doing it for an idea of Lily. A fantasy with which he is obsessed and which drives him.

This is what Slughorn meant in HBP when he said "Never underestimate the power of obsessive love."

word of god (though death of the author still applies, but i think it's coherent with canon):

#+begin_quote
  he died to save the wizarding world
#+end_quote

he inadvertantly murdered someone he was once best friends with, felt remorse for it and acknowledged he was wrong, and tried to atone by...saving the wizarding world and opposing muggleborn discrimination. that's what he consciously thinks he's doing- saving the world.

even then, that makes him misguided/myopic, which i think is different from being selfish, since he consciously and sincerely thinks he's doing right. he didn't have anything to gain but the satisfaction of atonement

i don't think that was meant to refer to snape; seems more likely to be merope, since the narrative treats his affection for lily positively, a la dumbledore and harry, who admire him for it

******* Word of god can establish the facts of the universe, but it doesn't get to determine how the characters are morally judged. JKR can say what Snape did, she can say what he thought his motivations were, but she can't decide whether or not he is a good person. And in fact she has never said he was a good person, just that he acted out of love. Though in JKR's morality acting out of love tends to be a sign of goodness, I think this is highly open to criticism. Indeed, Snape is the perfect example of how you can act out of love and still perform evil.

Also "he died to save the wizarding world" is highly ambiguous. It states the intended effect of his action, not his motivation. It has always seemed clear to me that Snape never disagreed with Voldemort on an ideological level, and indeed was a true supporter of blood purity until the end. His desire to see Voldemort dead and thereby save the wizarding world was rather more personal.

******** i agree? i feel like you're talking around the issue. the quote i referred to said, specifically, that he died to save the wizarding world. she also said that what he liked about lily was her 'goodness', meaning he valued the abstraction.

edit: i didn't see the second paragraph. i don't think he's still a blood purist in canon, though with a reach you can argue it's ambiguous, i suppose. i don't think it makes narrative sense, though

you can also do it by negation. jkr doesn't shy away from saying that malfoys are dursleys are unrepentant bigots in canon, interviews and pottermore, and doesn't shy away from criticising snape, but solely calls him a bully, vindictive, a jerk, etc. not a bigot, or unrepentant murderer

but yeah, i think the most coherent answer is the most obvious one. when he chews people out for using slurs, it's because he no longer supports blood discrim. when she says he wants the triumph of the cause lily believed in, that means the cause, i.e. destruction of voldemort and what he believes in. him insisting that the only people he saw die are the ones he couldn't save...means he believes in saving lives.

Snape could partially fit the trope though. Troubled kid from a bad home gets involved with bad friends and wrecks his life? But it only really applies to marauder-era stuff.

I'm enjoying a relatively new fic called the Dark Lord Never Died linkffn(11773877) that has some interesting ideas.

Ron El Greco gets recommended a fair bit but personally I could never get into it really but I plan to give it another go eventually linkffn(5906518)

I enjoyed Mirror Mirror but unfortunately it's abandoned and unfinished. linkffn(4843238)

  I'm guessing that's pretty unpopular.

That's due to the influence of the films, which places excessive influence on Harry and Hermione and diminishes Ron. Ron used to be more popular in the fandom before the advent of the third film (which showed Ron in one of his worst lights tbh).

***** I agree with you about the third film, but Ron was fine in the fifth film. He had his share of good moments like when he defends Harry from Seamus and the rest of the Gryffindoor common room, or when he tried to get Hermione out of Grawp's hands. There's even a deleted scene that takes place after Sirius dies, where Ron says he won't go and have the feast and instead will stay with Harry. I guess it's just tradition for every HP movie to have that one deleted scene that everyone would love to have stay in.

Also, for the record, there aren't many Hermione centric stories either. Not ones that don't involve trying to pair her off with someone, anyway.

*** Very similar experience. Usually avoid fanfiction centered on the main protagonist of any fandom for this reason. It's particularly annoying when filtering hpfanfics that include Ron as a main character. You'll end up with endless bashing, stories that include him only to have very little involvement, or where he serves as an antagonist to another ship.

Anyway, that's not an unpopular opinion on this sub, I think. (Speaking as someone who posts their ridiculous, over-the-top crap on AO3 /and/ ff.net.)

Most of my favorite authors post to the Archive, and some of them overlap with ff.net as well. They tend to be slashers, femslashers, or slash-friendly, though, which gets a mixed response here. Most of them also write a variety of NC-17 fics, which isn't technically allowed on ff.net. As always, mileage may vary when it comes to sex scenes.

I do have some issues with AO3, but overall I'm pretty grateful for it.

Fics on AO3 are so often tagged with every character and pairing that even gets mentioned in passing, which means it's basically impossible to filter out stuff you're not interested it. For example, if you tick "Character: Harry Potter" you'll still get loads of fics in which Harry is not the central (or even a secondary) character. That doesn't happen on FF.Net.

I'm not sure how you could believe that. Dumbledore made many, many mistakes, some of which stem from his choice to do /nothing/. Knowing that the situation he finds himself in (a living Horcrux) is unprecedented, does not excuse him going; "Oh well. I'm sure it'll be fine," because that is what he does.

As far as we are shown he assumes that because he doesn't know how to remove it safely, and seemingly so does no one else, that it cannot be done and to try to do anything would be foolish. Even just telling someone what the problem was to try and get some ideas on how to proceed would have been infinitely better than just doing nothing.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light]] is fan-friggin'-tastic. The sequel does go back to Hogwarts but I don't mind it in this case because there's some intrigue going on and the story already started on such a strong note. It treats Hogwarts like an asset, rather than just going "oh, I'm writing HP fanfiction, so let's go through 7 years of Hogwarts with /this/ difference!"

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]] needs no introduction. If you've somehow managed to not read it yet, it's Groundhog Day-style time travel that gets pretty crazy and out there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB]] is a very interesting fic by enembee about a forest full of magical creatures. It goes in depth about all sorts of magic and is an all around fun time to read.

** Northumbrian gets recommended on here a lot for people looking for the canon continuation fics, but I've never been a fan. He's a good writer, but his characters sometimes act in ways that don't really make sense.

Also I don't like fics that bend over backwards to excuse either Snape or the marauders. Sometimes it seems like a lot of marauder fics have an agenda of sorts. Either they're trying to convince you that Snape is the worst and Lily/James were meant to be, or they're trying to convince you that James is the worst and poor Snape's story is tragic. No, Snape and his death eater friends didn't torture Sirius into telling them how to get into the Whomping Willow. No, Snape didn't spend his entire time as a Death Eater brewing potions in a corner. I also don't like fics that make Lily Evans a perfect character, because she was a flawed human being. I've read fics where Petunia is just throwing constant vitriol at Lily and Lily is treating her with saint-like levels of love/forgiveness. Ditto with fics that make Lily the person who "fixed" James but give her no flaws of her own.

We don't actually know all the sexualities of the secondary characters. Even some of the het canon pairings don't prove anything.

When someone says "slash has no place" when clearly there is an audience I feel like they are saying "I don't like it, it shouldn't be allowed".

So in slash Harry is written as gay and canon says het. So what? Why is changing a character's sexuality identity so much more OOC than making Draco a werewolf or Snape a vampire, or Hermione the wicked bitch of the west? It's not. Yet those things still "have a place" apparently.

I mean sheesh, there's plenty of people in the world who feel marginalized and disenfranchised because of their sexuality already.

It doesn't really work like that. If writers who write slash suddenly weren't able to post for example, they wouldn't start writing het-harem fantasies. They just stop writing and go elsewhere. But having anyone write in a fandom encourages others to do so (even in different genres), because it creates a community. And lots of people interested in a fandom generates more writers... so you should encourage slash, because that encourages others to write in all other genres as well.

**** Why are you downvoting people in a thread about unpopular opinions? That goes against the spirit of the thread.

***** ...well, how else do we know it's unpopular? Upvoting? But upvotes signal positive feelings. But they're supposed to be unpopular! But the upvotes... they're... but... argh!

** I find most AU stories boring. I don't mind 'what would happen if....?' (For example, Ron and Hermione were sent to Malfoy Manor but Harry escaped). I find anything out of the ordinary dull (Harry and the crew attend university!). I also prefer canon couples.

** 1 mpreg should never ever have become a thing 2 I refuse to read slash 3 their is so much missed potential with grindalwalds history as a dark Lord by the hp community

4 their is a lot of potential with a harry/cho parring I can see but the community hates her yet their is so much room to develop her character

5 I could see a really cool story if hagrid never got expelled and was a trained wizard but ended up as groundskeeper because of the racist wizards and ended up raising harry 6 I don't see many death eater Harry stories where voldamort stays voldamort and does not go back to being Tom riddle I hate that in dark harry fics

7 I think a harry and tonks/parring has potential if tonks isn't an excuse for sex scenes 8 I also see the potential for a harry/Parvati parring they went to the Yule ball and theirs a chance to dive into Indian magic

*** I agree with your point about Gindalwald and I hope that the new movies will spawn some interest in that period.

I don't really think that there is that much potential for Harry/Cho and Harry/Parvati. Harry doesn't really seem to have that much chemistry with either of them. Then again, when has that ever stopped fanfic writers from writing good fics.

**** I've been writing a grindalwald fix people seem to like it but sadly I've hit writers block with the story so that story's on a temporary break
