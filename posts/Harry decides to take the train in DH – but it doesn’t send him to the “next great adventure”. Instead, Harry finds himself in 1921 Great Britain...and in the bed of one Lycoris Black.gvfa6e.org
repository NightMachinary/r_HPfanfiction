** /"Easier than falling asleep,"/ That's what Sirius had said.

/"I suppose a train ride to the afterlife isn't terribly inconvenient,"/ Harry thought with a snort. He'd half expected to simply step aboard and arrive in...wherever he was going to end up. Heaven, he hoped; He certainly didn't think he belonged in the other place."/But then, who does,"/ He mused, letting his eyes slowly close as the train rattled along.

---

"/Guess I made it."/ he thought blearily. Everything was so comforting, and it had been so long since he'd had any comfort at all. The fluffy pillow beneath his head, the warm blankets around him, even the little snores next to him made him--

Harry's eyes shot open as he surged upright in the bed. A voice next to him groaned in protest, one hand swatting drunkenly at his side of the bed.

"Haaaaaaaaaaaal," she whined. It was a she, Harry noted absently, though even as his eyes adjusted to the darkness of the room, he couldn't tell much more than that. A mass of dark hair lay at the head of the bed, and a form hidden beneath the fluffy duvet.

"A dream," he muttered, it had to be. He'd fallen asleep on the train and now--

"Oh," the woman sat up next to him with a soft grunt, "Did big scary Halcyon Malfoy have a bad dream? Do you want me to make it better?" she asked playfully.

​

It's not finished, and it's not good, but there it is.

*** Oh, I think it's great! Halcyon Malfoy is an interesting name, to be sure, and the Lycoris you've come up with is good too!

** That's oddly specific. Mhhh is he in his own body or someone else?

*** It's specific because, while I've seen various Fics focusing on some of the other Black daughters from that era (Cedrella, Callidora, Charis, etc., etc.), I've never seen anyone focus on Lycoris lol. As for whether Harry is in his own body or not...that's up to you to decide!

**** Well, If we ignore the politics and social situation like all the fix-it Time travel fictions tend to do.

It's 1921 so he can still off Marvolo and Morffin Gaunt, save Merope (and so no Tom Riddle Jr), marry Lycoris, let Dumbledore defeat Grindelwald in 45, then manoeuvres The politics of Magical Britain, in the way he wants, with the influence of the Black Family.

Voila.

***** I mean, he could just as well fuck off to the Caribbean and live out his days sipping coconut juice or something.

A Harry that chooses to die rather than go back and finish the fight against Voldemort doesn't sound like a Harry that's planning to put in all that work in a whole new timeline.

** So pregrindlewald.

What's there to even do?

Become very rich and wait decades to see if your future knowledge remains ? Sounds boring as fuck especially for Harry seeing he has almost no interest in muggle history and sleeps through wizarding history he has almost nothing to contribute here.

Maybe you could do a crossover with peaky blinders.
