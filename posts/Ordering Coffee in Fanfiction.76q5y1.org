I don't know if it's just me but every now and then whilst reading a fic of somewhat decent quality I'll encounter a scene where a character for some reason or another orders a coffee.

This scene is normally fairly random and holds no relevance to the fic but is thrown in for some strange reason.

This by itself is fine, however something often occurs in these scenes that cause me to lose my immersion in the story and disrupt the flow, and it centres around what the character orders.

Everytime it's the most stereotypical white-girl coffee order possible. For eg the character may order a"White chocolate mochachino with whipped cream and extra sugar."

It's especially worse when it doesn't fit the character at all.

Imagine a fic telling the story of a "tired and depressed" Snape who at some point orders a coffee. Somebody like Snape ordering something like a double shot latte wouldn't sound very bizarre, as it suits his personality somewhat.

However, if Snape were to instead order some strange hybrid of a milkshake, coffee and tea with some bloody whpped cream on top of it, you'd assume the fic was meant to be comedic or something

Anyway that's just a gripe I've had with a while. Maybe I should stop reading fics in that vein.


** Decent odds it's the kind of coffee the author themself would order.

*** Not in the UK in the 1990s! Thinking back, the only types of coffee I recall were instant granules or, if you were really fancy, filter coffee/cafetiere. All this latte/cappuccino/Americano business didn't really get going until the mid 2000s.

***** I distinctly recall being in Ireland in 1998 and having cappuccinos all the time. You could definitely get a latte/espresso etc, just not with a bunch of flavours and toppings, the best you could get was a dash of cinnamon. It wasn't in every place either, many places just did black coffee with the option of milk and sugar. And I don't think people had fancy coffee machines at home, a drip coffee maker at best.

But yes, the authors are presumably going with the types of coffee they are most familiar with. And I've only ever seen a few scenes where a character actually orders coffee, and it's usually part of the plot (e.g. to introduce the character to another character who works at the coffee shop).

I've always been baffled by the idea that drinking coffee is an American thing because neither of my parents like tea; my mum drinks coffee every morning and we only have a box of tea for guests. (But to be honest I'm pretty sure all our guests would take coffee anyway; I know my gran does when she's over.)

But agreed on Snape. I've always seen him as a straight black coffee drinker. If it's not as bitter as his soul, it ain't bitter enough.

*** Coffee actually came to England about thirty years before tea! It was first documented in Yemen, probably invented there, whereas tea at that point was only available in India and further east. So it was cheaper to import coffee than tea, and in the 1700s, there were more coffee shops than tea shops in England.

So it would be odd for wizards to have tea and not coffee.
