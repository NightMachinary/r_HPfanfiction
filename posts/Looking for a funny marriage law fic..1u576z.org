I went looking for marriage law fics for another user and can't find this one again.

Hermione is bound by the Marriage Law and can't escape because the fine print was written by Dolores Umbridge.

The law makes the girl be fought over by suitors. Hermione is dueled for by Flint, an Indian Guy, A Anime character, someone like Neville, Draco, and Severus. Banter is mostly between Draco & Severus, eventually Severus wins, much to his despair.

It was on ff.net. I searched for it on google but haven't been able to come up with anything.


** Not sure if you're still looking or if this has been resolved, but I think what you're looking is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3666716/1/The-Devil-is-in-the-Details][this]] story by RhiannonoftheMoon. It's called The Devil is in the Details and it fits your description perfectly.
