I love this fic. Have read all the recent popular ones. Looking for older fanfics that are similar (2008-2014)

** I liked it when I started reading it, but the journal translations fell prey to a common fallacy. “It's about this” but a dozen pieces of translation later still haven't gotten to the point so how'd you know it'll get there eventually?

It's one of those stories that I stopped reading because I lost interest while waiting for the next installment. I don't do well with WIPs.

** I liked it for a while but the story is so dragged out in places and convoluted in others it just slowly lost my interest over time. I think I made it to chapter 80-something before tapering off.
