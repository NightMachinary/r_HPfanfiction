*** This is heavy speculation: [[/spoiler][I'm fairly certain that Harry is actually the BWL, or at the least that he has the Horcrux in his head. His muggle hatred aura, the thing Luna "sees but doesn't see", the fact that he's a natural Legilimens just like Tom Riddle etc. All of those things point to the fact that Harry has the Horcrux in his head. That doesn't necessarily mean that he's also responsible for Voldemort's semi-death but considering that there's no Blood protection I don't really see how Jim could have been responsible. Harry has some kind of connection to the Wild Magic that's been alluded to and afaik Jim hasn't shown any special talents in that direction. The Parseltongue comes from Lily and Quirrell's death could just as well have been Harry's doing since they touched his face at the same time. Voldemort simply doesn't know better, he assumes that Dumbledore got it right. I doubt he could have told the difference between two identical twin toddlers.]]

**** [[/spoiler][I think you're half-right. I think Jim is the BWL, but Harry is the Horcrux. Quirrell doesn't start sizzling until Jim grabs him, but Harry has the Wild Magic weirdness going on. It would also fit in with the trope subversion theme in the story.]]

***** I suppose its possible but why wouldn't Jim have been part of the Project then? They invited Harry after it became clear that Luna saw something special in him and i don't see why they wouldn't invite Jim too if she saw the same thing in him.

**** Also speculation: [[/spoiler][Personally, I don't think Harry is the horcrux /or/ the BWL. Jim was the one to burn quirrelmort with his touch, and this business with the Wild seems to be hinting at the fact that this series will have a much bigger big bad to contend with and /that/ is what Harry is going to be dealing with. Given Dobby's exclamation that Jim potter will protect them from Dark wizards, but that Harry Potter will be the one to "save them all" and that one of the most recent chapters has Dr. Gupta talking about how Voldemort was essentially small potatoes compared to most other recent dark lords/ladies, I really believe the story is setting up voldie as something used to distract people from the real threat in the Wild until whatever-it-is is ready to move. That way, while Jim still has his part to play as BWL, but the overall story is about Harry.]]

**** Minor nitpick: [[/spoiler][Harry is a natural Legimens, but Riddle was a natural Occulmens. Not that this disproves your theory, just that I doubt his Legimency is from Voldemort.]]

My theory: [[/spoiler][Harry's connection to Wild Magic seems so far to just be random coincidences - which is exactly how Jim was sent to fight Quirrel. This suggests to me that Harry is teh prophesized Prince of Slytherin and that the prohpecy is about Wild Magic. It's not the Horcrux that makes these hings happen to Harry - it's the prophecy]]

[[/spoiler][I do thing that Luna sees the Horcrux, but that all the other things you mentioned are unconnected]]

***** I just checked and it seems he was both:

Quote from chapter 81: [[/spoiler]['"You are getting noticed, Harry Potter. Noticed by people who remember the last wizard to publicly display such facility with both Occlumency and Legilimency." "Voldemort" [...] Snape nodded[...]']]

As for the Horcrux: [[/spoiler][As far as we know magical talents are genetic, so why is Jim not a natural Legilimens as well? You /might/ be able to chalk off the Muggle hatred aura on 'Wild Magic' but Legilimency is a known and well studied magical ability and the most likely source for it is the horcrux.]]

****** [[/spoiler][I took Voldermort's proficiency at Legimency at meaning that he had turned the locket into a Horcrux. Imo learning one of Occulmency or Legimency might make you better at the other]]

[[/spoiler][About Jim, idk if being a natural Legimens is hereditary. Parlsetongue is hereditary, and so is Metamorphmagic. But no one said anything about being a born-animagus, having natural Occulmency shields, etc. Idk if we can conclude that natural Legimency is hereidatry]]

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** Most of the ones I've read that have Wrong Boy-Who-Lived is usually a mistake on someone's /(usually Dumbledore's)/ part the the twin is the Boy-Who-Lived when it's actually Harry. I think OP's asking for a story where that doesn't happen, and the twin actually is the Boy-Who-Lived destined to murderize a noseless muenster.
