** Looking for new stories with characters like Fleur Delacour or Susan Bones is really depressing because there are very few non harem fics being written anymore.

And because they lack any interesting plot let's add Daphne Greengrass, the walking trope. It makes the story even worse but baits even more innocent souls.

  A) there's nothing wrong with harem fics, or manipulative Dumbledore, even together. They're not all I want to read, but you guys complain a lot about them.
#+end_quote

Have you actually ever found a good fic with the first or both tropes in an unironic take (eg. /not/ Dimension Hopping for Beginners)? I sure as fuck haven't. Manipulative Dumbledore can go either way, generally speaking the more benevolent versions similar to canon are written fairly well. Pretty much all Evil Dumbledore fics are trash.

#+begin_quote
  B) A harem fanfic getting to 521k words is damn impressive when it happens. Short fics <5k with grand ideals that are abandoned years ago are a more normal thing.
#+end_quote

The only difference between 5k words of shit and 500k words of shit is how long it takes you to get through it.

The only good (non-crack) fic I've read with those criteria is Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, simply because each girl gets her own screentime. It does have its own host of issues though.

#+end_quote

There's nothing wrong with the idea, but the execution of said idea often leaves a lot to be desired. I've personally never read a harem fic that I've liked. My problem with harem fics is the same one that I have with most other romance-oriented fics -- the shipping eventually displaces the plot, (assuming there was any to begin with).

**** SB usually denotes Sirius Black, because Susan Bones is a minor character vs a major character.

In context, FW/GW could be Fred and Ginny Weasley, or it could be Fred/George, which is more likely because of all the yaoi.

** As someone dipping their toes into fan fiction, this is depressingly true. Admittedly, I already write smut so I feel even worse for those people trying to share their non-romantic fan fiction.

Seeing the response to anything which doesn't involve Harry/Hermione is turning me off from writing anymore fanfic. Stories with other pairings are ignored in favour of those stories.
