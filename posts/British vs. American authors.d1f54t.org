You stumble across a great story - everything you've ever wanted to read. Except: would you rather the author try and fail horribly at Britpicking, or accept their Americanisms and just not even try?

As an American author I /know/ I will never be able to Britpick authentically. So is it better to just not try and focus on writing a good story otherwise? I know enough to make sure that "chips" are "french fries" and that a "jumper" is a "sweater", but the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/d18ksr/swearing_britpicking/][recent thread]] on shit vs shite got me thinking.


** As long as the characters' lines don't sound ridiculous when imagining them spoken with a British accent, I'd say you're alright. Best to avoid the obvious "candy" vs. "sweets"-type errors in dialogue, as well, but I won't judge you by it.

The main thing, at any rate, is that while there are good reasons to try to britpick your dialogues, it's utterly pointless to do so for the narration unless you're specifically trying to mimic Rowling's writing style, which few people do. So you're an American narrator telling a story about British people; where's the issue?

*** I can't name any specifics, but in previous threads that have brought up this topic, the sentiment I've seen is that /any/ Americanism immediately makes certain readers drop a fic. I've read that idea several times in this subreddit alone and that hurts, that people wouldn't give a story a try just because the author isn't British.

**** For me, dropping a story for egregious Americanisms is a "straw that broke the camel's back" situation. It usually happens because of a string of other reasons - bad spelling and grammar, improper use of punctuation, unrealistic dialogue for eleven year olds, rampant use of derogatory names like "Voldeshorts" and "Dumblefuck", and referring to the Killing Curse as "the A.K.".

I would overlook "Mom" instead of "Mum"s and other minor Americanisms as long as everything else is okay. Minor is fine. Just don't make Harry and his pals sound like the cast of Team America.

***** Absolutely this. Americanisms do jump out at me, but I wouldn't quit an otherwise good story for them (and would always be happy to Britpick for a good author who was open to the help on that front).

However a mediocre story will become unreadable when the worry about healthcare costs and endless pancakes for breakfast and Honeydukes' candy and me getting very confused over whether they're referring to American or British pants builds up.

I'd drop a fic if the author plainly didn't give a damn, did no research and filled a story with crap like Harry eating waffles for breakfast, skateboarding to the mall where he eats candy, hangs out with Hank, Ched and Cletus and then goes to Walmart.

If someone isn't even going to try to write, I'm not going to bother reading.

***** With over 800,000 HP fanfictions out there, why should we force ourselves to read something that we aren't enjoying? Wouldn't our time be better spent looking for something we truly love? I don't single it out as the worst sin a writer can make, because I don't see it as anything different from the list of other considerations I keep in mind when deciding to continue reading a fic whose first chapter I just finished.

- Spelling, grammar, punctuation

- Plot

- Dialogue, characterization, worldbuilding

- Use of fanon tropes

- Pacing, station re-hashing

- Romance pairings

- OC's

Maybe you don't care to get selective about what fics you want your spend your time on, but some of us do.

...Or hey, maybe I'm just a mean old crotchety Picky Patty because I don't like fics where Harry's emerald orbs are mentioned every time he looks at something.

******* As it's been said before, it's usually a combination of things that make people drop fics. Bad grammar and spelling is a really good way to give the reader a headache. And when the plot /seems/ mediocre you generally don't want to torture yourself hoping that it becomes better (there are extremely rare cases where the plot is worth the grammar issues but those are also extremely subjective).

******* People are going to like what they like. You can't make people start liking what you like, that's just the way things are. It's similar to the "No Slash" issue, which people are going to be stubborn about no matter what. I think it's silly, especially when the double standards kick in ("M/M slash is gross, F/F is fine!"), but I'm not going to try and change people's minds if that's what they're set on.

In my case, I'm picky about Americanisms because the Harry Potter universe was my form of escapism as a child and young teenager. I loved the British setting, the magical whimsy, and the aesthetic that JKR built - because that was a whole different world away from my own life. In the present day, that's what pulls me in and immerses me into a fanfic story. When fanfiction doesn't give me that, I don't enjoy it as much.

Everyone likes different things for different reasons.

** The one thing that bugs me the most is that a lot of authors (regardless of nationality) seem to overlook teenagers and how vulgar they are. Like, no way is a 15 year old Harry going to call Draco a dork, a dummy or just an idiot. Teens in general (not sure if British teens are worse) are gonna call him a nonce, a twathead or some other combination. And it varies. A lot. When I was younger, a lot of the time we just got a swear word and put another word next to it. And banter, like GOOD banter is hard to find. I used to call my friends cunts all the time. That's whats so great about British humour. It is so damning and insulting. If u can't take a joke then what the fuck are you doing in the UK.

If it fits the situation, yes. Malfoy will not care about social niceties, as is shown in canon. So if I were ever to write a gay character, he'd be using it 24/7 against that character. BUT, I always found the English fixation on single words weird because they do not seem very impactful to me. I mean, you can use them, but IMO "bastard who sucks the unwashed dick of a disease-ridden hobo" is way more impactful than the singular slur, which makes the slur the weaker choice and therefore not very useful while insulting someone. But maybe that's just my Polish side shining through since the Polish language allows you to create well-flowing, nearly endless chains of insults by combining them.

******** You can call them "fee-fees" and call me a soymilk connoisseur, but I still believe that people are entitled to be treated with a minimum of compassion and dignity.

And that goes for the books - slurs aren't used just to hurt the characters' fee-fees. They're not just there to make the bullying feel realistic, or to make the dialogue punch a bit harder, but are shown to have real, tangible consequences.

Notice how JK Rowling uses the slur "mudblood" in the books. It's not used gratuitously, but when it /is/ used, it's used to demonstrate the character of the kind of person who uses it (Draco Malfoy, Walburga Black, Marvolo Gaunt), and how the characters react to it, and the impact it has on them emotionally. The first time it's used in the books, the Gryffindor quidditch team got into a brawl over it. When Kreacher uses it, Sirius and the Order yell at him about it, and it results in him dropping the information about the OotP's DoM operations to Narcissa Malfoy.

Pancakes and syrup aren't an everyday British breakfast food compared to stuff like Weetabix or egg and toast. Even the books showed that the nicest Weasley breakfasts were the standard fry-up.

Oh, and in fic, everyone drinks coffee at breakfast. Fanon Snape is a coffee addict.

**** Wait, do brits not drink coffee? Or are you just saying that everyone drinking coffee would be the problem? (It's been awhile since I've been to London, so I honestly can't remember). I realize that tea is the standard, but my understanding was that people do drink coffee in England. I guess I always just assumed that there were people there that preferred coffee in nearly any country even if that wasn't the norm.

For example, I am American and I don't drink coffee, but I drink tea regularly and have an electric kettle in my house and my office (and in my camping supplies). And while, I'm not the norm by any means, I've met enough other Americans that do that that it's not completely crazy or out there - about half my office at work prefers tea. So, I guess I thought coffee drinkers in the UK would be more like tea drinkers in the US - more like a smaller subset of people, but that there would still be people that held that preference.

Have you seen the yearly fees for Eton? Because a year at Eton is on par with a year at Harvard in terms of cost. A year at Eton costs more than both my degrees together.

In fact, most of the UK's famous real boarding schools cost a fucking bomb.

I know JKR said that the Ministry covers all school fees but fics often ignore that because it's fairly logical that boarding school = fees. In fact, although there are state boarding schools in the UK, where the government will cover the fees you are still required to pay for the costs of boarding your kid.

It's not an ethical choice by any means, but the cost of seven kids school fees if Hogwarts were as expensive as Eton would be crippling.

It would make sense for JKR, especially starting out as a poor single mother, to make a Hogwarts education accessible and socialized. A large aspect of the way Slytherin is presented in the books is using its culture to mock and satirize the old, rich boys club institutions. Notice how often those rich Slytherins are presented as ugly, cruel, and selfish compared to our good heroic Gryffindors.

Aren't Miss and Ms. the same thing - with Ms. just the abbreviation (like Mr. and Mister being the same, just abbreviated). Do people really see them that differently?

***** Ah, I forget - people pronounce Ms(.) as 'miz', which I could see being more blatant there. I've always pronounced them the same way, which makes the whole distinction kinda not even there for me. (I'm not sure why, but to me 'miz' is less formal and written out, and I use Ms./Miss interchangeably for either unmarried women or women I don't know the marital status of. Might be the impact of having grown up in France before the US, where Mlle./Mademoiselle are the exact same)

******** And we would avoid so many embarrassing misunderstandings. Whole my childhood I have battled with the finale of the Wagner's opera “Lohengrin”, where the main character, a knight Lohengrin, leaves to battle on his enchanted gigantic swan. Whole finale is completely confusing in the Czech context, where not only a swan is female, but it is generally considered the most feminine and romantic of all birds. As it stands, it makes this finale slightly smelling with homosexuality or gender ambiguity. Of course, Wagner didn't mean anything like it, and it is the most masculine and chivalric of all finales, because a swan is masculine in German (and in French too, if I am not mistaken, which is even more confusing to me; the most romantic language and it makes a swan male ... it doesn't make sense to Czechs).

Culturally the swan is kind of seen as one of the more majestic/beautiful birds I suppose, but I don't think I don't know if I would necessarily use its inclusion as particularly male or female in a french text. There's certainly symbolism surrounding it, but... it's not anywhere near as large (IMO) as it seems to be to Czechs.

No I don't know what British people prefer calling this stuff. We call our yards a yard. A garden might be a subsection in the yard where you have bunch of plants/flowers or some people grow some their own stuff like my family grows tomatoes in some of our garden. I'm not sure why y'all would call a yard a garden and I didn't know that was a British term till just now. From where I'm in America people call it couch buy sometimes we may say sofa it doesn't really matter. Idk we say “going to the store” or “we are going to go shopping” I don't know it's just interchangeable. My point being is I don't write FanFiction but if I started too how would I possibly know to check for slang I didn't know existed? Obviously saying 21 for the drinking age is bad, but I feel like saying Walmart could be forgiveable. I did some quick google search and your second largest grocery store chain ASDA is owned by Walmart so technically you could say it's a Walmart :p

You have classic blunders like "Mom" (even American authors who know that "Mum" is the correct word sometimes slip up) and the ever-present pancakes with maple syrup for breakfast... or talking about "cookies" when they mean "biscuits" or "pants" when they mean "trousers" or "candy" when they mean "sweets"... but also things like baseball analogies as euphemisms for sex.

To me it's the same when they say they don't want their fic to be a work of art. I do think they should care about the quality of their work, particularly when I've seen authors removing all the gottens from their fics or asking where an elderly couple is likely to have a flat in UK.

I read /The Paper Magician/ trilogy last year, and while I thought the story was alright (though the MC was a bit of a Mary-Sue, and it was all a bit cutesy), the author had really munged early 1900s language and culture up. There's a point in the first one where the main character is making biscuits and gravy for breakfast. In England. In 1903. There's another point where the owner of the house she's staying at gives her some "bills" to do the weekly grocery shopping - when in the UK we call them "notes", and in 1903 there were no notes smaller than £5, and £5 would have kept you richly fed for about three months. There was something about school in there too - 1903 people left school between 10 and 13 (depending on preference), but in the book, the MC left at about 17. It's because I have a high tolerance regarding suspension of disbelief that I carried on.
