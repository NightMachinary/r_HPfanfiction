I'm tired of reading about Hogwarts and Wizarding Britain, and I'm having trouble finding things set anywhere else. I've read and enjoyed:

- The Alexandra Quick series
- Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum
- The Little Veela That Could
- A Wizard's Fairytale
- Harry Potter and the Irish Choice

I tried the Malkin Academy series, but the constant flashbacks threw me and I couldn't get into it.

Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, America, Ireland, Japan, Australia - just anything but England and Scotland. (I'd be fine with Wales, actually, even though it is part of the UK - it never comes up.) I'm perfectly happy to read things that bash the hell out of Hogwarts and/or Dumbledore. I don't care who the main character is or what (if any) the ships are, or if it's a full cast of OCs. Any recs?


** linkffn(2697521) is a really long one.

** linkffn(The Black Heir by FirePhoenix8) has Harry going to Durmstrang. The sequel has pretty much been abandoned, and it's been years since I read it so it might not actually be well written.

linkao3(A Beast's Virtue) is an AU where Voldemort succeeds in taking over Britain, but it follows Harry mainly at Durmstrang.

linkffn(thé à la grenouille) has Harry at Beauxbatons. I haven't been keeping up with it, so I can't attest to quality, but it's in-progress and has been recently updated.

linkao3(Dames and Dragons) is post-war and canon compliant but it's mostly set in Romania, following Pansy Parkinson as she does research at the dragon reserve there. Featurrs the very odd ship of Pansy/Charlie, but it's very well-written and the romance is slow burn enough that it's not super OOC.

linkffn(The Horror! The Horror!) is a crack fic about Harry running a potions supply company in Africa, although it does partly follow the Order, Ministry, and Death Eaters in Britain, so it may not be what you're looking for.

Hope this somewhat matches what you were looking for.

  Humorous, post GOF tale. Harry goes to Africa and sets up a potions ingredient business. Wackiness ensues.

  Post-war. Romania. Charlie is distracting himself with his favourite fire-breathing monsters, and an unlikely visitor descends to wreck havoc, academia and Slytherin angst all over the place.
