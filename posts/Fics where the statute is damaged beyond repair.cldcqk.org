Are there any stories where they give up on the statute? Suddenly muggles are free to tell each other if they see dragons/giants/magical bar fights, and the fallout from that.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): Extreme AU as Muggle world didn't develop nuclear weapons, and James and Lily survived the Halloween encounter with Voldemort. When the SoS was blown early in the story, it changed the world forever.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** Beyond The Curtain

New fic that updates regularly that has some really cool ideas. Nothing to do with the veil in the DoM.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6765496/chapters/15463549][Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach]]

Harry's flight at the beginning of the fifth movie gets recorded in a Superbowl commercial. However I found it a bit dry.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

** It's not exactly how you describe the effects of the Statute being broken, but Beyond the Curtain is still pretty good.

  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts. Eighteen years ago, Harry Potter disappeared, presumed dead. But when the remaining resistance breaches the Magical Curtain guarding Voldemort's empire, he suddenly resurfaces and offers to guide them through the new Europe where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free. But why the hell hasn't he aged a single day?
