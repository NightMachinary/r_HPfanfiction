:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a particular Harry Potter fic (I suppose that is obvious) there are a few thing I can remember about it. One is Harry isn't dark but morally grey and Dumbledore challenges him near the end Another is Luna was entirely devoted to Harry after finding her naked in a broom closet. Draco becomes loyal after Harry shows off his power to him.

Thanks in advance for any help

***** I believe Slitherin. The few pairings I can remember are Harry/Hermione/Luna, Pansy and Narcissa. If I'm remembering correctly lily and James are brought back from the dead. Lily joins in as well
