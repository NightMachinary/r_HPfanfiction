Please drop your Regulus Black fancasts that AREN'T Timothee Chalamet. I don't have anything against that fancast, but it's just not what I have in mind for this particular RAB I'm writing at the moment. Plus, I've noticed that the fandom tends to use the same fancasts over and over a lot, so I always enjoy seeing new ones :)

If you have other characters that you use non-typical fancasts for, please feel free to drop those as well!!


** oooo! I don't this is a popular fancast, but I think Louis Partidge (he plays Tewksbury in Enola Holmes) would be great Regulus.

*** Link didn't work for me, so I had to Google him.

You're right, though - he does look the part.

*** He looks very much the way I imagined Sirius. So I guess there's just a very strong family resemblance!

**** Oh, interesting! I imagine Sirius with more defined features (stronger jaw, sharper cheekbones, a lot more hair) - I've never found the perfect face claim for him but Ezra Miller is my go-to at the moment.

Honestly though it was really difficult to find 'my' Regulus who was sort of, handsome but in less obvious way than his brother? Someone who looked like he was slightly unsure of himself but trying to hide it. Someone with sad eyes!

** i always imagined regulus to have an androgynous look so the closest pick for regulus in my mind is jaco van den hoven! i also like conan grey if he had lighter eyes

** [[https://pin.it/70O8WNZ][This]] is my regulus black. It's the only photo of this dude I've ever found on the internets but he's just who I see when I write Regulus. Except with grey eyes though.

I definitely can't see Timothee or Ezra as him though. That's a given, and I'm so glad you agree!

** I've always imagined my Regulus to look a lot like Gerard Way, but aged down a bit, for obvious reasons. I particularly associate [[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9f/12/ac/9f12ac5cd352d5009d3341548fc170fa.png][this pic]] with Regulus.
