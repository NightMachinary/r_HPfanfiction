With bricks and gravel,sticks and stone,

esse of the nerve, true-blue,

wit and the wily,

erect it stood ; the castell of eunoia,

Hogwarts - a welcoming home.

A cosmos entangled within,

illuminating lives even in the dimming of light

and the darkest of times.

A dive in the abyss of black lake.

With a howl under the cold moon,

like a thrum from sunset to sunrise.

Paw of the grim leaving traces behind,

antlers entwining in the leaves of the forbidden,

With a squeaking rat who will stand up to it's name.

But there stood hogwarts,

welcoming them home.

As the shadows swell,

lightening striking the ether,

with a green towards a boy.

Screams of those who died and

the one who lived,

Unheard were the echoes of always.

Rise of the vanquisher, like the phoenix

from the flames.

He who lived, the king and

the brightest witch of her age.

With the someone who had no choice,

hogwarts was their home.

Killing of the spare as the darkness rises.

A moment to live, a moment to die; and

the moment to fight,

as for neither can live while the other survives.

Splitting of souls, destroying of their parts,

to take his final breath, and counting the beats

of the fading heart.

Red and green ; to mark the end of

the one who feared death.

And from the rubble and the ashes,

Hogwarts stood raised.

Welcoming again like a home it's always been.


** Very good :)

I wrote a poem about Grimmauld Place once, when I was going through a (mercifully short) poetry phase. I wrote one about Merope Gaunt too. I'd forgotten that.

*** No. I did post a few up once for part of a challenge but when that was over no one ever read them and after a while I deleted them. No one noticed.
