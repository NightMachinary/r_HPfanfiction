It randomly stopped working on my chromebook. I disabled all addons, still not working. Up to date in everything, have no issue in any other sub I read.

I see no counts for points/replies/etc.

Logged into my computer, still no numbers. Very strange.

*** Already done. Last night I only noticed it was borked because it accidentally got unchecked.

** Well for ONLY this communities CSS, disabling ublock fixed the issue so with the style I see numbers. ONLY for this community has some block in the CSS that ublock says "uh uh, nope" on...wtf?

*** I should note I had to do a cache/etc. total reset one by one after a "disable" all of my addons to figure this out. Sorry that wasn't my first inclination. Should have realized cache would have fucked shit up.
