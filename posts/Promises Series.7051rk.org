Does anyone know of any other novel-length fics where Lily and James and Sirius are still alive and the war continues?

** Could you give me a summary, the premise sounds interesting. Is the fix well written?

*** There's better and there is worse. I rather like how it focuses on [[/spoiler][James, Sirius, Peter and Remus over Harry, Ron and Hermione]].

*** Yeah! So it's based on the idea that Sirius and Pettigrew never switched and Sirius remained the secret keeper and was captured by Voldemort. James, Lily, Remus, Peter and Dumbledore all continue the fight against Voldemort. That's as much as I can say without spoiling.

Review-wise I think the fic is well written for what it is. It can be heavy handed at times (but hey so was JKR) but it reads very well and quickly became a favorite of mine. I think that's mostly subjective but I'd recommend it for sure!
