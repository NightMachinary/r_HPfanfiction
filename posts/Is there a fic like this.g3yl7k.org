I'm looking for a fic where Neville is the boy who lived and Hermione is his love interest. I read a short one-shot that kind of had this idea, and I really want a long version lol.


** I don't know anything like you want

But i am interested in reading that one shot if you happen to have the link

*** God, it was so long ago I don't even remember what it was called. If I come across it again, I'll post it here. Sorry.
