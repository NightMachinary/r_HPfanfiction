The in-progress fics I am currently following:

All three of these are great, which is why I am following them!

I didn't give away any plot points, but if you are super sensitive to the possibility of spoilers, then just read the summaries and not into "My favorite part."

1. The Phoenix Burns Brightest by AnyaYanko: Linkao3(The Phoenix Burns Brightest). *My summary:* When Harry is 4, Dumbledore realizes he is the only one who can raise Harry in a safe and loving environment. So he plucks him away from the Dursleys. Warm, fuzzy parenting moments ensue. *My favorite part:* the characterization of Harry. He is clearly still himself (impulsive, courageous, mischievous, etc) but he is also a very different Harry than canon because he grew up idolizing Dumbledore. Hearing an eleven year old Harry speak with Dumbledoreish self-deprecating humor is just fantastic. *I am excited to see:* where his interactions with Snape lead.
2. The Bureaucratic Error Linkffn(The Bureaucratic Error) by Iniga. *My summary:* When Remus Lupin dies at the Battle of Hogwarts, a bureaucratic error with Death sends Remus' soul (knowledge and memories) back in time 5 years (the summer before the PoA schoolyear). Not your typical time travel fic because Remus doesn't know all of the secrets that Harry knows, such as the locations of the Horcruxes. Also, it's much better written than 99% of fics! *My favorite part:* the characterization of Sirius and Tonks. I am mostly a Wolfstar person but this fic is actually making me care about Lupin/Tonks a way that canon never could. *I am excited to see:* how Sirius's rehabilitation and fatherly relationship with Harry develop.
3. Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis Linkffn( Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis) by Starfox5. *My summary:* Sequel to Petunia Evans: Tomb Raider. Harry, Ron, and Hermione follow in Petunia's path and become tomb raiders also. Their target? The lost city of Atlantis. The only problem is that other nefarious entities want to reach Atlantis first and are willing to kill in pursuit of that goal. *My favorite part:* the action scenes are very fun! I also like Hermione's investigations of certain artifacts. *I am excited to see:* well, with a title like that I think it's a foregone conclusion that eventually they will reach Atlantis. What does Atlantis look like? What will finding it mean for modern wizardkind?

Anyone else following these fics and want to chat? Any other currently-updating fics worth following?

(I have clearly been sending too many work emails because I originally ended this post with "Best wishes, [my real name]")


** Oh, thanks for the rec! I don't think I'll read the ones on ff because... I so much prefer AO3, but I'm definitely gonna check out that first one! It looks interesting!

About currently-updating fics, I am a fan of Face Death in the Hope. I've never used this bot before so I hope it'll work: linkao3(Face Death in the Hope)

When Harry dies, instead of just coming back to life, he travels back in time to before he was born (and saves Regulus). It's very interesting and it's a bit painful to have Harry interact with his parents who are not yet his parents.

I don't understand this, there are tons of very good fics on ffnet you cannot find on AO3. Why limit yourself in what fics you can read? Or is this just regarding WIPs?

**** AO3 is a much more advanced and modern site than FFN. It's got plentiful viewing options that are absent on FFN and has a much better searching/sorting functionality.

If I find a story I really like on FFN, I'll do a quick search to see if that story also exists on AO3 and read it there.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

**** Well, it's less about finding more stories I enjoy and more about enjoying the reading experience on AO3? Like... I like being able to view the full work instead of chapter by chapter? Also, I love the organisation system of it. I find ffn harder to navigate?

If you like Face Death in the Hope, you should check out the author's other HP stories! Their fics got me into reading HP fic. Like... I've read the occasional HP in the past, but I saw someone recommend a fic by them and I decided to read it and then I was like... Wow, I need more of this.

And AO3 has ebook downloading built in. So you really never need to actually be online or deal with any website issues once you download the work.

** My favorite WIP, by a mile, is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14164617][An Hour of Wolves]] linkao3(14164617). This fic is pretty tailored to my interests - I love angst and I love fics where the trio friendship plays a central role - but it really stands out because of how in-character everyone is, and the strength of the writing. (Do note all the potential trigger warnings though - stuff gets pretty dark.)

Also, since you like The Phoenix Burns Brightest, you might also enjoy [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13553343][Albus Dumbledore and the Boy Who Lived]] linkao3(13553343). It is a rare, rare thing to find a fic that 1) focuses on Dumbledore and Harry and 2) keeps Dumbledore in-character, and I fervently hope it'll update soon.

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

It starts in Harry's 3rd year, when Uh is drafted as a coconspirator to the Weasley twins in pranking. They end up dealing with Sirius Black.

It becomes a crossover when you find out Uh is Alex O'Connell, the grandchild of Rick O'Connell and Evy Carnahan of the Mummy movies.

** I did read the second one because I've never seen a time traveler Remus before. I skipped some of the chapters, though, I'm not sure why. The problem is that I never liked Tonks so I'm not sure I'll make myself finish it. But I really rather enjoyed Sirius's characterization when I usually can't stand him in fanfic. I'm not even sure what it is that makes me like him in that story.

** Obligatory linkffn(Basilisk-born) because despite its grammar problems the characters are really quite incredible (and they all act more or less like real people!) and some side-characters get to be more than cardboard cutouts. Slow updates, but still active nonetheless.

Secondary fic I'm following is linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance) which is mostly just entertaining, although it has some cool ideas.

I actually have a lot of fics I follow, but they all update like once every month or so, so I don't have overly much to do. Naturally. :(

**** Its sort of like reading Shakespeare I feel. English is not Ebenbild's first language (or his best, for that matter) and it shows in how he arranges a lot of his verbs and nouns around each other. The sentences are in English but the organization of the sentence looks very similar to something like Spanish (not that I can tell overly well, I just took high school Spanish). Similarly, a lot of the typos and errors in the writing disappear the farther into it he gets, and the newest parts of it are really quite well written. His writing style is unique (as is his dialogue, a lot of that comes off kind of strange) but you get used to it as you read, and soon you can make sense of it pretty well.

​

Basilisk-born has some of the best world building I've seen, and is also one of the most original time-travel fics I've heard of. Similarly, the time travel is canon time travel where it's a loop, and if you know the result of an event it cannot change but all the circumstances thereof /can/. It's worth the read, but the opening four or five chapters are hard to get through due to the grammar problems.

***** I see. The paragraph and sentence structure definitely felt off to me when I first read it, and in addition to not really understanding what was going on was key to me dropping it.

I'll ready a couple more chapters and give it a go. Thanks for the detailed reply.

** Apart from the fics you mentioned, I'm following these fics with anticipation:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(12088294): the sequel to "The Accidental Animagus". It's being actively updated again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725354/1/Gods-Among-Us][Gods Among Us]], linkffn(7725354): rare crossover with both Battlestar Galactica and SG: Atlantis. What I especially like about this fic is that Harry and Hermione are changing canon plots in ALL 3 universes with their actions.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][I Am Lord Voldemort]], linkffn(12980210): A genre savvy SI replaced Tom Riddle after he had killed James. He was still a totally evil SOB, but at least this guy was smart had some humors. One of the very few fics in which I can cheer for the bad guys.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13161929/1/Invincible][Invincible]], linkffn(13161929): Darth Marrs's attempt at a 'Wizards in Space' fic, and this fic has been fairly typical of his style so far, which is mixed with brilliance and ridiculousness.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136): Ginny and Sirius were building their empire in the Land of Fire and Ice. This fic does not nerf HP magic and shows its power in full glory. But it seems Rhaegar Targaryen could make meaningful contributions too.
