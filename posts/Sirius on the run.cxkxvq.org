I was chatting with a colleague about hp fanfics (she's never delved into them) and she asked me if I've ever read anything about Sirius' time on the run, so I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for this? I've only ever read ones where Sirius breaks out early and takes Harry abroad.

Ideally it would be something close to canon for her, but I'm open to anything along these lines.

Completed fics only please!


** I can give you one that starts with Sirius on the run, but he does come back.... It might spoil her for other fics though. I have a friend that said I nearly did that to her.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** Linkffn(*Interwoven: The Seamstress and the Lovable Stray* by Katinka31)

It was written before OOTP and it shows, but it is still one of the best Sirius during 4th year fics around. It is a romance story between Sirius and an OFC and it is really good.
