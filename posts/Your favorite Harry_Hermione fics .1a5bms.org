*** Ok I'll give it my best shot. Sorted by website. The most high quality ones are at Portkey.org for example: [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/8081][Less Than Tomorrow]]- Post Hogwarts, Hermione becomes an Auror and works undercover with Harry and Malfoy. I didn't like the summary either, but I've reread this one the most. Drama/love triangles(rectangles)

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6446][Shadow Walks]]- HP meets the multiverse theory, incredible well thought out read

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/5185][Forever Knight]]- Novel length, gritty HP/vampire crossover (written pre-Twilight!) Intense, dark, and addictive

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7460][Love Lost, Love Found]]- An H/Hr romance that takes place after the epilogue, great read

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6089][What I Always Wanted]]- Post Hogwarts. One of the most balanced mixes of plot and romance. The romance happens secondary to the mystery and story.

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/1667][Harry's Seventh Year]]- Self explanatory title, but obviously H/Hr

Fanfiction.net has some classics that aren't on portkey such as

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2204553/1/Everybody-Loves-Hermione][Everybody Loves Hermione]] and its sequel [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2240986/1/Everybody-Still-Loves-Hermione][Everybody Still Loves Hermione]] are both equally addicting and laugh out loud reads. I usually read them each in one sitting. Hogwarts and love potion. Hermione is central, but story involves Harry, Ron, Ginny and Malfoy equally.

HarryPotterFanfiction.com These next two are strictly humor. Pretty OOC fluff, but they are just plain fun if you're not in a serious mood! Both by the same author, a lot of quick dialogue. Hermione's perspective.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=14994][The List]] - Harry and Hermione are convinced they're just friends and decide to make a list of everybody who thinks they are a couple as a joke. Ginny is my favorite in this one.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=164381][I'm Not Neurotic! The Diary of Hermione Granger]] - More brilliance, definitely read this if you want a laugh. The summary on the website is the only thing that can come close to doing this one jsutice: "Now a Seventh Year and Head Girl, Hermione relays her life in the diary given to her by Harry: from Harry sneaking into her bathroom (and just acting odd), Head Girl duties, NEWTs, and hormones, to Ginny setting Hermione up in hopes of making her less neurotic, Hermione's life is slowly slipping out of her control."

Last but DEFINITELY not least, the Legacies series by The Dark Lord Nedved. By far the *best* action/adventure writing. Incredibly detailed fight and battle scenes. Very dark, Harry has special powers, Starts right after OoTP and just goes. Action/Adventure/Drama. All novel length. H/Hr (obviously) Here they are in order:

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=101545][Legacies: The Solidus Charm]]

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=109223][Legacies: The Halo of Life]]

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=111620][Legacies: The Sword of Gryffindor]]

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=104896][Legacies: The Grim]]

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=185772][Legaceis: Brothers in Blood]] WARNING: Brothers in Blood is unfinished. Only four chapters long. There's not really any closure, but this series is still, by far, worth your time. Make up your own damn closure.

**** Thanks for Shadow Walks! It is incredible story, rare example of using this entire Multiverse thing beyond "I want AU that technically is not an AU".

It sits in Angst/Romance but I would classify it as Adventure/Romance - there is angst (at start), there is properly used fluff and incredibly satisfying ending.

Also, certain small ideas that alone make this worthy reading (like this tidbit about certain robber).

One of the best fics that I have read. Thanks again!

*** In "Harry Crow" main character is so powerful that it should qualify as crackfic (usually he is more competent/powerful/intelligent than professors - see first transfiguration lesson for extreme example), 11 years old better in martial arts than anybody in Hogwarts etc.

#+begin_quote
  Minerva had been a transfiguration prodigy and now held a mastery in the subject, an eleven year old goblin-trained wizard had just totally destroyed everything she held to be true. She was a powerful witch but couldn't even contemplate repeating the feat this boy just achieved when she was the same age. It wasn't just that though, Harry Crow just threw the transfiguration rulebook out the window. Where the hell did they go from here?

**** True, but that's the Goblin training which he is demonstrating, not solely Harry himself, which is so 'overpowered' as to be upsetting. If there was real dialog between Wizarding and Goblin practitioners of Transfiguration -- which would presuppose that Goblinkind were handled as equals, something impossible until Binns was binned -- then McGonagall would have been exposed to their methods long before this.

As it is, the Goblin method relies first and foremost on forceful and crystal-clear visualization, something which, from the look of the overall Hogwarts curriculum, comes hard to most young Wizarding students, hence all the memorized wand-movements and Latin incantations, and even Ollivander wands with active elements inside. I can see the lessons of traditional academic Wizarding Transfiguration as taught by McGonagall as having value in leading beginning students, through formal practice, up to where they can engage with their magic directly and begin using Goblin methods. Training wheels, in other words.

From the description of the battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort in the Atrium of MoM in HP&OotP, that's where they're heading anyway, as that's the kind of mastery demonstrated. Including Goblin methods can help them get there sooner.

** Resistance by Lorien829

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]]

'Voldemort has launched an all out war on the Wizarding World, and has taken the Boy Who Lived. But he has not reckoned on the resourcefulness of Hermione Granger. HHr developing in a sort of postapocalyptic environment.'

This is one of the darkest, most epic yet grounded stories I've read. The author favors H/HR, so check out the other stories as well.

Of course, once you're reading a good story by an author that writes H/HR, it's a simple matter to explore what they mark as their favorite stories and authors to find more.
