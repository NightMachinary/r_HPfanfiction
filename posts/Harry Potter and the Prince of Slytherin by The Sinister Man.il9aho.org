"I refuse to believe that the cunning Head of Slytherin would ever work with a man who wears a turban," said Harry drily.

Yeah... Er... My buddy is a sikh and wears a turban. Am I missing something here? Is this racial bias? Wtf?

edit: Btw, I know the author isn't racist at all. I'm speaking specifically about turban itself.


** This seems like a pointless criticism... he's an 11 year old kid making a joke with his teacher. It's a joke on the absurdity of a white British wizard wearing a turban for fashion purposes.

** It's more of a mockery of fashion choice than race though.

Presumably if you aren't a Sikh (which Quirrel wasn't), then having a preference for wearing turbans may seem outlandish and thus a target for mockery.

Heavens forbid, not everything is racist.

** What?

Flat attempt at humour, I'll give you. Racism? Not really?

Apart from anything, contextualise the line. From 1981-1991 in South East England, its entirely likely that Harry had never met a single person who wore a turban.

*** Even if it was racist, have you ever listened to how teenagers actually talk amongst themselves (eg in a bus)? If you transcribed that, people would think that it's poor freestyle rap based on the amount of racism, homophobia, sex and overall swear words.

Obviously they aren't all racists, sexists and such, they simply have no filter and think that bad language makes them badass.

** I am sorry my man but you are just feeling a little hurt right here. The author probably just thinks the turban is ridiculous on a brit like Quirrell. And just read more than a few chapters will you before you make claims like this. So calm down.

****** It could be considered cultural/ racial appropriation since a turban is considered a religious and a cultural item in a lot of different religions and cultures, mostly in India so Harry could just be thinking about that (while it is true that most religions which involve a turban don't mind that other people wear a turban Harry is probably not aware of whether its okay for Quirrel to wear a ethnic clothing item especially since Quirrel is a white dude who's as pale as a vampire). Plus in the books (Both canon and POS) the turban is described as ridiculously large for his head (since you know he has a whole another head he needs to hide in there). If you're really concerned about this I would suggest asking your friend if he thinks this is a unsavoury line or simply humour.

******* Cultural appropriation is not a thing. Sikhs are completely okay with other cultures imitating their culture such as wearing a turban. Who ever came up with cultural appropriation is an idiot.

********** Cultural appropriation is definitely a thing. There are customs that are open, and customs that are not open. The sikhs are super chill and open and that's valid, but that doesn't mean that people from other cultures who find white girls wearing their sacred traditions as fashion to be incredibly inappropriate and disrespectful aren't valid

Eta: I find that line incredibly off putting though I haven't read the fic. What was the context? Why would someone say that? It's very strange.

And why do people keep acting like there are only white people in England?

*********** White girls? Really? As a brown grown ass man, you're an idiot. You being white, and you want to wear a sari and preform a Hindu weddings id say go for it. We would love you for that all the more. And we have absolutely no beef that you're a Christian or whatever.

Culture is meant to be shared, and not inclusive to people with certain skin color. Culture does not equate skin color.

************ While Sikhs might be fine with sharing their culture with other groups of people that doesn't mean other cultures are. For example a year or two ago a white woman in America dressed as a Geisha for her school prom, this garnered a huge negative response from the Japanese community. While your opinion as a person of colour should certainly be respected this doesn't mean you're allowed to speak for other cultures and their opinion on appropriation of culture.

************ I don't know, man. Kind of sounds like you've only heard white people talking about it, so I'm not going to add to that. But don't worry, I love saris, and do engage with the Indian textile tradition because it's fucking awesome. I'm just not going to be like ‘I just thought of this really cool thing. check out my wrap' and it's just like...a leather sari, or something lmao.

But anyway on the subject at hand I think that is a really weird thing to say about Snape as an argument as to why he didn't think he was the culprit.

*********** The context of the line is Harry talking to Snape after Voldemort flees from the castle in first year (I could be wrong about the timeline because I haven't read the first POS book in a while) and then he says that he never believed that Snape was working with Quirrel/ Voldemort to steal the philosophers stone after Snape asks why Harry didn't believe it like his brother, he lists some legitimate points on why he didn't believe that they were working together before he sarcastically says he wouldn't have expected that the head of Slytherin house would work with a guy that wears a giant turban.

And about why people (at least me, I'm not sure what other people's view points are) are talking like only white people live in England is that Harry was raised in a primarily white neighborhood where he wasn't allowed to interact with other people for most of the time and spent most of his time in a cupboard, also the Dursley's come off as the kind of people who wouldn't talk or associate with anybody who doesn't seem normal or doesn't uphold the status quo (basically I'm saying that they seem like the kind of people who would be racist/xenophobic in that “I don't talk to anybody I consider inferior” kinda way). While I'm not saying that Harry has never seen a Indian person or a person wearing a turban I'm saying that Harry has probably not had the chance or much motivation to go research the importance and reason for wearing a turban before he came to Hogwarts.

************ valid point. You're right that Dursleys are totally the type of people to be completely and blatantly racist, and be complexity unapologetic about it. ‘Those people stealing our jobs' etc etc, right?

Some people actually say shit like ‘Harry would never have seen someone who isn't white before' which is just too extreme. He was very sheltered, but never? Your point isn't that though, so sorry for misreading it.
