Voldemort has his daughter grow up as he did, to have a true connection in their heir. (Not thinking of how he reacted to his own father for his abandonment) Only, Hermione was adopted and loved. If you have read something like this or would write it, please, let me know ;)


** this doesn't involve Hermione, and isn't quite what you asked for, but if you're looking for looking for Voldemort's daughter stories where there is no love lost between them, there is linkao3(13788267), in which Delphini does some time traveling and shenanigans ensue. This is what Cursed Child should have been.
