It's been many years but I recall a story where after the events of 1st year Madame Pomfrey says words to the effect, "I swear next year you'll lose all the bones in your arm" or "I wouldn't be surprised if you got bit by a basilisk with all the trouble you get in. " which of course happens.

In the story she made several of these statements all of which came true and eventually Harry (maybe the twins?) put a plaque outside the hospital wing doors saying "Madam Pomfrey Hogwarts Resident Seer". Which caused what's her face, the divination teacher, to blow a gasket.

I think it's from Harry's pov. Its probably a canon rehash. But that's all I can remember.
