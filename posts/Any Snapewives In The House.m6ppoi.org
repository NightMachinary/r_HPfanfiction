***** Deathtocaplock contained a whole multitude of Snapeists back in the day, and I'm nearly positive that some of the Snapewives were part of that forum. dedfromsnake and HP_STFU used to mock the hell out of them, and Fandom Wank was known to make some noise about those marriages on the astral plane, let me tell you.
