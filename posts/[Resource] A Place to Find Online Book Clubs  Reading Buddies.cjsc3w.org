Hey everyone -- My name is Curtis :)

With all the fanfic-fans here, I wanted to share a site called Caravan that my friends and I have been working on.

Caravan ([[https://caravanapp.ca/clubs]]) is a site that helps readers connect with other readers for buddy reads & online book clubs. You can join existing groups to discuss, or create your own!

We're also playing around with author groups, where you can link up with other authors to exchange work and provide feedback to each other :)

If either of these sound like something you'd be interested in, we'd love to see you on board!

Feel free to reach out if you've got any questions!


** Lovely idea. I might join.
