I've browsed the sub-reddit for a while, I frequently search on ff.net, and I also check on DLP. I'm looking for well written non-slash Harry centric fics. Other than that, the only thing I care about is that it is not an abandoned fic.

I'd be especially interested in any well written fics that are not frequently rec'ed on this site (as I've probably read most of the frequently rec'ed fics).

I realize that this is a very broad request, and I am hoping it will generate a large number of recs.


** Have you read these two? Not too many reviews, so I assume the stories aren't very popular, but they're really good. Kind of a different take on magic.

This is a pretty cool Harry / Sherlock Holmes crossover. Wish there was a sequel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6947125/1/A-Study-in-Magic]]

I recommend this H/Hr fic all the time. The war here affects not just Britain, but other countries as well as the Muggle world. The second part of the story drags on a bit, but still well worth a read IMHO.

*** Ooh, seconding that rec for A Study in Magic. Not only did it combine one of my favourite TV series with my favourite books, but it had so many new interesting ideas to explore in the magical world! Plus I didn't find myself cringing my way through, which is increasingly rare. I've read it quite recently, so my love for it is still fresh.

*** I've read and enjoyed a study in magic, and I believe I read the diving light as it looks familiar, but I'll give it another look. I think I tried to read the last Horcrux and I don't think I got past the first chapter.

Thanks for the recs, if you have any more please feel free to leave them. There can never be too many recs!

Judging by reviews alone, the following two aren't very well-known. The first one is a crossover with one of my favorite fantasy series, Chronicles of Amber, so I'm a bit biased.

*** I'm following Firebird and Compound Interest as well. Not really a fan of fem Harry or stories that aren't Harry centric. I tried to read Battle School, but didn't really enjoy it.

Thanks for the recs.

**** I would still recommend giving Being Sisyphus a shot. Its definitely a unique story. After dark is also unique and pretty good. The Arithmancer is Hermione centric - sorry about that. I just copied the stories that have been updated recently. I hadnt realized that 3 of the stories are fem!Harry, i dont typically read them, but i guess those are stories actively being updated.

Do you have any recs for us?

** Check out [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/]] if you like overpowered Harry with little trouble dispatching voldemort fics. The author has a few great co.pleted fics and white knight grey queen is one of my favorite fics out there and Jeconais' Gabrielle/Harry fics have no equal. (IMHO)
