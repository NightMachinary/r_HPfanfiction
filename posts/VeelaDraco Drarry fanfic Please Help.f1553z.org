:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
My friends and I have been discussing fanfiction which reminded me of a drarry fanfic I read probably 5 years ago about Draco being a veela and I've been trying to find it for like an hour and can't. There's a decent chance it got deleted but it's bugging me that I can't remember the name.

A little info about it: •Draco was a veela and went through the "emergence" of the veela and the veela chose Harry as its mate •they got put into a separate dorm together because they had to maintain close contact regularly or else the veela would try to die •neither of them were happy about it but they eventually love each other •when they tried sleeping in separate rooms they would literally get like magnetically pulled to each other and wake up in the same bed •I vaguely remember someone (I think Lucius or Voldemort) trying to kill Harry and Draco went on a rampage and saved him I think •it's very very long like over 100k words I think

I vaguely remember seeing it on both ao3 and fanfiction dot net but I could be wrong

If anyone can help I'd really appreciate it. It's bugging me to no end that I can't remember what it's called. I feel like the name started with like a V and wasn't a real word.


** Maybe the Veela enigma? I don't have the link but try searching it up.

*** Good suggestion because the summary sounded close but after reading a bit it's definitely not something I've ever read. Thanks though!

** I know it's been a few months but I think there is one fic that comes to mind:

*** Unfortunately that also isn't it. It's not long enough and the concept isn't quite right. My friends and I are assuming that the fic I read got deleted because otherwise I feel like I would've found it by now. Thanks for the suggestion though!

**** I know I've read it. I literally read it within the past month but I can't find it! I'll have to sift through my history.

*** YOU FOUND IT! As soon as I went to the first chapter and saw the banter between authors I knew it was the right story. It's been so long since I posted this I honestly didn't think anyone would find it. Thank you so much!
