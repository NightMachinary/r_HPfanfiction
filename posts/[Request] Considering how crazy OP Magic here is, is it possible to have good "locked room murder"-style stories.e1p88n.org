Or just any good mystery fics?

Bonus points for creepy halloween stories. And gory. Oh so very gory. Think Umineko if you know it.

+Happy Halloween+


** I'd argue that the secrecy of time-turners makes them a good tool for any murderer who wants to obscure the evidence of their crime. It's much easier to set up a "locked room" murder if the murderer can time-travel to enter an area that was inaccessible in the past.

I'd love to read more fics which explore the idea of criminal time-turner use, but the only ones I know of are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality][HPMOR]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10413771/chapters/22996143][Turning of the Times]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7062230/1/][Concentric Wavelengths]], and of those three only "Concentric Wavelengths" is written like a mystery.

*** I remember reading a fic that covers some of Tonks's (I think?) auror training with Moody. There's a section where she correctly figures out that a colleague or some other ministry figure is under the imperius curse and that the perpetrator had used a time-turner to get into the room and observe the attempted assassination so that, depending on its success, they would know whether to attempt it.

Tonks thinks that it's a test by Moody and is insulted that he thinks she'd fall for it; everyone else has no idea what just happened and is confused how she was able to deduce the series of events.

Now if only I could remember what fic that's from...

  What? Why was Amelia snickering? Surely it was a good thing to have such a legendary auror like Alastor Moody as a mentor... right?

** You're unlikely to find any good mystery fanfiction without massive amounts of PIS or CIS, the magical system in HP is guaranteed to make the mystery unfair, either for the murderer or the detective. The murderer has access to magic that would make the creation of a perfect closed room murder a walk in the park, and the detective if he's not a muggle/squib would likely have an unfair advantage toward the reader due to the various spells he got at his disposition.

Umineko worked because as explained in ep6 magic could not do anything that couldn't be done without it, and might not even exist to begin with.

** That kind of murder mystery is pretty much impossible to have in a full magical setting. Umineko works because the reality with and without magic co-exist but the case is very specific.

In a general magical setting the whodunnit and howdunnit are pretty irrelevant as magic is extremely flexible. The exploration of the whydunnit is an interesting angle but has to be done well being character driven and all.
