I've seen the words "Potter Hair" being used many times in fics. Why is that? We know Harry has a messy hair of his father but that's it. Couldn't James inherited it from his mother? Am i missing an info? Did jk mention anywhere it's a potter treat? Is hair magically a Y chromosome trait now?


** The last update on Pottermore stated that the Potters grew very rich by inventing magical hair care products. It wasn't called "Potter Hair" though.

"Henry's son was called Fleamont Potter. Fleamont was so called because it was the dying wish of Henry's mother that he perpetuate her maiden name, which would otherwise die out. He bore the burden remarkably well; indeed, he always attributed his dexterity at duelling to the number of times he had to fight people at Hogwarts after they had made fun of his name. It was Fleamont who took the family gold and quadrupled it, by creating magical Sleekeazy's Hair Potion ( â€˜two drops tames even the most bothersome barnet' ). He sold the company at a vast profit when he retired, but no amount of riches could compensate him or his wife Euphemia for their childlessness. They had quite given up hope of a son or daughter when, to their shock and surprise, Euphemia found that she was pregnant and their beloved boy, James, was born."

***** jk just likes to attach random things to potters to generate unnecessary nostalgia so people will want to reread the books, and buy a whole new set in their current favourite house colours to do it..

** As an argument for the 'Potter Hair' when Harry looked into the mirror of Erised in book one, he was able to recognize his family and ancestors because they shared similar features to him.

That being said, fanfiction always takes things like this and extrapolates them to an absurd degree.

** Same reason Potters all look like clones, marry redheads(which never has or will effect their hair color), etc. No information, someone states it in a popular fic, and it reverbs constantly until people treat it as canon.

** Because nobody remembers longer than a generation and James was so iconic that he defined the archetype of a "Potter" for the rest of the Wizarding World.

** When I saw the title I thought you were about to complain about people misspelling 'heir' when they give Harry arbitrary titles.

Basically, all Potters having the same hair is a pretty stupid trope, and as such is very common in parts of fanfiction. There are a bunch of different reasons people will use, but it's been around for a long time and it's one of the things that people who are new to writing fanfiction will frequently use.
