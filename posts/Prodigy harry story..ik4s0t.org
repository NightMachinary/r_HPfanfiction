A story where harry is a genius that matches or exceeds Voldemort or Dumbledore. But even though he will eventually become the most powerful mage in his school among the students and adult wizards.

He should not be able to be as op as Voldemort is in his fucking third year that makes no sense considering the difference in talent level.

The power progression must be written well. Harry should be preferably in slytherin but raven claw is fine. Dark harry is fine.

A good romance is optional but preferable.


** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path) although it's largely due to taking a path they didn't, and being spectacular at it.

** On the off chance you haven't already read it, The Merging, an AU from fifth year, just wrapped up after seven years, and ticks all your boxes except for the house (Harry is still a Gryffindor).

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
