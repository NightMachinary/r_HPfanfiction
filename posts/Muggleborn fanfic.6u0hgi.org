Anyone who knows a good one? :) Thx


** Can you add a few more details? Do you mean a story with a muggleborn OC as the protagonist, a story focusing on canon muggleborns, or a story where muggleborn isuses are critical to the plot?

**** You might like my story "Divided and Entwined". It focuses on muggleborns in an alternate Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** A Different Kind of Brave by ImagineWords fits what you're looking.

It hasn't been updated for two years though.

  Cara is a young muggleborn who hasn't had very many breaks in her life. Then she dives head first into the weirdest world she could never have imagined by accepting a letter to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she is sorted into Hufflepuff and proceeds to be a wrecking ball to a school where age old house prejudices still exist. OC nearly all the way.

** Yeah, I know one. It's in seven parts... It's written by J. K. Rowling. It's about a boy who is basically a muggleborn.

*** All sarcasm aside, Harry doesn't have to deal with "You dirty mudblood!"-style prejudice, which is potentially one of the things OP was looking for.
