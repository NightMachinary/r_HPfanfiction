** Have it work from the other end. Gellert Grindelwald does some complicated ritual and it either goes really wrong or has unexpected results. This ends up summoning Harry from the future. The Deathly Hallows could be involved* -- Grindelwald was trying to summon them or some such.

Maybe Grindelwald tries to summon to him the closest one using the Wand, intending to get the Stone, but Harry wearing the Cloak at some point in the future turns out to be the /physically/ if not /temporally/ closet Hallow. They both show up, antics ensue.

This helps introduce the setting and jumps right into things without being too cheesy.

** It could take place during the whole department of mysteries fiasco. We already know there are rooms dedicated to love, death, time, etc. Possibly while running from death eaters, he runs through a door to find himself inexplicably in the past.

** - Afterlife Inc: Harry's Reaper is pretty pissed that he's died again, and sends him to where it all began, with a tweenage Tom Riddle\\
- Divine Intervention, the Upside: Some deity sees how much Harry's life sucks, and lends him a hand... accidentally knocking him a bit further than intended.\\
- Divine Intervention, the Downside: Some deity sees how much Harry's screwed up this universe and punishes him by forcing him to go back in time and fix it.\\
- Time Turner Abuse: Turn once for an hour, turn 8766 times for a year, etc.\\
- Time Turner Explosion: One turn + an overpowered AK = ????\\
- Drapery Incident: Harry gets into a fight with the Veil and loses.\\
- Deus Ex Machina: Harry suddenly becomes awesome and creates a spell successfully taking him back in time... and overshoots his target. Exactly how he accomplishes this is sorta glossed over.\\
- Crossover: Any number of well known time traveling characters stop by for a whirlwind tour of the Ages.\\
- Planet of the Wizards (AKA Wizards... IN SPACE!): Harry flies through a black hole and winds up a century in the past.\\
- Fairy Godmother, the Good: Harry finds a fairy and wishes he could go back and fix it. She obliges.\\
- Fairy Godmother, the Bad: A Fairy finds Harry and makes him go fix it, or else!\\
- Fairy Godmother, the Ugly: A fairy pretty much just wants to fuck with Harry and sends him back in time (teehee!).\\
- Saint +Elsewhere+ Mungo's: It's all just a dream, so have fun!\\
- ALIENS: Pretty much as the label states.
- The Enemy of My Enemy is My Friend, Right?: Harry is summoned by "the good guys" to another place and time to take care of their Dark Lord problems\\

*** You could probably lump it in with Afterlife Inc, but I also occasionally see Harry going back from the kings cross scene after he dies and going back in time because/when he declines to board the train.

Also, Sliders, Harry is slipping from world to world, today he lands in what looks like WW2.

**** Dimension Hopper, Greetings Mr. Potter (someone other than D makea him go way back), One step forward or three steps back (decides on his own to go back) and All aboard the Hogwarts express destination: the past (chooses to go on but it sends him back any way)

The last three all fit fairly close with Death being the cause.

** If you don't want to make it cliche, *create another environment, rather than the same-old Hogwarts or Department of Mysteries.* (That's /way/ too overdone - I'm not sure why people are suggesting that.) Look up mystical "places" in the real world, or create your own. Stonehenge. Some ruins Harry might be exploring, perhaps. Atlantis, maybe? That's been done before, though. An ancient crypt. Perhaps a relic of WW2 that's been preserved in time, somehow? A stray magical "field" or artifact Harry might come across in his travels around the world.

The key being - don't use the normal HP fanfiction universe and location. It's awfully restrictive in what you can do and plan for. If you create your own "magical" location, though, you have the entire world open for access when you write your fic - something that might become /very/ useful when writing a fic in a time period with /international/ conflict.

Try reading these for some ideas on creating a post-WW environment, once you've had your starting point done - some of the best WW1/WW2 time travel fics out there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][*The Skitterleap*]] - /Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?/

The night I died and lived England celebrated the end of the nightmare that had yet to begin and praised the baby they would later fear and hate. I am Harry Potter. I am legend./

**** That's a great idea!

A central problem I've noted with many fanfics that don't make it "to the top" is that they are a bit too restrictive when it comes to world, location, history, culture. They keep the entire fanfic in one or two countries, barely mentioning anything about any other nations, communities, conflicts. But the few fanfictions that do - it makes you truly feel like you are in a world with a /global/ history.

 

For an example of what I'm talking about, read joe's acclaimed Wastelands of Time. He takes advantage of the fact that the wizarding community exists around the world, and throughout history - so he comes up with some truly amazing imagery, plot lines, and history for his fic. It adds another dimension, another layer of depth. It doesn't seem easy to pull off, but if you /can/ manage to do it - to expand upon the canon world and make it something cooler - then it pays dividends.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][*Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time*]] - /Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time./

 

On another note, try visiting the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][*Dark Lord Potter forums*]], for ideas. You can put your story up there, too, in the forums - I've seen writers often do this in order to have avid fanfiction readers (and writers - almost everyone who has a story in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][*DLP C2*]] is on the forum) review and comment on a chapter-by-chapter basis (or even part-chapter basis). [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=20483][*(Example)*]]

 

Edit: You could try taking a page from Magicks of the Arcane for creating a vast, dynamic, and amazing world. The author truly does that aspect well. Also another great read, if you want ideas.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magics-of-the-Arcane][*Magicks of the Arcane*]] - /Sometimes, all it takes for a man to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Harry isn't satisfied with his life, and the Goblet of Fire gives him the perfect excuse to change it./

** A race of extra planar multidimensional beings create art by craving space-time itself generating shards that fly away across dimensions one such shard hits Harry sending him to 1942 (Eric Flint, 1632)

During the battle at the Ministry of magic after Sirius falls trough the veil harry runs towards there and falls too at the same time a killing cure hits the veil sending harry to 1942

After Harry Dies Mr. White the Mysterious after life bureaucrat sends harry to 1942 instead to the afterlife after misfiling an archive. he is clumsy like that.

I could go on and on but really, who cares? just get into the meat of the story!

** In all honesty, whatever you choose won't matter if all you're doing is using it as a prologue to set up the rest of the story. (By now, most readers just skim the first chapter of dimension/time travel fics in order to get to the meat of the story.)
