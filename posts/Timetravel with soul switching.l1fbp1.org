After 5th year: It isn't only Sirius who died in the ministerium. Dumbledore and Remus died too. Harry, Ron and Hermione were misting out a newfound room in Grimmauld Place and find something that could help them. The three were desperate, couldn't think of a way to win the war without Dumbledore, so they took the risk. They didn't expect to go back to their 5-year-old self. And certainly not to be in the other's body.

Harry is Hermione Hermione is Ron Ron is Harry

Harry finds out what a true family is like. Even if he's a girl now, but, well, he never really cared about his gender anyway.

Hermione has to endure the 'teasing' and 'pranks' of the twins because of her(Ron's) studio's nature and 'surprising desire' to be a girl (Molly loves to have another girl) while getting closer to Percy as a result.

Ron... Well, he is pretty pissed off. He can't imagine this is what is best friend had to go through all those years. Now, he truly appreciates what his parents did for him and his siblings. Ron is set on a path he never before would have thought about. He's going to open an orphanage for all the lost, rejected and abused. No child should ever have to go through this Hell.

Let the chaos begin.

P.S. The Golden Trio of Griffindor also becomes The Golden Trio of Hufflepuff

  There are certain segments of the Harry Potter fandom which more or less idolize Hermione. You know, the people who think that Hermione really should have been the main character of the stories all along, because she was the only one of the trio with a brain. Now, I don't necessarily think JKR did a great job portraying her as very intelligent in the series, but I'm still one of those people who wants to see what she could have been if she were actually the main character, and not just the brainy sidekick (or, as in Mary Potter, a mostly-independent secondary protagonist doing her own thing on the sidelines). So this is that story: What happens if you put Hermione Granger's mind into Harry Potter's body, effectively making her the Boy Who Lived?So she wakes up in his body, and vice versa. While he revels in his new-found loving family (which more than makes up for the strangeness of waking up as a girl), she drastically re-evaluates her priorities, endeavoring to act like the story-book heroines with whom she is so familiar and deal with this unpleasant development as efficiently as possible.

  In which Hermione attempts a time-travelling ritual without due preparation and Harry happily goes along for the ride, and both have to cope with living their best friend's life.
