Sometime during or just after the Battle of Hogwarts, or during the year where they're on the run, Harry gets cursed. It's not really noticeable by people because his slide down the slippery slope is so gradual, and most people think he's just becoming a bit eccentric/trying to heal from the shit the War put him through.

Death Eaters that escaped the Battle begin turning up dead: no esoteric magic was used, but basic spells that any Hogwarts student knows are used, like /scourgify/ being used in a crazy excess to essentially sandpaper their skin off, /wadawasi/ sending corrosive potions ingredients up noses and into brains, /aquamenti/ filling a victim's stomach with water until they hemorrhage, et cetera.

When Luna of all people catches him dancing around naked one night, on the battlements of the Astronomy Tower and under the full moon, people finally clue themselves in that something is very wrong with him.

Harry, however, feels more free than he has ever been. An epiphany hits him. There's /nothing/ holding him back.

He ups and vanishes without a single fuck given at the time.

Hermione and Luna eventually discover what happened to him, and the cure involves the powdered horn of a certain Snorkack. They join the Department of Mysteries for their resources, and search for a cure between their missions/research as part of the deal given.

Unfortunately, this causes strain between them and a lot of their friends and family due to the secrecy involved -- Ron in particular thinks Hermione has gone around the twist, too.

Meanwhile, Harry, despite his deteriorated mind, still cares for the people he left behind over the years: stolen muggle money (in excess) is regularly deposited for Teddy and Andromeda via the goblins, who are for some reason pants-shittingly terrified of Nutty-Harry in an off-screen Noodle Incident (Andromeda opening her door one day to be buried under an avalanche of stacked brick-bills would be hilarious); birthday presents are sent anonymously, sometimes weeks late, and extended friends' problems, like people bothering a growing Gabrielle, are 'solved'.

  "*Bill!*"

  Fleur's screech caused the book he had been looking over to fall from his grip, and he rushed into the kitchen, stumbling across the threshold, wand drawn in readiness.

  "/Love/?"

  He froze: resting atop a birthday cake on their table, its white icing stained with small splats and rivers of blood, was the severed head of Fenrir Greyback. Carved into his cheek were three, neat little lines -- a mirror of the exact same scar given to him by the monster.

  In neat writing on in the icing were the words /Happy Birthday, Bill/.
#+end_quote

He meanders his way around the world, doing crazy shit and baffling the shit out of the superhero and supervillain elements by straddling the line (vanishing Superman's clothes could be hilarious; the Riddler wakes up every morning to find a very annoyed sphinx at the end of his bed, /somehow/).

Since he only has access to an incomplete Hogwarts education and whatever else he picked up along the way, he munchkins. No 'Master of Death' cop-outs, unless his magically brain-damaged brain believes he does and accidental magic/McGuffin causes him to do freaky shit (though this'd be a subplot, I think?), or super-power ups unless he earns them over the course of the story.

There'd be a subplot involving the ripples caused with the Statute worldwide, too. Politics.

Eventually, he ends up in Gotham, catching wind of a final, missing Death Eater hiding there.

Harley, with her background, has trouble making heads or tails of him because of how the magic boned his brain/personality. It's like 2+2=4, only not 4 because the colour green was used in the equation somewhere, so the answer doesn't make sense.

Ironically, it's /Ivy/ who can see a good person underneath the crazy.

He mostly sticks to magical crimes/acts that catch his attention, but they cross paths sometimes, eventually going from frenemies, to acquaintances, to friends, to being an off/on again member.

Over time, Hermione and Luna finally have the cure and catch up to him. Ivy and Harley try to warn them against using it, but they don't listen, determined to get 'their' Harry back after so long.

The cure works... but they've been chasing more of an ideal now after so long. Not only has the damage been done, but a now saner Harry with even a Swiss-cheesed brain recognizes what he's done over the years... and promptly has a psychotic breakdown, becoming even /more/ batshit insane and going on a spree that surprises and terrifies a lot of Gotham's elements. I'm talking rampaging /Obscurial/-levels of "oh shit".

Ironically, it's Ivy, Harley, and the rest of the gang that slowly anchor him back to sanity and the 'new normal' he had while being cursed.

More subplot thoughts:

When Harley does realize/recognize she has a thing for him over time, she finds herself competing with Supergirl or another b-grade heroine or villain for his affections.

Supergirl (who is very annoyed with that moniker now that she's in her twenties) thinks she can rehabilitate him and make him a functional hero: this causes a bit of division in the Justice League because of the complicated relationship Harry has with their individual members.

He amusingly saves Freeze by stumbling in during one of his 'episodes', tossing a blood-replenishing potion at him during the transfer (Ivy recognizes it), then bumbling out. In under a year, he unknowingly becomes the godfather to the Freezes' first child, which surprises him.

He gets cured at his and Harley's wedding by Hermione and Luna, who have the social-sense of a pair of doorknobs.

  "I should be on my honeymoon!" Harley smashed another one of the stumbling, misshapen Death-Eater lookalikes with her bat, it crumbling to dirt and dust under the blow. "But no! I'm havin' to chase my new hubby down before he goes nuclear on Gotham -- again!"

  "A little help!"

  Ivy, her bridesmaid dress in tatters, was going blow-to-blow with enlarged, animated simulacrum of the long-dead Ace Chemicals board of directors. She winced as a maw more akin to that of a human-toothed chainsaw snapped at her face, missing her cheek by mere centimeters.

  "Huh, that's ironic," Harley said with a blink, before launching herself at the backs of their hydra-like heads.
#+end_quote

So, uh, yeah. Thought this might be interesting, as I've been laughing my ass off at the Harley Quinn show.

Edit: Christ, I just realized Clayface would love him due to his character, heh.

*** When I'm not feeling like sh*t, I'll probably write a few loosely-written snippets based on this.

Of course, I'll need to find a way to watch the Harley Quinn series in full, and also I'll need to trawl through the various DC wikis for interesting tidbits I can adapt, too.

** Wadiwasi needs more of a... morbid twist to it. Bertie Botts Beans... Yeah! The fandom/wiki page for the spell says it has the force of a bullet. A jellybean would hit pretty hard at those speeds. Imagine the autopsy report... "Victim was shot in the nose, leading directly to the brain. Projectile turned out to be a... jelly bean? Mass spec results confirm a lobster... flavored... jellybean? I will have the test redone to confirm..."

It would be funny for him to think he's actually the "Master of Death". Picture him using the stone to mess with someone like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2uCbXUmpZY][Keep Summer Safe]] (Rick and Morty, NSFW: violence). It would require advanced scheming though... Run from Batman, lead him down crime alley and as they pass the "spot", summon Martha and Thomas Wayne.

*** Jellybeans being used as makeshift bullets, smashing kneecaps and breaking bones when they don't penetrate flesh. Sounds grimly amusing, and something I think Harley's crew would find hilarious, too!

IIRC, Lupin directed the wad of gum up Peeves' nose: it's likely the trajectory of objects affected by wadiwasi can be directed by a wand-flick.

*** Luna being insane in that way is pretty overdone-a-trope, to be honest. I mean, her being nutty has been overdone in humorous and frightening ways in various fics, but she's really just an emotionally-damaged, a bit quirky as a result, sheltered girl.
