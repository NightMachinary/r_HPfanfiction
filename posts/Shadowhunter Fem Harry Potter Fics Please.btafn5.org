*** I'm guessing op means nephilim from The Mortal Instruments by Cassandra Clare / Shadowhunters (Netflix). Or I'm completely wrong and op means some other obscure rouge like race.

**** You are right. I meant the nephilim from Cassandra Claire's mortal instruments. Should I have made it clear? I didn't think there would be other shadow hunters!!!

***** It's more that it is a bit obscure if you have no knowledge of the series. Might be a good idea to make an edit with base description of nephilim in the sense of this series. I mean if you think about it a very basic description of it could be tattoo magic. On saying that I don't think anyone's actually made this so, I doubt you will get a story of a mini Clary not Clary fucking up Voldemort. Despite how amusing that would be.
