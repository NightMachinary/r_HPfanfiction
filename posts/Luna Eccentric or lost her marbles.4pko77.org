How do you write/like to see other people write Luna? Do you see her as just different or do you think she's actually been affected, by, say, the accident that killed her mother?


** She is just different. Some people ask why, Luna asks why not? She is written very child like, very full of wonder.

I can't stand Luna who is only pretending to be strange, or Luna who is absolutely crazy. She is probably the worst written character across the fandom.

** I've always written her as just being very whimsical and spacey. I don't think she's dumb or lost her marbles, but rather embraces the non-mainstream thinking. I think she's really in touch with herself and doesn't view the world as this black and white place, but rather as this wonderful mish mash of fantastical things. And is it really so crazy to think that some of the things she believes in actually exist in the wizard world?

** Luna only works in wisps for me. Once you expand above her whimsical nature the character loses it's appeal. Luna is rarely good in longer stories.

** I'd say mostly just different but not so much as a defensive mechanism to deal with the death of her mother but rather that her father probably became more eccentric after her mother died. So then she had a father who was already a bit weird and a mother who was probably very creative, and then she just had a depressed eccentric father who probably tried too hard to keep things whimsical for Luna. So she's probably just creative and whimsical, but also a bit affected by her mother's death and her father's reaction.

** I see her as out of touch with reality.

If I had to give a good cause to write her like that, I would say that somewhere up her family tree, a muggle became a wizard/witch and was far too gullible about the possibilities and extent of magic in the world. Now that kind of gullibility/magic paranoia has been passed down to her father and now to her.

I honestly do not like her character though, so that influences my view of her. I've known people similar to her, pretending to be odd for attention or just to be different.

** Doesn't eccentric mean cute or rich but lost her marbles anyway?

** Just eccentric. She always struck me as very deep thinking and incredibly smart, just in a unique way. To be honest, I wish it was acceptable to act like Luna in the real world. Is it possible her moms accident did affect her some? Maybe. She likely lost some female guidance and maybe she developed an even more interesting imagination as an escape from the pain of the loss. But she clearly is still a happy person.

** I think we had a similar question to this last week! She doesn't seem to present as psychotic (aka 'lost her marbles'), manic, depressive, having sensory delusions in the medical sense.

I'd say just eccentric. At least she's not a conspiracy nut. /shudders/ Sandy Hook truthers....

Oooh what would a wizard truther be?!

** She needs a therapist (she might not be crazy and can actually handle herself pretty well - outside of believing all that crazy shit (Rotfang-Conspiracy, Stubby Boardman, Nargles etc. etc.)) and some grounding in the real world (and no bullying...I love it when fanfiction makes someone go after her bullies (preferably Harry or Flitwick!))
