He feels ill and sick constantly through the summer after second year. When Marge provokes him, rather than blowing her up, he transforms into a horrible chimeric monster, highly intelligent but vicious and feral. Then, only vaguely remembering himself, he starts hunting wizards, beginning with Lucius Malfoy. As the body count rises, Dumbledore has to find and stop the beast, which he thinks killed Harry.


** Harry tried. God, he really tried.

Ever since the Chamber he felt wrong, different, like something was /growing/ inside him. It wasn't literal, of course, otherwise he would have ran screaming to Madame Pomfrey without any worry for her incessant prodding.

He just felt /wrong./

And then Marge showed up, all bluster and fury - pointed questions shot his way like bullets, vicious in their intensity. He could hardly stand her, the woman on her fifth glass of wine and Ripper snarling from between her legs.

The pain in his forehead was new, not the sharp sting that ran through his skull like the end of a nail, Quirrel staring down at him from the end of the Great Hall. This was dull, throbbing, pulsing out from his head and working its way down his spine sparking shivers all the while.

Harry caught himself nearly growling in return, eyes fixated on Ripper and his jaw tight.

"Boy, did you just /growl/ at my puppy?"

"No," Harry uttered thickly, his voice low and strained. "Wouldn't dream of it."

Marge huffed. "All snark." She pointed at Vernon, one sausage-like finger extended from the thin stem of her glass. "You don't beat him enough, do you?"

"He is at St. Brutus'... aren't you boy?"

"Yes, sir."

"Strange. I'd thought an institution like that would still use a cane."

Vernon glared at Harry.

"Every day, ma'am."

"Ma'am? Do I look a day over forty? No? It's /miss/ to you."

"Yes, /miss."/

"God almighty." Marge chuckled aloud, shaking her head. "A little beast, aren't you? Just like your mother, bitch that she was."

In that brief, glimmering moment, the pain in Harry's skull stopped. He blinked, only given a second of respite before it came thundering back, all claws and sharp edges as it chipped at his mind.

He howled, collapsing to the floor as a bestial scream erupted from his throat. The skin on his forehead split, sharp horns bursting from the thin flesh and spraying blood across cheap linoleum.

His hands cracked as the bones in them shifted, extending, reaching forward into wicked points that pulled towards his wrist. Harry screamed again as his back twisted of its own accord, spine lengthening into a tail of pale white, interlaced with ropes of muscle - no skin to be found.

What stood in that tiny suburban dining room was no longer Harry, not truly. Not entirely. Its skin was thick and scaled, subtle patterns running across his arms and just barely catching the light. Sharp protrusions of bone poked out of his flesh in no real direction but /out,/ resembling more of a bramble patch than any living thing.

Marge and the rest of them could only manage a reasonable response to such horror, that of screams and panicked motions toward the sliding door, some primal part of themselves urging them away - to be anywhere but in a room with that /thing./

The noise that left Harry's throat could be described as nothing short of wretched, like falling stones wrapped in flames. It crackled and hissed, echoing out across Privet Drive and sparking real, true fear in its inhabitants.

He lunged.

Two men in suits were situated a bit away from the cordoned-off section, one of them sitting on a barrel and the other with one hand laid on his shoulder.

"It's... this might be the worst case of homicide I've ever had to witness. They were /torn apart/, whatever got into that house had claws sharp enough to rend bone. These people weren't killed, they were /eviscerated/. I don't know if I can continue after this."

"It's alright, tap out and wait for me at Dave's. We'll drown it out with a bit of the ol' fire-water, I'll finish the examination here." The other man squeezed his shoulder once, then began walking towards the house, blue flashes cutting through the mist.

"John!" came a call from behind him.

He turned around, looking at his partner's ashen face.

"Be careful."

--------------

Albus was currently reading through a thick, grey tome whose cover was stained with something black. It had no title, for it didn't need one - The feeling one got while holding out a hand and feeling its aura was enough to know the subject matter.

Suddenly, Fawkes went wild, teetering strange, discordant tones that inspired not hope or happiness, but a confusing jumble of emotions, and shortly thereafter one after another of the small, silver instruments began deviating - one exploded, another began whirring, another simply stopped dead, and one with a crystal at its center began glowing blindingly and then went dark with a fizz.

As soon as the first one had began to make noise, the ancient tome was thrown carelessly aside, and Albus vaulted over his table, wand appearing in his hand. He strode over to the table, wand glowing various colors of the rainbow (and a few others besides), before cursing in both german and english alternatingly and yanking his wand over his shoulder, which made a small pot of floo powder shoot into the fireplace.

Albus barked "FIGG!", and jumped through the flames.

  As Harry Potter slays the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, blood and venom get in his eyes, mostly blinding him. While Harry learns to adapt, he makes some new friends. But this is more than a story of adaptation and friendship as there are threats... and Harry isn't the only one with a past that haunts him.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?

*** As other people said, I also love your setting.

In fact, I just reread the last fea chapters to catch up.

[Minor SPOILERS] To me, a gradual process of the protagonists shifting away from their former humanity sound cool. Like, the more time it passes, the less connected to the rest of humans they are (maybe seeing them as inferiors/annoying? Idk), and the more they embrace their new entity (being five but not really [like tiamat]). But hey, its your story and up until now, it is going great. [Minor SPOILERS] END

Sorry for the rambling, but I really like these kind of stories. Yours specially :3

All in all, great job writting it and I am sure that whatever path you decide to follow will result in a great story.
