​

Seriously, people, it stopped being funny or clever around 10 years ago, and some never were, I've lost count of the time my suspension of disbelief is interrupted in an otherwise decent fic because of a stupid ass nickname!


** There are a couple of those worth keeping to some degree: "Dogfather" is okay - it seems like the kind of joke Sirius would make, and I do like it when Dobby refers to Sirius as something like "Harry Potter Sir's dogfather". Also, while the canonically clean-mouthed characters would be unlikely to use "Umbitch", it does work well, as does the classier "the Batrachian Bitch".

**** Well, Umbitch is ok once or twice, but using it repeatedly gets annoying, I agree ^^

Calling Dumbledore an old goat is also ok, but al long it doesn't become a synonym to his name. Then it gets frustrating. Had a story where this happened and I was constantly reading: the /Old Goat/ did this and that...

** Cub, in particular, makes no fucking sense at all. You know what animals have cubs? Bears and big cats.

Now, you could make an argument about young gryffindor = young lion = cub, I suppose (it's still stupid), but that isn't really what people are doing because it's usually coming out of /Lupin/'s mouth and referencing his "pack" in some way. Baby wolves are pups, people.

Speaking of... Fuck off with the talk about packs and alphas too. Y'all know that the stereotypical 'alpha wolf' shit has been debunked, right? Like, over a decade ago. By the dude that created the concept, even. There's /no such thing/ as an alpha male, an alpha wolf, or alpha any-animal-at-all.

... wow, that went a little bit off topic. /Whistles/

Sadly that was waaay too late for all the Werewolf mythos/fiction that were created.

AND JKR says Fenrir has his pack and is considered the Alpha IIRC Remus talks about it in the books.

TES also has Alpha werewolves.

Many modern depictions of werewolves(movies, shows, games) use terms as Alpha to designate the leader of the pack.

** I don't mind the first two, but only if it's a fic focusing on Sirius raising Harry. Parents come up with ridiculous nicknames for their children all the time as a term of endearment. My own parents even called me bear cause I gave huge hugs as a kid. So that okay even if I'd like more variety.

“Clever” names for Dumbledore, Death eaters, Voldemort, and Umbridge were cringe worthy in the first place. If you want to insult the characters just do it. Hermione calling Umbridge a bitch to her face can be an effective outburst of emotion. Calling her Umbitch just seems dumb and childish.

I've had to train my brain to read Mione as Hermione. Otherwise I couldn't stand to read a lot of fics that focus on her. That one makes me cringe whenever I notice it. It's so strange and annoying. It would like be shortening Ronald to Ald.

Also if you call him moldyshorts I'll fight you.

*** I dont like Mione much either, but lets be fair on that nickname.

It is not a given that a nickname comes from the /first/ part of somebody's name (like Ron). A name-based nickname could come from later parts of the name, too. An example from fiction for this would be Xander (Alexander) from Buffy, but I also knew a Helena who went by Lena. Mione does not seem /that/ far out to me.

Personally I simply dont like it because I dont think Hermione is the sort of person who'd let you call her nicknames. That's all.

Not really. Nicknames typically come from the parts of names that draw the most attention when we hear/say them. That's often the start of the name, but it doesn't have to be. Ronald has the stress on the first syllable, Hermione has it on the second. And the two consonant sounds in the first syllable of Hermione are weak, so it's very easy to drop off.
