Edit: I wrote an alternative version based on the critique in this thread - read this first, then scroll down into the comments.

--------------

Year three, Harry and Hermione have the fight over the firebolt early on in the year, Harry doesn't really like to confrontation, so he just spends less time around Hermione (as does Ron) - as a result Hermione spends even more time learning and researching, and ultimatively ends up getting addicted to the time turner. And when I say 'addicted', I mean 'addicted'. The constant use of the time turner even for inconsequential things, like daving the time it takes to get dressed, to go to the bathroom, to return books to the library, etc. It starts slowly, but it clearly enters the realm of unhealthy.

At this point it has become a mental addiction with al of its side effects. A feeling of dread when she feels like having missed the opportunity to save time somewhere, combating mental exhaustion caused by overuse of the time turner by making more time to sleep using the time turner, a growing distance between her and her friends. From Harry and Ron's perspective they still see/bump into Hermione as often as usual (especially after they stop shunning her for her broom-intervention), but from her perspective it's often a whole day or more between meeting each other, a serious amount of time in a school with shared houses.

The additional amount of time spent looping meanwhile ends with Hermione finishing her curriculum for the year ahead of time, and so she starts learning spells for the fourth year.

The change in Hermione becomes more apparent, and eventually even Harry notices that there's something more going on. He tries to talk to her, but she just brushes him off, until he finally decides to ask his head of house, McGonegall, whether she knows what's going on. McGonegall correctly assumes that Hermione's behaviour has something to do with the time turner, and so she confronts her about it. Hermione is defensive about her use of the time turner, and tries to make arguments to be able to keep the thing - and makes a mistake. She reveals that she has already finished the curriculum for the year, assuming an educator like McGonegall would be pleased to hear her studying so far ahead. The opposite however is the case. McGonegall is shocked over how much the time turner was really used and confiscates it, and mentions to Hermione how 'some of her friends' were already getting worried.

Hermione is pissed and confronts Harry. Harry is having none of it, as he has problems of his own, e.g. Draco trying to get buckbeak killed and apparently a killer hunting him. Hermione is still angry, but she realizes that she wasn't the best friend this year and focuses on helping Harry. For a while everything continues as normal, up until Sirius Black is arrested and Buckbeak's execution is imminent.

Because this time they don't have the time turner anymore.

Hermione realizes their only chance however is using the time turner, so she tells Harry about it, and they create a plan to steal it from McGonegall's office.

Invisibility cloak here, marauders map there, a bit of good time and luck later, they have the time turner and manage to save both buckbeak and sirius.

But there's one thing they fail at - and that's returning the time turner undetected. While they were gone, McGonegall noticed that the time turner was missing.

Hermione gets caught trying to return the time turner, and McGonegall, oblivious to the events that had just happened, is not disapointed about Hermione breaking her trust (that already happened when she overused the turner even when warned about it), she is furious. A student breaking into her office to steal a valuable artifact she is obviously addicted to is a serious offense, and expulsion is one of the possible consequences.

Hermione gets dragged into the headmaster's office, who knows what's going on, but can't officially defend Hermione for freeing someone thought to be a terrorist/killer.

He reduces the punishment to detention for the rest of the year, as well as some detention in the next, which would allow him (if the detention is with him) to spare her. McGonegall however notices what the headmaster is trying to do, and insists on not only her being the overseer of the detentions, but in addition to them that Hermione is banned from all hogsmeade trips and similar events for the next year.

Ultimatively Dumbledore has to accept, and Hermione receives her punishment.

Cue next year.

Harry feels guilty for causing Hermione to get punished (from his perspective it all started with him asking for help to free sirius, continued with her returning the stolen time turner instead of him, and ended with him not being there to defend her against the accusations).

He wants to make it up to her somehow, but isn't sure how to. Before he even gets the chance however, he is placed in the tournament. McGonegall, being worried about her student, allows Harry and Ron to visit Hermione in her detentions, so that they can research for the upcoming trials together, and also assigns specific punishments to Hermione, that would be considered cheating, if she assigned them to Harry. Ron, still angry/jealous about Harry being in the tournament, doesn't initially join them in their detentions.

Apart from Harry learning a few helpful spells early on and Hermione never meeting Victor Krum because of detentions, not much changes. Until the yule ball.

Hermione is still banned from any hogsmeade weekends and events like this, while Harry is still trying to make up his error that caused this situation in the first place. He realizes that this might be his chance, and he tries to argue with McGonegall to allow Hermione attend. He however fails his persuasion check and has to resort to his backup-plan: also not attending, so that Hermione atleast doesn't have to sit around alone. (Ron in the meantime is cheering inside, because while he officially has made up with Harry, for the first time he actually managed to do something Harry didn't: he got a date for the yule ball!)

Harry and Hermione use the time to apologize to each other for both causing the other to miss the ball, Hermione wonders why Harry didn't manage to get a date, Harry wonders what Hermione would've looked like in a dress, and both for the first time really realize that the other is of the opposite gender. And since there's nothing to do, they both start to dance around a bit in the empty gryffindor common room, stepping on each others toes a lot and having a great time.

And there and then they realize - even if the whole world is off to do enjoy themselves and don't care about what happens to both of them, they will be fine. Because they still have each other.

--------------

So, whatya think?


** Indeed. Sirius's innocence should solve the issue easily. McGonagall obviously trusts Dumbledore a great deal - her "he said it, that should be enough" line in book 4 is telling.

I'd also - though that's just my personal preference - go against canon there, and save Sirius by going back much further than in the book, far enough to catch Pettigrew by ambushing him when he (and everyone else) thinks he has escaped.

Instead of getting detention, Hermione could need help - therapy, or treatments - to get over her addiction, like Sirius needs help after a decade spent among dementors, with Harry visiting both. She might have regular "sessions" even into the next school year.

Would only hope you would weave in some obvious signs to the reader that they are interested in each other while they remained oblivious. How does Hermione miss Harry as she is sucked into the time turner? Where does she feel most lonely. What smells make her feel happy or sad about her choices.

** I'm less critical than BigFatNo except for one thing: why doesn't Dumbledore explain the facts to McGonagall? It's not plausible that she'd be under oaths to report things to the Ministry, and it's not like she's Umbridge. I can see them agreeing on a token punishment, because they did break into a teacher's office and she had an addiction problem, but that's it.

Focus on your characters and make sure they have plausible reasons for their choices, even mistakes.

** I like the overall idea. However, since Harry has a thing about authority figures, I think he may attempt to covertly ask Lupin for advice regarding his concerns about a friend, rather than going to his head of house because he eventually builds up a sort of trust with Lupin.

Lupin has probably noticed something peculiar about Hermione as well (and it would be fun if they both suspected the other of something nefarious) and after some investigation, brings it to Professor McGonagall's attention. I think that McGonagall would definitely handle the detentions and disappointment the way you say she would. However, she'd definitely be in the know about Sirius since she's an Order member and all.

I like the H/Hr relationship and it sounds like the narrative will give the origin of it a very organic feel. Are you planning on making this a "shipping" fanfic or are you continuing the series but changing it based on H/Hr endgame? I'm just asking because this has the potential to be about more than just the relationship aspect and I love fics that change the world based on a just a few tweaks.

Oh and I think it would be adorable if Sirius makes a comment about how Harry shares the same good taste in women as his father 😍.

** Too much hand waving is needed to create an arbitrary situation for the two to grow closer together. The time-turner addiction could be interesting I guess, but only for the fact that Hermione is already 10 months older than Harry. Bu the time the year is done, taking three extra classes and whatever "extra time" she wants to put herself far ahead, she could be over a year older than them, physically older than some of the fourth years even.

But, as others have said, I don't buy the situation with McGonagall and Dumbledore at all. You essentially have McGonagall undermining Dumbledore for no other reason than for Plot Reasons, despite all evidence in canon suggesting that she wouldn't act that way at all.

So, I'd say it's way too convoluted of a setup just to make a random Harry/Hermione story.

fascinating premise here but it will have to be written just right to keep your reader from throwing up their hands and dropping it.

Harry finding out about it before Hermione realizes it by watching the Map.. Hermione splitting off and into multiple Hermione(s) and Harry watching what is going on, figuring it out for himself..

** I liked it up until the point of rescuing Sirius.

I think the addiction part of the time turner is really good, and you could definitely make a lot of stories about that, like this one for example.

You can really make it a Stephen King-like story, where after a slow build-up of Hermione becoming confused about the rules and seeing her past self in the distance etc, her past self sees her future self do something, and she's so insane from the addiction, lack of sleep and too much time-travelling, she kills her future self. From then on, it becomes a bit like Groundhog Day, where she has to constantly try and alter the timeline, so that nothing bad happens.

Back to your plot: after the time-turner is confiscated, it's just a build-up towards Harry and Hermione getting together, so the plot becomes weird. Why doesn't Dumbledore just tell McGonagall that Sirius is innocent? That way Hermione escapes punishment. Also, Ron cheering about having a date while Harry hasn't and Hermione isn't allowed to attend? Doesn't sound very Ron-like.

I know it's fanfic, so you can be very liberal with the universe and its characters, but I don't really like the plot, apart from the time-turner addiction.

Sorry for not being more positive :/

*** Criticism read and understood. Here an alternative, deviating after they stole the time turner from McGonegall's office:

--------------

Stealing the time-turner took a bit longer than anticipated, and Hermione and Harry are running out of time. It appears as if they won't have enough time to first rescue buckbeak and then Sirius, and they are getting desperate.\\
At this point Hermione remembers something seemingly unimportant: she once borrowed a book from the library that was already taken by someone else by simply remembering the instruction for her future self to borrow the book in the future and place it near her bed, exactly at this time where she wants to borrow it. As long as she hasn't experienced it yet, she could potentially force something to happen by simply creating the intention, as long as she remembers to set up the requirements for it to happen at a later point in time and as long as she closes the loop.

She convinces Harry to give up on rescuing buckbeak, instead they'll run near the place sirius is being kept. There they find buckbeak, unharmed. They climb onto buckbeak, rescue sirius and let him escape with buckbeak - now they have to close the loop.\\
They use the time turner, travel back a bit (as long as the not completely refilled turner allows at this point), rescue buckbeak and place him at the position where hermione intended to find him the first time in the loop: near sirius' cell.

This experience of actively being able to shape the future through the means of intention hit Hermione deeply, and she thinks of setting up various experiments with it - but sadly she won't be able to actually do them, as she has to return the time turner before McGonegall finds out.

Walking back to McGonegall's office, she realizes that McGonegall is in her office, searching her desk for the time turner. Hermione panicks, fearing that McGonegall finding out about her stealing the time turner would result in her expulsion. Just before McGonegall can open the drawer in which the time turner is supposed to lay, Hermione creates the intention to soon travel back in time using the time turner, and store it there before McGonegall can realize that it was gone.

The drawer is opened, and the turner is within, McGonegall non-the-wiser. Sadly this doesn't make the situation any easier for Hermione, as McGonegall mentions that the time turner will be returned to the department of mysteries, now that noone is actively using it.

Hermione, still somewhat addicted to the turner and now filled with the determination to experiment with the idea of intention and shaping the future, wants to prevent that from happening.

After leaving McGonegall's office, she again travels back in time, takes Harry's cloak, enters McGonegall's office and places the turner in the drawer.

Just as she's finished with that, McGonegall enters the office, and Hermione only barely manages to hide herself in a corner below the cloak. She sees herself standing in the door, McGonegall telling the story of how the time turner will be brought back into the department of mysteries, and sees herself leave. But McGonegall doesn't simply put the time turner back into the drawer, instead she puts the time turner into a special box, which she seal with an incredibly advanced spell, one that no simply alohomora could hope to open, as if expecting Hermione to actually try to steal the thing. Afterwards she leaves the office.

Hermione now has a problem, she has no idea how to open this box, nor does she have a time-turner to create the time to learn about the spell before the time-turner is removed from the castle.

Desperate, she tries the trick with the intention one more time - she wishes to find a working time turner and a book detailing the spell in a different drawer in McGonegall's office.

To her surprise the trick works - but not completely. The time turner looks a bit different than the one she had before, and instead of a book there is only a letter, addressed to herself.

She opens the letter and recognizes her own handwriting.

"Dear younger me.

The experiments are amazing, we can achieve so much more with this idea, can shape the future so much further than we could ever have imagined. But the time will come where you realize the true cost of it. For you, the time where you will learn about the cost is now, but you will only understand the cost much later.

Every intention, every wish you create, is a burden for your future self. Like a loan at a bank, it creates a debt, that creates relief for your current situation. But unlike a loan, you won't know the interest until you've paid it.

Take this time turner as an example. It's not the one from McGonegall's desk. We didn't manage to find the spell in time, I had to get creative, find a different solution, so I could close this loop. And maybe it's my fault that you don't really apprecicate how dangerous this little of yours is yet. You only see the result, the clue that not only your idea is working, but you can't see who the person is who sent it back.

You expect this all to work so easy, since the time turner can't go back further than 24 hours anyway. But you underestimate your own ingenuity, and at the same time you overestimate it. You added more layers to this than you could manage, you took more loans of the future than you could pay, and now I'm paying the price.

Three months. In three months you will write this letter. And you will stumble over the debts of your past and go so much deeper than you ever asked for.

Be afraid, be very afraid, because this addiction of ours will not only give but also cost you precious time. But most important of all, it might cost you your friendships to both Harry and Ron. Try to salvage what there is to salvage, and try to prevent the mistakes that I made, even though it's futile.

Because I know I tried."

Hermione is shocked over the contents of the letter, and leaves the office without even taking another look at the original time turner, she just puts on the new one and leaves.

What could this letter mean, what could go so wrong that she would work several months on rectifying a mistake she apparently made?

The longer she thinks about it, the better she starts to understand the problem: she now has a time turner she doesn't even know the origin of, but with the limit of 24 hours travel, she can only assume that she has to create a chain of intentions that connect her to her future self - meaning she has to intent to collect the time turner from her next-day-self for three whole months, while using the time to find out where she could possibly get one from, until her three months into the future self can close the loop by handing the letter and turner back through the chain.

What worries her even more though is that even with trying she apparently almost destroyed her friendships.

In the next months she spends half her time trying to find out where the time turner came from (her intentions of receiving a letter from a future self for possible hints don't work for some reason, she soon decides that this is probably to prevent creating even more time-debt) and the other half trying to spend more time with Harry and Ron.

Ron and her continue to bicker about every stupid little thing, but Harry she tells about the time turner (but not about the letter detailing that she might destroy their friendship). She feels guilty for not allowing Ron in on the secret, but justifies it by saying that she also wouldn't have told Harry about it if he hadn't known about time turners already.

Together they try to lift the secret of the origin of the time turner, with many obstacles happening along the way. During their time researching together, Hermione notices that her friendship with Ron already started to deterriorate, because he senses that his other two friends are keeping secrets from him. Worried, she decreases the amount of time spent on research, so she can spent more time together with both of them, something Harry appreciates. But eventually even that is not enough, and Ron confronts her and Harry about their behaviour, and she confesses of owning a time turner. Ron is angry about being kept in the dark and being considered 'untrustworthy' (he assumes she didn't tell him because he would tell everyone about her secret), while she is afraid of him forcing her to overuse the turner even more (e.g. getting the test results before the test is written, so Ron can slack off, something that would theoretically be possible, but would make her chain of transporting the letter and time turner into the past even more complicated).

Harry defends her by saying that he also didn't know about it until he had to safe Sirius, and that he only kept the secret because he wanted to pay her back for helping him out.

Ron is angry, but ultimatively forgives them both in exchange for using the turner from time to time to turn a prank of Fred and George back on them.

The end of the year is getting close, and the chain into the future reaches way into the holidays, and Hermione is getting afraid, because her friendship with Ron and Harry is stronger than ever. The idea of losing them both is driving her insane, she has nightmares about driving them away almost every night.

**** The last day of school, Hermione is still worried out of her mind, when she receives a huge package at breakfast. She doesn't have time to open it, so she takes it onto the train. In the compartment she finally opens them, within are dozens of letters, one addressed to herself, the others simply with continuous numbers on them.

She opens the letter and sees that it's another letter from her future self, instructing her to give the remaining letters to Harry, without reading them. Both her and Harry are confused, but they know better than to question the ideas of their future selves, so they just go with it.

At the first day home, Hermione finds an identical package on her bed, together with one additional letter. In this letter her future self instructs her to not only continue reaching the original letter and time turner back through the chain, but this time to also travel back in time together with her owl to before breakfast, and send the package to herself using her owl, so that her version at hogwarts can receive this package from home. She is further instructed to from now on establish a second chain back in time, which makes sure that this package with the instruction-letter ends up sitting on her bed on the day she arrives from Hogwarts.

The reason become apparent sooner than later - Dumbledore invites Hermione into the Order of the Phoenix and instructs her to refrain from sending letters to Harry, isolating him completely. Hermione realizes that this would've been one of those events that could've possibly broken her friendship to Harry, who would've waited for letters all summer, receiving none without any explanation to why.

From this day on, Hermione writes one letter every day about the situation in the order, marking the letter with continuous numbers, and adding them to the package arriving from further on in the time-chain. Knowing that Harry has already received his letters for the holiday in the train compartment eases her worries.

Meanwhile Harry experiences one of the worst summers of his life, and only the letters of Hermione, who somehow went through the immense headache that is meddling with time just to deliver him some mail, keep him from going insane.

He writes letters to Hermione as well but refrains from sending them, now knowing that they would all never reach their destination on the orders of Dumbledore.

With nothing better to do, he writes these letters, discards them and writes them again, as they won't reach their destination for quite a while, he has all the time in the world when it comes to refine his normally less-than-stellar writing.

This however doesn't take up nearly as much time as he had hoped, and so he tries to continue his research on the whole time-travel-issue that Hermione is still doing, but since he doesn't have any magical books at hand, it mostly ends with either him reading muggle science fiction, or him fantasizing about sitting across Hermione in the Hogwarts library and somehow contributing to her far too difficult to understand loop and chain theories.

Hermione meanwhile is slowly becoming insane. Not only has she to upkeep two seperate time-chains, she also has to help with some order business, has to try to upkeep her friendship with Ron (who already has forgotten about the time turners apart from the times he wants to use it to take revenge on the twins) and prevent the rest of the order from finding out that she owns (and possibly stole for all she knows) a time turner. It doesn't help that the third month is rapidly approaching, and she still doesn't have a clue on what will cause the friendship between her and the others to end.

With Ron already being dealt with (since she can simply keep the friendship alive from her everyday dealing with him in the order) she focuses all her efforts and thoughts on Harry, whom she expects to lose first ("what if the letters weren't enough", etc.).

The holidays end, Harry arrives at the order headquarters, and Hermione is happy to see that their friendship isn't destroyed (it seems even stronger than before, she isn't sure about the reason for that however). Harry is happy to help her get back into the research, and even goes as far as to sometimes brush some stupid suggestions of Ron aside, which he normally would only be too happy to go along with. She doesn't know how rough the past few weeks really felt for Harry, and how much her letters meant to him.

Not until he gives her his own letters. As she reads the letters, she starts to realize that Harry might feel more for her than just friendship, the incredible effort (for Harry's standards) that were put into the letter being a big clue (from Hermione's perspective, she doesn't know that Harry just literally didn't have anything better to do). And as she reads and overanalyzes the letters, the solution to her problem flashes in her brain. The way to end a friendship without it hurting. The way forward.

She would advance their relationship, to break it off.

Of course, the quick idea doesn't mean she jumps to implement it immediatelly, as it definitely means reconsidering Harry from a perspective she never chose before, but she also doesn't disregard it completely.

Days pass, which Hermione now spends both researching and being distracted from researching by Harry sitting across from her, and the third month comes to an end - no time turner in sight.

Hermione still doesn't have the slightest clue on where to get a time turner, and while she thinks her advancing-the-relationship-idea of being the one her future self meant when writing the letter, she isn't too sure, as the month is almost over, and it seems impossible to change their relationship that quickly.

That's when she (for the first time in a long while) uses her intention to ask her future self to establish yet another chain (the letter-package-chain being completed by her writing the last letter the day before Harry arrived) to give her a hint towards how to get the time turner.

And when a letter really arrives, she is incredibly happy. Until she reads it.

"Hello younger me.

I see you are caving in under the pressure. The debt established, so big, no end in sight, no idea how to pay it off. How could I have done anything but ask for another loan, to help me with my struggle?

Do you remember the first letter? When I wrote that you would learn about the debt, but only understand it later?

I think the time is now, to reveal what I meant.

You failed.

You failed to pay off the debt in three months and you caved in. You paid the debt with borrowed time from your future selves, you handed forward a time turner that you didn't find, and together with it, a letter in which you warned your younger self about these mistakes you made, so that you wouldn't repeat them.

The time to write this letter is now.

Write it, tell your younger self how she has three months of time, how she has such a huge debt before her, and how she doesn't yet understand how hard it'll be to pay off that debt, no matter how many hours she will spend on researching and keeping her friendships together.

Hah, the friendships ending! I was a fool, almost destroying my friendship with Ron and Harry by keeping them out of it, not telling them, not sharing my secrets, if not for those words written down, it would surely have ended that way.

I know what you feel. Betrayed? Given a task impossible to complete? But betrayed by whom? It was yourself after all who burdened you with this task, and it is you who now burdens me for a second time.

Your friendship with Harry and Ron, they will not end, far from it, not if you keep up the work and effort you learned to give out during the last months. You have seen what they are willing to do for you, if you only return the effort they put into this friendship of yours.

Now trust them. Trust them to help you with your task, your debt, don't make the mistake of not trusting them a second time, or your friendship will break under this pressure just like you will break under the task ahead if you insist on walking alone.

You will find that the time turner is still there, next to your bed, that the chain isn't broken yet.

And this time.

This time you don't have three months.

But a whole year.

Use the time wisely."

***** Holy moly, that's complicated! I think I like it, though. The whole idea of being addicted to time-travelling is great, and your plot is definitely going the right way. The part where Hermione plans her relationship with Harry and Ron is great, shows how much she's caving in.

I think you need more settings than Hogwarts and Grimmauld Place, though. Maybe incorporate more of London?

Also, if you really want to further complicate things, add a new enemy, like a time-travel police force that ruthlessly squashes down any holes in time and any people who are playing too much with the fabric of time.

I imagine it would be very, very hard to write, though: planning multiple overlapping stable time loops may be easier for you than it would be for Hermione, but still...

Also, there was this bit:

#+begin_quote
  The reason become apparent sooner than later - Dumbledore invites Hermione into the Order of the Phoenix and instructs her to refrain from sending letters to Harry, isolating him completely.
#+end_quote

I don't know if you are conscious of this when you planned it, but I feel compelled to point out that the notion that Dumbledore forbid Ron and Hermione from communicating with Harry in the summer before OotP is very common and very bashy (and downright destructive to the fandom, IMO) fanon, which is explicitly contradicted by canon. Harry's friends wrote to Harry, and Harry wrote back. What /did/ frustrate Harry to no end was that their letters told him little about current events and OotP activities. This, while deeply unpleasant to Harry, was probably the right thing to do given the circumstances: it is a very bad idea to send actionable intelligence over an easily intercepted medium to someone with a mental link of then-unknown nature to the greatest Legilimens alive. (And, that the good guys knew about the link was, in and of itself, an important secret.)

With that out of the way, why /would/ Dumbledore induct Hermione into the Order all of a sudden? Hermione is very smart and capable, but she is, fundamentally, a fifth-year who is only somewhat ahead of the curriculum, but can't even use a wand outside of Hogwarts. What could she do for the order that would be worth the risks it would bring? Now, if he did come to know about her continuing time-turning adventures, he might have had a use for her: after two years of using a time-turner in complex and unsafe ways, she would probably have more experience messing with time than anyone alive.

That would be my suggestion: suppose that Dumbledore knows about her time problems and does what he can to help, but there is only so much he can do, especially because Hermione is already balancing on the edge of paradox at all times, and the more she tells others about the future, the greater the risk of tipping over. At the same time, Dumbledore occasionally asks her to mess with time for Order business. So now, that's another set of secrets she has to keep from Harry, which is going to strain their friendship.

***** Happy cake day!

Holy shit this is complicated. But it's *brilliant*. Absolutely BRILLIANT. You /need/ to write this into a full-fledged fic.
