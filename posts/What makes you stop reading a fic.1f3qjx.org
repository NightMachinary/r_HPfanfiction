I've reading a lot lately and have dropped a considerable number of fics.

Some reason for me are

1. OOC without explanation. Ex. Making Dumbledore an Idiot/racist/bigoted with no real reason at all, I liked HPMOR Dumbledore but disliked Harry Crow's Dumbledore so much that it made me drop it.

2. Overpowered Harry without a good reason Ex. Giving Harry Extreme powers like A patronus that can kills Dementors, Making him the champion of Hogwarts. a big glaring example is Learning to breathe

3. Plotholes/Not doing research Ex. Having people apparate in or out of hogwarts, Having kids using magic before attending hogwarts and not being chased by Aurors for underage magic. I mean if you are writing something on this universe at least follow the rules.

4. Making Non cannon pairing without an explanation of why My prefered pairings are cannon (except for Neville and Luna these two should have ended together) but i do enjoy reading no-canon if they are well writen, bonus points if they include some sub-plot/love triangle with the other canon character.

What makes you drop a fan fiction?


** The first turnoff for me in a fic is bad grammar or a lack of mastery of basic English. I cannot handle randomly capitalized words or misused homophones or the worst thing possible in a fic: excessive or inappropriately used slang. I'm more forgiving of occasional spelling errors or an incorrectly placed comma, but when cool or awesome or swag or fetch (still NOT happening, Gretchen) appears in a description, I'm abandoning the story immediately.

The next thing that may cause me to ditch a story is dialogue. That slang thing I mentioned before also can be a huge problem in dialogue--especially with the use of American slang. These characters are British. If you aren't familiar with British expressions then don't use them. But you cannot expect me to believe that Harry Potter would call Ginny a "hot chick." Stilted dialogue is also a concern. It's very apparent when writers cannot write a conversation; it comes off as stiff and robotic and forced. Ugh.

The third problem I occasionally encounter is overly attractive physical descriptions of characters. I usually don't like reading stories where Hermione Granger has silky caramel tresses that cascade down her back and a heart shaped face with soft almond eyes. Hermione wasn't a babe, people. You can make her attractive if you'd like, but for me that makes it automatically AU. What's even worse is when every character in the story is described as shockingly attractive. If you're writing smut, go for it. If you're writing a story with a plot not based on sex, I'm going to frown upon your descriptions of super!hot characters.

The fourth problem is poorly written smut. I can't stand reading some Fifty Shades style smut. Awkward phrasing or descriptions that turn into a list of actions are not pleasant to read.

I think I'm a picky reader.

*** I agree with all your points completely. I especially hate poorly written fanfics. If you didn't bother to run spellcheck, why should I bother to read your story? And please proofread for grammatical and spelling errors!

I also hate when authors try to write "fancy" instead of writing well. It's a common mistake made by younger writers in all genres. Or writers who think that's the way to write. Also, if a writer relies on sexual scenes to keep the story going. I prefer the hint of that sort of stuff rather than porn-like descriptions.

British dialogue may be tricky for most American fanfic writers, but the best stories have British slang. At the very least, no American slang is a plus, even if it's not very British.

** This is very nit-picky of me but gets me to drop a fic almost immeadiatly is when an author changes Harry's name to Harrison, either to make his namesound more pureblood or whatever, it breaks the whole thing for me. His name is Harry, if you want to cange it make it Harold or Henry(both are shortened/changed to Harry).

Another is just unrepentant bashing of characters, I enjoy a Dumbledore that does what he thinks is right for the greater good but regrets teh choices he makes, what I do not enjoy is a Dumbledore that apparently was setting up Harry to be a saccrificial lamb. Another bashing that makes me shake my head and stop is when they turn Ron from a jealous friend to cursing Harry bhind the back for whatever reason, I remember reading one fic where Ron hits him with a crucio in a mock duel infront of dozens of people.

Admitidly I have read stories all the way when it happens but I still dislike reading it is during fic set in GOF they have griffindor entirly turn on Harry and strip him of his house and such and excommunicate him. The example at the forefront of my mind is The Lie I've Lived where they get a censure against him I believe and they expect him to forgive them. This is probbaly the biggest thing that gets me is when people who should believe in Harry shun and disbeleive him with no proof, that was the first nail in the coffin for me when I read Not the Only Red Head.

*** My response to the gay thing is that sexuality for teenage boys/girls is rarely a straight line...there usually is some sort of sexual experimentation, even if its just a kiss, and sometimes that can develop into a denial of the physical sex and instead turn into a focus on the person themselves. However, as i said, its rare and a writer would have to demonstrate the confusion of Harry pretty well for me to believe it.

** Many have already been mentioned, but here are the main things that get me to stop:

1- Grammar/spelling. Careless formatting (e.g. " hey harry" said Hermione). If the writing does not flow nicely and feels stiff. If dialogue is robotic/too formal, not the way people normally speak to one another. If the author constantly confuses THEY'RE/THEIR/THERE! Nicknames. OOC characters (especially Snape).

2- PACE! If it's going so slow that several chapters have passed without anything actually happening, I'll discontinue reading it.

3- Everything described with emphasis on the physical/physically attractive. I can live with honey-coloured eyes or whatever, but the moment someone has kissable lips, I'm outta there!!

4- If it's an AU (be it a redo fic/time travel/sorting in a different house/other major difference) and yet THE SAME EXACT EVENTS/DIALOGUE occur! If I wanted to read canon events, I would read the books!

5- Excessive violence, especially Harry getting abused. I know some people enjoy the graphic descriptions of his ribs getting broken and his body getting bruised all over, and I don't mind it in moderation, but once it becomes one of the main themes of the story, I find it boring.

6- If Ginny is a main character (ha).

7- If it's full of clich√©s. It's boring if I've seen it all before (be it plot, reactions to situations, reactions to characters (e.g. Hermione time travel fic, where the moment she sees Tom, she finds him handsome but all his smiles, that look genuine to everyone else, are actually fake. She can see right through him all the way to his inherent evilness. She hates him, and can hardly keep the hate out of her eyes when she looks at him. /snores/))

8- If it's a redo fic/Harry gets adopted/new family type thing, and the there's the dreaded shopping chapters. NOTHING is more boring to me than these shopping chapters. Harry gets to buy the whole new wardrobe with formal dress robes (of course) from madam malkin's, then gets the special trunk with hidden compartments that's really expensive, get a ****ton of books, because man, he just wants to learn EVERYTHING about the wizarding world, gets the manor (sometimes Potter Manor), etc etc. Oh and the Gringotts chapter, booooring.

9- Time travel where nothing from the timeline can be changed. The reason I'm reading time travel is because I want to see changes damnit! But I realize it's a personal preference.

10- If traded insults/barbs are lame. It's an art I tell you, not everyone can pull it off.

There's probably more, but that's all I remember for now. I'm very, VERY picky with my fanfics...

**** Yes. It's the detail that's tedious to me. Going into every store and describing the character buying obvious things (or unrealistic items that are way too expensive and tend to be the same in every fic, e.g. bottomless pouch/bag, trunk with hidden compartments, 1000 books on everything, dragon-hide armour, weapons of different descriptions, an illegal wand that has an unusual core, etc).

I've read it over and over and over and if the fic spends too much time on that, I'll try to skim and skip these paragraphs. But then the pacing issues tend to crop up, because the author feels like the Diagon Alley sequence can last 2-3 chapters.

** Your example in 2 is the exact reason I dropped HPMOR. That made me so annoyed. Although I can generally put up with overpowered Harry to an extent since most fanfics write him as overpowered compared to the books so it's very difficult to avoid, but I think it's crazy to have a young Harry with nearly no experience nearly on the same level with Dumbledore and Voldemort without some reason (ie, future Harry with years of experience is in his old body).

OOCness is definitely a huge one. I actually didn't like HPMOR Dumbledore and I don't really like extremely manipulative Dumbledore in most fanfics (although I'll usually keep reading if the good things in the story outweigh it). I think Dumbledore wasn't perfect, but that overall he generally cared about people and so I don't like where he is basically another Voldemort in terms of how he treats the people that work for him. I also hate in Harry has a twin fanfics how James and Lily completely ignore Harry or abuse him- I mean that is clearly unlikely based on their personalities.

Similar to that, I don't like fanfics that bash characters in general. I prefer HarryxHermione, so I often see this with Ron since many of them will make him a huge prat, more so than he is compared to the books.

I also don't like huge age gap pairings, which is why I usually avoid Snape or Remus or Sirius x Hermione fanfics and similar pairings. I'm not a fan of incest either. I don't mind slash though as long as it's written nicely.

Bad grammar or spelling or something like that will also make me drop a fic. I'm more likely to read a well-written fanfic with a ridiculous plotline than the opposite.

I dislike fanfics set in the Marauders time period that will add an additional Marauder that was there the entire time yet never mentioned in the books for whatever reason. Or when Lily happens to have 3 friends that are basically girl versions of Sirius, Remus, and Peter and then pair up with them. I don't like when fanfics basically exclude or write Peter as one of the worst people ever either- if he was that horrible and they all secretly hated him, then he wouldn't have ever been made secret keeper.

This is pretty nit-picky, but I also don't like when the authors add nicknames that were never there in the books, primarily Hermione becoming "Mione." I wouldn't drop a fic solely because of this, but when combined with some of the others then I would drop it.

** Misspelling character names is the *biggest* thing for me.

I can't remember the title of the fic but by the end of the 5th paragraph, Hermione's, Ginny's, McGonagall's and Tonks' names have all been butchered. HERMOINE? MCGONALL? GINERVA? REALLY? (not just once my dear people, several times in one sentence). It wasn't even a parody...

** I /rarely/ stop reading fics. I have slogged all the way through dozens of mediocre fics because I hate giving up on anything mid-read. I can only recall a few times that I've actually given up. Some of the reasons I can recall:

1. Portraying unhealthy relationships as healthy. I'll read light stories about lovely fairy-tale romance, and I'll read dark stories about dysfunctional relationships, but I /cannot stand/ stories where the partners are violent and abusive and then giggle and wave off their explosive hostility as a mere spat. It's just sickening and makes me worry that the author can't recognize an abusive relationship even when /they're/ the one imagining it.

2. Seemingly written by a immature teenager. A lot of good stuff /is/ written by teenagers, but if I can just /look/ at a story and /tell/ that the author has the mindset of that notorious breed of OMG IM SO RADNUM LOL SPORKS!!1! thirteen-year-old, I lose all hope.

3. Ships without warning. Find a fic, nice writing, looks good, reading, reading, hooked on the story, then suddenly -- /Harmony/. Really? How hard can it possibly be to include a note in the story summary? Here, let me try: /H/Hr/. Wow, that was, like, four entire characters.

4. Stilted dialogue. I like complicated sentence structures and big words and the like as much as anyone, but those things aren't supposed to be found in /dialogue/. Humans don't talk like that. Use a contraction or something for fuck's sake.

Even when I encounter some of these things, though, I'm pretty forgiving. I can usually find some redeeming qualities in a fic that encourage me to continue reading. It's really only when issues stack up that I throw up my hands and walk away.

**** There are certain ships that I can't take seriously, that involve characters I dislike, or that I just get grossed out by for one reason or another. I'm sure the same can be said for most people, whether they dislike pairings in general but enjoy one or two, or whether they enjoy all ships with only one or two exceptions. It's common decency for an author to indicate that there will be romance in the story so that any reader who dislikes the ship won't invest a few hours into reading only to be confronted with a relationship they never signed up for.

Think of ships as akin to genres. You might enjoy comedy and adventure, but dislike horror. It would be similar to reading something tagged as "comedy," but which gets darker and darker as you read until it has essentially become a horror story with a few funny elements and you're sitting there like "what the hell is this?" It's not that the story is necessarily /bad/, just that it's not what you wanted and it feels like you were tricked. Doesn't really matter how well it's written -- it's just not to your taste. I mean, even if an author can make something like Dudley/Snape/Millicent totally believable, I'm still not interested, in the same way that some authors write amazing Muggle AUs which I never read because I am not interested in Muggle AUs. Everyone can write what they will, but properly labeling ships, genres, ratings, warnings, etc. is just the polite thing to do.

**** Sorry, just have to comment on this, even though you said this days ago.

You say, that Snape is capable of love and use Lily as an example. We never know if he truly loved Lily at all. We knew he desired her, and was obsessed with her, but never that he truly loved her. We only have his word for that. The reason I am questioning this, is because none of his actions shows us that he truly loved her.

We know that he called her a mudblood because she attempted to help him when he had just been humiliated. This tells us 1) that snape does not want pity, and/or being taken care of, even if it his best friend. 2) not even years of friendship can make him forget/go against the pureblood ideas put forward. He should have known and believed, that there was nothing wrong with being muggleborn if his best friend was beating everyone, but instead he makes her 'an exception to the rule'.

Lily had tried convincing Snape that he was walking a path that truly let to evil. She commented on his deeds, his friends, and everything that the wanna-be death-eater cherished. But he never listened. I'm sorry, but I just don't see him truly loving her, if he doesn't even listen to her arguments. What the hell kind of relationship is that?

In the end, I fail to see how his 'love' or desire for Harry's mother suddenly makes Snape do a 180 and help him out/become a father figure. He never changed to even remotely appease Lily, but he suddenly does it because Harry pops up? Snape is a cruel man with a bad history, and I truly dislike stories that change the whole character so that he fits their view of the man. What is it about him that people like? That he kept on thinking about 1 woman after she's been dead for 17 years?

** Well, I kind of disagree about some of your reasons. (I do understand that preference doesn't necessarily go along with logic though).

1. Dumbledore in canon is obviously either an idiot, evil, manipulative, or all three.

First Year The trials in Harry's first year to protect the stone are beaten by a group of first years. The only dangerous one of them is Fluffy. Fluffy is right there, easily accessible to many young students. Dumbledore said that students shouldn't go there, but any good educator would know that that would cause students to want to go there.

Second Year: Really, Dumbledore couldn't have said anything in front of the school to defend Harry.

Third Year: You give a young girl access to time travel. So she can do extra classes. Really... That's stupid.

Fourth Year: Dumbledore couldn't do ANYTHING to remove Harry from the tournament? Not just declare it a draw magically (have simple tasks that can be done in 5 minutes) and hold the tournament without the goblet. And there was really no way for Harry to back out. Really?

Fifth Year: Dumbledore is an idiot. He's not convincing anyone, so why doesn't he just say that Voldemort hasn't returned and plan in some other way?

Sixth Year: It takes a year to teach something that they could have done in a day or two.

Through out the whole story as well, he leaves Harry in Privet Drive to be protected by bloodwards even when Voldemort has Harry's blood. Sirius doesn't get a trial from the group of people that could give him a trial. Dumbledore leads that group. He allows Binns to teach.

He says that everyone should get a second chance. That's a great idea. But in a war situation it DOESN'T WORK. You can't just do that. You have to kill. It's a necessity in war.

He allows Snape to teach at a school. To get your potions NEWT you have to do well in his class, which he makes impossible for non-Slytherins. A potions NEWT is required for both a healing job and a job as an Auror.

1. I agree with you on this. Unless you have a good reason/explanation, OP Harry is annoying.

2. There can be legitimate reasons for many things.

Hermione does magic before Hogwarts but doesn't get punished. Evidently you can do magic before Hogwarts.

We don't know how the Goblet worked so we should assume that there was no other option than to continue with the tournament. I consed this point but only because Goblet of fire has more plot holes that i can count.

  Sirius doesn't get a trial from the group of people that could give him a trial. Dumbledore leads that group.
#+end_quote

Just after Voldemort is gone, Dumbledore believed Sirius was a traitor who sold his best friends. aurors captured sirius and threw him to azkaban wihtout even thinking about a trial. Dumbledore probably was notified that Sirius was the traitor when he was already in a cell in azkaban. (on PoS Hagrid mentions that Sirius Black lent him his motorcycle, not McGonagall nor Dumbledore bat an eye to this)

#+begin_quote
  He allows Snape to teach at a school. To get your potions NEWT you have to do well in his class, which he makes impossible for non-Slytherins. A potions NEWT is required for both a healing job and a job as an Auror.
#+end_quote

Tonks is a Hufflepuff who was taught by Snape and is an Auror not imposible just really hard. Dumbledore is more concerned with the evil wizard Snape is Spying on for him than whatever some students pass or not their NEWTs. he needs Snape in a position where he is a valuable 'spy' for Voldemort

Now, Dumbledore is a really hard to write right character, he is not only a genius he is wise, manipulative but no evil. he has the best interest but is capable of doing some thing one would think make no sense. he also has plots over plots over plots, he doesn't share.

I Hate when the character is flanderized instead of being a wise mentor willing to manipulate other 'for the greater good' he becomes an Manipulative bastard willing to use anyone as a chess piece to reach his goals without any qualms.

Or have harry (who for whatever reason now is more intelligent and powerful than him) leaving him speechless after a little crappy discourse the writer came up while taking a shit or something.

Dumbledore is not perfect in anyway (as he said in DH) but he is an interesting character that if written well can take a fic from mediocre to good.

  Hermione does magic before Hogwarts but doesn't get punished. Evidently you can do magic before Hogwarts.

  Hermione Granger also admitted to successfully trying out "a few simple spells" just prior to her First year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[3], but, apparently, she never received any notification that this was banned, even though, as a Muggle-born witch, it is unlikely that there were any other wizards or witches in her vicinity, whom the Ministry could have believed cast the magic instead. However, this is probably because the Ministry does not monitor pre-Hogwarts students, as their magic is normally uncontrollable. This may, however, indicate that the Trace is actually put in place after students begin formal learning.

Yeah... no. 1) I still fail to see Snape as a redeemable character. He is a bastard and a bully to young children and everyone who complains gets told, that Dumbledore just doesn't care. Because he believes in Snape. We know he relays information to Dumbledore, but also that he relays information to Voldemort. We have no idea what information he has given Dumbledore, but we do know, that he has several times put both students, the order and Harry at risk. Prime example being Dumbledore's painting telling Snape to make a plan involving 6 Potters and divulge the information to Voldemort, for which Mad-Eye died. He is a character used to create friction and a sense of forboding and intrigue, but as a person he is horrible man.

2) Draco. Yeah... so leading death-eaters in to Hogwarts is a good thing? What did Draco do to make you think of him as being worthy of forgiveness? That he ran from the final battle? Balderdash...

3) Lupin. There was nothing to forgive... he had an affliction and Dumbledore saw beyond that. 4) Hagrid. Well he was set up by Tom Riddle, but they didn't believe Dumbledore when he told people the 'truth'.

** Non-canon plots and plot elements, especially the major deviations.

I like stories that are about the characters from the books, not some new interpretation of what coulda'/woulda'/shoulda' that changes everything you ever thought or knew about Harry Potter. Give me the canon events through a new POV or pick up after DH and unfog the future and I'm just happy as a clam.

I'm not saying you can't do a little shipping or whatever little changes to canon that you feel are best for your story, I'm just saying that when I read stories where Sirius is still alive and teaching DADA to young James Potter, I'm closing the window and moving on.

As for AU...I just can't. It always feels like one of those cheesy cartoons where the Harlem Globetrotters show up for an episode and help our hero solve a mystery/fight evildoers/win an important basketball game.

**** I think the whole 'beyond the veil' thing is pretty interesting but this reminds me of another fanfic characteristic that always annoys me.

I call it The Secretly Enormous World of Sirius Black. This is where Sirius goes off without the Marauders (LOL) and forms all of these relationships with OCs and takes his own little adventure. There is ALWAYS an ex-girlfriend who really /understands/ Sirius and his struggle and helps him on his adventure just in time to boomerang back in the last 3-4 chapters and help Harry defeat Voldemort/ see James and Lily die.

Not saying your friend has a bad story, I only read one chapter and skimmed a few more, but I imagine a lot of people in this topic have read The Secretly Enormous World of Sirius Black at least a dozen times and feel my pain.

** There are a lot of reason why I suddenly stop reading a fanfic, but even more reasons why I chose not to start reading a particular story.

- I'll never read a story where Snape is considered a good person. There are so many reasons why I won't that I can write page after page addressing this. However in essence, it is completely out of character. If you use canon characters, make them act canon. Side note: If you want a good Draco it takes years for him to change. You can't just have him change his viewpoints and everything that makes Draco the Draco that he is in a couple of chapters.

- Main character slash. I have nothing against homosexuals, but I just don't want to read about slash. Especially if it is a canon character that has never shown any signs of it. I have no problems with it, if you have a gay couple on the side or something like that, but it needs to make sense. Don't just make Sirius and Remus a couple just because they didn't get with Lily and you didn't want to invent new characters for their partners.

- Overly powerful Harry. At least give me a reason. In the fic I am writing I am making him powerful, but slowly. After a full 1 and a half years of training starting at year 3 he will be able to compete with most adults wizards who don't focus on fighting. But having him suddenly turn around and best people who have trained for 20 years more than him at the very least? No.

- Soul bonds etc. No, just no. If you want to write a romance novel or something, then you should probably learn what makes a relationship instead of just having them instantly connect. I really like the Harry/Fleur pairing, but having them suddenly become bond mates is just stupid. Give them a reason. Also, she is a quarter veela, not full. Even if there was such a thing as mates (seriously, stop writing as if she is an animal) then she would probably not be able to do it.

- Bashing for the sake of bashing. It is annoying that I sometimes have to content with Ron bashing just because I like the the other parts of the story. I really don't get why Ron is seen as such an evil character while people like Snape as if he is some great hero. Ron is at times jealous, but at other times he is just what a best friend is supposed to be. Not everyone is perfect, and just because he has a few jealousy issues doesn't mean he is suddenly the new dark lord or something or other. Weasley bashing in general is something I feel very strongly about. There are very few things that I dislike about the Weasleys, but they have shown themselves to be the most caring and wonderful family portrayed in the books. Just because Molly approves of a possible relationship between Ginny and Harry doesn't mean she will suddenly spike his food with love potion etc. And they are not stupid. They have been fighting the good fight for years on end, with no casualties in their family.

- Idiotic plotlines. Don't just suddenly make Harry richer than the everyone else, and don't let him suddenly rule the wizangemot. For Merlin's sake keep it down, and move slowly. If Harry is able to do that because of his inheritance James would have as well, and he didn't so stop it. It just makes him overpowered for no other reason than to give the author a new avenue. There are many other plotlines that are just doomed to fail, and those are the biggest reason I suddenly close a story I've read 20 chapters of.

- Many people have stated bad grammar. yes, it can be annoying, but it is not the most important problem in such stories. Grammar is one thing, but writing stupid highly transparent dialogue, overly descriptive sentences in the middle of something else (such as breaking from the dialogue to describe the person they are talking with for half a page and constantly stating that their eyes are so and such, as well as their lips, pft.) and authors note and comments in the middle of a sentence are some of the things that really matter. I don't understand why native english speakers can't figure out how to use their, there, they, they're etc. but sometimes you just have to ignore it. I can also look past the occasional wrong word (blue instead of blew) but insessive mistakes can turn me off a story as well.

** "Your so right Harry - their never gonna be able to figure this out...."

this makes me want to inflict violence on the writer. I seriously want English teachers to be given the right... nay.. mandated to slap any student that makes mistakes like this. The epidemic must be fought. I am fine with spelling errors and a few grammatical mistakes are forgiven. But at several times per paragraph the story gets unreadable.

Matter of fact vehemence in the heroes of the tale - Hermione/Harry/Ron swearing and cursing at Malfoy, Dumbledore, Voldermort as part of routine conversation.

AU that was clumsily woven into the canon story line is also a big turn off. I prefer writers pick a point and make a clear divergence, preferably only one. After that, evolve the story from the divergence plausibly.

Extremely silly plot/setting points in non-crack fics: "Potter House turned to have owned an island of 20 sq miles. On this island there was a peaceful and awesome fishing/brewery/farming community. When Harry found out about it, it turned out that over 14 years he had 100 million Galleons in tax revenue and could now buy Malfoy Manor from the bank... so he did and had Malfoy's family booted out into the street. On a cold rainy day..."

For example of the worst fic written that I have ever encountered, look up Harem Wars. It's one of those that manages to get absolutely everything to do with writing horribly wrong, yet still attempts to be serious and continue to novel length.

I think this is party because I'm dyslexic and I visual don't recognize grammar good or bad, unless its so bad that whatever I'm reading doesn't make sense. However, I think its insulting to suggest that writers aren't proof reading their work because your understanding of grammar is or might be abnormally greater than the story you are reading. We have to remember, that as a community, that there people who are not so familiar with English, who are often quite young, and who are attempting to improve and develop there writing skills and ideas, through fan fiction.
