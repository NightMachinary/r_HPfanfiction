** You might want to try this one: linkffn(11762850), and its sequel: linkffn(12278649)

Its very slow burn, but it will get to where you're going eventually.

Addtionally, you might want to try my fanfic of the above fanfic: linkffn(12518394). I just updated it.

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.

  "So let me get this straight," I said slowly. "for causing a scene, humiliating your housemate, and nearly getting yourself killed, Snape didn't give you a detention, but instead made you seeker of the Quidditch team?"

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

**** You can skip the slash but in my opinion the way Harry acts in this story would be the way I would imagine tom riddle to have been (the charismatic cunning and etc etc tom riddle)as I was saying skip the slash but do give the story a try.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
