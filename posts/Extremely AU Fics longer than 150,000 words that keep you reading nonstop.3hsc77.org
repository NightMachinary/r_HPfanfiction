Hi, all,

I'm looking for fics to read for an 8 hour plane flight. I normally cover 150k-200k words in that amount of time easily, so I'd like fics that are at least that long and AU enough to keep you reading for that amount of time.

Stuff like everything on my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Exvector][favorites list]] (edit: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/5409855/xvector?a=fs][mobile link]]). *Basically, stories that would keep you entertained enough to read for 8 hours nonstop.*

Thanks!


** So, you're basically looking for exactly what I want then, I'll post ones that you haven't read yet from my favorites. Forgive me if they overlap at all.

A bit unorganized but that should do it.

****** Yeah, I'm fine with long stories, but long chapters on top of that kind of get to me. I still made it through, though. Something I liked about PotDK is that until the 5th book the chapters are really short.

** linkffn(It Falls To The Young)

Warning: Has young!Snape as protagonist. Though it's so wildly, wildly AU (much of it was jossed by HBP) that he might as well be an OC that just happens to have Snape's snark, dark and weird angst. It's just shy of 150k words.

Edit: You seem to like stories with savvy!Harry as the lead, but I think this fic makes up for that lack with fairly interesting original magic and premises.

** This was the very 1st AU fics that I ever came across when I first started reading fanfiction back in 2009. And to this day, it still remains one of the greatest fanfics that I've ever read. It is currently being redone, and posted up on the HPFF site now. But I started out reading/reviewing this story years ago when it was posted up elsewhere, and then over time I actually became pretty close friends with the author. He is such an amazing and passionate writer, and this story definitely deserves WAY more love & attention than what it is getting on HPFF right now... So please read and show this wonderful author some much-needed love!! <3
