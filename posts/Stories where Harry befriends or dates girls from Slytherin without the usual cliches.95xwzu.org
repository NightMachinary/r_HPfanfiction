Just looking for something slightly original.

One "usual cliche" in particular that I would like to avoid reading again and again: "Harry needs to learn to be more Slytherin from the cold-hearted Slytherins". I'd love to see a fic where Harry remains his usual self and maybe the Slytherins appreciate him for his honesty and directness. Maybe they'd find it refreshing to talk to someone who isn't constantly trying to plot something.

Even better if not everyone in Slytherin acts like Salazar himself and a personification of the House qualities.

I'm just so tired of edgelord Harry having to learn to be deceitful and aspire to become a Slytherin in disguise, because obviously that philosophy is just the best way to make loyal friends /s.


** I'd like to read one where Harry dates Daphne, but Hermione isn't bashed. There aren't many Haphne stories out there that don't also include Hermione bashing.

******* Not all Slytherins (or none if you go with canon) are Machiavellian Masterminds, you can get in for the ambition to purge a race or to build a chain of "rent a dildo" stations. Canon Slytherin is an utter, shithole, a melting pot of genocide and racism. The only decent member was the odd misfit who didn't go with the party line on blood purity (Andromeda Tonks).

And OP, as they said themselves, is looking for stories which are devoid of the FANON tropes associated with Slytherin love interests.

******* Nah, not hating on it, just feel the pendulum sways far too much in the other direction in fics that feature prominent Slytherin characters. Harry always has to embrace his Slytherin side and learn how great their attitude is.

I think adding a Slytherin to the group can be quite complementary and useful, but what's the point if you turn everyone into Slytherins as well in the process and lose the Gryffindors/Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff attitude during all the Slytherin wank. It's not like you can only become friends with a Ravenclaw as long as you become exactly as nerdy and obsessed with knowledge.

******** Okay I see what you mean. I definitely hate it when fics just make the Slytherin right and everyone has to go along with that, but I totally get why authors do it since JK kind of did the exact opposite but always making Slytherin bad and wrong. That's probably why these types of fics are so hard to find.

********* Yeah I understand the desire to go into the opposite direction of what JKR did, but it often just overcompensates, you know? Also JKR didn't really portray House Slytherin at all (ambitious and cunning), it's just "House Evil" in her novels. The most prominent Slytherin students don't show even a modicum of cunning.

** I think this is a live story that fits the bill.

Daphne is not a "typical" fanfiction Slytherin and Harry is also a bit OC so they fit well together. Teenage drama in this one so be aware.

PS: In fact it's Daphne who demands that Harry stops the charade and become honest.

linkffn(The Pureblood Princess): Daphne is basically that fourteen year old girl who you hate for taking a hundred selfies of herself and posting them on snapchat or something.

linkffn(The Changling), though more so in the most recent sequel. Harry's pretty true to canon idiocy on his part.

linkffn(Duality): definitely feels like a more fleshed out Slytherin house. Shit got serious real quick too.
