Several characters time traveling leads to multiple timelines. But instead of just having the main character create a happy end in the one they ended up in, each side of the war tries to win in all timelines, with many characters traveling back and forth. Voldemort manages to kill Dumbledore take over Hogwarts in timeline 1? The Order escapes to timeline 2, doubles their strength and together they attack back. Meanwhile Harry from 1 follows Voldemort from 2 into timeline 3 and discovers a Horcrux location, which turns out to also contain Horcruxes in the other timelines. And in timeline 4, Snape from 3 from killed Tom Riddle in the 40s but has to figure out how to hibernate for 60 years before he can travel back into his original timeline.

** Sounds cool, eventually could end up dissolving into a free-for-all war spanning through dozens of time-lines.
