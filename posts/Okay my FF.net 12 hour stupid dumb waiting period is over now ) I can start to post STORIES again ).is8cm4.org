I put up a super short prologue for a new one and made a summary and everything! :) It might be familiar to some of my reddit friends because I posted it here before in a thread about unused works! :) But I'm using it now!

** Why is there a waiting period? (I don't know anything about the posting or account making process.)

*** :o Efficient! :) I don't know! But it is. New accounts don't get to post stories for 12 hours after making them!

**** After thinking about it, maybe it's there to prevent spambots? By the way, is there a story behind your usernames? Or is just that you like spiders, friends, lamas, and Emperor Kusko?

***** Well my original username of reddit was Almalamemperorkusko because I love Emperor's New Groove! :) But then I made this new one and I also love spiders so I changed it to Almaarachnidfriend. :) When I had to remake my FF.net account yesterday I decided to make the new one there "almaarachnidfriendempress" so I can be Queen of the spiders. :) OR just the friend of a spider queen! :) It could be either.

****** That's cool! So where did the lama come from? Was it just something to rhyme with Alma? Or did you have an interest in Tibetan monks?

BTW, I'm sure you'd make a great spider queen :)

******* No the lama is from Emperor's New Groove! :) Kusko became a LAMA in that movie. But also yes I did love that it rhymed! :)

******** Ooh, I get it now. I was thinking lama like the monks (like the Dalai Lama), not llama like the animal. Thanks! :)
