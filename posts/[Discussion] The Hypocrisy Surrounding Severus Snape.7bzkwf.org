So Snape's a beloved character in the fandom. I can understand that. He's a complicated man who held his cards close and was part of an epic plot twist. But I'd like the opinion of people who like Severus Snape over James and why.

There's a lot of hate surrounding James. Often Snape is excused because James and the Marauders "bullied" Snape into being a Death Eater. The flashback shows Snape becoming friends with awful people like Mulciber and Avery while being friends with Lily. I would also like to point out that Snape bullied Harry and Neville relentlessly for years. He made fun of Ron's family and Hermione's teeth and hair. He essentially tortured Harry in his fifth year.

I've seen Snape defenders point out how he died for Harry. Well... so did James.

I'd also like to point out that Snape leaked the prophecy. If it wasn't about the Potters, he'd probably would have happily signed another family's death warrant.

Snape also at 34, pettily outed Lupin. He made his life 10x harder, because he lost is Order of Merlin 2nd class. Seriously?

Last, he has a seriously unhealthy obsession with Lily. He's incredibly possessive, wanting Lily to follow him into Slytherin, knowing that her life would have been hell. At the end of the day, he's in love with the idea of Lily, or more specifically Lily at 15. Lily at 21 is probably a noticably different person.

So what I want to end with it is, how do people hold Severus Snape to be a misunderstood paragon of virtue while seeing James Potter as the devil incarnate?

P.S. How much of this is from the movies? The movies don't really show the depth of Snape's cruelty. Plus, Alan Rickman portrays Snape the stern taskmaster, not the needlessly cruel teacher who threatened to kill a thirteen year old boy's pet.

Edit: Actual evidence that Snape started the grudge match:

- "My whole family have been in Slytherin," he said. "Bliimey," James said, "and I thought you seemed alright!" Sirius grinned. "Maybe I'll break the tradition. Where are you heading if you've got the choice?" "Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart! Like my dad" Snape made a small disparaging noise. James turned on him. "Got a problem with that?" "No," said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise, "If you'd rather be brawny than brainy.."

Did James escalate beyond a reasonable level? Yes. But it's clear that Snape didn't much like him to begin with, and ran his mouth when he didn't need to. It's also clear that James doesn't hate Slytherin. He's not a fan, is all. Anything done to Snape after probably results from the fact that James feels Snape is insulting his father, a man James might idolize. There's also reasonable chance that Snape is insulting James precisely for that reason. He's bitter that James has a father he can look up to and strive to be like, while he has an abusive, drunk, layabout.

2nd Edit: Wow! This is such a controversial topic. I really didn't expect this kind of response. So my final question is not "why do people view Snape as the better /character/ but why they view him as the better /person/. A character is judged by their depth and contribution to the story, Snape clearly wins there. But so much on fanon insists on crucifying James for childhood bullying while conveniently ignoring the cruel and sadistic side of Snape, and sanctifying him. That's the hypocrisy that I'm referring to.

I understand how some of Snapes loyal defenders (who I've seen on this thread love him). James draws parallels to Draco Malfoy. Single child, rich, well-cared for. Of course he isn't the hitler-youth type indoctrinated asshole Draco is, but has a similar arrogance and callousness. Snape comes from an abusive household with clothes to big for him, and looking to escape into the Wizarding World, sound familiar? But still, I wanted to shed light on accepting every part of Severus Snape, not just the pretty ones, and realizing that, yes, sometimes childhood bullies grow up and, yes, they /can/ become good people who do good things.


** As someone who prefers James over Snape, I think the reasons mainly boil down to substance and fanon. James basically doesn't exist in the books, he appears in a couple scenes where his character is wildly different but we don't get any explanation for how or why that happened. Whereas with Snape it's the complete opposite, he's right up there with Dumbledore and Voldemort as main characters after Harry, Ron and Hermione, and his motivations for why he is the way he is is probably one of the most compelling storylines in the books. He's just a more compelling character, which was always going to be the case because he's actually alive, is in all the books and can actually have an active storyline. You can like Snape for the character and prefer him over James without actually liking the person he is solely because he's far more compelling and interesting.

As for people actively liking Snape as a person more than James, well it's easy to pin the blame on James for Snape's life turning out the way it is (which I think is complete horseshit but whatever), especially when you have the result right in front of you and James got the girl so clearly he got the happy ending (despite y'know being murdered when he was 21). This is especially the case when really the only scenes we have of James that aren't to do with Harry, he's usually being a jackass to Snape. Someone mentioned in a different comment about Hagrid being a unreliable narrator but you have to admit Snape is one too when it comes to James. I'm not saying those things didn't happen, because they obviously did, but we're only ever going to see one side of James from Snape.

Fanon does have a large role to play too though, lots of people like to write redemptive Snape fics and even more like to read them. Hell, I've read a fair few myself and I'm barely interested in Snape as a character. And when the fandom has been around and still active for as long as this one has, it does become really difficult to separate canon from fanon, there's a reason there's basically a weekly thread on here about things you didn't realise were fanon. The entire reason I even have any opinions on James past the very bare bones that the books give us is because I spend a lot of time reading character introspection pieces. I have ideas and thoughts built up in my head about James that I think the books support about why he did the things he did as a teenager and how he changed afterwards, so people who think Snape is a paragon of virtue probably have the same and when it's so ingrained, and you can see support for it in some way in the books, it's difficult to let go of the ideas as not actually being canon.

**** I've never read it and I'm not really interested in reading canon rehashes, particularly one's about Snape but in my opinion, as far as fanfic goes, people can write whatever they want. I've read and enjoyed fics where James is Literally The Worst Person Ever, No Really and Snape is the Bestest Guy Ever but that doesn't make it canon.

It says it's canon-compatible in the description but without having read it, I can't really comment. By 'dark mirror' do you mean it's there to make Snape more sympathetic and everyone else worse, or is it there to show Snape as the bad guy? Either way (and if that is even what it does), Snape is more complex than that, he's not evil and while he did good things, he's not a good person. But without having read it, it's hard to say anything on it.

***** It shows things from Snape's point of view and keeps him extremely complex. It compliments canon rather than rehashing it. You get to see the thoughts in Snape's head in pivotal scenes, and it does change your perception.

He isn't noble. He's awfully broken. Bitter, petty, brave. This story makes him human and believable and fleshes out a plausible backstory for everything we observe in the books. It isn't good!Snape or evil!Snape it's more 'what was Snape thinking when...?' or 'why would Snape...?'

Interestingly, Snape in the books never physically threatens or harms a child that I can recall. The one exception I can think of is when he finds Harry with his head down the Pensieve, throws him against the wall, hurls a jar of cockroaches at him, and nearly has an aneurysm.

(Small gripe here, but somehow I can't believe that's actually Snape's Worst Memory when compared to the night Lily was killed. I don't see how anything could top that in terms of personal devastation and remorse.)

Maybe he saw the act of calling her a Mudblood as cementing his other bad choices? He probably thinks that if he hadn't called her that, he'd never have lost her and it wouldn't have led to everything that happened afterwards. This is obviously not the case since Lily was becoming tired of his behaviour for a long time, but Snape's not very high on emotional intelligence. And he possibly saw that as the time he lost Lily forever, as opposed to her death.

But in terms of which event utterly destroyed him, I agree. The night in Dumbledore's office should be his worst memory.

****** Uh...I didn't say anything about Snape being at Godric's Hollow? In any case, I don't think that's how shock and memory work. He didn't have to be there. His worst nightmare had come true.

Years ago, a friend of mine died in hospital. I knew he was gravely ill. I knew he was probably dying. I arrived for my visit, and the nurse told me he'd passed away that morning. I stood there for a moment, trying to accept it, and the next thing I knew the nurse was dragging me to a chair because I'd fainted. I wasn't in love with my friend. I even knew his death was inevitable. My friend wasn't murdered, the way Lily was. But having the news broken to me secondhand made no difference to the impact. Believe me, gravitas has nothing to do with it. In canon, we see Snape howling with grief in Dumbledore's office, wanting to die.

I'm pretty sure Lily's death was the worst moment of Severus Snape's life.

For example WBWL stories often have Lily/James portrayed as a terrible parents to Harry. Do people who write it think Lily would be a terrible mother? No, they just want to get Harry into specific situation and bashing James/Lily is the easiest way.

** Snape is my favorite forever, and I am 100% not here to make excuses for him. As an adult he is a bully, an abusive asshole who can't let go of a grudge for /literal decades/, and a conniving secretive piece of shit who won't tell an unpleasant truth to save his soul. As a child he was selfish, vengeful, careless with the feelings of others and uncaring for the worldview of others even while demanding that level of understanding from them. His (complex, imho) feelings for Lily excuse nothing; in fact, they damn him more. He was shown a deep and personal caring and still fell for the Dark Arts thinking he could maintain a friendship with her while surrounding himself with people who wanted her dead.

He's not misunderstood in the least. He doesn't have a "good heart." He has a complicated one. He's a mirror for many deeply human darker impulses.

By comparison, James is simple; he is a pampered pureblood prince who was brought up confident and loved and became a bully in school but straightened out later on in life. Some of which is conjecture, which is half the problem. James is just as much of a cipher as Lily is; when you say that Snape only loved the "idea" of Lily, I have to think it's because all we really have is his idea of her. There's just so little to go on: the letter Harry finds in Grimmauld place, Snape's memories, and her final words to Voldemort. That's it. And there's even less of James.

At the end of the day, people love rooting for an underdog and I'm no exception. Snape grew up treated poorly at home and at school, made messy mistakes that cost him and others much, but grew into a powerful wizard who could go toe to toe with Voldemort, whom Dumbledore trusted above all else. Rooting for him, wanting to dig into his personality and his desires and his neuroses is entirely understandable.

As a character in a novel, Snape is fully realized, complex, and robust; James is a flimsy slip of memory and little else. There's just no competition in my mind who I'm more interested in.

I'm glad he doesn't (or doesn't have time to) pick and choose which memories to show Harry, because we get to see Lily being sharp with him and taking him down a peg. It makes their friendship more interesting and adds a small fierce detail to her otherwise saintly character. It also leads me to wonder about her attraction to assholes, which is a fair description of both James and Severus as students, although James is obviously much more the husband/father type.

***** Yeah, Lily is not a pushover. In fact, every glimpse we have of Severus and Lily together inclines me to think she's the dominant personality in that friendship. Severus knows more about the wizarding world, sure, but he's also besotted, and desperate not to lose her goodwill. He's always upset or bewildered when she gets mad at him (which adds to my sense that he doesn't understand what's wrong with his behavior, not because he's a sociopath but because he really was that deprived as a child). After several years at Hogwarts, he ought to know better, but of course by then he's surrounded himself with Slytherins who reinforce his childhood bigotry.

Lily should be written with some fire and definite confidence. During SWM, the way she stands up to the Marauders makes it clear she's quite comfortable in her social standing. She's not rich or a bully, but otherwise she's far more like James than Severus: popular, good-looking, comparatively affluent, much loved by her parents, and the teachers' favorite. She's also supposed to be kind, although we don't get to see that in action. She's far more secure in herself than Severus, and the world rewards her accordingly until fate (and Severus' self-absorbed awfulness) intervene.

** I've been staring at the comment box trying to muster up, for the 8723458708275 time, all my reasons for liking Snape as a character: the distinction between narrative purpose and real life consequences, the entertainment value of unvarnished arseholes, the intriguing potential of Snape's complicated backstory and conflicting desires vs. James's bland origins as a swell-headed rich boy, the bittersweet appeal of imperfect or actually unattainable redemption, the self-sacrifice on the part of someone who theoretically shouldn't have been capable of it... and so on.

And then I think, ugh, I just don't have the energy to do this one more time. I've been in fandom for years, and if you're a Snape fan, this question comes up over and over and over. Sorry, but Snape is interesting. He's an ugly character who lights up the page. He makes things happen. He makes /horrible/ things happen - and he makes it possible for Harry to save the wizarding world. He bristles with contradictions. He even gets to have a moment in which he's morally superior to Dumbledore. Meanwhile, James is an egotistical bully and favored son who turns into a good guy off-page. His heroism feels abstract.

You will notice that at no point did I mention Alan Rickman. Book!Snape fascinates me in all his cruel, self-loathing, emotionally deformed glory. Movie!Snape - well, movie!anything really isn't what I'm here for.

Like with Ginny, we don't see her grow into the supposedly super awesome and perfect and powerful and pretty and popular girl she is at the end of the books. We're told these characters transformed from how they used to be, but it's unearned because it's not seen. So it's much more easy to dismiss and write off as fake. Combine that with how interesting Snape is and some people will run with it to mean Snape is the best. They don't take the lesson from reading Snape that people can be complex and contradictory. Instead, they turn it into a simple good and evil situation.

*** Thing is, I like Snape too /as a character/, as a complex and difficult character. I still hate the way he's handled in fanfiction particularly by Snape-fen. Because in those fanfics the authors take away everything that makes Snape-the-character interesting to create Snape-the-person they like.

As for James as an egotistical bully - we ONLY have the extremely biased Snape's viewpoint to affirm that. Every other viewpoint we know of tells a very different tale. The problem there is of course is that Snape is the main source of what we are told about James. Excuse me if I do not subscribe to his extremist interpretation of James' character.

***** I totally forgot about that.

Actually in that conversation with Sirius and Remus (OotP, near the end of chapter 29) they do not in fact straight-up say that. Whether Lily /hated/ him before was never addressed, nor was the bullying called out. They say she started going out with him after he "had deflated his head a bit" and "stopped hexing people just for the fun of it" and for the rest of their activities she remained fairly ignorant of them. So they dance around the topic quite a lot, clearly embarrassed about it.

And yes, it can be read as James being the worst person ever if you approach it with that pre-conceived notion. But it can also be read as him being a minor asshole on a limited scope who grew up and his relation with Snape on a wholly tit-for-tat basis.

The other examples of Lily's reactions to Snape and James, her calling it bullying, stem from the pensieve memory. And that is just not trustworthy enough a source.

Q. Do the memories stored in a Pensieve reflect reality or the views of the person they belong to?”

J.K Rowling: It's reality. It's important that I have got that across, because Slughorn gave Dumbledore this pathetic cut-and-paste memory. He didn't want to give the real thing, and he very obviously patched it up and cobbled it together. /So, what you remember is accurate in the Pensieve./

******* While I would argue that there is a difference between attempted falsification and faulty memory or skewed understanding, lets keep that to the side. But that means Voldemort is an even greater idiot that we've already known. Snape's Pensieve memory shows already that it contains data it could hot have got from his actual memory, that he could not have observed. Not only things that were behind him but also the interaction between the marauders he could not have overheard.

Because that means that to get the full prophecy all Voldemort would have had to do was get a Pensieve memory of the night Trelawney made her prophecy, go into the room and listen in.

Sirius was just as bad as James when it came to bullying, if not worse. Another big reason that Snape carried his hate for James with him through life is because James saved his life at Hogwarts. I'm surprised no one else has mentioned this yet. Sirius tricked Snape into thinking he would catch the Marauders up to something if he went to the whomping willow on the night of the full moon and went through the secret passage. What really would have happened is that Snape would have been torn to shreds by Remus as a werewolf but, thankfully, James found out and rescued Snape before he could be harmed.

To be fair to Sirius, he was stuck in Azkaban for twelve years. And he was innocent. While Snape, a guilty-as-sin Death Eater walked free. I think it's safe to say that Sirius thought Snape was dead in battle, since he never wound up in Azkaban. And then when they finally meet again, Snape is trying to put Sirius back in Azkaban.

As for the...incident, I'm not sure. The wording's vague. It's certainly plausible that Sirius lost his temper and half-taunted Snape--"You think you're so smart? Why don't you go down the tunnel and see for yourself?"

**** I don't agree with you that Snape's viewpoint is the only evidence for James's behavior - JKR does a pretty good job of scattering clues about his casual cruelty using Sirius and Remus as mouthpieces - but I do agree that Snape is often written by fandom in ways that strip him of his complexity and turn him into either a woobie or a brave, sardonic, rather ordinary character with a sharp tongue. Snape is irreparably damaged by his past; he may be brave and sardonic, but he's not ordinary. It took him 37 years to finally figure out that other people's lives matter. His own life in canon, to the bitter end, gives him very little reason to stop hating the world (although get him away from Hogwarts and assign him magically interesting work with a chance to shine, and he might have had a fighting chance). He's not moderate, he's not mature, his mistakes will always haunt him, and he really doesn't know how to be a good person. In fanfic, Snape's personality gets cleaned up on the regular much as his appearance does, and it makes him /less/ interesting, IMO.

** I've never understood this, either. What I've come to recognize with James is that he changed, for the better. The James we saw in the flashbacks is definitely not the same man Lily married. Just because the full depth of character development wasn't shown in the books doesn't mean it wasn't there.

Yeah, he was an arrogant ass in his earlier years, but he grew up. He had to in order for Lily to pay him any attention. I believe James Potter had the capacity to become a good man, and made the effort to become one.

Snape, however, did not grow up to become someone Lily wanted anything to do with. He got increasingly deep into the dark arts, and tied himself in the same group of people who would've like to see Lily dead and then expected her to be okay with that.

I get that Snape is a complex character, and I will advocate for how great THAT fact is, but being complex does not make him admirable, or even good. The man had one redeeming quality, if you can call it that, and that singularly drove him. He cared about no one else but Lily. Snape would've been happy to see James Potter and his son dead if Lily were alive. That's part of where we see a huge difference. Snape would never have gone out of his way to save James Potter's life, but James risked a whole lot to save both Snape and a friend. Snape loved Lily, and no one else.

He emotionally abused a LOT of children, and that, to me, has no excuse. This is also where he and James separate. I can't believe he would've ever gone to the lengths Snape did in order to make life miserable for a select group of kids. His behavior towards most Gryffindor kids makes it impossible for me to respect him much. I can't believe that he's truly a good man. I think he's a complicated person with one obsession that drove most of his actions: Lily. But if he truly loved her, would he not have stopped trying to make her son's life hell, or at least tried to get to know him before automatically assuming that he's just like his father? Because if he stopped and truly looked, I think Snape would've found that there is a lot more of Lily in Harry than James.

- We get to know Snapes character, what he wants and what he has done. We see him perform these actions first hand, through Harrys eyes throughout the entire series.

- James has one scene that is not told by one of his friends, the flashback during the occlumens class with Snape. In this scene James is 'only' a tormentor of Snape and nothing else. None of his (supposedly) good points are shown.

- Everything else we know about James is told by one of his friends, whom themselves are not really trustworthy about this, because, this is a person talking to an orphan about his parents. They are almost bound to exaggerate the facts to make James seem like a better person.

He goes to the same school as his newly(?) made crush only to be bullied by a group of four kids that stand above the rules because of a choice to become 'brave' and not 'ambitious'.

After some time he snaps and calls his only friend a racial slur and loses her.

There is a war going on.

He overhears some information from the leader of the 'light' side and uses this to bargain for his friend life, unknowing that the information will lead to her death.

Everything about James can be fabrications to please Harry. He is a 'nice' person that bullies a kid for seven years, because the kid is in Slytherin and his friend is a girl James likes.

And the evil part, It is easier to add pieces to things that are undefined. We know what Snape would do in a certain situation. Or at least we can guess.

James has done plenty of good things though:

- befriended Sirius and helped him escape his terrible homelife, had no prejudices against him for his family
- befriended Lupin and made his condition tolerable, had no prejudices against him
- risked his life to saved Snape's life and probably Lupin's just because it was the right thing to do
- actually recognized he was a dick and changed to win Lily's affection
- actively fought against evil even though being a pureblood he didn't really have to
- died defending his family

James doesn't have problems in his life, true. But he's also not a hateful, murderous, racist terrorist. I find it easier to understand a rich kid with a nice family who's kind of a brat but has some good in him, than a person who joined the equivalent of the Nazis.

And unlike Harry. Snape has zero reason to hate Neville. Neville has never done anything to him, I don't think he's ever even said anything smarmy to him.

So it's not that he sees James in Harry and can't get over that, it's just that he enjoys being cruel to children. It's so much fun that even whatever regret he feels isn't enough to stop it.

The way he treats Neville and Harry (and the others) makes all his noble actions look like selfish obsession-driven revenge bullshit. He clearly doesn't feel real regret or empathy. I mean he does feel empathy -- for Lily, and maybe Draco?

To me Snape is a little worse than Voldemorte. Voldy is a true psychopath who has seemingly never felt most human emotions. Other people mean nothing to him so it's understandable that he will torture and murder to achieve his goals, why not?

Snape is simultaneously "in love" and seems to regret his actions as a death eater and have empathy... and at the same time relentlessly and unnecessarily cruel to exactly the people he hurt the worst, when they have done nothing to him. He is so duplicitous both internally and externally, it's deeply disgusting to me.

** IRL, I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't want to be friends with either of them. As a youngster I wasn't that cute and I have a sneaking suspicion that James would have bullied /me/ had I been around Hogwarts during those years. Mean, handsome, popular guys just kind of set off alarm bells in my brain like that.

I could write pages and pages about the why of Snape and the why of James, but ultimately I don't think they're mutually exclusive. You can hate both or like both. I like them both as characters that I read about, but I like Snape more because he has a redemption arc. He obviously feels really really bad about the shit that he's done, and that's just more interesting to me.

James is just kind of a flatline as far as his story arc. He supposedly gets better as he gets older, but all we really see is that he gets better at relating to people (Lily) that he's liked all along. And does exchanging bullying Hogwarts kids for fighting Death Eaters in the war mean he's changed as a person? Does he ever actually regret being a bully, or does he just move on to more acceptable and deserving targets?

Also you talk about seriously unhealthy obsession. James latched onto the idea of dating Lily and for SIX YEARS, despite her constantly saying no and telling him to leave her alone, he continues to make unwanted advances. He even tries to blackmail her into dating him by saying he'll leave Snape alone if she does. Didn't he pretty much start bullying Snape in the first place because Snape was friends with Lily? Seriously, that's one hell of a lot more stalker-ish than anything Snape does. It just really kinda rubs me the wrong way. I'd never go out with someone who acted like that, red flags all over the place, and I don't really understand Lily's choice to do so.

*** Unless I'm misremembering I think the idea of James being obsessed with Lily from the get go and liking her for their entire time at Hogwarts is largely a fanon thing. From what we see of their interactions during their Hogwarts years, we only have two scenes, the one where they first meet on the train and James is a brat to both Lily and Snape and then the Snape's Worst Memory scene where he asks her out and while he's annoyed/embarrassed over her rejection, he doesn't act like a stalker.

We do have another scene in Deathly Hallows from Snape's memories where Snape tells Lily that James fancies her, which happens just after Sirius sends him down the tunnel which I think would also put that scene in fifth year. So we have pretty much no proof that James fancied Lily before fifth year, and we don't have a scene of him asking her out other than the one. This idea of James basically hounding her for their entire time at Hogwarts is completely fanon.

He never hurts his friends, the only child we ever see him interact with us Harry and he definitely doesn't hurt him and we never see him interact with an animal so I don't know where you've got any of that from. The only threatening behaviour is towards Snape and potentially him saying he'd leave Snape alone if Lily goes out with him, which reads more like a stupid teenage boys saying stupid things in a stupid attempt to get the girl he likes to go out with him. As for the behaviour towards Snape, I'm not trying to defend it, he was a massive asshole but does bullying one kid who is involved with all the stuff he hates make him an abuser? I don't think it does. He was a massive ass to kid he didn't like. Every teenager is like that. That doesn't make it right but it isn't precursor to becoming an abuser.

A character who was hurtful to friends, children and pets though was Snape, which we clearly saw multiple times throughout the books so.

James starts hating Snape because Snape makes fun of James's dad. James remarks that he wants to go into Gryffindor, like his father. Snape insults him for that.

Yes? Snape was also a minor, and he didn't know that Lupin was a werewolf, otherwise why would he have crawled into a tunnel to spy on him? Granted, Snape had spotted Lupin as the weak link in the Gryffindor chain and was trying to find out something about him he could use as leverage against the whole gang (which makes it weirdly OOC to me that he'd follow Sirius' - Sirius', ffs! - instructions).

Lupin may not have bullied Snape himself, but as prefect he sat right there and did absolutely nothing to stop his friends from tormenting Snape. Of course, he didn't want to lose Sirius and James's friendship, but that's not a virtuous or harmless kind of passivity. There's a reason people call Lupin spineless.

Re: Snape the vindictive SOB. Yeah, he is. He's like an animal with his back to the wall. From the way he behaves, he's probably a constant target. He's sitting there trying to read, but the moment the Marauders show up, he clearly expects to be attacked. He's sitting under a tree with a book, and they go after him.

No, that's not true. In the Prince's Tale, Snape already theorizes that Lupin's a werewolf. He specifically references the full moon when talking to Lily. He want's to find proof to out him. If Lupin is outed as a werewolf, he's forced to leave school, any (already nonexistent) career prospects he had are just about gone. It's a life-changing impact.

Also, I've been thinking a lot on what happens in that scene in OoTP. A couple of things, first the whole Shrieking Shack deal happens before. I'm assuming there's a whole deal of bitterness on both sides. Could be why James and Sirius decide to attack him out of the blue.

Ah, that's disappointing, because it makes Snape listening to Sirius even stupider. And it may mean I'm coldhearted, but I still don't blame Snape for searching for ammunition. It wasn't the greatest idea (but then Snape's a teenage boy and socially backwards to boot), since if he'd succeeded, it would only have fueled James and Sirius's hatred even more, and they would have made him suffer for it. (Also, frankly, I think Dumbledore would have done damage control and shut Snape up, which is what he did after the Shrieking Shack.)

And, yeah, I'm pretty sure SWM happens after the "prank." Which is one of the reasons I think James and Sirius are repellent dicks. Sirius almost sent Snape to his death. If James hadn't caught up with him in time, a fifteen-year-old boy would have died horribly, and Lupin would, at the very least, have been sent to Azkaban. Snape was traumatized by his brush with death and then forbidden to speak about what happened to him. And yet James and Sirius are still swanning around, attacking Snape as if it's just a laddish bit of sport. Whatever reason they have to be bitter (detentions? oh horrors!), Sirius brought down on their heads, not Snape. And the way they behave very much implies to me that this is just their MO. They don't need a reason to attack Snape. It's just the way they have fun together.

It's possible Snape's friends joined the feud, but who knows? He's a penniless half-blood swot in Slytherin, and he certainly gives off loner vibes. It's not portrayed as "Gryffindor gang vs. Slytherin gang." It's Marauders vs. Snape. He's the target. After the Shrieking Shack, the fact that they're still tormenting him makes it harder for me to care about James and Sirius later. /shrug

They were both incredibly obnoxious and bully-like from the beginning, both with the potential to become good people. James did become a good person. Snape became a complete piece of shit. You can compare the two during their school times, but after, they're completely different people.

He betrayed Voldemort, risking his life every day (except for the 1981-1994 respite) to help the side of good win in the end. And "completely destroying any confidence they might be building up" might be going a bit too far, too --- the only one in this situation, I believe, was Neville, who was already very insecure.

Well, that's a debatable point. That he betrayed Voldemort only for Lily's memory and nothing else is /possible/, but I and many people rather think it was more of a traumatic /catalyzer/ for him to finally stop ignoring what his conscience had been screaming at him all along. Unlike someone like Riddle or Bellatrix, I see Snape not as an innately sadistic maniac with no conscience, but as a flawed but ultimately not evil man --- a pitiable, weary man whose heart was in the right place, but who much, much too often let his negative emotions get the better of him, occasionally silencing his moral side to frightening extents.

**** That's not how I see him, actually. Yes, I think he's usually got a lot of anger seething just below the surface, and he's clearly a high-strung character. But he is, by nature, mostly a quiet, cold, intense, hostile, defensive presence who's learned how to cow a roomful of students by radiating spite and menace. He's also, after book 4, a spy who has to maintain nerves of steel and mental self-control. He loses his shit about, hm, four times in the books? Which is an expression of the explosive emotion his past stirs up in him, because almost every occasion that we see him foam at the mouth with rage, it has to do with the ghosts of his childhood rising up: Sirius escaping and Dumbledore mocking him, Harry snooping in his Pensieve and seeing his worst memory, Harry calling him a coward after he's just killed Dumbledore. I know I'm forgetting something else.

So I read Snape as a very repressed character, very tightly contained, but one who has a volcanic reaction to certain people and certain triggers. He's serpentine and spidery; he glides and whispers. He doesn't twitch. But when provoked, he basically loses his mind. It's the contrast I love, and the movies cut out all of his dramatic, emotional scenes, which was - well, on par with all the other disappointing things in the movies.

he's a tragic character- he's shown to be a victim of both familial and peer abuse, with zero supportive or positive adult figures throughout his childhood and adolescence. the only other character i can think of who had a similar fate was merope- and she raped someone and then died. he's contrasted and compared with harry and riddle- two of the most legendary figures in wizardkind. his reasons for doing bad things and his idiosyncrasies in general are interesting to parse. contrast, james was a dick because he was privileged and entitled. snape is a dick because of his dysfunctional relationships with his father and mother, and to power in general. he's talented and creative. he's dramatic and pretentious, and i find his personality entertaining. he's clannish. i find redemption arcs, specifically /difficult/ redemption arcs, where the character still does damage on their way to redemption, interesting. lily was his catalyst for defection, and his self imposed terms of atonement involved him overhauling his entire general moral framework. i like that his morality is sincere, myopic, and contradictory/hypocritical. i like that he's committed to saving lives while not caring about his own emotional mistreatment of his students. i like the hbp plot, about harry being endeared to and enamored by the prince and his genius only to slowly be disenchanted as he gets gradually more malicious. i like that the narrative involves using the same tools he used to acquire power as a teenager to help others as an adult, and how that's shown when he has to heal draco from an unknowingly cast sectumsempra. his relationships are intense and dysfunctional with consequences on both a personal level and to the world. i'm a goth ally

James really did hex people just for the fun of it. James became headboy ( hagrid is unreliable though) even though he was a big bully. James got the girl in the end.

Sirius nearly got Snape killed. Sirius hated Snape with a passion for the crime of being sorted into Slytherin. This didn't even stop when they both were in the order.

Snape wasn't the paragon of light or whatever that some people in the fandom make him out to be. But Snape did endanger his life on a daily basis by being a spy for Dumbledore. He was alone, isolated and hated almost from day one. How can anyone be mad at him for turning to the one group of people who showed him kindness and friendship? He grew up in a broken home, his only friend Lily was in another house, he was relentlessly bullied by the Marauder's from get go.

James had everything and still acted like the biggest jerk on Earth.

Sirius had a nasty family but he had friends and was like the bully who had abusive parents at home and thus directed his abuse and feelings at others. At least he had friends though.

Snape had less than nothing and clung to friendship like a drowning man

  Okay, so this is my favorite part. At the beginning of the year we find out that Snape distrusts Lupin, duh, and thinks that Lupin is either protecting or is working together with Black. He is fucking right. Only with one correction that Lupin was protecting not Sirius but himself. Ok, so mass murdering psychopath just broke out of prison to kill Harry Potter. You know, the son of his closest friends. So what does our hero do? Maybe he warns Dumbledore or literally anybody else that Sirius is an unregistered animagus and thus is able to get into the castle undetected? Maybe he warns anybody about 100 secret passages that he and Sirius and few else are privy to? Maybe he at least gives the confiscated Marauders map to Dumbledore? He doesn't. He does neither of those things even after the castle-wide security alert during which Black personally got into the Gryffindor common room. To presumably kill Harry Potter. Remember, 13-year-old boy and son of his closest friends? Seriously what the fuck? And that's not even the end of it. At the end of the year Lupin, the werewolf, who lived his whole life with the curse, who was entrusted with the life of schoolchildren, who was offered a job Dumbledore, in all honesty, should not have offered him doesn't take his potion. He doesn't take his potion while in a school full of children. For this alone he should be put to prison, not just sacked from his position in a school. A position that obligates him to protect the lives of children in his care. I despise Lupin more than most other characters in the book and there's probably a reason why non of Harry's children were named Remus. It baffles my mind that you use this as an argument of Snape's pettiness.

Plus, if what they are doing is so inportant, I don't see why he should entrust his, his girlfriend's, his future child's and the magical wolrd's in general future to three barely-adult not-fully-trained (and maybe excluding Hermione I'm not sure how competent) wizards.

*** Ok! I'm going go give my rebuttals from the bottom up.

-Snape grows up with a wizarding mother. He knows about the world and it's prejudices. He and Lily have a conversation about it in the flashback.

-I'm not so sure his obsession with Lily is love. At least not in the end. Thirty years later, that love has probably warped. Also let's say Voldie kills Harry and James, and spares Lily, the way Snape wanted. We can safely say Lily wouldn't have been happy. People who love someone else generally wamt the best foe them. Snape has a possessive, selfish, obsession.

-Lupin's a stupid man who makes stupid decisions to be sure. But snape doesn't out him because he's thinking about the kids. No, he outs him because he lost his Order of Merlin 2nd class. In the shack, Harry&co are begging him to look past his prejudices and listen. But, he doesn't. Imagine how things could have changed if he took a second to just listen. He would have tied up Pettigrew, saved Sirius, and made Lupin stay in the shack.

-But what gets me, is how even when Snape turns spy, he tells Voldy to go ahead, kill James and Harry, but leave Lily. In a similar situation James risks his life to save Snape's.

I get that he's a deeper and far more interesting character. I even think so myself. But I don't think he was a better person.

  What does having turned spy have to do with anything??
#+end_quote

because your statement was that even when snape turned spy he told voldy to go ahead and sacrifice james and harry. there's nothing to suggest he entertained that after he met dumbledore and he reprimanded him for it.

#+begin_quote
  Lily's question wasn't, "does it make a difference to you Sev," it was "does it make a difference"
#+end_quote

...and it doesn't make a difference to her capability and ability to perform magic, or any other tenet of pureblood supremacy, which is an entirely valid way to interpret her question, which is how he did. she didn't ask 'do people care if you're muggleborn?'

#+begin_quote
  His desire to have her in a house, that he knows would be awful for her is possessive and selfish.

***** Ok, rebuttal time again! From the top this time,

Some quotes:

1) "Does it make a difference, being Muggle-Born?" Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair. "No," he said, "it doesn't matter."

2)"Haven't been spying," said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. "Wouldn't spy on /you/ anyway," he added spitefully, " *you're" a muggle."

3)"I don't want to talk to you," she said in a constricted voice. "Why not?" "Tuny h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore." "So what?" "So she's my sister!" "She's only a-," he caught himself quickly

4)"My whole family have been in Slytherin," he said. "Bliimey," James said, "and I thought you seemed alright!" Sirius grinned. "Maybe I'll break the tradition. Where are you heading if you've got the choice?" "/Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!/ Like my dad" Snape made a small disparaging noise. James turned on him. "Got a problem with that?" "No," said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise, "If you'd rather be brawny than brainy.."

5)"Slipped out?" There was no pity in Lily's voice, "It's too late. I've made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can even understand why I talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends - you see, you don't even deny it! You don't even deny that's all your aiming to be! You can't wait to join You-Know-Who can you?"

6)"We /are/ Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging around with! I'm sorry Sev, but I detest Mulciber! /Mulciber/! What do you see in him Sev? He's creepy! D'you know what he tried to do to Mary McDonald the other day?" "That was nothing," said Snape, "It was a laugh, that's all-"

7)"You disgust me," said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little. "You do not care, then, the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?" Snape said nothing, merely looked at Dumbledore.

First point. Snape does know about prejudice. Using quotes 1, 2, and 3, he seems to be pretty anti-muggle. Somewhat understandable considering his mother and his father. But he knows about the prejudice and misleads Lily otherwise in 1. Also from 6, the argument can be made, that Snape doesn't much care for muggle-borns unless they're Lily, seeing his rather blase reaction to Mary McDonald.

The reason I'm presenting it as "Snape at 34, etc." is because of this. It's pretty clear Snape is upset about Sirius leaving. It's also reasonable that Dumbledore takes him aside and tells him the full truth. At this point, knowing that Sirius is innocent, Snape gets his revenge the only way he can. "Outing" Remus as a werewolf. Remus was likely to resign anyways. Letting the world know he was a werewolf /was/ petty. Lupin didn't deserve that.

The whole tell Voldemort "spare only Lily" point isn't about what he logically tells Voldemort. It's about the motivation. Quote 7 shows that he genuinely doesn't care that James and Harry die. In my opinion, loving someone, truly, means also wanting the best for them. He has a selfish obsession.

I want to reference quote 4. Actual evidence that Snape started the grudge match. Did James escalate beyond a reasonable level? Yes. But it's clear that Snape didn't much like him to begin with, and ran his mouth when he didn't need to. It's also clear that James doesn't /hate/ Slytherin. He's not a fan, is all. Anything done to Snape after probably results from the fact that James feels Snape is insulting his father, a man James might idolize. There's also reasonable chance that Snape is insulting James precisely for that reason. He's bitter that James has a father he can look up to and strive to be like, while he has an abusive, drunk, layabout.

Lastly, quotes 5 and 6. Snape knew his way around a wand, and held some pretty nasty grudges against the Muggle world. It's clear that he /wanted/ to be a Death Eater, until they targeted Lily. He's hanging around some nasty people while still being friends with Lily.

I understand the dynamic. James, rich, only child, and adored, feels closer to Draco Malfoy then he does, Harry. Snape, the ratty clothes, and the horribly family, feels much like Harry does in Book 1. It makes it easier to empathize with him. But, for me, I see James as a better person than Snape, when he died. I do think that Snape matures as well growing up, and lets go of many grudges around the end of Goblet of Fire. I think that's about it for me when it comes to debating this.

***** You're basing a lot of your argument on what you believe to be true, but what we don't actually have any evidence for at all.

Why would you think Snape knows about those things but not everything else?? Yeah, sure as an 11 year old he's probably not going to be reading the paper every day but he's not completely cut off from the wizarding world and everything that's happening in it. He shows disdain for people who aren't magical before they even go to Hogwarts through his interactions with Petunia, and while this is probably from a negative association through his father, it doesn't take long to figure this shit out once you're in school. I don't think Snape wanting Lily to be in Slytherin is a bad thing, he wanted to be with his friend, but I find it doubtful he would have been completely ignorant of all the things you're saying he is.

I'm not going to get into the love stuff or the Remus stuff because you can read the love stuff how you want and if you don't like Remus then that is completely your opinion, but just because in your opinion Remus is a bad person doesn't mean Snape wasn't spiteful in his actions. He wasn't acting out of some protective instinct, it was spite because of his history with Remus, his anger that Sirius had gotten away and that he'd lost his Order of Merlin and made to look a fool. Just because you think Remus deserved it, doesn't mean Snape wasn't acting from a negative place. Just because one character is 'bad' doesn't mean the other is 'good'.

Before Lily is killed, we have nothing from Snape that even implies that he was vaguely interested in saving Harry. His conversation with Dumbledore on the hill when he first goes to him directly implies the opposite, since when Dumbledore straight up asks about Harry and James, Snape doesn't say a single thing. And then after Lily is dead, it's again all about her to Snape, he says to Dumbledore 'I thought you were going to keep her safe', not 'them' not 'her and her son'. He doesn't give a shit. He never has the realisation that Lily would rather die than lose Harry, he only makes the decision to protect him after Dumbledore suggests it to him once Lily is dead.

And what you're saying about James only saving Snape because of Remus and Sirius has no basis. I mean, yeah I definitely believe that he was also worried about what would have happened to his friends but there is absolutely nothing to suggest that he did not give a single shit about whether or not Snape would have died. James was a dick, but he wasn't evil.

******* This is conjecture, but Snape's mother comes from an old, and possibly wealthy family. She's a pureblood that married a muggle. Considering the state of his clothes as a kid, it's clear he's not well off. It may be because his mother was dis-owned for marrying a muggle. May be part of the reason he resents muggles the way he does. It's not the people he's dismissive of, but in the Prince's tale, we see he holds a very negative opinion of muggles. An opinion, that is probably popular in the Slytherin common room, and stoked and grown. The fandom loves to use the idea that he was "bullied" into being a death eater, and I just don't think that's true. He wanted to be one.

******* You're seriously underestimating kids if you think they have little to no grasp of these kind of things at that age. I'm not saying he's going to have a deeply nuanced and thoroughly researched opinion on the topic, but children are aware of these things and the quotes OP provided in their reply to you demonstrates that he knew this stuff too.

In my opinion, it is that he wanted the assurance by going to them both. I looked up what actually happens and here's the exact quote when he goes to Dumbledore to ask for his help:

'"If she means so much to you,' said Dumbledore, "surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?" "I have - I have asked him-"' Snape admits to bartering Harry's life for Lily's. That does not sound like someone who has realised that Lily would rather die. Dumbledore then calls him disgusting and says 'You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?', and Snape replies with 'Hide them all, then. Keep her - them - safe. Please.' It is literally only in this moment that Snape gives a damn about saving anyone other than Lily and it is already after he has decided to go to Dumbledore. Saving Harry because Lily would rather die than lose her son had nothing to do with his decision.

*** I can't think of any either, but I think it's because he is often just not mentioned or shows up in Snape fics where he is obviously not shown in good light. I believe the main reason is that we don't know very much about him so it's much harder to write the details or praise him when we don't really have much evidence of it other than a few mentions here and there. Its even more difficult when half the information on James comes from a very biased source showing him at his worst.

** What I would like to know, since we're here talking about Snape, is why he's portrayed as being an unpopular teacher.

I mean I can see that Harry would hate him and Neville is scared of him but none of the other students seem to like him either and in my experience that's really weird.

In my high school the most popular teacher was categorically awful to every student in his class. He called us reprobates and monkeys and wastes of oxygen. He gave enormous amounts of homework and never let us have any fun and once threw his lunch at a student. And we /adored/ him. We used to have like this little weird competition regarding who got the best insult every week.

And from what I've read that's not at all uncommon.

So I just find the fact that it seems that he's universally disliked very odd.

Also the fact that nobody in canon ever picks up on how fucking funny the man is just breaks my heart.

Snape actively bullies Harry. He vanishes his slightly substabdard potion regularly while accepting toxic waste from Crabbe and Goyle. He threatened to kill Neville's toad, and would have if Hermione didn't help him. When Hermione got hit with the teet growing hex, instead of sending her to the hospital wing, he said, "I see no difference". He's made fun of Ron's family for being poor.
