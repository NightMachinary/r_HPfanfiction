There's a decent amount of "Dudley has magic" fics, usually with Dudley attending Hogwarts with Harry, but in all my searching I haven't found any fic where Dudley has /just enough/ magic to not be considered a Muggle. E.g. he can see magical creatures and not be turned away by Muggle-repelling charms, and maybe he's had a handful of moments/traits that could arguably be accidental magic if you squint, but definitely not enough magic to get a Hogwarts letter or even cast a Lumos.

What if Dudley is aware of this from a young age, knows he's a /freak/ just like Harry? Does he react with denial/by becoming an even bigger bully, or does he start to sympathize with his cousin? Maybe Harry finds out; would it become a shared secret? How (slightly, but perhaps significantly) differently would Harry grow up if he had someone to talk about his moments of /weirdness/ with? How would Dudley react to Harry getting a Hogwarts letter: jealousy, relief, concern, curiosity? Or to their run-in with Dementors in the summer after fourth year if he could actually /see/ the Dementors: incidentally making for a somewhat natural entrypoint into the wizarding world if he's brought in as a witness to Harry's trial? And so on.

I think it could make for a really interesting story (that leans more on the introspective side than the "epic save the world" side), and I even started plotting one where Dudley's magic makes him a tiny bit more durable than can be explained and gives him extremely vague but oddly accurate premonitions, but I don't really have the time to write anything these days.

Edit: Discussion is also okay! And funnily enough while writing this post I also thought of a scenario where Dudley has a normal amount of magic but brutally suppresses it to the point of becoming an Obscurial?


** Not Dudley, but Petunia. I really like linkffn(12551744) (even writing a sequel of sorts).

Also, linkffn(13137899) ... extreme Dumbledore bashing, but nicely written.

And Petunia as a full-fledged witch in linkao3(11676102) and its sequels.

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?
