I've definitely had 2 stories update in the last week that did not send me an update email. I've also had a couple properly send a notification so it's not consistent.


** I'm getting them sporadically as well. The site statistics is taking roughly 2 days up update on most things. E-mails seem delayed about a day.

** It seems to be sporadic. I posted a chapter, 5 reviews showed on the site, 1 email notification. I'm getting chapter updates for stories I follow days late and out of order.

** Yeah, I checked my story and I got a bunch of new reviews but only two emails. Lack of emails had me really sad for a bit until I actually checked the stats on ffnet

** I've been getting messages regarding new favorites, followers and reviews. I just got a review that made me smile. :D

** The e-mails are a little screwed-up. I just now got e-mails for reviews I received last week.

** Yeah I'm not getting them either. I thought it was just me at first, but since it isn't I should report the bug.
