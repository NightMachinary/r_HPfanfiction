Absolutely not trying to hate, I've never stopped reading a story because of this but I just find that it's better when an author says “Harry used a Tooth Cleaning charm” rather than “Harry muttered _lavit dentes_” I just think there are more to creating spell incantations than just putting the names through google translate. It works pretty well for longer ritualistic chants though

***** And of course Rowling has things like this anyway:

“Like what kind of weapon?” said Harry. “Something worse than the Avada Kedavra --- ?”

"“But there can't be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse, can there?” said Ron."

"As far as I am aware, they do not know to this day how the Riddles died, for the Avada Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage."

"“--- more Death Eaters arrived --- and then Snape --- and Snape did it. The Avada Kedavra.” Harry couldn't go on."

But ignoring spells that require so much intent, the point stands.

****** In my opinion...

While saying the incantation they would have to be trying to cast it, otherwise the teachers would be constantly casting the spells while teaching the students. I believe even in the first book they had the classes repeating the incantation before learning the wand movements, then putting it together and trying to cast it.

If you just had to say the words then you would have a class full of spells going off just teaching the incantation. So to me it makes sense they have to be channeling their magic, whether aware of it or not, and intend to cast the spell for it to work.

I believe a lot of fanfics say it's all about your intent and the spells themselves aren't good or evil. And I can see this applying to casting it as well. Especially when you get into wandless or silent casting. Cause that shows you don't need the wand movement or incantation but just want to cast it. It also helps explain accidental magic like Harry growing back his hair after Petunia cut it since there is no incantation or wand movement involved.

*** This. I've always wondered why authors write the incantation when referring in prose to a spell. Take a Stunner for instance. Though probably unlikely, is there not a chance, especially if an author is twisting the lore to make wands less necessary than canon, that saying "Stupefy" to refer to a Stunner could cause the person to cast it? That feels like a hazard, the likes of which would need to be addressed early in magical education the way, for example, firearms instruction says to keep the trigger finger off the trigger until ready to fire.

**** When authors twist lore to make wands less necessary, they basically do it by making magic purely intent. That also makes the words unnecessary. Which is also canon for everyone at NEWT level anyway. If magic is purely intent based, it doesn't matter whether they refer to a spell by its name (e.g. Stunner or Stunning Spell) or its incantation (e.g. Stupefy) because neither will do anything without the intent and either will work with the intent. You could say or think "Banana" and if the intent is to stun, that's what it'll do.

** For me it depends on context: Expelliarmus vs. disarming charm is pretty obvious for every reader, but if the author makes a habit of intoducing new spells I probably won't remember every incantation. And in this case 'lavit dentes' would tell me exactly nothing.

My favourite way of saying it would be "Harry cleaned his teeth with a quick spell", since it gives me all the information I need.

The only time I've done Latin sentences was for full rituals, such as the ones in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27669059/chapters/67710647][this one-shot]] for time-travel, Fidelius and draining magic of non-Purebloods respectively.

** Yes. For one thing, half the Latin in these stories is just run through Google translate. Like your example, "lavit dentes"? It translates to "he washed the teeth," when presumably you'd want an imperative, 1st person active, or 3rd person passive subjunctive. And that's just 2 words; the ones where someone does a ritual with full Latin sentences just turn into a mess of bad Latin.

For another thing, I don't think spells are hyper specific in the HP universe. So you wouldn't really have a spell just for brushing teeth. Maybe you have a general body-cleaning spell instead; something like "lavetur." Then you aim at what you want washed and it does it. It's not like you need to say "Wingardium leviosa chair" to make the chair float, after all.

Third, JKR didn't use straight Latin for most of her spells. A lot of them are bastardized Latin or something else. So why should fan-made spells all be clean Latin? Yes, I realize this contradicts with my first point, but it's 2 different things. The issue there is that people trying to use proper Latin don't; I'm saying don't even try to use real Latin. So let's go back to our Tooth Brushing Charm, which is now a generic Body Cleaning Charm. "Lavetur" is the 3rd person passive subjunctive of "lavo," translating out as "Let/may it be cleaned." Let's bastardized that into Laveto," which is a nonsense word that souds vaguely Latin-ish and shares a root with "lavo."

Finally, as you say in the original post, it's really best to use the name of the spell. We might talk about Voldy AK'ing something on reddit, but that's not how literally anyone in the series talks. They won't say "Bellatrix crucio'd Neville's parents until they went crazy." They say " Neville's parents were under the Cruciatus," "Bellatrix used the Cruciatus," etc. It just sounds weird and unnatural the other way.

**** One issue that is ignored is /why/ the spells are in Latin, namely that to English speakers, Latin is an exotic language associated with 'hidden knowledge'.

But the ancient Romans themselves rarely used their native Latin in their own spells. Too commonplace. They often preferred using Coptic or Armenian in their spells, two exotic (to them) languages linked to the ancient hidden magics of the Pharaonic and Zoroastrian priests (e.g. the cults of Isis and Mithra). Human nature doesn't change.

When somebody told her to research the language that was used for the spells in the Merlin show, she threw a fit, called everyone in the fandom haters, and deleted her fics.

I mean, sometimes making up spells works if you understand the canon material to do so, but at other times it doesn't. I am sure that fanfic authors make up their own language for spells and enchantments in the Harry Potter fandom as well.

** For the flow of the story I prefer descriptive text versus spell names as well. That is mostly only though only a few ff writers have fun with spell names.

The majority of the time it is just words thrown through an online translator, which is sad.

I enjoy learning new languages as a hobby and learned Latin in middle school. Rowlings spells are fun but clearly bullshit which means ff writers are free to go batshit crazy with spell words.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/lh2k29/snape_dies_earlier_than_in_canon/gn3s2kg][I explained how I came up with an incantation for fiendfyre]]. I wish more writers had fun with the freedom her bullshit incantations offer the world of magic.

Before Rowlings a good deal of magic stories had any worded spell use being extremely exact. She came along and was all 'hmm a spell to make a feather float... wing, levitate...uh wing..ar..dium? Levi..o..sa? Cracking good idea that!'

** I'm not that bothered. What I do like though is when authors just show the effect of a spell. Wandless casting is a thing all wizards should learn at their later years at hogwarts.

** I really do hate it when people abbreviate the incantations, for example using AK instead of spelling out Avada Kedavra

*** I don't mind it in casual conversation, like “Yeah if it wasn't for Harry I might've taken an AK to the head”

** Well, if a spell exists that doesn't have a given incantation, that sounds to me like creative licensing. I would likely end up using them in conjunction like this:

Person Man used Spell Name. “He says the incantation.”

** Definitely. The only time I write out an incantation is when it's relevant that "Stupify" is quicker to say than "Avada Kedavra."

** Harry took the machine from the closet, plugged the end of the power cord into an appropriate outlet, flipped the switch, and the machine went brrrrrrrrrrrrr. He pushed it over the carpet until all the little pieces of detritus were cleared.

Then he took out his wand, did a swish and flick while saying, "WingGARdium leviOsa!" The Hoover lifted onto the stairs which Harry cleaned next.

Fuck yeah, that's how you show don't tell.
