Everyone's always having high tea or a "Full English Breakfast" or swanning around being unbearable toffs. Everything's Lord this and Lady that.

** Tbh I've always thought the lord/lady thing referred to a handful of tropes/concepts.

P.S I get the post is poking fun at the trope but I couldn't help but explain my thoughts.

P.S 2: I did actually have a fic to recommend but when I went to post it I found out it doesn't exist anymore. I do hate FFN some days. To briefly explain it best I can:

Imagine, if you will. The stereotypical lordship fic, but Harry absolutely RIPS into magical England using his newfound position and money to essentially become a political dictator. And literally no one questions it because in the fic the lordship title is essentially diplomatic immunity as he uses loopholes in the laws to walk all over people. The fic explains this away by saying ‚Äújust because no one uses a law, doesn't mean it doesn't exist‚Äù it was hot trash but it was funny hot trash.

Anyhow, my two current thoughtbunnies regarding lordships. A.

A holdover from the Victorian basis for magical England. Lords and Ladies generally struck me as the sort of title you'd bestow upon the exceptionally wealthy elites of the community.

‚Ä¢ The title for head of family, there's no real power, but calling say, the Malfoy family head ‚ÄúLord Malfoy‚Äù sounds like a hold over. Especially if the families in question were the 1% so to speak. Far as I'm aware, money got you a *lot* during that period. This is one way I think of it, as it would also explain why say, the newer families or the less wealthy aren't called such. It's a historical holdover of the arostocracy (right term?)

B.

It's just a political term.

Take the classic trope of ‚Äúonly the lords have seats on the wizengamot‚Äù. If you go that route, you can safely say that:

‚ÄúA lord or lady is someone who's got a say in the political environment. Be it part of the voting bloc, or having a say in the making of laws or legislation, or even simply part of the judicial system.

This plays into both canon and fiction, as I'm pretty sure the list of names said during the actual book showings of the Wizengamot include people like Malfoy, Longbottom, (I think Avery, Nott, and Greengrass are mentioned by surname, but not as people). These families are typically the ones you'd tack a ‚ÄúLord‚Äù onto purely because of their station.

I remember a fic where rather than lordships being a properly defined station they were used exclusively for the Wizengamot. Specifically, as a group it was called the ‚ÄúLords of the Wizengamot‚Äù with each person in the collection being a Lord or Lady of the body. The title was associated with the organization rather than the person. The fic actually included people like Umbridge as one of these ladies. It was actually a surprisingly /not/ terrible fic.
