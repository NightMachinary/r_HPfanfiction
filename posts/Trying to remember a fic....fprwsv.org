:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
New here, and not sure if this is the proper place to ask this, but here I go:\\
So a bit ago, I read this Ronmione fic - but silly me, ended up forgetting the name. It was a bit long - around 40+ chapters, if I remember correctly, and mainly just talked about the interim period.\\
I do remember a few plot points, if that'll help: I remember Hugo being taken at one point, Hermione having troubles with her dad, and, if my my memory serves right, the last chapter was the marriage of Scorpio and Rose...\\
I also remember reading it on fan fiction.net if that's any help.
