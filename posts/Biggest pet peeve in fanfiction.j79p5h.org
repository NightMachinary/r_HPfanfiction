Is the trope about the killing curse severing the connection to their soul and it killing them. Like isn't it established that dementia literally suck the soul out of someone but it doesn't kill them? It's so weird that people don't make thatt connection


** I hate it when authors refer to characters as 'the red-head' 'the blond' etc. Just use their names and pronouns ffs. It annoys me so much I'll usually abandon the fic.

** House elves need to "bond" with a family to survive.

Completely undermines Dobby and his quest for freedom. Either he's lying or he's suicidal.

After that it's Ron bashing, I nope right out as soon as I see it.

** 1-)"Goblin King Hidranius Potter Black Peverell Merlin Griffindor Slytherin Azkaban Ravenclaw Huflepuff Pendragon Stares Voldemort in the eye and Voldie explodes due to being inferior to sheer awesomeness oozing out of Lord Hidraniuses skin" trope.

2-) Dumbledore is essentially a much less honorable Grindewald trope.

3-) Unnecesary Bashing.

4-)Romance between 40 years old time traveler in a 12 year olds body and an actual 12 year old.

5-)Married by kissing trope

** It's a stupid thing to get angry about, but the clothes always bother me. Fanfic writers always use the movie versions of the Hogwarts uniform with the colored trim and open robes over normal school uniforms. They forget that the average pureblood wizard doesn't even know what pants are.

*** Hogwarts uniform includes a shirt in the books:

#+begin_quote
  “The Inquisitorial Squad, Granger,” said Malfoy, pointing towards a tiny silver ‘I' on his robes just beneath his prefect's badge. “A select group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic, hand-picked by Professor Umbridge. Anyway, members of the Inquisitorial Squad do have the power to dock points... so, Granger, I'll have five from you for being rude about our new Headmistress. Macmillan, five for contradicting me. Five because I don't like you, Potter. Weasley, your shirt's untucked, so I'll have another five for that. Oh yeah, I forgot, you're a Mudblood, Granger, so ten off for that.”

OotP Chapter 28

Suits are worn by pure-bloods:

#+begin_quote
  The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a scarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm he carried a lime-green bowler.

  “That's Dad's boss!” Ron breathed. “Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic!”
#+end_quote

CoS Chapter 14

The only wizard depicted as ignorant of pants is Archie, the wizard at the World Cup in GoF, who is depicted as eccentric.

*** I agree! The Weasleys I get, because of Mr. Weasley's muggle obsession, but everyone else... robes aren't just a cloak. Though it makes me curious about the idea of jumpers, which we know about from canon. Mrs. Weasley, who is unfamiliar with most things muggle, still knit them for her kids. So are they considered wizarding clothing or not?

** It's not my "biggest" pet peeve, but I'm always a bit annoyed when I read "Magical Core", especially because it's not something you can dodge by playing with the tags.

** - shopping scenes. Idk if this sounds petty but I don't want to read a super long chapter where Harry gets all these new clothes, new books, something new with his hair, etc

- Harry is super knowledgeable with wizarding politics (addressing people like Malfoy as "Lord") and is super smooth with the ladies

- Harry is acting super girlish or childish

*** Personally i hate grown up Harry more than childish Harry. Like I get he had a horrible childhood and would be more mature than the average child. But that doesn't mean he should be all, "we have dealt a devastating blow against the dark this day, but we must be wary as lifes equilibrium always moves to oppose the changes we have made!" when he is 11 yrs old

** Dumbledore bashing in any shape or form. Can't count how many great stories I've dropped because of even a hint of Dumbledore bashing.
