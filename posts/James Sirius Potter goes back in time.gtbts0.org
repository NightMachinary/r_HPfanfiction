  AU, post-DH. Harry Potter is dead. Voldemort and his Death Eaters run rampant, and the only ones capable to stop him are the broken remains of the Order of the Phoenix. When desperation strikes the resistance, James Sirius Potter is sent back in time in order to finish Voldemort once and for all -- and maybe get to know the father he'd lost. [Semi-Omnipotent MC.]
