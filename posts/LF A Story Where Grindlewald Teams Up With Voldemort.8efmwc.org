I was thinking of doing this in my own story, but then I realized I'd just rather read about it. Preferably a story of decent length where, at some point, Voldemort breaks Grindlewald out of Nurmengard and the two team up to actualize their goals (preferably Grindlewald's escape is not immediately discovered by the world at large). Yes I know they didn't have the same goals, maybe someone can find a way they could be fine with a temporary arrangement. I dunno, work it out for me!

They don't have to be the MCs (although that could be cool), nor do they even have to win. I'd just like to see any decent stories where this happens.
