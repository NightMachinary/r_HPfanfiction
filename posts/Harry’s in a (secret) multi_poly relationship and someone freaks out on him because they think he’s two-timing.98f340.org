*** Do you by chance remember in which part her father discovers it? Maybe even a rough estimate of which chapter of that part?

I have read the trilogy a long time ago but still remember too much of it too reread it completely. I just would really like to reread this scene.

**** I took a look and it's at the very beginning of Journeyman. Also it seems it's not her father but (great?) grandfather.

*** Does Harry ever calm down in this fic? The description tells me it won't happen for a while. The first few chapters is just him screaming/shouting/roaring constantly. It's getting tiresome.

** A "secret" multi/poly relationship just sounds like cheating.

**** Lol it'd be pretty hard to have a poly relationship if you're the only person to know about it. Actually, that would be funny to read. Dumbass protagonist thinks he's in a polyamorous relationship with multiple girls, only to have all of them dump him when they find out about the other girls. Or maybe they string him along with some dastardly plan.

***** Have you played Persona 5? The main protagonist can date all the girls and then he gets caught on Valentine's Day.

****** Oh god, really? I never actually tried to do that. After I realized it was possible in 4 I decided in 5 that I just didn't want that. So I didn't try. Now I want to replay it just to get him in trouble!
