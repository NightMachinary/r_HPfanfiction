Like the title says, I'm having trouble accessing fanficauthors.net and I was mid story. Checked to see if it was just me and it's apparently the whole site is down.

I was hoping it was a just me thing actually. Restarted my phone, closed every single app and still nada. I've been trying all day.

Barring anyone knowing when the site will be back up, if it will be (fingers crossed!), does anyone have HP and the Junior Year Abroad by Ishtar?? I'd like to finish the story, it was really good!


** Just a hint: if it works at least for couple of minutes, [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare]] (as a command line tool or a Calibre plugin) can download whole book as EPub locally.

** Really hoping it comes back up. I was mid way through re-reading Hope by Jeconais and really want to finish it!

So if anyone has a copy of that, please share. :)

*** I'm not sure but there's a few groups.io that might have it in their files?! Caer Azkaban and Snorkak are the two that I'm in.

**** Thanks! Managed to find it on Scribd. However, I was also able to access a bunch of other fics I wanted to read (This Means War; White Knight, Grey Queen) via google cached pages. Just tried it on HP and the Junior Year Abroad and it works for that too, so maybe you could grab it via that?
