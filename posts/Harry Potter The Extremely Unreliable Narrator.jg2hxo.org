Had an idea, wondering if anyone has attempted it before.

Basically, Harry Potter is an extremely reliable narrator, and canon is his internal telling of his (actually quite normal) school years.

​

Harry is a war orphan, disfigured during the war. He was placed with his closet living relatives through the normal process.

Harry has an *extremely* active imagination.

When he is told about a secret world of magic (which is all quite sensible thank you), he imagines up that he is a hero who was set upon by the villain of the last war.

He is an anti-social boy who hangs out with just a few friends, those who seem willing to put up with his references to his imaginary friend, dubbed "You Know Who".

He befriended a young bookish Hermione Granger, after saving her from the collapse of a toilet stall (likely shaken loose by previous pranks). She finds him enjoyable to hang out with, although he keeps talking about trolls for some reason.

At the end of the year, he happens apron the rituals and hexes instructor who had been supervising a 7th year's project and managed to hex himself. The professor was eventually fine, but he retired from teaching.

Later in the second year, a wave of students fell ill to a bout of Unicorn Fever. When students got it they had to quarantine in the Hospital wing, still able to study but unable to attend class. Harry runs into a young girl as she passes out from symptoms. Harry valiantly brings her to the Hospital wing, which was just beginning to process the medication. The girl is grateful for his assistance, but isn't quite sure why he is talking about giant snakes and possessions.

etc.


** Most students and teachers merely ignore his off-hand, off the wall comments. He isn't violent and it doesn't block him from doing his school work or playing with his friends.

One exception is a slightly younger student named Luna Lovegood. She steadfastly refuses to entertain Harry's nonsense, and insists on correcting him every time he says something wrong. Although her friends (and his friends) have told her to give it up as pointless, she believes if she is just firm enough in corrections, maybe it will sink in.

Dolores Umbridge was a psychologist brought in to help students with the aftermath of the 'special teambuilding exercises'.

To help students who seem to be having troubled development at boarding schools, the association of schools created a program where students identified with similar issues were grouped and participated in extracurricular, teambuilding exercises. As a cross school event, it involved many students spending an away year at neighboring schools. Harry, Fleur, and Viktor were all identified as having trouble integrating socially and seemed to be living in their own world. (Viktor was convinced he was a major sports star).

An upper-classman (Cedric) volunteered to help the group out as part of his senior project. However, disaster struck Harry's group and during one of the exercises Cedric broke both his legs. He is now homeschooled while recovering.

As the students in the group saw it, Delores was brought in to help them work through any issues with seeing a fellow student maimed. As much as she tried with Harry, she could not get him to abandon his delusions.

I think I read a fic like this. But I think it was Hermione. Who in the epilogue published their lives as the HP books in the muggle world. It was something like "The Dursleys weren't that bad..." "Harry, they put bars on your window." "There were a lot of break-ins that summer! ALL of the windows had bars!"

I can't remember the name of the fic...

**** If we're thinking of the same fic, he told her that he had to have a /very/ awkward conversation with Dudley, who he was still on good terms with because they both bore the brunt of Vernon and Petunia being joyless authoritarians.

It finished with Daphne Greengrass (who'd binned the magical world to succeed as a model and was trying the model-turned-actress route) reading for the part of Professor McGonnagall in the movie.

****** If I'm remembering aright - and buggered if I can find it on FFN, which is where I'm pretty sure it's posted - it starts with Tracey Davis going to a muggle bar for one last fling before her arranged marriage and running into Harry. He was between jobs of basically slaughtering troublesome dark wizards.

** Here's the thing.

It's not uncommon for a character to be an unreliable narrator. It can be a wonderful thing in a twisty plot to have a character who lies, misremembers or just plain wasn't paying attention.

With Rowling, we have a situation where the author is an unreliable narrator, which is a thestral of an entirely different colour.

It's bloody amazing that she made such an outstanding world an characters in what is arguably such a broken set of books.

*** As a kid who had to wait for months and even years for each book to come out, I loved reading each book as I discovered more about the magical world with Harry.

It was only years later and reading fanfics that made me think of stuff that didn't make sense in-universe. But I try not to think of them too much anymore because JKR was clearly making up stuff as she went along. She's no Tolkien who wrote the whole LOTR as one book which just had to be broken up into 3 parts.

*** Clearly Ron, a scion of a well-to-do family, is annoyed by his father's stringent 'you will all learn to live within your means' meaning a strict, low allowance. He connects with Harry as someone who won't criticize his lack of ability to spend at his station.

"Ron, The Centaurs are attacking the Toad! Quick, we got to go!"

"Ok Mate"

/whsiper to Hermione/ "Toad?"

"Dr. Umbridge. I think she was called away? We should follow him before he gets himself in trouble."

(For anyone who doesn't get it, Ron is Jimmy from Thoroughly Modern Millie)

The Adventures of Ron and Hermione following around the crazy Kid and translating into regular speak for him.
