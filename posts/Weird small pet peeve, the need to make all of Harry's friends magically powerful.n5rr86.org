I notice a lot of fics decide that anyone who Harry is friends with also is also very talented and powerful. I dislike this because it kinda cheapens the concept. Like, Harry being very powerful makes sense, he has to beat Voldemort and also has to do with without spending 20 years training. But by making all his friends powerful, it kinda implies anyone can just decide to become powerful? And makes the protagonist of the story less useful. You can write characters who are very useful in a war but aren't power houses.


** I WISH there were more stories where everyone has the same power but it was the dedication, skill and learning that made people truely powerful. I get bored of the MC who are super strong for no reason except they are the MC. Even if they are a 13 year old.

** Isn't it literally a choice to be 'powerful', though? Voldemort and Dumbledore didn't just sit around and just one day became powerful, they spent their lives studying magic and perfecting their skills in it. You aren't simply born with a bigger MaGICaL cOre, you have to truly dedicate yourself to the study of magic. So in that sense, yes, anyone can 'just decide' to be powerful. Also, I don't see exactly why Harry should be more deserving or logical for him to be powerful just because a prophecy says he will have to defeat Voldemort. I didn't know you could buff your love stat by becoming a world-renowned duellist.

*** It's a decision in the same way anyone can decide to be Einstein. Which is to say - you can certainly decide to /try/, and if you do work hard at it, you will definitely see /some/ results, but whether you achieve your goal depends a lot on your mind.

And by mind I don't just mean your intelligence but also your intuition. If you want to be Einstein you need to look at the world in a way that allows you to see connections other people don't, because that aspect of the world just makes sense to you. There are plenty of very intelligent people who can learn physics by rote, doing the mathematics etc., without ever having an intuitive grasp of the concepts the mathematics represents. Those people will never be on Einstein's level, no matter how smart they are, because they lack his intuition.

*** OP didn't mention magical cores and, for a sub that dislikes them so much, you guys bring them up a lot for no reason.

There's a whole lot of nuance in power and skill that goes beyond dedication to study. Hermione, Snape, and Dumbledore all did that and, at age 17, all these characters were at different skill/power levels. Remus dedicated himself to study more than Sirius and Sirius was still the better wizard. We even see it on a spell by spell level. Luna had to coax a patronus out of Harry because the 3/4 already produced couldn't get the job done.

Fan fiction lacks that nuance on both sides of this argument. Sinyk having Harry's group of friends be master duelists, animagi, and on the same level is just as boring and ridiculous as your standard lone wolf, Indy Harry.

**** Except Hermione's studies weren't exactly in areas that would make her more conventionally more powerful, were they? While she studied for her classes as well as history and magical law, Dumbledore was experimenting and publishing his works in scholarly journals while still at Hogwarts. Snape for his part focused himself in certain areas (spells and potions) and, again, experimented. Hermione might have some creative or clever uses of magic throughout the books, but she's very... well, by-the-book.

As for Sirius and James? Well, you got me. By all evidence, they shouldn't be as successful academically as they are reported considering they're reported to somehow being top of their class, trying to become animagi, making the map, doing a shit ton of rule-breaking and bullying, Quidditch and having the time to just chill on the grounds with friends at the same time. Which, really, just feels like Rowling falling into the pitfall of telling instead of showing.

Literally, no one in Harry's year is even close to having done as much as any of the Marauders or Lily or Snape, and considering Rowling straight-up called Hermione a genius, I think is telling.

Neither were Tom Riddle's yet he was "probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts had ever seen." And that wasn't your argument. You said they dedicated themselves to study. I pointed out that other characters dedicated themselves to study and weren't as good, so obviously there's more to "power" than dedication to study and choice as you just pointed out by tacking on "experimented."

Edit: Hermione also didn't just study for her classes.

#+end_quote

I don't see why this edit was necessary, since I said Hermione studied history (as in things magically-raised children would know about and not necessarily something that would be taught in HoM) and magical law. Hermione is advanced in her classes (i.e. Protean Charm) but it's still, you know, her classes. Hermione is a good researcher, but the bits of magic she finds that don't pertain to the standard curriculum aren't the results of a self-drive to research magic, they come from a necessity.

In CoS, Hermione only researches and finds about Polyjuice and the Basilisk because of the yearly mystery. In GoF, the whole arsenal of spells she finds and practises are only to help Harry through the Tournament. Her whole thing in OotP is because she doesn't want to fail a class when the teacher refuses to teach and forbids the usage of practical defensive magic.

Hermione is a character I love dearly, but she simply doesn't have the drive or even the true interest in researching less standard or less well-known magic. She didn't dedicate her entire life to the study of magic, she was a student who studied a lot while in school, big difference. Remus also may have studied more while in school than James and Sirius, but that's still in school. I'm pretty sure Remus didn't dedicate the 15 years between graduation and getting hired by Dumbledore to studying magic and honing his skills just to end up somewhat on par with a freshly escaped Sirius Black. The guy was between Snape household and Gaunt shack quality of life during those years, not really conducive for scholarly pursuits.

Because memory modifying charms, the Confundus Charm, and a host of other spells she learned weren't class topics. /I/ don't like Hermione, but there's a sweet middle ground between genius and she studied history, law, and for her classes.

#+begin_quote
  she was a student who studied a lot while in school
#+end_quote

Which is why I compared her to 17 year Dumbledore and Snape to point out there's more to dedicating yourself to study, which was /your/ argument. Given that OP speaks of a Harry who "doesn't spend 20 years training" they're also speaking of people who haven't "dedicated their life to study."

Yet Remus stuck to low level DEs in OotP while Sirius matched Bellatrix spell for spell. He also seems to have been murdered by someone not much older than him and was in Azkaban longer than Sirius.

******** I don't really get the comparison between Snape and Hermione. 17 year old Hermione has shown much more magical skill than 17 year old Snape has:

1. She is able to learn a year's worth of material in 2 months with minimal effort in multiple books

2. She is able to master more than 3 months worth of charms in a few hours on the Hogwarts Express in 2 books

3. She is shown to be extremely knowledgeable in Alchemy, protective charms, healing magic, advanced dark magic, enchanting, and random obscure and helpful charms

4. She is able to cast multiple charms that were said to be extremely complex on her first try, such as the False Memory Charm, the Memory Charm, and the Undetectable Extension Charm. She also implied that she didn't spend a lot of time learning them and knows much more magic on that level

5. She was able to make a potion in her second year that is allegedly "best left to highly skilled wizards"

6. She was able to cast a jinx that professional Minstry officials and a professional Healer could not undo, so it just faded naturally over the course of a few years like regular acne does. We know that it isn't advanced dark magic since it faded and is referred to as a jinx, so the reason nobody could undo it is unknown, although many believe it is because she created the spell.

7. She was able to master nonverbal casting in minutes, while Harry never showed the ability to do so (with spells that weren't tailored to be cast that way) in the books, unless you count Cursed Child.

That isn't the extent of her skill, of course, since the only reason a lot of these points came to be in the first place was because it was important to the plot, but I think it still outstrips what we see of Snape's magical ability at a similar age. The only impressive thing he did was modifying potions and creating a few dark spells, but comparing Hermione to him in that area is extremely unfair, as the Dark Arts and Potions are his specialties. Hermione's specialties are researching about the yearly debacle, Arithmancy, history, and law, and she does extremely well in all of them (except maybe for Arithmancy, since all we know is that she got an O and reads lots of extracurricular books on it).

I'm also pretty confused about the comparison between Lupin and Sirius. Firstly, Sirius did not match Bellatrix "spell for spell". He was just shown as engaging her in a duel, and then when the narration focused its attention back on the duel, a spell of hers missed and her second spell struck him. The fact that Pottermore implied that Lupin would have at least stalemated or even won against Dolohov, who is the second most impressive Death Eater by feats, if he hadn't stayed home with Tonks and his son is more impressive to me IMO. Also, his strategy of sticking to mid-tier Death Eaters in the DoM obviously worked better, since he was the only Order member left standing, while Sirius was the only Order member who was killed. Secondly, what does duelling ability have to do with magical ability? Hermione's more skilled than Harry, but in the first 6 books, she would be stomped by Harry in a fight.

As an aside note, why did you state Dolohov wasn't much older than Remus even though it's still unknown by the fandom whether he was the Dolohov that was part of teen Tom Riddle's gang or not?

********* Honestly, Hermione was boosted by Rowling to be the second Lily or something. It is plain obvious at times.

Anyways, Snape created his own spells (Muffiliato, Sectumsepra, Levicorpus).

He also modified potion recipes to be more effective, etc. His notes allowed Harry to do better than Hermione in class!

Snape was probably more 'genius' than Hermione - becuase genius doesn't mean just being able to memorize stuff from books. He is the youngest potion master, too.

Hermione is smart as well, but she is one of those smart individuals that know everything from the book but have little outside-the-box thinking or creativity. It shows whenever she hissed at Harry for not cooking his potions like advice in the books. She saw that his methods were more effective, but she didn't care and stubbornly followed the 'less effective' recipe.

Her 'genius' with spells isn't that impressive either. Sure, she could do some advanced spells, but so could Harry. The Patronus, for example.

Hermione was basically turned into that character that knows about most stuff, by reading lots of books - easy excuse. Whenever the Golden Trio faces a problem, there is a high chance that Hermione knows the solution to it, and readers were not surprised by it becuase that's what her character is supposed to be like. But there also scenes where she should know stuff, but then doesn't becuase it isn't convenient yet.

Idk, I would say that Hemione is an above-average witch - definitely. But she isn't a genius. She is mostly a jack-of-all-trades kind of character that excels in many subjects, but not to a degree where she can be called genius. I mean, Harry did better than her simply by owning Snape's old potions book.\\
On the other hand, Snape is a genius in Potions. The book didn't show much of his skills in that area, but it must have been impressive since Voldy held Snape in high regard ( since he reached Snape his super awesome unsupported flying ability).

****** Riddle could control his magic before he even visited Hogwarts. He was even aware that he was magical without knowing that this stuff really existed.

Idk, guys like him are naturally powerful. Give them some books with spells and you have a powerhouse.

*** Well, I assume that there /are/ people who are born powerful.\\
Voldemort could do some magic tricks, controlled tricks, well beyond his years at Hogwarts. The kids that bully him in the orphanage were harrassed back by him, using magic. That level of control shows magical power above the norm. He wasn't aware of any spells etc. but was able to control his innate power, weaponize it.\\
Other kids can't do that, they perform accidental magic that comes with random effects.

That proves that some people are born much more powerful than others, I guess. Just like some are born squibs - magical, but with too little magic inside them to actually use their powers.

Dedication and hard work /will/ pay off, and so on. But some people are simply born powerful, better than the average. If they become truly powerful later on in their lives, that depends on their level of dedication and ambition.

Someone that has, let's say, a 'manapool' of 250 due to his good 'genes' won't need as much hard work as someone with a manapool of 100.\\
The guy with the bigger amount of magic at his disposal will be able to cast more spells, more powerful spells, without exhausting as fast, etc.

Hermione was undoubtedly a hard worker. She knew a lot of stuff and had great insight into many topics, but she was still 'weaker' than Harry in practical magic. That doesn't make her actually weaker, but it is a factor - especially in the big leagues.

Idk, I think Snape is probably only second to Voldy and Dumbledore in knowledge when it comes to the Dark Arts, etc. But I doubt he would have a chance against Bellatrix in a duel. That woman is known for her ferociousness and her power with the wand.

So, with all that said, I think that some people are born stronger than others, but a ripped guy with good genes and bulging muscles won't necessarily be stronger in a fight than a professional martial arts guy. One has the power, the one got the skill.\\
But there are people that combine this, these are the true monsters.
