Just, please, Harry with guys of his generation.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816][Away Childish Things]] likao3(16052816) is probably my new favourite Drarry. Harry (and then Draco) is deaged, and it's the best exploration of how their respective childhoods shaped them I've seen in fics.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/118431][Little Red Courgette]] likao3(118431) Drarry, political comedy set in the Ministry

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10513749][You Send Me (Honest You Do)]] likao3(10513749) Drarry, Harry and Draco are Auror partners

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] series likao3(9323225), another one of my all-time favourites, has Drarry in the later parts, although it's not the focus of the story.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15260055][Vellum Voices]] likao3(15260055) Harry/Blaise. 5th year, Harry is cursed to speak only Parseltongue

** Bond, by Anna Fugazzi is probably my favorite Drarry fic. I've reread it several times over the years. It was written before HBP came out, though, so it's an AU seventh year fic.

(Fingers crossed I got this bot thing right!)

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.
