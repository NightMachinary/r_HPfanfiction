** There can be some good points about writing a self-insert I suppose, as you know how you would react to a situation, which probably makes writing dialogue and thoughts a lot easier.

The thing that most people who use self-inserts do wrong however, is that they make the character an idealised version of themselves. This often leads to an annoyingly perfect character, even to the point of creating a Mary Sue.

So I would say, if you use a self-insert, have a good think about not just your good qualities, but also your flaws and how both would come into play in the story your character is part of.

Another thing to keep in mind is that if your self-insert is Harry's twin in your case, so it's likely the character has grown up very differently than you have. So you might want to consider to what extent that upbringing makes the character's personality and actions different from yours.

** The most important thing to do would be to be very subtle about your knowledge. Lets say that you want to get Harry away from the Dursleys. Instead of coming up with some complicated scheme to free Sirius, catch Pettigrew and get emancipated, keep it simple. Perhaps find a way to contact the Tonks family via phone book and a phone box and claim that you have a vague memory of them or some Divination bullshit. Instead of exposing the evil potion Queen Molly Weasley, first of her name, just avoid the Weasleys if you don't like them.

I'm assuming a lacking knowledge of magic here (you don't know how to cast spells) so instead of trying to /fix/ the books as fast as you can, you will spend a lot of time learning magic. Your peers will be 11 year old children so you won't find them good company. Find yourself a mentor (Penelope Clearwater, one of the background Professors) so you can actually have someone close to your mental age to talk to.

And, as [[/u/amy713]] said, have flaws. For example, were I to write a SI, he'd be a socially awkward and craven guy. I'd much rather miss an adventure than risk my life. Ginny ended up in the Chamber of Secrets? Sucks to be her. DA? I'm not joining that. You don't need 27 people to learn a shied charm, you can do that with a single friend and so can anyone else. Due to these limitations, I would have to come up with my own solutions instead of simply making myself look good by fixing the canon.

**** Maybe something else like the basement or attic. I don't think that they'd simply abuse them less just because there're two. Whether a girl would end up sexually abused is up to the writer but I feel like Vernon would do it for power's sake, not because he gets off from it.

** Anything /can/ be written well, but equally there will always be someone who doesn't like it. But if you've got a story fighting to get out, write it down; set it free! Don't forget it's not compulsory to post. It's perfectly okay to write a story and keep it to yourself.
