... She quickly took the baby in before any of the neighbors could see and once she finally understood what had happened she was sure of one thing, that baby could not stay. So she quickly grabbed a coat long enough to cover her nightgown, put on a pair of shoes and took the baby to the car heading for the furthest orphanage.

Maybe she left a note with his first name written on it, or maybe he was just given a new name by the staff , thing is that when ten years later a letter arrived at the orphanage addressed to Harry J. Potter, everyone thought it was just a mistake.

This can be either interpreted as a prompt or as a request if you know a story with a similar premise (Harry raised in an orphanage).


** Orphanages didn't exist as such. Maybe she drops him off at a residential home for disturbed children, maybe she leaves him at a church, or a fire station. This Petunia, in this paralel dimension, would want to get the little assassination target as far away from her little Dudders as possible. She's terrified for not just her own life, but for her husband and son, she just learned that her sister was dead, she wouldn't have been thinking clearly at all. I'm not sure what the polar opposite of suburban Surrey would have been. Downtown Birmingham?

So some security guard at some juvenile detention center spots something weird on a security camera, and goes to investigate. A bundled figure is dropping some baby carrier on the ground, and racing back to a waiting car. The security guard approaches, demanding to know what it's all about, but Petunia is too quick, and gets away. The guard takes the baby in. Petunia did not, under any circumstances, want this traced back to her. Maybe she stopped at a Tesco or similar, to swap out Harrys' wizard-made basket and clothes for muggle ones. She would, of course, destroy the note. Maybe she thought she was doing him a kindness, getting as close as she could to a witness protection scheme, and all in a matter of hours. Blood wards, indeed. Who would look for some random kid with a name pulled out of a social workers' arse in the middle of bloody Birmingham?

Meanwhile, the blood wards never took.

Dumbledore would visit personally. Vernon would be shocked to learn about what happened, but he would stand by his wife. They would smugly tell Dumbledore nothing, taunting him about not being able to wave his wand and find Harry through magic means. Dumbledore would bait them into a long back-and-forth. The longer they talk face-to-face, the better Dumbledore can use legilimency on Petunia. Her mind is like a precarious bookshelf, piled with loose papers and haphazard stacks of books. A lesser legilimens would have made like the proverbial hippogrif in the china shop, leaving Petunia a drooling wreck. Not so for Dumbledore. He eventually leaves with all his questions answered, and the Dursleys watch him go with smug satisfaction. The blood wards have failed and Petunia can now do nothing for Harry, and yet, the family might prove to be a liability. Arabella Figg positions herself as Dudleys' occasional baby sitter, just in case.

Meanwhile, Harrys' face is about to be plastered all over the muggle news. Who would abandon this innocent baby? Does anyone have any information on the bundled figure who was spotted abandoning this sweet boy? Why St. Brutus Secure Center, of all places? A number of muggleborns tuning in to the news will be very confused. Harrys' face has already appeared in the Daily Prophet, but how did he fall into muggle hands like that? At least one of them will spill the beans to the general wizarding population that Harry is now living with muggles.

A three-way race ensues, between disgruntled Death Eaters, a frantic Dumbledore, and Rita Skeeter, unable to resist the allure of such a news story, all converging on an unsuspecting foster home in Birmingham. Who should come out on top? I honestly don't know. One thing is certain though, Dumbledore has lost credibility.

**** I couldn't decide on one ending, so I'll throw out a couple ideas on how things might turn out.

Dumbledore arrives at the house last, only to see that it has been reduced to a smoking ruin. The bodies of the foster parents and Rita Skeeter are recovered, but Harrys' isn't found. The muggles go nuts over this turn of events. The news story grows from national to global. All sorts of muggle law enforcement agencies open their own investigations. This puts a strain on the Statute of Secrecy. The Prime Minister himself inquires of the MoM if wizards have anything to do with what happened. The Wizengamot isn't happy with how badly Dumbledore dropped the quaffle, and Dumbledore eventually retires from most public life. Lucius Malfoy spearheads the Dumbledore bashing crew, and he and his allies grab a bigger piece of the political pie than what they had in canon. Ten years later, Harry shows up at Hogwarts, but he's been adopted by Death Eaters, and he becomes one of Dracos' friends. The Death Eaters had scattered after Voldemorts' defeat, and some of them wanted to move on. One of these took Harry in, and raised him with the idea of making a pureblood mascot out of him. When Voldemort returns, Harrys' adoptive parents are unwilling to sacrifice their sons' life, and basically switch sides. Becoming full-fledged Order members would not be easy, but they would eventually find common ground with each other, and take the fight to Voldemort.

Another idea for an ending gives the story a "muggles are awesome" flavor. The muggle authorities threw everything they had at cracking the mystery of the scarred baby abandoned at the juvenile detention center. Petunia is eventually identified, and summoned to a police station for questioning. She breaks under pressure, and confessess everything to the police, explaining all about the wizarding world and warning them that someone might try to kill Harry. The police don't immediately believe all her claims of a wizarding world, and slap her with the legal consequences of dumping ones' nephew at some random location. The Dursleys get their names and faces plastered all over the news, and their reputation is ruined.

A bunch of muggleborns who saw the news take what they know to the authorities. They don't want to break the Statute of Secrecy, but to aid Harrys' safety, they don't necessarily have to. All that needs to be said is that a violent terrorist group killed Harrys' parents, and that Harrys' life is also in danger. Enough people warn enough authorities that Harry is accorded some special protection, and all the social workers that handle him take extra security measures. Eventually, word of the special nature of Harrys' case percolates high enough through the ranks of the muggle authorities, that it reaches someone who must be kept in the loop regarding the wizarding world. It turns out that the Prime Minister is only one guy, and to hold up something as big as the Statute of Secrecy, you need to keep a number of people in a number of places in the loop. Some top men in law enforcement and social services were already in the know, either because a wizard told them everything, or they figured it out on their own. A few of them were muggleborns or squibs themselves. Harry is eventually given to foster parents who live on the fringes of the wizarding world, and he is guarded by police.

Rita Skeeter is very surprised to be rebuffed by wizards. She really expected to just waltz into a muggle home and magic her way into a lurid tale of a wizard child wallowing in muggle squalor. A disgruntled Death Eater is gunned down by an armed police unit. Dumbledore is told off by Harrys' foster parents for his gross incompetency. Harry grows up in a safe, loving, and thoroughly muggle environment. His foster parents eventually adopt him. Harry goes to a perfectly good muggle school, and every Hogwarts representative that tries to convince Harrys' parents to send him to Hogwarts gets told off. When Voldemort comes back and sets his sights on Harry, the muggle authorities step up to protect their own.

***** Ok, someone is not forced to take of a child they dont want. Making them face legal consequences when they were worried about their own safely is ridiculous. Nephews/ family are not entitled to be taken in. Abandoning a child at a orphanage should not be punishable by law. It's like saying, " i know this child is being hunted down by terrorists, but you cannot be allowed to give the child away, we do not care about your safety, you will face consequences is you do not comply.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
