** “Gred and Forge”

IIRC, the gag was only a one time thing when Fred and George swapped Weasley Jumpers on Christmas Day in PS/SS, but it's /everywhere/ in fics.

And don't get me started on twin-speak.

*** I love the way the twins' names are handled in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340][Harry Is a Dragon and That's Okay]] by Saphroneth.

- “We're just thinking of the children,” said George, or possibly Fred.\\
  “Don't want them deafened,” George, or perhaps Fred, agreed.
- “Phew,” George said (Harry had decided to call them both George unless something changed).
- Fred and George (or was it George and Fred? Harry could never remember) interrupted a couple of times...

In various conversations, there's Fred and Maybe Fred; Fred and Other Fred, First Fred and Second Fred...

*** I keep telling people to mix it up a little.

Why not Grorge and Fered? Grug and Frodo? Grf and Eorgd? Making it more and more stupidly unpronouncable would be such a twin thing to do.

Or how about "This is my brother, george. He's the ugly one" and then george goes "Fred isn't the best one to make introductions. He's the stupid one".

And as for twinspeak, here's a post of mine from a few months ago:

** This isn't so much a trope as it is a subtle/funny thing that writers tend to do with characterisation. When writing Remus I've noticed that he usually and without fail will first say whatever it is he has to say, and then the fic writer will end it with the word ‘mildly.'

For ex: “Ah,” Remus said mildly.

I've tended to start giggling when I see it in a fic because I see the word so often with him that it's become funny to me and I can't really explain why. It's great for characterisation but when it's used over and over again no matter how subtlety it makes me want to laugh.

** One thing that's really common is portraying Snape as really calm and level-headed, while he's frequently furious and losing his temper in canon. Recall at the end of PoA when Sirius escapes and Snape is literally spitting with rage and shrieking accusations? Fudge even comments that he seems unbalanced. Fanon-Snape never looses his temper, he just drawls and smirks. Same with Draco Malfoy, really.

** This can easily go wrong; but I like it when Harry, Dumbledore, Voldemort and Grindelwald are more powerfull than your average wizard. But it has to be done tastefully. Harry can't come in his first year already yeeting Dumbledore's wand around. I like it when it's clear that he'll grow up to be on their level to pretty much everyone, but that Voldemort is still a huge threat because the guy has 50 year more experience.

***** I always liked using that as an indication of hidden power, but then I'm torn between that and the merit model. I like the merit model, which is basically

magic power = experience + knowledge + creativity + emotion

and using the emotional impact of scenes like that to boost spells to a ridiculous degree. In one fic, I had Harry hit Bellatrix with a stunner so powerful that it fried her nervous system and ironically left her in the same state as neville's parents after she kills Sirius.

Scenes like that aren't really possible in the lord model.

** - The one that's absolutely ludicrous that I see ALL THE TIME, is that *students get their Hogwarts letters on their 11th birthday*. Harry only HAPPENED to get his on his birthday, after a week of failed attempts, and it was clearly late as THAT DAY was the deadline for replying. McGonagall is not some sort of Hogwarts Social Secretary who sends out birthday greetings all throughout the year. Instead, just like every other school out there, all of the letters are sent out in the summer. So no, Hermione hasn't had a year to read and memorize the books.
- I've seen this referred to as "Little Orphan Susan," where *Susan Bones lives with her Aunt Amelia*. This in fact goes against canon: when Amelia Bones is killed in HBP, it specifically says that she lived alone. Yes, Amelia's brother and his family were all killed in the first war, but she had TWO brothers. It was Susans uncle, aunt, and cousins who were killed, not her own parents.
- Even before her death, *Lily and Petunia hadn't spoken for years* (possibly since Lily's wedding where the Marauders thought it would be cute to do some Muggle-baiting). In the very first chapter, when the Wizarding World is busy celebrating the demise of Voldemort, Vernon Dursley is an unwilling witness to multiple instances of abnormal behavior. He hears reference to "their son Harry," and suspects it might be his nephew. If there had been no communication, he would have no way of knowing his nephew's name.
- *Nymphadora "Say my first name and die" Tonks was still a student in Harry's first year.* Harry meets her after his fourth year, and she has been a qualified auror for a year. Auror qualification is a 3-year course (and hers might have even taken a bit longer because she had trouble with the stealth training). That means she left Hogwarts the summer before he got there.

**** imho the best way to handle Voldemort in a fic like this is as a scarily cognizant cockroach. You can't kill him, he'll always scatter and hide, and if the threat gets too big, he fucks off. Have him disappear and lay low for a few decades while uber-harry and whatever world destroying situation you've conjured up to oppose him clash.

Voldemort is reckless, yes, and arrogant, but he knows when he has a chance. He does not take chances, and he doesn't have honor or attachment to anyone. If anything, he has his squad guard some large and important manor of theirs, fakes a fluctuating magical emission from inside a locked room, anonymously tips off the aurors or the order and blows the entire thing to shreds once they're in viewing distance. Then he apparates out, never to be seen again in the story.

** *Subtle bashing:* Most characters other than the bashed one are smarter, wiser and more mature than canon for no reason, while the bashed one remains the same as before.

*Subtler bashing:* The bashed character as he/she is, is just bad in every single way imaginable, they're wrong on all accounts. They will realize that and completely change themselves, so much so that they've basically become an OC. Or as the author would like us to believe, "character development".

**** I'm just saying that it's not really character development.

This guy explains it much better than I.

#+begin_quote
  A brief word about bashing- it works in many different ways, and in one regard, there are two major types of approaches.

  The first- which is also the simplest, as well as the one most people take- is to leave the characters as unsympathetic individuals who are the butts of everyone's jokes, until the story ends or they die sufficiently painful and humiliating deaths.

  The second, and subtler, variant, involves three stages: 1)Characters are repeatedly abused and victimized- essentially the step that those who use the other type never go past. 2)The characters apologize for everything they've done to the victims, usually without getting any apology of any sort for anything they've suffered. 3)The characters are rebuilt into something desirable that bears little resemblance to their old selves. I call it the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeFic][Revenge]], Repent, Rebuild cycle, after each of the steps. This is different from honest [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment][Character Development]] on a disliked character in that the characters in question regret all their flaws, are shown little sympathy by others or the narrative, and have little of their personality left afterward.

** I've never read a non-cliche-ridden Harry/Harem.

I hate the usual characterization of Sirius as a manchild caught in the past. Despite how plausible a stunted personality would be from a decade-plus of imprisonment and dementors, it's cliche now that all he wants to do is drink or play pranks or both. That sort of trauma would change someone's personality. I'd rather see him as depressed and drinking than some manic prankster or relentless womanizer set on making up for lost time. It seems more likely he'd be suicidal or impotent.

At the risk of offending shippers, IMO H/Hr and H/G as a pairing both seem bland and saccharine, full of cliches. It's hard to find a Hermione or Ginny in a romance who feels alive/realistic. So many cliches/fanon traits make them blur into the same boring romance.
