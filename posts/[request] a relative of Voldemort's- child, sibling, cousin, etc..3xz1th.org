Looking for stories about OCs that are also descended from the Gaunts. Bonus if Voldemort has no idea they exist. (Really want to find a story about Tom Riddle experimenting with sex and having no idea that the girl became pregnant [& possibly Obliviating her after the fact], but I'll take what I can get!)


** Ooh, I've got one! It's something I read years ago. (I wonder how well it would stand up to re-read?) [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=5243][Harry Potter and the Heirs of Slytherin]]

  Isabella Dementa Riddle was the daughter of Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange. Rescued by the Order after Bellatrix's arrest, Dumbledore sent her to live in an American Orphanage away from her parent's dark past. She is forced to transfer to Hogwarts upon her father's return where she meets Harry Potter, the boy who lived. Will he hate her too, or will he see the truth in her?
