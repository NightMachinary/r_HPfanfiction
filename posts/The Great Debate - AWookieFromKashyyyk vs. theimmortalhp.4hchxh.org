*** The International Statute of Secrecy was signed into law in 1689, and the muggle and wizarding worlds fully separated in 1692. It's purpose was to completely rid the muggle world of evidence of a magical people. However, wizarding incompetence violates or comes close to violating the statute on a regular basis. Consider for example, the first book. After the fall of Voldemort, witches and wizards celebrated in the streets of London and all across Britain. They completely and utterly failed to disguise the wizarding world, even going so far as to use magical terms in front of muggles. This is no single exception either. Whenever wizards must come into contact with muggles, the majority of them completely fail to disguise themselves. Famously, Mr. Roberts had to be repeatedly obliviated during the World Cup because many wizards could not fool him at all. Situations like these already poke holes in the Statute of Secrecy.

And magical accidents happen all the time in the muggle world. It's so common that there's a large number of people dedicated to reversing damage caused by wizards outside of Magical Britain (and presumably other nations) including the Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee and the Obliviators (in the Accidental Magical Reversal Squad). And it's only a matter of time before a situation occurs which can't be covered up. During the Second War with Voldemort, the muggles were highly suspicious of the “deaths” that were occurring. Dementors kisses and death eater attacks kill people, and when the numbers get too high, the excuses run out. There's only so many suspicious deaths that can occur before too many muggles figure out that something odd is going on. And Voldemort's war won't be the last one. It may take a while, but there will be future conflicts that spill over into the muggle world, especially as more people live with a foot in both worlds as pureblood supremacists decrease in number. And minor incidents become more and more likely to be accidentally recorded or posted online where their distribution becomes impossible to control without having to resort to extremely complex magic (certainly more than what was discussed in canon).

Not to mention, magic has powerful benefits that muggles could use as well. For example, magical medicine is, in many cases, vastly superior to the corresponding muggle medicines. The ability to regrow entire bones overnight is vastly beyond anything the muggle world can conceive of, and other such miracles are performed on the regular. Countless numbers die because muggle medicine simply wasn't good enough, but in many cases, magical medicine very well could have been. The dissemination of magical medicine is a moral obligation because of the sheer amount of good it could do. And with the number of muggles who would be willing to research magical medicine, the field would likely develop at an accelerated pace compared to the current pace. Wizards and muggles working together would allow for both worlds to bring their best parts together and revolutionize medicine.

One of the big reasons that Voldemort was so capable of taking over Magical Britain was that the community was so small. The best estimates on the wizarding population of Britain fall around 12 to 15 thousand people. Because of this low population, there are very few locations where large numbers of witches and wizards come together. These are essentially Diagon/Knockturn Alley, Hogsmeade, the Ministry, and Hogwarts. Outside of these places, the magical population is essentially composed of homes. For a hostile force (like the Death Eaters) to take over Britain, they only need to seize a few critical locations (which they did). A magical world united with a muggle one allows witches and wizards to mingle with muggles and coexist. A magical store could exist side by side with a muggle store, and no enemy magical force would be able to easily knock out wizarding centers of power.

My final point involved muggle-wizard romances. Love is not limited to wizard-wizard and muggle-muggle relationships, magicals and muggles can and do fall in love. However, many of these relationships end in tragedy because of the Statute of Secrecy. One of the most tragic relationships was that of Merope Gaunt and Tom Riddle Sr (although I hesitate to call it a relationship). Tom Riddle Sr was taken advantage of because he had absolutely no knowledge of the wizarding world. Merope, as a witch, was in a position to dose Tom with love potions because he had no way of knowing that she could do such a thing. In his experience, any love felt was actual love. Without the Statute of Secrecy, he would have been able to realize that love potions were a possibility and would've been on guard for such a thing. Another relationship I point to is that of Minerva McGonagall and Dougal MacGregor. The two of them were engaged, however, Minerva couldn't live hiding her magic for the rest of her life. She gave back the ring and left him because she had no real choice in the situation (choosing to marry him would lead to a lifetime of hiding until their children went to Hogwarts, after which point, Dougal would have been forced to find out). The Statute of Secrecy only causes more pain in these kinds of situations.
