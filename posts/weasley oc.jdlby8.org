:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
looking for a good fanfiction of maybe a weasley sister going by pureblood superiority and turning to the dark side and maybe even becoming a death eater? i never saw a fanfic like that and i'm wondering if there even is


** There is this one fic, but its harry!centric. Ginny gets sorted into Slytherin and kinda gets shamed by most her family for it. Its a very good fic, but Ginny isn't the main focus and she's only properly introduced in the second book. Its mainly about Slytherin politics with no specific pairing yet but I really like how the author portrays the Death Eaters. Might not be what you're looking for but I definitely recommend.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
