Morfin Gaunt, uncle of Lord Voldemort was sentenced to a lifetime in Azkaban after he was framed for the Riddle murders by his nephew. He could speak English as he reportedly confessed committing the Riddle murders. I think that freeing Morfin Gaunt and convincing him to join the Order ( to get revenge on his nephew) will be the ultimate FUCK YOU to Voldemort.


** Oh yes

He would definitely join the order

The dark wizard squib would definitely join an organization that fights the dark arts

*** I thought that the Order was just to fight Voldemort for I fail to see anything that Mundungus Fletcher and Molly Weasley have in common save their enmity to Death Eaters.

Secondly, the only dark magic Morfin used was the pustule hex on Tom Riddle Sr and he stayed about of legal trouble for about 15 years. He is definitely not a squib for he and Marvolo held their own against an Auror team led by the head of DMLE, Ogden.

Thirdly, if Mundungus Fletcher can be recruited by Dumbledore, Morfin's recruitment isn't that far-fetched. He could serve as a Parseltongue translator.

**** I believe Mundungus is just a dealer, not a dark wizard, just does illegal deals and stuff

Harry could also serve as a parseltongue translator.

Well near-squib, the only reason he would be able to stand against an auror is either because the aurors have shit standards or that he used some parselmagic (if that's a thing) and if he did then that would definitely count as dark magic (in ministry eyes)

Only reason he stayed out of legal trouble would be that he didn't have the money or influence for people to just ignore it, or that he was too drunk to care

***** Parselmagic is fanon. I hate it. No evidence to suggest how good or bad he was at magic.

****** Yeeeah, but it's a cool concept and honestly there is no fkin way that Slytherin didn't discover /any/ magic that could be used only by parselmouths.

Maybe we don't have enough info for this argument

Honestly, I want to see Gaunts fighting Riddles for the Heir of Slytherin position.
