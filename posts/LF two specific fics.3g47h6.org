My google-fu has failed me so I hope someone can help me out.

- The first fic was a weird bashing fic? Molly was raising Ginny to marry Harry and was planning to take over her body to re-live her youth, sort of like in the episode 'Witch' in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There was a whole subplot about how she tried to snare James Potter and failed so was trying again.

- The second fic was a point of divergence where Hermione refuses the Prefect badge and eventually gets into a relationship with Harry. I think there was no DA. It's not Weary Wizard by Yunaine however, she rejected the badge before school started.

They are probably fics that no one with good taste admits to reading but they have been niggling at the back of my mind. If anyone can throw out a link, thanks in advance!


** Er... The closest I can think of would be linkffn(Notebooks and Letters), which does have Hermione refusing the Prefect badge, but which isn't actually a point of divergence.
