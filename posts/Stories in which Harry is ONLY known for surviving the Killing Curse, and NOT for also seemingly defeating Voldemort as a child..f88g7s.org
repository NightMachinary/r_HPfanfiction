I had a bit of a realization recently, in that it completely doesn't follow logically speaking that 'Harry Potter survives Lord Voldemort's Killing Curse' and 'Lord Voldemort disappears' implies 'Harry Potter defeated Lord Voldemort'. More plausible and quick-to-come-to-mind explanations for an uninformed outsider would probably include 'Lord Voldemort left for a completely unrelated reason', 'The same thing that protected Harry drove away Voldemort', 'Voldemort never attacked the Potters in the first place, Harry wasn't hit by the curse, and Voldemort's departure is unrelated to both'. So basically, I want Harry to be viewed as a miracle, local celebrity, or as an interesting specimen for magical researchers to pick apart, sure, but /not/ as a /saviour/ specifically.

Now, what /actually/ happened doesn't really matter. I'm only looking for fanfics in which the public reacts realistically to the aftermath of the attack.

(I'm also /not/ looking for stories in which the public reacts the same as in canon, but /individual/ characters hypothesize the above-mentioned theories. Those happen pretty often in indy!Harry, pureblood apologism fics, and such, so there's no problem finding it.)


** The part where they thought Harry survived a killing curse is not that realistic either. They'll probably assume he didn't cast the killing curse at all, but some mysterious unknown curse, and hid away biding his time until the curse did whatever it was meant to...

*** That's true. Or they could even think that Voldemort, for all the monstrosities he had committed, just couldn't pull off enough intent to kill a young child. So the Killing Curse hit and did nothing, not because of any special quality on the part of Harry, but because of the weakness (or some semblance of personal integrity, depending on who's speaking) on the part of Voldemort. Probably a more popular theory on the part of sympathizers to his cause, though.

**** ooh that's a good thought experiment there. How would Voldemort react to hearing that? Anger at his followers for daring to assume he has a weakness as trivial as empathy for children, or pride at his loyal servants that managed to dumb down the wizarding public, so he can restart his reign of terror more easily? After all, the dark lord who broke when standing before a child is probably not met with as much vehemence as the dark lord who did not hesitate one single second, something a reasonably intelligent dark lord would use to great effect.

** In canon it seems that everyone thought he deflect it back at him and that is why everyone thought he defeated the dark lord.

And above that if he is strong enough to be the first one to survive an unsurvivable curse and the dark lord is defeated rhe same day it wouldn't be a stretch too think he defeated him.

I never read a fanfiction where he is only know as the one who survived sounds good though

*** But /why/ would they assume the curse was specifically deflected, rather than hitting and doing nothing? You need the Shield Charm for that, right? And if Harry performed a really powerful Shield by accident, he wouldn't have got the curse scar on his forehead.

Also, surviving a curse doesn't really display extraordinary strength, it displays extraordinary /health and vitality/, doesn't it? Just because, say, Hagrid can take a lot of punishment, doesn't mean he can cast just as powerful spells.

**** The same reason they assume the spell hit Harry at all. The scar could have come from other curses or injuries. After all if no one had ever survived the killing curse, they have nothing to compare.

**** Surviving the killing curse display powerful magic not health and vitality because it can only be stopped by magic.

Voldemort vanished the room was destroyed and harry was alone as a baby with only a scar. His parents both died from the killer curse and he was fine. It is logically too think that harry defeated the dark lord.

Only dumbledore who has a huge understanding of magic could quess what happen. For the rest it was clear harry was magicial more powerfull than voldemort and when he tried to kill him he failed and instead destroyed himself and the room

** The reason Voldemort's defeat was accredited to Harry was that that night, every person that was under Voldemort's Imperious control suddenly wasn't. And I'd say that whatever the magical equivalent of first responders to Godrics hollow found enough evidence of Voldemort having been there to say that it was down to Harry that it had happened.

I like your prompt though!

  A mysterious green inked letter banished Harry from his cupboard. But does taking the boy out of the cupboard also mean that you've taken the cupboard out of the boy? A first year fic.

** People were desperate enough to get a break from Voldemort, many hardened aurors can't able to fight him, then one night, suddenly he is no more, a baby, who clearly had signs of killing curse being cast survived and what is assumed as Voldemort's remains found.

They don't want any logical explanation, because Magic defies logic and they just want to lie down and rest without the fear of Death Eaters, they want to trust their friends again, they don't want to hear that another one of their friend dead - along with his family.

The killing curse leaves no marks on the body. The fact that Harry was left with a scar is actually an argument /against/ the use of the killing curse. And since the baby was the only survivor in that room, there's no reliable witness to the events. I've often wondered how ANY tale of "what happened" was given any credence.

**** As I commented, they were desperate and now they are in a Euphoria of victory, any sceptics were quickly shut up in that situation. Just try to criticise your winning team right after their victory in front of adherent fans, you will find what they means.
