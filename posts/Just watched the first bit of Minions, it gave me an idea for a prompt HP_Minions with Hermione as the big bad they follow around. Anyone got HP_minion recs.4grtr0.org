#+TITLE: Just watched the first bit of Minions, it gave me an idea for a prompt: HP/Minions with Hermione as the big bad they follow around. Anyone got HP/minion recs?

Or if you like the idea and run with it, lemme know. It could be really amusing to see her high minded ideals warped by the Minions as they carry out her ideals ever so poorly.

** [[/r/minionhate]]... But as someone who wants every possible story to exist by the end of our civilisation, sure, why not. Haven't seen any myself, but I'll keep an eye out.
