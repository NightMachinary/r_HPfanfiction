** No.

There are /700,000/ fanfics just on ffn. I couldn't read half of them in the time I have left to live.

And I'm neither old nor sick.

**** I wouldn't even use "slowing down" - stabilizing sounds like a better description of what's going on within HP fanfiction.

***** And with FB out (and more movies coming) we will get new material - for example now that I know Newt I already have four ideas that would each make a great fic, if properly diluted.

** Not really, I'm more worried about the various websites going down. I only got into this fandom 1-2 years ago, so I'm not in any danger of running out. There's still some great stories that are ongoing.

It's really a tragedy that there seems no complete archive of Portkey anywhere. I think the most important stories are preserved, but there's a lot of stuff that's probably lost (or sitting on a hard disk somewhere in an attic).

**** Hey, umm. There is an online archive website of Portkey that someone else put together. I can find the link if you want.

In addition, I have access to a very large zip file with (what I think is) all or most of the Portkey stories. Let me know if you're interested in either.

Portkey archive site: [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/]]

**** Man, Portkey was the best if you followed any of those ships. It was a sad day when it went down...

** No. There are 750,000+ HP fanfics solely on FFN. I'm more worried about the archive sites with older and unique stories shutting down, resulting in the loss of those stories forever.

HPFF reddit has 11,090 subscribers as of the time of this post, and dozens of new topics are posted every day. I think we are in a good place. Furthermore, many people are at least writing, even if some of that writing isn't of high quality.

** The ammount of fics is going to be always bigger but I really struggle to read fics I like. Most of them are:

- Bad slash, I have nothing against it except when the author is a 12 years old girl without any idea of how anatomy work.
- (Marie Sue) Hermione (I really hate her and could litteraly watch a wall for one hour than reading any fic staring her. It already eliminate 80% of the fics)
- OP Harry, where Harry can speak 99+ languages at 11, is a master of every little aspect of magic, can humiliate Dumbledore and Voldemort at the same time, etc...

** Maybe it is, or maybe my interest in the genre is dwindling. The number is increasing, but I'm not so sure about quality. If you discount all the badly written fics, the wierd slash and the over the top tropes, finding decent fics(that have been started in the past 3 years and/or haven't been abandoned yet), you get a rather small number compared to the size of the archive.
