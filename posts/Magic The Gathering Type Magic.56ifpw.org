I really love Magic the Gathering's magic and lore. Are there any fics that combine it into the HP universe?

Over 70k+ words.


** I've tried a few concepts, but MtG mechanics don't really work that well in a story. But, the characters, plot, and generic magic does, as well as planeswalking. As soon as you start talking about mana though is when it goes downhill.

*** Well, here's how I would do it.

Mana is the same as magic. Dark spells such as the unforgivables would be black mana, fire spells red mana, ect ect. The MtG spells and creatures and all that call upon that portion of magic. However, a normal human doesn't have the magic to use them. That's where planeswalking comes in. Every time you go to a new plane, it's mana is added to yours. Fiery, hot places give red mana, places submerged in water gives blue mana, ect ect. You can call upon the power of the places to use the spells.

If I missed anything, please do point it out.

**** I dislike pretty much everything about what you just said, but if that's what you want, that's your call.

****** Probably because going for card game mechanics when you have a whole lot of lore with its own magic and creatures and lands that you could go for feels like a really unappetizing cop-out. There are card games that have worlds crafted in which said game exists in a form that makes it still a card game, and those could be adapted with game mechanics. But to cross over with M:tG, a game with lore that could make for an epic tale when handled properly, by wrapping all that lore in simplified and warped game mechanics? Yeah, it's ... underwhelming, compared to what could potentially be.

** What if someone like Chandra Nalaar had her first planeswalk into hogwarts during Harry's first year? IIRC she was also 11 back then.

Anyway, I would focus more on the lore and less on the mechanics of the cardgame.
