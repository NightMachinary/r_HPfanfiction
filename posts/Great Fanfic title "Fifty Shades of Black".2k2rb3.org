** Sirius and James S&M... the "bitch" puns would be even worse (or better, if that's your kink) than the Sirius ones.

** This title triggers me...

Perfect. Go with it.

Shame someone else has a shitty little fic with the name already. At least one, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8898705/1/Fifty-Shades-Of-Black][just on FFN]]. But don't let that stop you from writing about Black tying up James. One visit to Wikipedia and it'll be better than the original.

Err. Fifty Shades. Not canon HP. You're still horrible for writing this. Just to be clear.

*** Hahaha. I don't know if I have the patience, imagination, or willingness to go through with writing this - I just really really am attached to my title.

**** Please do! If there's anything I like, it's smutty smut. A++ if it includes Sirius or James.
