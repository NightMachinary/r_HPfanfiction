I mean, what's up with all of the spanking? There seem to be a fair amount on FF. net's Potions and Snitches where Harry is getting his saucy behind tanned by Snape, and I've seen others unrelated to that group. It's kind of disturbing, to tell you the truth.

** Theres a fetish for everything. Corporal punishment at hogwarts is the first I read in that vein. Though it's more of all of hogwarts getting spanked instead of house points. And harry fred and George are all girls in it.

** 1 A lot of people of many ages think it's a cure all for everyone and every issue, just spank the child and it will fix it self.

2 'Harry is Lazy' 'Harry is Arrogant' 'Harry is Selfish and Greedy' 'Harry talks back' how many times have you seen those very words on THIS Subreddit. A lot people have problems with Harry and want to 'Fix' him

3 'Snape would of been a good guardian for Harry'

Mix it all together and you have Snape spanking Harry

*** Or, they believe the vitriol Snape said about Harry.

Not that I think Snape would ever physically harm a student with his own two hands. That hits a little too close home to what dear old dad did to him.

** Some people really believe in corporal punishment being the 'right' way and so... clearly that's what they think Harry needs in a new guardian.

** I've seen corporal punishment in fics where Sirius raises Harry as well. It's disgusting, especially when the author gets defensive in the author's note. No one should be hitting a teenager to discipline them.

** Ask the human race for millennia. Even today, you'll find that corporal punishment is far less banned than you think it is

** I especially dislike it when Harry feels safe to be punished for misdeeds and it's so different from the way the Dursleys treated him.

Like ok, maybe Snape might spank as a guardian because doing it without anger or something might be viable since it's not senseless beating then and far from what was done to him. (Though I think Snape would prefer words and extra chores to show a child the mistake in their ways.) But Harry having any positive experiences with that seems very wrong to me.

** No idea man. I remember once stumbling upon an author that has some sorta genuine fetish for this. Like I went on his profile and every single fic description had the line, "Contains the disciplinary spanking of minors. Don't like, don't read."

** Why's it disturbing?

Corporal punishment wasn't banned in real-world schools until 1998.

*** Because it often goes to the same lengths as Extra-Abusive!Dursley's, and yet Harry is happy with it because it's Snape beating his behind and not Vernon.
