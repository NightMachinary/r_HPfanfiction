What makes the shippers go "yes this is a direction that makes sense" when they look at these two. You could make the argument "oh snape loved lily and harry is like lily". While they shared qualities harry had a lot of james in him too. James that Snape couldn't stand. Snape only put up with harry and his bullshit because he was lily's kid. This ship makes less sense to me than Tomarry tbh

Edit: So I've seen mentions of 2 things, those are the feelings towards ships with animosity between the 2 canon characters. For example dramione and drarry. Another thing brought up is the question “Why do we only have slash that has animosity in the first place ?” I haven't seen Harry x Ron once nor have I seen Harry x Neville once. Idk why all the gay ships have to be based in animosity. I just want normal functional ships


** OP, there are literally 2492 fics on AO3 with the tag "Harry/Ron" and 625 fics with the tag "Harry/Neville", and that's only on AO3. Where are you searching for fics if you haven't been able to see /one/ fic with these pairings?

(I myself have read fics with these two pairings and well writen ones. I've also read many fics about pairings that don't rely on animosity - both slash and het ships. Fortunatelly, especially for the HP fandom, there are A LOT of good fics out there you can chose from - I could even say it's one of the most generous fandom in that area, as I was able to find fics for ships that aren't very popular or even not that much thought of).

**** Yeah, I honestly can't remember a hp ship I wanted to read a story about, that I wasn't able to find at least a few stories for. I admit, some ships are more popular than others, but Harry/Ron isn't that unpopular/rare in general. Harry/Neville is maybe less popular, but there's still a decent amount of fics for them available. And I'm saying this as someone who loves to read rare/peculiar ships - I've liked ships before that had maybe 5 fics available for them, a 3rd of which where not in english (for which I had to use Google Translate) - and have still considered myself lucky that someone has thought about and actually writen something for this ship. But for most HP ships there usually are a lot more fics available even on the accesibile sites like AO3 or FF. I think in that reguard we are lucky that the HP fandom is so popular and populous :))

I've read a few before, but I'm always opened to try more. I actually really like their dynamic and the best-friends-to-more trope going on there. They are so close als friends they just don't realise when the "transition" happens and it still takes them by surprise when they finally get even closer and turn into more-than -friends.

In most of the fics I read I usually try to avoid any Ron bashing, Hermione bashing and Weasley bashing in general, since I loved in the canon that Harry was able to find a family in them.

** I personally am indifferent to it, but that's because I find Snape unattractive and have little interest in seeing him in a romantic relationship. But I can somewhat understand why other people would find him and Harry together to be interesting. They have an antagonistic and complicated relationship, and some like that sort of thing. If people just want to read healthy, vanilla HP slash, they'd stick with shipping Harry and Ron. And though Rarry is a very lovely ship, it's not everyone's cup of tea. We all have different tastes.

**** It's all a matter of taste, I'd say. Most people prefer Drarry as the choice for an enemies-to-lovers slash ship, but that sort of relationship has a different dynamic compared to Snarry. Draco's antagonism towards Harry is much more juvenile in nature. He's the schoolyard bully. Also, his cowardice and the way he's consistently the butt of the joke may turn some people off.

Snape on the other hand, is a far better antagonist. He's an extremely talented wizard and his quick wit makes him a worthier opponent. Add in all the details surrounding Snape's past with Harry's parents, and Snarry is easily the more layered and complicated ship.

** It's okay to not like something and still understand that people may like that thing for one reason or other. You don't even have to understand why they do like it for you to be okay with people liking things different than what you like.

​

Having said that, I don't like or dislike it. It's one way things could be written, and written well. Fanfiction doesn't need to be canon compliant. If I want canon, I would read canon. My theory about fanficiton is that it is a different world than canon, a world created by fanfic writer for writing their story.

A Snape in one fanfic can be a baby eating, blood thirsty rapist, while a Snape in other fic may be a lovely dove who like to sing and dance. It's whatever a writer wants to write. If I don't like it, I close it and move on. It's fanfic. At the worst case, it's free entertainment that I can close the tab of and read other. At best, I may get a new story with different theme and different lessons as characters of different types engage in conflicts.

***** The greasy part was mainly because of Snape's very poor hygiene (dirty teeth and dirty underwear for starters). But hey, I'm not here to kink shame. Whatever gets the reader off ain't my business. That being said, it still catches me off guard whenever the author describes Snape as handsome despite the very detailed description of him having the looks and hygiene of a common neckbeard. I'm also aware that it's mainly because of Alan Rickman who was a Hollywood actor and are more often attractive people.

****** I really don't think it is due to Alan Rickman... it was definitely a thing before the movies. Weird as this may sound I think it's really more of a personality thing, or a hurt/comfort thing.

I'm not into Snarry (age difference is kinda icky, but they are fictional so I'll sometimes read it if I like the Snape characterization) or really into pairing Snape with anyone, but I do like fix-it stories where he becomes a little happier. I liked his character a lot more before the Lily reveal, tbh. I still like it if I think of the love as non-romantic, like someone would have for their sister, their grandmother, or their best friend who was really the only person who ever believed in them.

I'm sort of rambling here, but a lot of people describing Snape as handsome just want it to be more possible for him to be happy. Bad hygiene is very fixable, and if you fix it, what's left that's ugly, really? A big nose? Lots of attractive people could be described as having large noses.

In the second case, it could be acceptable only if the time travel happens when either participants is both physically and mentally the same age. IE no adult Harry time travels into the past where Snape is still in school and somehow physically de-ages. That's a mental adult preying on a minor, despite the fact both look like minors. 11yo Harry somehow time travels and meets 11yo Snape? Sure that's fine. They've gotta be similar ages both mentally and physically, with little or no underlying relationship before the time travel, otherwise that's just wrong.

Also the student-teacher relationship dynamic wears off with age. Tbh I'd be a bit uncomfortable reading about 18yo Harry with Snape, but if say Harry is 30 and Snape is 50? I don't think there is anything unethical about that. Even at 18 Harry is already grizzled as fuck (understandably after all he's been through), doesn't bow down to authority and doesn't let anyone walk over him. I don't think as a mature adult there would be any imbalance of power between him and Snape.

Personally, though I heavily dislike the ship itself (unless it's like, a time travel thing where they're different people and know each other in a completely different way, that's ok), I don't necessarily share the revulsion most people have towards it, because there are some truly beautiful works that have that ship and are worth reading even if you hate it.

Snape is the grown man who consistently bullied Harry from the age of eleven before Harry so much as opened his mouth - the very first time they came face to face. What ever he was doing to protect Harry was behind the scenes, their personal interactions consisted of Snape behaving like the vilest of bullies.

And he had a creepy obsession with Harry's mother

And he was literally old enough to be his father.

**** I agree, though, the commenter specified that “Harry was responsible for everything wrong in Snape's life” from Snape's specific POV.

It's definitely true that Snape was an asshole to Harry a lot. But to be fair, there are a lot of things that I think weren't meant to turn out the way they were regarding the later half of the series. For example, we've seen this with how Harry gets completely fawned over for the Patronus in a few books, but it's portrayed as something much simpler in OotP. There were some hints Rowling was dissatisfied with both Hermione/Ron and Harry/Ginny (or at least unsure about it) at some points but she went with it in the end. She even said outright that at one point she almost killed off Ron in the end.

My point is, I don't think her endgame vision for the series was figured out from the beginning. For the same reasons you mentioned, I think it's disturbing in many ways that Harry would name his literal /son/ after Snape (and Dumbledore, but that's another can of worms), but he did that, didn't he? I think if Rowling had that redemption arc in mind, she might have bothered to make him at least a bit more sympathetic (and less of a creep), but she didn't, so she didn't. The result is that the final arc of the storyline is a bit mismatched, because her final vision for Snape is one that she didn't have in the beginning.

In fanfics, it's easier to reimagine everything so it works out in a way that makes sense. I don't really think there's anything right with going with the entirety of canon and excusing it as a matter of sexual tension, but I do think there are a few stories (some with truly exceptional prose that make it worth reading even if you hate the ship) that reimagine many events in the series entirely to make it work.

**** Try:

- "The Most Powerful Magic" by cjr2 . IMO this is a great gentle introduction to Snarry. Over a decade after the war, Snape wakes up from a coma and meets the next generation of Potters and Malfoys. Really interesting take on the "love conquers all" theme that is center to HP.

- "Sub Rosa" by cjr2. It is pre-slash covering Harry's last few years of school, so again a great gentle introduction to the genre.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/cjr2/pseuds/cjr2/works?fandom_id=136512]]

- "Fate is a Four Letter Word" by Philo . 40-something Harry married to Ginny with teenage children. Absolutely riveting and brutal "who-dun-it" murder-mystery-conspiracy-spy story that will keep you at the edge of your seat until the last chapter. If you only ever read one story where the main pairing makes you go "urgh, not my cup of tea", make it this one.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4267422/chapters/9661617]]

About the only story that can somewhat hold a candle to "Fate" would be cambangst's "Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood", just in case you have read that. Both stories have similar plots, but in comparision I find that "Fate" is funnier, has the better OC's (Kingsley's mom is a hoot) and overall better writing and more plot twists.

- "For Auld Long Syne" by Cybele2013 . Very long and very good. Hard to describe, but basically Harry and Sev orbit around each other, wanting to be together but life interferes.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/34560]]

Some shorter fics:

- "The Boy Who died a lot" by starcrossedgirl

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]]

- "Chrysalis" by starcrossedgirl - trigger warning sexual abuse and PTSD [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/304714]]

- "How we were warriors" by writcraft . This story focuses on what it meant to be a young gay man in the 1980s and in the late 1990s and the challenges. Really interesting read and character study.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18897526]]

- The Finder's Series by Gateway Girl. The part on how they get together is a bit yuck and not well done, but I love Ron as an Auror and the exploration of moral ambiguity.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2690]]

- Nobody's Saviour by suitesamba AU. Harry grows up as a Muggle and never goes to Hogwarts.

** But its fanfiction. It doesn't need to make sense. People don't have to write about relationships that are healthy and definitely not ones there would have preferred in canon. Sometimes people write a certain pairing because the idea is an interesting one and they can build a story very different from canon. Harry isn't always canon Harry, and in this example Snape isn't always canon Snape. It's just a story that exists in that world, not a representation of the authors opinions.

The first time I saw the Harry/Voldemort pairing I was like... What?! How?! But then i read it out of curiosity over how they made it work and now it's one of my favourite pairings. Not because I think it's healthy or something I would have preferred in canon, but because it can make a story interesting when they explore that dynamic.

Now in all fairness, nothing about the Snarry or even Drarry pairings has ever pulled me in, but I think that stems from disliking Snape and Draco and having no interest in reading any more about them. The same goes with the Harmony pairing and that's a healthy one.

I think there is still a lot of love for Snape and people who do want to explore his character more, and a Snarry pairing can be a method of that.

** There are a lot of great long form commentaries on why people ship Snarry, some of which have been linked earlier in the thread. I think what I find most compelling is the idea that despite their differences, Snape and Harry are quite similar. Both had abusive upbringings, but their choices led them to vastly different outcomes. I, personally, like to believe that Harry became the Dark Arts professor after graduation and that that is when the relationship begins. What I find interesting too is they're both snarky, and Harry is really the only one to ever ‘give' it back to Snape. I think that in an ideal world, Severus would need someone who challenges him, despite his outward resistance too it. I also love the tension that enemies to lovers brings with it as a trope, and I think Snarry can bring out the best in this. The fact that Snape never reveals his feelings adds this thick tension, and this is where Snarry really shines in fanfic in my opinon. Tl;dr I think its a really interesting ship that allows for an interesting look into the characters. Ship and let ship as they say!

** Honestly, I like Snape and he's my favourite character. Here's a powerful, competent give no fucks person, and fan fiction gives authors the opportunity to take that base of Snape character and build upon it. Some people find the age gap distasteful, personally it doesn't bother me, because the fics are mostly Harry's (or Hermione's) POV, which equals MY POV as a reader. It's essentially me and Snape, but Harry as the POV medium (though I do think Harry should be at least 16+). Do I think that sort of relationship is acceptable in real life? Hell no! Do I need to hold my entertainment to the same standards I have for real life? No (how many movies with murders are rape are out there?)

My favourite Snarry fic is the Marriage Stone (unfinished). Heads up it's a forced marriage fic (I just like this trope, outlander anyone?) where Snape does not take advantage (no sex at all), and they slowly grow to respect and love each other, and over 70 odd chapters builds the culture of the wizarding world in the best way that I have read, you see Snape as person with more social standing, powerful Harry coming to the realisation that he ended up falling for the person he was forced to be with.

There aren't as many fleshed out female characters in HP for straight guys and lesbians to find pairings for. Straight guys are also a smaller minority of the shipping community, so it's hard to gauge what type of pairing they would go for. Pansy/Hermione is one of the biggest femslash pairings, and Millicent/Hermione also seems to have a sizeable following.

Just off the top of my head, I know lots of lesbians also love Shego/Kim from Kim Possible, and Villaneve from Killing Eve. There just needs to be more fleshed out female villains for them to choose from.

Do we? It's not exactly difficult to make any of the male characters LGBT. They should have similar amounts of people to choose from - why no Harry/Ron or Harry/Neville?

My point was that in slash its near exclusively Harry/antagonist. Outside of Wolfstar, the most common m/m fics are Draco/Harry, Snape/Harry, and Voldemort/Harry, with Lucius/Harry being a distant 4th. There's no equivalent to the aforementioned Hermione/Ron or Hermione/Harry with, say, a Harry/Ron or Harry/Neville.

****** They're hard to compare, though. Hermione/random male characters and Harry/random female characters is bulked up by a lot of self insert shipping (aka people just shipping easy to write main characters with characters they personally want to bang). You're not really going to get the same amount (and variety) of that for queer ships when most of the authors are straight.

The role that Hermione/Ron fills in fic is the same as the role Remus/Sirius fills (aka popular basically married couple who are often tagged as a background ship to the couple the fic is actually about). Harry/Hermione fills the role of "two most popular characters shipped together" which is basically what Drarry is as well.

I just think you really have to consider the context in which these ships are born... not just the relationships between the characters but also their role and relevance in the story, the alternative shipping options available, and how people engage with those ships.

Outside of HP, whenever there's two male characters who are close friends, they're almost guaranteed to be the top ship. But if the guy is friends with someone fans don't like that much, they're not going to be that motivated to ship them and create fanworks for them. Hence why Ron and Neville aren't very popular in ships that aren't either explicitly canon or heavily implied.

*Characters in a ship with Harry that have over 1k fics:* Draco (39.4k), Snape (10.3k), Tom Riddle (4.8k), Ron (3k), Voldemort (2.4k), Cedric (1.2k), Blaise (1.1k), Lucius (1.0k), Charlie (1.0k)

*Characters in a ship with Harry that have over 100 fics:* Fred/George (749), Draco/Snape (728), Original Male Character (720), Neville (626), George (459), Fenrir Greyback (453), Bill (430), Fred (253), Draco/Blaise (203), Percy (203), Dumbledore (200), Oliver Wood (176), Barty Crouch Jr. (120), Draco/Ron (112), Newt Scamander (112), Dudley (101)

The one real exception to this is Draco/Hermione, which is just as popular as the above. In terms of other enemies-to-lovers pics, Harry/Pansy and Harry/Bellatrix are there and definitely have an audience, but its nowhere near as big a proportion as Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, Harry/Voldemort, or even Harry/Lucius.

As far as Snarry, that might be the case now and will take your word on it. I remember pre AO-3 (before I could exclude fics from the search) it seemed most of them were still at Hogwarts, which eww. I definitely have much less a problem with enemies to mentors

Neville on the other hand, while likeable, doesn't seem to be very... interesting I guess? Like he's friends with Harry, but the two aren't particularly close... and it doesn't feel like there's a super interesting story to tell about them getting together.

** First, let me say that I'm talking about of age fics.

I find that giving snape a fleshed out character, like small hobbies and a friendly relationship with McGonagall, him sitting on a dark room near the fire drinking whiskey, it just completes his identity and make him more realistic.

On the other side, you have Harry, a person that has gone through a lot and understands some things about him. He's more optimistic, and is usually really forgiving.

I find that putting them together cultivates the grounds for growth in those two people. Harry helps Snape get out of his own head, and Snape shares moments, his hobbies, and a (somewhat, he's still Snape) patient guidance. So the characters slowly change, and their relationship and companionship are really nice to watch.

I find that older!Harry (like when he's 30-40) works in similar ways, but you find that the companionship and understanding element appears much quicker, as they have a lot more in common by that time.

To sum up, I find that their characters work wonderfully together to bring the best out of each other, something rare in most fics (as well as books). I've sometimes seen it in some draco/Hermione fics, but not in the same frequency by a long shot.

** TBH it's usually starts with 1 amazing author/story, and they do such a great job of weaving an AU plot (cause by the nature of the pairing, it has be to AU) that you want more like it. And down the rabbit hole you go. And that goes for any pairing or trope.

But you may ask, why does a person even read that first amazing story, when the pairing/trope freaks them out?

Could be boredom, curiosity, maybe the summary is everything you love except the pairing (so you give it a go for the plot not the romance). And for us older fandom members (pre-A03) it wasn't uncommon for fics to have no details about the pairing - so you were half way through what you thought was a gen fic, only to end up in a slow burn slash fic.

** It's the age gap that makes me uncomfortable. He's the same age as Harry's parents, and while they did have him pretty young thats still three times his age when they first meet. Yikes.

I don't understand the people that like Snape/Lily but like, at least theyre from the same generation. There are so many canon characters to choose from so it just rubs me the wrong way when they specifically choose the ones that far apart, even if its an au with closer ages or something.

With the animosity in gay relationships, I have mixed feelings about it. I have seen Harry/Ron and Harry/Neville fics, but then again do I look for them specifically. I don't mind a little rivalry or enemies-to-lovers, especially if it's done well, but it is disconcerting how many gay ships seem to only be based in that

** For me, Snarry is an interesting concept. I personally don't ship it but I've come across fics (that are very AU) which create an interesting premise.

A lot of ships are popular because of the possibilities the two characters bring to the story. In a Harry/Ron or Harry/Neville there isn't a personality contrast and no significant barriers to getting together unless there is a conflict introduced in the story. So these can seem “boring.” But with Snarry and Drarry there's a lot of stuff to go through, and it can be interesting to read about.

Drarry doesn't have to be toxic! Draco has redeeming qualities so post war fics where both are more mature are possible.

If you can have tomarry then why not Snarry? Voldy is even older than snape so make it a time travel thing and the age gape isn't important. Also, wizards and witches apparently live longer than muggles so if they are 40/60 or older age doesn't matter that much.

*** I am not going to say that there aren't horcrux Tom/Harry but most of the Tomarry is set in AU with Tom and Harry going to school together or being on the opposite sides in the political field and there are some absolute gems so dont judge a ship just because you havent read it. The same goes for Drarry and Snarry its set in different times different ages it all depends on the author and the readers who read them. I think the reason most readers turn towards Slash is because of the writing and Tomarry, Snarry and Drarry has some of the best fics, now dont get me wrong I am not saying there aren't good Het fics out there but compared to Slash its very less, I mean the most hit fic on Ao3 is a wolstar fic.

***** I read a LOT of Snarry on FFN prior to DH's release in 2007 (over 26, I promise). You couldn't filter on FFN for pairings back then, you could only put 2 main characters and a rating. I remember this clearly cos I wanted Mentor!Snape fics and these were lumped in with Snarry.

In 2013, FFN added the option to filter by pairing, and AO3 didn't exist until 2008. Most old stuff hasn't been crossposted and backdated on AO3.

In addition, Snarry was huge on Livejournal. A lot of LJ content was removed in the 2007 strikethrough. There was also the FFN purge of 2002 and 2012 where they removed adult content.

Snarry ppl also lived on a number of archives: Walking the Plank, Silver Snitch, HP Adult Fanfiction, Glasses Reflect, Harry Potter Fan Fiction, to name a few. Most of these works are not on AO3/FFN.

I'm not surprised your maths is dodgy and the Snarry numbers are small cos you're asking: how many people have gone back to their 6+ year old Snarry FFN fics that have yet to be purged, to add the relationship field? and how many people, years later imported their works to AO3 and backdated it?

****** Okay, I didn't know/hadn't considered most of that.

Still, on FFN, about 6k/22k of all fics tagged with Harry and Snape were published before DH. And on AO3, about half of the 14k Snarry fics were published within the last seven years. So unless every Snarry fic put on AO3 for over seven years after DH was actually a pre-DH fic that just wasn't backdated, the vast majority of Snarry fics on AO3 are also post-DH.

And I don't have an easy way to check all the other archives you mention. But again, unless there were at least 10k-20k Snarry fics on them, then your initial claim is incorrect.

I think you're underestimating the fact that it has been 14 years since DH was published. And Harry Potter fics peaked in popularity in [[https://m.imgur.com/q437v6I][2011, at the very earliest]] (I can't find data for after 2012, and I don't feel like figuring it out myself). There may have been a ton of pre-DH Snarry fics, and it may have dropped in popularity after DH. But the passage of time is working against you, and while it may be true that the vast majority of Snarry shippers started shipping them before they read/watched DH, most of them did not stop shipping it afterwards.
