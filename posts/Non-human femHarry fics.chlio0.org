Hey all, as stated in the title, I'm looking for fem!Harry fics in which she is NOT human. I am absolutely fine with any creature, ranging from elementals to werewolves and veelas, all is cool with me. The tone can also be quite dark but if possible, romance should not be the focus.

I recently read 'The Fire That Swallowed The World', so no need to recommend that.

Thanks in advance!


** Wasn't there a crossover somewhere with Monster Girl Quest that had Harry as a female lamia?

I remember reading that delightful clusterfuck.

** Why not also look for female OCs instead? At This point is just an original character.

*** If an OC has James Potter and Lily Evans as parents and has bad eyesight and is good at flying and is prophecized to defeat Voldemort and has a scar on his forehead and has Sirius as godfather and..... and is unobservant as fuck then is it really an OC?
