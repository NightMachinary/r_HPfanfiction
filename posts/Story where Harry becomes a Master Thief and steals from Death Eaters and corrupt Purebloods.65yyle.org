I read one where Harry, Hermione and Luna become thieves wearing fox masks, but I'd like to read more like this. I've also read the Black Comedy, which has Harry and Sirius stealing from Death Eaters purely because they can. Does anyone know of anymore like these?

  Unexpected time travel can provide endless hours of entertainment...if you do it right. Under any other circumstances Harry would have done everything in his power to set things right the Gryffindor way. Too bad he's learned a lot since that final battle. Meet the biggest prankster in the Ministry's dreaded Audit department, and with one heck of a grudge to grind!

*** They don't wear fox masks, but Hermione's thief name is "the fox". I'd be surprised if it wasn't this one because it sounds crazy similar, but if not, op, this is right up your alley.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

***** How in the world? This reads like a sequel, except with better writing. The author doesn't seem to mention their inspirations though.

Edit: +Never mind, this absolutely had to originate from the same writing prompt.+ I'm still reading it as a sequel though.

Edit 2: Apparently not. The author does mention in chapter 4 that they made a "reference" to it in chapter 3, though there's no way more wasn't inspired by it.
