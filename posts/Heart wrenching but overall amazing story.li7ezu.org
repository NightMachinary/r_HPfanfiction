I just finished reading A Marauders Plan where instead of leaving Britain Sirius stays and changes everything. Let me tell you how now only was it amazingly written but the depth of the story was just wonderful. 87 chapters and just under 900,000 words. Theres no bashing unless its a death eater really and its written in many perspectives which give it a very well rounded depth to the story. Theres twists and turns that will make you cry before you're sent down more twists. The ending was just extremely well written in the fact that it doesn't fall into the trap of everyone lives happy ever after. There is a few major character deaths and I love it it gives the story and the emotions of the characters feel more real due to there loses. It has wonderfully written male friendships and emotions in those friendships. It also has very strong female influence that creates a great balance of the two. It has a wonderful plot based on various ancient type magics and it makes al the characters seem real and now perfect. They have flaws and make mistakes. Just a fair trauma warning the end does have some content regarding grooming and statutory rape but overall its a wonderfully well written story and honesty i love it just a tad more than the JK version. 10/10 recommend.


** I've always pretended books 1-3 and A Marauder's Plan is canon. I swear, that fic is better written than JKR... and the author isn't (at least to my knowledge) a jerk.

** Are there any fics you could recommend that are similar? I love a marauders plan as well and would love to find something along those lines.

Was Dumbledore evil in the end?

*** No, he wasn't. He made some severely bad choices (e.g., screwing up Sirius' life), but in the end both him and Fudge were working with others together in eliminating Voldemort.

*** No but I really liked the way they portrayed him an old man who made mistakes and was alone for a long time having troubles giving leadership reins over. He tried his hardest and tried to work hard to repent for his mistakes. I really loved how they handled his character. Snapes character as well only really had the usually Sirius hates him type bashing.
