Are there any fics where Hermione is pregnant with Harry's baby and he abandons her? Years later he is sorry but Hermione is married to someone else and neither she or the child want anything to do with him? I would prefer Hermione not be paired with Ron or Draco.


** What's with these fics denigrating other characters for the benefit of Hermione?

In my opinion neither of them would abandon the other and it's just romantic drama bullshit.

*** Especially Harry. I mean, first of all he would never leave. Second, I don't think she's stupid enough to not use as much contraception as possible.

  He felt something close to pity for the woman in front of him. And while that disturbed Draco to no end, what really disgusted him most of all was the harrowing fact that someone or something had broken Hermione Granger's spirit beyond recognition.
