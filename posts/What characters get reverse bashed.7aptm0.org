We all know the most often contenders for most bashed (Ron, Dumbledore) but what characters get the opposite treatment? Basically, what characters get all their flaws stripped away?

And, how do we fix this? Cause it's honestly bad as bashing imo.

Example: A lot of fics that feature Hermione make her a genuine genius with an intellect rivaling Einstein. Fred and George are always lovable pranksters who happily stay on Harry's side even when the rest of the Weasleys go batshit crazy.


** Snape is the most obvious but I'd like to put out Sirius. In the books he was a very broken man. One who'd try to do the right thing but never knew what the right thing was. Harry built up a glorified version in his head but really the man wasn't around much nor was he overly sane. Wasn't his fault but he was shattered as a person by the Dementors. In fan fiction he's often something completely different, he becomes responsible and wise while also being a fun loving pseudochild. They write away how damaged he was to make him both the best parent, the best friend and older brother all wrapped into one.

**** Living in a cave eating rats while not really doing anything isn't normal. He's trying too hard to make up for his past mistakes.

** Sirius and Draco, as well as Snape sometimes.

Sirius is a bit mad, endangers a lot of people for no good reason, sees Harry as almost a replacement for James instead of his own person, and he mistrusted Lupin for being a werewolf during the first war.

Draco is a prissy, bullying pureblood supremacist who identified Hermione to Bellatrix in Malfoy Manor.

Snape did a lot of good, but he did it for all the wrong reasons. He tried to trade an infant and a guy who used to bully him in school for a woman who didn't love him and never would, if it had worked. He bullied schoolchildren, and was Neville's worst fear when his parents had literally been tortured into insanity.

On Snape, I think Lily always loved him and hoped he could see the light, but there comes a time when you need to wash your hands of someone who's so determined on being self-destructive. She just never loved him the way he loved her or how he wanted her to love him. And any chance of her loving him that way, he burned that bridge himself.

If he's decided he doesn't like you, nothing will change his mind, and he'll delight in being nasty to you. Also, he does probably see Harry as a replacement for James, and is disappointed when he isn't.

This doesn't mean he doesn't also have a lot of good qualities. He's got a pretty sharp mind, for the most part he's a good judge of character, and he's almost suicidally brave. If you have his loyalty he'll do ANYTHING for you; living off rats for months is just the start of it.

Look, I find him an enchanting character to read but whether from malice or stupidity Sirius almost killed Snape for a prank.

It's all fine and well to say he didn't think it through but is that really an excuse? If in the real world a schoolboy had tossed another boy into the lion cage at the zoo, would we have accepted 'it was just a prank'? The point is that he /should/ have thought it through.

The fact that he not only contemplated the prank but actually carried it out means he was either dangerously reckless, or an actual murderous psychopath. Considering that he appeared to have real affection for Remus and James, I'm leaning towards dangerously reckless.

Edit: basically one of the things I love about the HP series is that every character is morally ambiguous in some way. They're all shades of grey and it's fantastic.

But we see him actually mature, realize the real consequences of Snape being there, and save him at great risk to his own personal life. That's also why I can see Lily actually liking him, and like the ship (unlike a great majority of the fandom it feels).

For the magical world such animals have been solidly real for millennia. Magical society has worked, and still works very hard to keep those magical creatures secret.

Even with those efforts, muggles have lots of literature referencing them.

The first mention of Luna's creatures come from Luna.

So either Luna possesses some /ultra rare/ magical perception, she likes messing with people, she uses her "beliefs" to keep people away, or she's mentally ill.

She's plenty smart. She works hard, yes, but she also often grasps concepts first in the class. Further, it's hard to divorce intelligence from knowledge because your ability to comprehend advanced concepts will depend on how thoroughly you understand the basic concepts which they rely on, which can be a function of hard work.

She's no Dumbledore, nor even really a Snape, but it's absurd to say she isn't smart. She's up there with people like Bill Weasley, Cedric Diggory, Remus Lupin, etc.

Harry is an American action hero spouting one-liners, and who threatens to punch people's faces in for no reason, and his reaction to seeing Ron -- who's been left behind to clear up the rubble and has been frantic with worry about his sister -- is to call him a "bigoted little shit."

But what really broke the fic for me was when Tom Riddle basically says "I made six Horcruxes, haha!" in casual dialogue just because Harry makes with some half-hearted flattering. Hello?! He never told people about his Horcruxes, because he knew that people might find them and destroy them if they knew! The only one he discussed Horcruxes with was Slughorn, and that was only because Slughorn had information about them that Riddle needed.

In HBP, Hermione literally gives Snape an answer word-for-word from a textbook rather than putting it in her own words. While we don't see every single class the trio, its implied that Hermione gives a textbook answer basically all the time. Snape is simply the only Hogwarts professor who we see explicitly annoyed her reliance on the textbook like a crutch.

One of the main reason Snape didn't like Hermione (aside from her being one of Harry's friends) was because she kept parroting the literal textbook answer, rather than try to put it in her own words. Snape being the Half-Blood Prince was just to reinforce how much he valued creativity over parroting unoriginal textbook answers. One of the recurring themes of the series is that those who are creative are better than those who parrot the textbook, hence why every DADA professor who ignored the textbook (Lupin, Crouch Jr, and Snape) were considered good teachers while those who focused on theory and parroted the textbook (Quirrell, Lockhart, and Umbridge) were terrible teachers.

Hermione isn't the only one who is looked down upon for parroting the textbook. Harry does the same thing in HBP by repeating the improvements that Snape made. The narrative paints Harry negatively for decieving Slughorn, since Slughorn believed Harry was a genius who was a natural at Potions when he wasn't. All Harry did with the HBP book was parrot facts, yet him doing so doesn't make him intelligent, as Harry proved when he struggled in Potions without the textbook. Harry using Snape's notes as a crutch didn't make him any more intelligent, as proven by Harry's performance without the notes. Likewise, Hermione parroting the textbooks she reads speaks more to her impressive memory and her dedication to actually taking her education seriously (unlike Harry and Ron), but having a good memory is not the same as being a genius.

Snape, as a Hogwarts professor, knows that Hermione is a smart student. Surely it must annoy him to see a student who gets Outstanding in almost all her O.W.L.s prove herself to be an dull, unoriginal student rather than a creative genius like Snape himself was. She wasn't inventing popular spells (i.e. Levicorpus) nor was she find superior ways to make better potions (i.e. the improvements in Snape's copy of Advanced Potion Making).

In other words, Snape's dislike of Hermione is because he held her to his own standards. From Snape's perpsective as a Hogwarts professor, Hermione seems like she would be creative and seems like she would be a genius, yet she was none of those things. In other words, Snape's treatment of his students is because he holds them to his own standards, expecting them to do as well as he did when he was their age. In Hermione's case, its more pronounced since he would have expected more from her, especially if other professors (e.g. McGonagall, Flitwick, etc) spoke highly about Hermione to Snape.

At the very least, anyone is capable of realising that Hermione was never as intelligent or magically talented as Snape or the Marauders were at her age, and nobody but the biggest Hermione fans would unironically believe she was even remotely close to the same league as Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald when they were her age.

*TL;DR: Hermione was an above average student, but she was not a genius. Having a good memory doesn't make a person a genius. Hermione was unquestionably the smartest and most talented student in her Hogwarts year, but she was never in the same league as Snape or the Marauders, let alone Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald.*

To put it in context: McGonagall, as per Pottermore, got Outstandings in all her O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s and was pubishing academic papers in her Hogwarts for Transfiguration Today. To put it in a real world context, what McGonagall was capable of would be like a student producing PhD quality academic work in her high school years and getting them published. Hermione was smart, but she lacked the talent and intelligence to produce actual academic work in her school years. *Hermione was "average smart" in the same way that most straight-A students are: smart, but nothing special. Straight-A students are smart, but how many of them would be considered an actual genius? Barely any of them.* McGonagall, Snape and the Marauders were in a different league to the Hermione Grangers and Percy Weasleys of the world, and Dumbledore/Grindelwald/Voldemort were several leagues beyond even that one.

Yet this same McGonagall who was that talented is implied to have not become an Animagus until at least her seventh year. The Marauders achieved on their own by their fifth year what McGonagall, implied to be an actual genius, needed Dumbledore's help to achieve by her seventh year Dumbledore had helped the Marauders like he helped McGonagall, its likely they could have became Animagi a year or two sooner.

********** The thing is that when you look at it, none of them were really up to the previous generation's standards.

I do kind of think that we need to cut Hermione and Co a bit of slack for the circumstances. I mean. Snape was a pretty solitary kid who had a gang of bullies after him constantly. He probably spent a lot of time in hidden corners of the castle experimenting. He had the time for that, you see ? Ditto with the Marauders - they had time for their secret animagus studies and so on.

On the other hand, Hermione is in a very different situation. Her best friend is at risk of being killed every year. They are building up to a war against people who hate her and everything she stands for. Every year, she's up to her eyeballs in schoolwork and on top of that, she has to try and figure out what's going to kill Harry this time. When is she going to have time for experimenting with spells? (although I think the protean charm she used on the galleons is proof that when she needs to be, she can be pretty damn creative)

Does she rely too much on book learning? Yeah, she really does. But given the situation I don't think it's fair to paint her as less intelligent than Snape and the Marauders just because they had the freedom to experiment and question and she didn't.

I also think that a part of her reliance on book learning is that she is scared. She's scared that she doesn't belong, she doesn't really understand this world she's living in, and quite often she's legitimately afraid of actually dying. Memorising books is much simpler and safer than trying to go her own way, with the possibility of getting something wrong and being exposed as a fake.

And it's not just Hermione who is less than the previous generation. Harry is infinitely less talented than his animagus-by-fifteen father, or his brilliant mother. Neville will never measure up to his brave Auror parents. Draco lacks Lucius' conviction.

They're all... I sort of want to say stunted, if that makes sense? None of them are what they could have been.

****** It's always /OK/ to do anything. Authors do it because they like it, and they do it for free. Besides, I just gave the reasons why I understand where authors are coming from, not that I agree with it. So no, I'm not against boosting other characters or even making your characters Mary Sues, if you're into that kind of thing, but I don't think it's exactly the same in this case.

The thing is: Harry is the 'Chosen One' and usually the protagonist, which means it's mostly on him to defeat Voldemort--as is with most protagonists /and/ Chosen Ones-- and has disadvantages too great against his enemy (that being intellect/talent and decades of experience). That is not the case with Hermione, who I guess is the character you're referring to; she was more than competent in canon, not Voldemort's mortal enemy, and usually not the protagonist.

'Reverse bashing' is not making Harry a genius or portraying him in a positive way; it's making him, basically, a Gary Stu or a perfect character, which, if you compare fics without Harry or Hermione as protagonists, happens more with the latter (in my experience, of course). Hermione is too often portrayed as a witch with the appearance of Emma Watson and an intellect seen once a century.

*TL;DR*: The character with the responsibility to confront Voldemort should have a bigger flexibility when it comes to boosting their capabilities. Hermione tends to be reverse-bashed even if she doesn't need it. I don't really like bashing or reverse bashing.

** Hermione Granger. I tend to skip fics that write her as perfect. She was a know it all who was socially awkward, didn't care about looks so she didn't dress fancy or whatever. She tried to help the House Elves become free, which while a nice thought the majority of them were fine with how it was. She could have made it so that the House Elves were treated better instead of being free, that probably would have made them happy, Dobby was just an exception to most House Elves.

Don't get me wrong, I like Hermione; but she's not my favorite. Heck I don't think she's even in my fifth or tenth favorites. She's a good character don't get me wrong, but she got me annoyed at her so much.

Draco Malfoy: Thought Muggles, Muggleborns, Squibs ect extra were beneath him. Was a daddy's boy who believed in what his father told him, looked down on anyone who wasn't a Pureblood, rich or had some sort of connections. Don't get me wrong I love Draco, and thanks to some great fanfictions he's become one of my favorite characters. But he can get way too much love in my opinion.

Severus: Hated Harry because he reminded him of James, was rather rude and cruel to people, was a known Death Eater but was allowed to teach students, again don't get me wrong I love him, he's one of my favorite characters even before I started reading fanfiction but sometimes the love for him feels very strange.

Daphne Greengrass: We know nothing about her except the fact that she has a sister named Astoria and that she's Pureblood, and yet so many people write about her. Why?

Sirius: Treated Snape horribly along with his friends, was a bully to other students at Hogwarts, and is for whatever reason seen as a sex God to fanfiction writers. Yet again don't get me wrong, I love Sirius, he's a great character despite or in spite of his flaws, but the way fanfiction writers write him is crazy imo.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/69p2uc/what_is_the_attraction_for_snape_stories/dh8fhtm/]]

#+begin_quote
  Yarglethatblargle may be right about Rickman's impact on some of the fandom, but I started out in a LiveJournal corner of Snape-fanciers who preferred the book character, and Rickman!Snape bore very little (as in, no) resemblance to him. (I have to pause here and say I loved Alan Rickman, enjoyed him in several movies, and considered him wildly if unconventionally attractive. But as Snape, he was wrong, wrong, wrong.)

  I think a lot of people are drawn to acidic, sarcastic, self-destructive, sacrificial characters because they carry around their own electrical charge and create narrative tension wherever they go. Snape is extremely smart (which is sexy), a bundle of contradictions (which is intriguing), self-loathing (which implies backstory hurt), a highly entertaining arsehole (which is vicariously satisfying), cruel and spiteful (which sets up retribution and consequences), trapped by his own mistakes (which I can sympathize with, while knowing quite well he brought it on himself), and loyal to a fault (which is an unexpected virtue in someone so emotionally damaged). He's also intense as fuck, which is something I appreciate in fictional characters. And while the books harp on about his ugliness, most descriptions of him fall along lines I find attractive. E.g., in canon, a large hooked nose is obviously meant to be an unfortunate facial feature, but I'm a fan of hooked noses in real life.

  None of this is really an explanation, and I have to add that I'm a slash fan so my criteria may be slightly different from het shippers. But the very fact that Snape is such an unholy mess is part of what I look for in fics about him. I want the relationship to be a struggle, and I don't necessarily want romance. Redemption, perhaps. Possibly tragedy. I want a skinny, unkempt, bitter, intellectually brilliant and emotionally fucked-up, grudgeholding, vicious, desperate, formerly working-class, touch-starved, overworked, thirty-something rage-a-holic whose life has been a nonstop shitshow and who tends to take his thwarted hunger and guilt and grief out on the people around him. I want competence porn, in which Snape is very, very good at what he does, balanced by incompetence porn, in which a stronger and more emotionally stable character backs him up against a (metaphorical) wall and breaks him or seduces him or sends him into a frothing, helpless rage. I see Snape as an obsessive personality, and I like dysfunctional relationships and emotional addiction (in fiction! not reality!), and oh boy does he deliver.

  Also, it's important to remember that the mystery of Snape's behavior was a thread that ran through all the books, and fans loved speculating about his reasons for allying himself with the Good while not being good himself. Mystery adds an extra dimension, and many of us formed our sense of Snape before the last book dispelled the mystery with a romance-novel cliché.

  I somehow doubt this long ramble helps you understand, and apologies if it bored the pants off you. But for one fan, this is an incomplete summary of things that make me passionate about Snape as someone I like to read and write about, and whom I ship with a fair portion of the Potterverse.

linkffn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love) A canon compliant friendship fic between Snape and Luna, this fic is a good character study, it does focus less on his bad side though and more covers his state of mind during Hogwarts years.

linkffn(The art of self fashioning) This one takes it too far in my opinion since he doesn't have any good parts to him at all in it. He is never redeemed here either and it comes back to him in a bad way. Harry is also a psychopath in this AU so he is kind of messed up.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

*** I think it's less about the genious, and more about the Emma Watson/Veela like incarnation of Genious (with a capital G) that can do no wrong.

Lady Archimedes by White Squirrel is a fic that achieved a genious Hermione who could still fuck up really badly, and your little Lady Thief still makes mistakes. These aren't the 'reverse bashing' people are referring to here.

Rowling is also the same woman who gave Cursed Child an approval, completely disregarding her own canon. It's hard to justify anything she says (or sanctions) when it doesn't fit the canon as presented in the books.

  "She's a caricature of me --- a real exaggeration --- because I was never that clever, and Hermione is a borderline genius. I don't think I was quite that annoying, but when I was eleven I was very insecure. I covered up for it by studying hard and getting good grades. By twelve I loosened up. Hermione is going to loosen up, too."
