I feel sickened just writing the title, I pray to all the higher beings that this not be real but if it is may Cthulu destroy us all.


** If there is Harry/Lily, and Hogwarts/Squid, and stories where Arthur whores out Bill, there are bound to be stories about Harry/Umbridge, and people who read them.

*** Lily is hot, and a redhead. The other details just get in the way for some people

**** tbh I'm surprised there aren't lots of Harry/Lily or Harry/Ginny/Susan or any other Harry/redhead fics. Could make interesting stories.

***** They mostly end up as crackfics with Lily being brought back to life or something. I could maybe see one working where Harry travels back in time to the marauder's era, but that's not really something I would read anyways.

****** Those resurrection fics are unoriginal. They're BS.

I like the kind of fic where Lily raises Harry, Harry travels back in time to the Marauder's era like you said, and the fic below is a guilty pleasure: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6644695/6/Harry-Potter-The-New-Life]]

That's probably enough material to scar you for life.

*** "I just can't resist you, your curves, your grown up and sagging titties and your tight skin that is covered with too much make-up. It just turns me on, I can't help it!"

Wow just beautiful.

**** I never read them. I just did a quick search for them and posted the urls. I would never willingly read a fic like this... Well not unless someone offered me money in advance to read them.

Shame that. I would love to see someone tackle this in a (semi) realistic way.
