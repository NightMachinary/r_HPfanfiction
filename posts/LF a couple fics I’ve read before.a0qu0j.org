The first is a Harmony fic that starts off at the epilogue and Harry is with Ginny. Harry goes mental because he finds out he is living a lie and Hermione goes back in time to several moments in her life to see where things were changed. I feel like t gets recommended a lot but I couldn't find it on the most popular list.

I remember very little about the second, but there are chapters from many different character's point of view. In one chapter the Order goes to a secluded wooded area for a funeral for Order members who have died and it is a trap. The POV goes to Fred and George who share a single mind as twins. One of them doesn't make it and the other experiences the solitude of a single mind for the first time. I remember it being heart wrenching.


** The first one is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6033933/1/Time-is-the-Fire][Time is the Fire]] by Oddment Tweak.
