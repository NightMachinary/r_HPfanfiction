I recently read about half of 'barefoot' and I'm wondering if there are stories like it, specifically the relationship with Harry and Albus. I mostly read manipulative/Greater Good Albus, but I just loved reading this relationship

*** I have now started to read that story like 3 times and each time I wondered why I dropped it. I mean it was not stellar but okay, but then I reach this fucking [[/spoiler][Hedwig becomes a human]] thing and I remember why I ran away.

** Maybe you'll like /Blindness/. It doesn't focus much on Harry and Albus, but does have a mature acting and competent Harry with a gimmick (in this case his Daredevil-like compensation for his blindness).

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** This series by Shezza has an amazing relationship between a 'doesn't give a fuck' Harry and a 'trying to do the right thing' Dumbedore. It has IMHO by far the best relationship (from a reader's perspective) between the two. linkffn(3473224;3856581;4359957)

**** The second and third parts have some of the best fight scenes I've ever read. Both Voldemort and Dumbledore are shown as hypercompetent and ludicrously powerful. Also, the wand magic can be said to stay true to canon in terms of how it works. To quote Dumbledore from the story

#+begin_quote
  "Voldemort is a powerful wizard," Dumbledore said gravely. "He has undergone procedures and rituals that would have crushed a lesser wizard and come up on top. He will shrug off and regenerate all but the most severe physical and magical wounds, although your skills in this area probably exceed his. His spells will be tens-times more powerful than the average Auror-class wizard. His reflexes and duelling style is unique to himself and quite possibly one of the most dangerous duellists in the world. His stamina, unmatchable by even myself. His greatest asset, however, is his mind. His ability to analyse a situation in a split-second and react accordingly will match even your own superior senses. I have heard some compare Lord Voldemort to a modern-day Salazar Slytherin. That is incorrect. Voldemort surpassed Slytherin long ago."
