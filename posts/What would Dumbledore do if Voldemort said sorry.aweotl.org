It's a bit of a crack question, but I'm serious. Dumbledore is all for second chances, and I don't think Tom has used his second one yet. I'll add context for the scenario I imagine.

After the defeat of Voldemort by Harry as an infant, Voldemort is stuck in his He-Who-Is-Less-Than-A-Ghost form for a few years. Eventually, Tom finds Dumbledore. Where? Not a clue. Why? Help, of course. What does Dumbles do?

I've asked this question a few times. Most notably in linkffn(The Rise of a Dark Lord by Little.Miss.Xanda) where Dumbledore can't bring himself to immediately kill Harry when he thinks that he might be Tom Riddle reborn. This one quote really stayed in my mind.

#+begin_quote
  "Is that so? Do you want to take care of it now then? Do you want me to hold him down while you fire an 'Avada Kedavra' at him?" though his tone was light, his eyes had lost their usual twinkle and were as cold as ice.
#+end_quote

If Tom really was an eleven year old at Hogwarts, then I can't imagine Dumbledore would do anything to harm him. That may just be my idea that most people wouldn't be able to harm a hair on Hitler's head if they held him as a baby especially if they weren't told who it was at first. Anyways, I am fairly settled on this idea that Dumbles wouldn't hurt baby/adolescent Tom if he hadn't done anything.

Feel free to give my your thoughts on any context though. The one I gave is what I'd like to see, but I would be interested in anyone explaining it. How far is Dumbles willing to go for second chances?

  "No, nothing," said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face. "The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Tom ... I wish I could ..."
#+end_quote

Realistically, Dumbledore wouldn't believe Tom if he said he was sorry. It would seem like a trick, because Tom doesn't know how to feel true remorse.

But if we're going with the scenario, and Tom really was sorry, then the second chance would have to involve penitence, justice, and repayment. In a cracky AU, that would be Voldemort doing community service, returning all of his horcruxes to their legal owners, removing all the Dark Marks, giving a proper burial of all the people he turned into Inferi, and returning the bodies to their families, personally apologizing to Kreacher, Pius Thicknesse, the Jorkins family, etc.

In a less cracky AU, Tom would have an extended holiday in Nurmengard, because Azkaban can't hold him.

**** What /is/ the point? What would Dumbledore do to Ghost_Voldemort versus what he'd do to 11 year old Fetus_Voldemort?

Dumbledore goes by the logic of "He who commits the crime, does the time", unless there are extenuating circumstances. 11 y.o. Tom Riddle is a thief and a bully and would probably be fixed with therapy and good adult guidance. 60 y.o. Ghost Riddle is a terrorist and murderer and should face the justice system, but if the Ministry is too incompetent or corrupt to hand down a conviction, then there's always extrajudicial vigilante justice.

How far would this vigilante justice go? As much as it takes to teach Tom a lesson, but for the purposes of rehabilitation, not cruelty or vengeance.

***** Although I do not resent people sharing the belief that Dumbledore wouldn't, I was asking what possible paths Dumbles would take if he were to do so.

A hypothetical. For example, if I were to ask what would happen if gravity turned off, then the answer wouldn't be "gravity can't turn off because..."

****** Your hypothetical makes the character so completely unrecognizable from their canon version, that if it was true then the story itself could not be told the way it was.

A Tom Riddle with the ability to feel true remorse and repentance wouldn't have become Voldemort in the first place. He would have had empathy for others, and learned from his mistakes, which are the two main reasons why Voldemort turned into a soulless snake man and died.

It's like asking "What if Snape really /was/ a single mother?" Or "What if every character in Harry Potter /was/ gay?"

******* It's more along the lines of asking "What if Snape was forced to attend a Birthday Party?". Putting a character into different situations is how you develop that character. To go back to my former analogy, If I asked what if gravity turned off, then the answer wouldn't be "But gravity can't turn off. If you turned it off, then it wouldn't even be gravity.".

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

I think 'Dumbledore giving second chances' is way overblown in the fandom. In Malfoy's case, he's hurt people but hasn't actually done anything inexcusably evil yet, is still a kid, and has to deal with his parents effectively being hostages. In Snape's case, Dumbledore basically gets Snape to do whatever he wants, it's not like he forgave him immediately. That only happens after they work together for years. Grindelwald gets locked away instead of killed, but for him that's more personal and he recognizes it as a weakness.

Pulling from the top comment in the above thread, recall this scene:

#+begin_quote
  “You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed. “Above such brutality, are you?”

  “We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,” Dumbledore said calmly. “Merely taking your life would not satisfy me.”
#+end_quote

Against Voldemort, it's not so much about second chances. It's about going above and beyond to end him permanently. If he thought it was Voldemort reborn, someone who he knows is fundamentally irredeemable (especially within the context of something like horcrux possession), I could see him making the choice to end them regardless of appearance/age.
