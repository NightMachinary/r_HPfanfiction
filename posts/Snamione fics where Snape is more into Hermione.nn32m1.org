Tired of reading fics where Hermione is in love with a Snape who is still in love with Lily, or where Snape is just generally a bastard to her. Looking for fics where we have a Snape who is super whipped in his feelings for Hermione. Bonus if Hermione is less into him than vice versa.

Examples can include end of marriage law where Snape is sad bc he expects Hermione to be eager to leave.

Thanks all!

** I'm glad you asked for this. I didn't realize how many of my bookmarks and even my own fics had her pursuing him and not the other way around. I'll be peeking back here to see what others come up with!

I might have a pair of fics for you, from my own works list ;) In both /[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28292328/chapters/69327945][Fridays I'm In Love]]/ and /[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29359479/chapters/72119202][Letters by Candlelight]]/ he falls hard and fast, while she takes a little longer to figure it out.

From my bookmarks, you might like /[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1176726/chapters/2398352][Another Dream]]/ by dragoon811 which is rather fluffy sweet romance, and /[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/641517/chapters/1163321][The Marriage Benefit]]/ by miamadwyn which is a fake-relationship story that has /hilarious/ banter.

*** Popping back in here to say I binged Friday I'm in Love last night, and it was fantastic!! Thank you so much and really amazing writing :D A lot of fics might have nice premise and plot, but the writing is heavy-handed and I just can't get into it. But you write with a great fluidity, depth, and ... the story just FLOWS so well! I'm excited to check out your second story :)

*** Exactly! Many (if not most) fics seem to be her being put through the emotional wringer by him. Since I'm a woman and identify with HG's character, it feels a bit masochistic. A lot of those stories are well-written and intense, but I just want the table turned for a bit.

Thanks for your recs!! I'll be working through them :) In exchange, if you haven't read Aurette already (which I'd be shocked by), her "The Tattered Man" and "Appetizers" are two stories that fit my descriptions. Also "The Stone" by I M Sterling. Beware the Tattered Man - that one was seriously depressing T.T
