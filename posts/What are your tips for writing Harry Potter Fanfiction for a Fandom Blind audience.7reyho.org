** You need to approach it as if you're writing an original story. But I would say if you weave in too much canon background you risk irritating the non fandom-blind readers. Fanfiction really doesn't work in the same way as original fiction so you need to take a different approach. In any case how likely is it that someone who is completely ignorant of the canon will read it? This is Harry Potter. Almost everyone has a vague idea of the plot and characters even if they hate it. And how likely is it that someone who isn't already a fan to some degree is ever going to read a fanfic? So you may be finding a problem where there needn't be one.

** It depends on the Audience and the story you want to tell. Do they take a critical look at the media they read/watch? If so try to fix inconsistencies like the stupidity of Dumbledore's master plan, Malfoy not ending up in Azkaban for using unforgivables on civilians, Snape being a good guy in the end or Molly claiming that Harry is like a son and yet letting his abuse go on for another 5 years.

Are they hopeless romantics? Well in that case drown them in fluff. Do they love mysteries? Time for an Auror story. Do they want a "badass Harry"? Grab the 2 .50 cals Rambo style, build your harem and prepare the oneliners.

Generally speaking you want to avoid fandom favourites like Daphne Greengrass because outside of fanficton nobody knows who that is. The same goes for popular fandom concepts such as Snape as a godfather or that dating the magical Waffen-SS is a good idea because they are hot.

Avoid twenty pages of infodumping your ideas on magical theory, or the two chapter long "I WILL NOT BE CONTROLLED DUMBLES FUCKING DUMBLEDORE!! 1!!" Stick to basic plots like an alternative Yule Ball, postwar slice of life or time travel fix it. Something with a clear objective.

** Have the first letters of you opening paragraphs spell out "read the books".
