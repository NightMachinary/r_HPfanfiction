  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1399984/1/Recnac-Transfaerso][Recnac Transferso]] is the first fic in one of my favourite old series (and it's complete!) where Harry befriends a Muggle family during the summer after 4th year and essentially transfers the father's cancer to himself. This fic deals with the repercussions of that decision. linkffn(1399984)

****** What an apt description! I never get tired of it -- it's full of both tears and laughter, and despite how devastating it can get at times, it's also incredibly heartwarming. I'm glad I stumbled across it all those years ago.

  In a rash act of self-sacrifice, Harry saves a dying Muggle by magically transfering the man's cancer to himself. Now, going through his fifth year with a terrible secret, he begins to realize just what he's given up. H/G, R/Hr. Warning: abuse

** I have a strange obsession with hypertrichosis recently, so...visualise a Harry with that?

And maybe everyone assumes he botched an animagus transformation when trying to emulate his parents?

I saw one that was never finished (or got past the first few chapters, though they were good) where Harry was stuck with transforming from human to basilisk every sunset and back every sunrise, too, if you like magical diseases. linkffn(5915237)

  Thanks to a healing gone wrong in the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is now a Basilisk. Able to turn into a "Human Harry shaped" Basilisk from sunrise to sunset, he tries to keep this a secret. How long until his secret gets out and the panic begins?
