I'm writing a Sirius-centric fic.

The premise is that instead of waiting for the sight of Wormtail in the Daily Prophet, Sirius instead breaks out just before Harry's first year of Hogwarts.

I'm trying to get as close to the book Sirius as possible. Meaning making him intelligent, and clever. He realizes that Harry was safer with him in prison as a child, and once he is already in Hogwarts, will be able to introduce himself.

Since he has nowhere to go, he takes advantage of Dumbledore's arrogance. (A bit of my story goes into a slight character analysis of Dumbledore, and how Sirius recognizes this weakness of his), and hides on the grounds of Hogwarts.

Anyone have tips as to how I keep him close to IC? Or avoiding any stupid cliches that are of the eye-rolling quality?


** I'm sure people will have lots of input for you (or I'm happy to write more when not on mobile), but curious about something you said:

#+begin_quote

    realizes Harry was safer with him in prison as a child

Mind expanding on that? Is that a character analysis point (that he doesn't consider himself a good guardian), or a plot point (biding time for some reason) in your story?

*** More along the lines of Sirius being clever enough to understand what Dumbledore is up to, and agreeing that him being away from the Wizarding World is the best for Harry. I think it's well known that the Ministry is tainted by Death Eaters in power, and he knows that some of them would just attempt to tear him down.

I am definitely going to have Sirius build political alliances for Harry, but not in the “Lord Black-Potter” bullshit that you see EVERYWHERE. Haha more like a subtle use of the Black's gold, and using either blackmail-which is something Sirius would have no hesitations using-or downright extortion.

**** Accepting for the sake of argument that Sirius feels that Harry is best off away from the wizarding world, why does Sirius choose to stay in Azkaban and be tortured rather than escape and check on Harry in Muggle form ? Or just plain escape and wait for Harry to enter a Hogwarts from a tropical island rather than from Azkaban?

***** Exactly what I was about to ask.

OP, I'd also be careful with how you go through his thought process here. It's not a foregone conclusion he'd even be able to understand that kind of thinking in Azkaban; it's debatable how much you can focus on anything that isn't fear, pain, guilt, etc. (though I suppose you could write this as /they're all after Harry and I failed him, I'm better off in here and him away from me/).

Also, in canon, he needed the newspaper to leave Azkaban. Before that it was his innocence, which kept him just focused enough to retain some of who he was/his power, and thus the ability to transform that kept him sane. But that wasn't enough to give him the strength to leave. So there needs to be that push or some reason why he's only able to do it around 1991 in your timeline.

Unless it's hand waved, I probably wouldn't buy a story that has Sirius waking up, somehow realizing what year it was, and then noping out of his cell after ten years. It's pretty clear from canon it was a more involved psychological process than that.

****** It might just be my own errors, but I've almost been looking at it in the, “I've already failed my best friend once, I can't do it again,” determination.

Sirius in canon has been shown to have a very extreme sense of self, and mental fortitude. He escaped Azkaban, swam to shore from the prison, trekked miles and miles from the island to Surrey, and then Hogwarts after over a decade of exposure to Dementors. That's some serious shit.

Maybe I'm exaggerating said mental fortitude, but I think the Dementors in general are inconsistent in canon. If they're as bad as they're stated to be, then how don't they just drive all of Voldemort's followers away when they're allied to him? Wouldn't someone like Bellatrix, if we're going by the effects of Azkaban, have some sort of outward reaction to said alliance?

******* I agree with you entirely on that and I don't think our points are incompatible. He's my favorite character by a long shot, partially for this very reason: his mental fortitude.

Sirius says most people go insane within a year; he lasted twelve. There was a mental toughness that could take the thought "I'm innocent" and use it to stay sane for so long. But I think he still needed that push from the paper to actually go, because it fueled his "obsession" (his words) to not fail James/Harry again that made him strong enough. He was an animagus day one as he was on day four thousand, so something changed in his mind. At the end of the day, the Dementors were kept on Azkaban to lock prisoners in their own mind and they're magical, dark creatures; there's only so much a strong sense of self can do for you, I think.

But this is also just his own way of describing it...and to be fair, when Remus (or whoever) asks him in the Shack he straight up says he doesn't know how he did it.

The Dementors are very inconsistently written, as is his reaction to them, frankly. My personal head canon for the escaped Death Eaters is that they had their own version of "I'm innocent" to cling to; either that Voldemort would return for them, or that they were innocent because they were doing what they should have done. Also, are they all sane? We only see Bellatrix up close to any degree and she's ... suspect, hah. And then you've got Sirius, who gets a bit cheeky with the Minister and seems "bored" but also falls unconscious within like ten seconds of seeing them in PoA in the woods. I think it's most helpful to think of them like JKR intended: as a metaphor for depression. The cliche image of someone with depression isn't a person muttering to themselves, it would be like Sirius and Fudge; detached, bored, withdrawn, etc. But if you've been removed from them and then it pops back up unexpectedly, it might hit harder.

***** This is my first stretch of my own head canon-is that Sirius spends most of his time in his animagus form.

I haven't read PoA in a long time, but I remember it being stated that it helped a bit for him to be a dog, so I asked myself, “Then why didn't he just stay as a dog for most of the time he was there?”

Why he wouldn't just escape at any time? You think Dumbledore would allow Harry to stay in the same place, or not make preparations for Sirius to go after him? They believe him to be a mass-murdering Death Eater on the level of Bellatrix. He would catch Dumbledore more off guard by breaking out at a convenient time for himself.

****** I do think Dumbledore would leave Harry in the same place, yes, because of Lily's protections. In canon, Sirius WAS able to approach Harry at the Dursley's (in dog form) the night Harry blew up Marge, despite Sirius' prison break being front page news in both the magical and Muggle worlds. Everyone involved then let Harry live on his own in Diagon Alley for a week. I don't see how that would be different if Sirius broke out when Harry was two or five or eight versus thirteen.

Of course, it doesn't matter what I think or what happened in canon--- it matters that your alterverse Sirius draws the conclusion that he can't approach Harry or that he would somehow hurt Harry by breaking out.

I personally would have a hard time wrapping my mind around Sirius biding his time for years before breaking out. He wants to be away from the dementors; dog form lessens the agony but doesn't eliminate it. He wants to get a look at Harry, if not take custody of him. He wants the other people he loves (Andromeda, Remus) to know he's innocent--- Harry is most important to Sirius, but not the sole person who matters to him.

The canonical glimpse of the newspaper “lighting a fire in his head... cleared his mind” was a trigger the absence of which I would feel in any fic that didn't replace it.

Y'know, that reminds me of something I once thought of one night when I couldn't sleep and had just finished watching that scene in the movie. I was lying there trying to sleep and being annoyed at how underwhelmingly small movie-Sirius's dog form is. And I got to wondering: *"What if Sirius - without identifying himself - had actually approached Harry in human form?"*

It's dark, and if he has managed to steal or otherwise obtain robes or some garment with a hood, he could conceal his features easily enough. Plus if Harry asks who he is, he can always introduce himself by his nickname.

I'd written up a short conversation between him and Harry that then gets interrupted, but I forget what I did with it.

******* I'd like to think my Sirius had that fire since the very beginning. Maybe I'm not explaining it well enough, or I have to go back and edit the beginning of the story, but I'll try to express this as well as I can.

Dumbledore was neglectful of Harry. I don't think he was willingly, as he's ultimately a good person, but I think he let his arrogance get the better of him. He couldn't possibly leave Harry with a demented family, of course not.

He is a genius, though. If Sirius Black was actually a threat to Harry, there'd be no way Dumbledore wouldn't have an increased amount of people watching Harry at the Dursley's. He'd be pulling favors left and right, or even personally looking out for his safety.

The way I'm writing is that Sirius is smart enough to realize this, and rather than risk it, goes to Hogwarts instead. My idea is hiding in plain sight.

****** I suggest rereading the books to see what Sirius is like, I find it helps when writing a character, so pay attention to Remus, Dumbledore, Harry, people central to the story, etc.

Sirius likely didn't stay in his Animagus form most of the time because he himself says his emotions are simpler, as is his thinking method. Staying like this for a long time is going to have some psychological effect, I'd guess. Maybe he'd even lose himself.

As for not escaping, he probably thought he deserved it. Also, if you does escape, then what's he gonna do? Try to prove his innocence? That'd hardly work since Wormtail is the only 'evidence' he has and he doesn't know where he is. Anything he says could be taken as him lying. The story is also incredibly outlandish and if you wants to present some proof, however small, then he's admitting that he's broken crucial law for the past decade and more, when he wasn't even of age yet. I imagine it might do more harm than good, especially if Snape testifies to him almost getting him killed as well. It's really not a good test for his character in court.

Remus thinks he's the traitor, as does Dumbledore and the entire Order. By then he's probably the person they'd hate the most. As far as he knows, Harry is at his aunt's and we don't know if he realises she's abusive or not so he's safe, the last thing he knew was that he was with Hagrid, whom he seemed to have trusted.

Another thing about Sirius that I rarely say mentioned is that when it comes to people he loves, he is not that reckless. At first, he doesn't immediately give Harry to Hagrid and flies off after Pettigrew. No, Hagrid himself says that he kept arguing with him to give Harry over but he eventually lost. Only after them did Sirius start hunting for Peter. I also doubt that he'd hunt for Peter, willing to kill, with Harry in the crook of his arm.

His plan was also ingenious if it weren't for the minor inconvenience of Wormtail being a spineless traitor. He keeps warning Harry of danger in GOF. That's the time where he's most mentally stable. After Lily and James's death he wouldn't be that emotionally stable but he's not as mentally detoriated as after Azkaban and in OotP, but he still hadn't met his wit's end.

He's clearly the most impulsive and reckless when he's very mentally unstable. In PoA he's extremely reckless, with no planning whatsoever and as Dumbledore puts it, acting as a not very innocent man. In OotP, when he's locked up and basically under house arrest, he also starts getting reckless.

I do not understand this reasoning. Are you trying to suggest that Sirius thought that Pettigrew might have made an attempt on Harry's life before he was 11 if he'd lived with Sirius (and on the run?)?

Either way, Sirius knew where Harry lived - right after breaking out, he visits Harry at 4 Privet Drive. Sirius was also the best man at Lily and James' wedding, so he'd have been introduced to the Evans family at some point or the other and probably met Petunia and Vernon before (and seen them for what they were). Knowing all that, why would he leave Harry to the mercy of the Dursleys for 10 years?

Sirius was able to flee the country after PoA - why not make away with Harry, and flee the country, to a place where the Ministry and Albus Dumbledore won't look?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

If you're going to have Sirius think upon Albus' actions, make him extremely distrustful of Albus. Sirius fought alongside Albus' vigilante order for three years, probably risking his life several times - and Albus throws all of that in the trash and testifies against Sirius immediately and does not even take a moment to talk to him in prison (and one talk would have been all that was needed to ensure Sirius' innocence). If someone tossed me aside like that, and condemned me to years in prison, I'd probably never trust that person ever again.

Same goes with Remus - he too testifies against Sirius and turns his back on him completely.

  Or avoiding any stupid cliches that are of the eye-rolling quality?
#+end_quote

Avoid writing Sirius as a happy go lucky kind of person. He's spent years in Azkaban after his best friend and best friend's wife are murdered by someone they all trusted. No one comes out of something like that smiling and joking. Canon Sirius was happy only a handful of times, and in those moments, he's always happy because of Harry - either Harry accepting his offer of staying with him (PoA), Harry doing well in the TWT (the cave scene), Harry being cleared in his trial... Too many authors write him as smiling all around, but the truth of the matter is that smiles were hard to come by for canon-Sirius.

Obviously, avoid shit like pup or cub or bambi or prongslet. Do not touch that crap with a ten foot pole.

The whole reason that they did the switch was that it was so very plausible that Sirius would be the chosen secret-keeper that no one would believe anything else. When you add in Sirius's family and that tons of witnesses saw Sirius kill Peter right after getting James killed... Remus just wouldn't have a reason to trust his gut, if his gut even said differently. Especially if Pettigrew had been feeding them each subtle misinformation to make them more suspicious of each other, which I see in many stories and it makes so much sense for him to do.

If anything, Pettigrew reacted the way most normal people will react. Despite what we think of ourselves, fear is one hell of a thing. People do not act rationally, and are willing to go to extreme depths out of desperation. All in all, Pettigrew was a scared young man who was facing the most powerful Dark Wizard known until that point. Would you act any differently? I'm not excusing his actions, as he was shown to be a coward even later, but he loved James and Lily, and Harry.

That was what made his betrayal so hard on Sirius and Remus. The four friends loved one another dearly. I can understand the way Remus feels. Feeling betrayed such as that would make me livid. I can only imagine the complexity of that situation.

Let me say that I love, love, love fics where Pettigrew was just scared, and where they were all brilliant friends. I even love me some Pettigrew redemption. Nice Pettigrew is the best, but he's AU as hell.

Unfortunately, if you look at what he actually does in canon, I don't even think it's the case that being scared is his only motivation. Fear leads to a fight, flight, or paralyzation response. So his natural response should be to fight harder, run away (like to another country where all this was't going on) or do as little as possible and hope to be overlooked. Instead, what happens is that Peter's Gryffindor side comes out. He decides to go for his greatest wish - to be on the winning side, to sit beside the biggest bully and watch while everyone else gets hurt. Accordingly, he becomes a spy, hoping to get the greatest reward if Voldemort wins, and also hoping he'll never be found out if Voldemort loses. It takes some big brass balls to be a spy, honestly, when Snape did it Harry called him the bravest man he'd ever known. Why don't we give Peter Pettigrew the same? Because we believe him when he says he's scared. But- Pettigrew never /acts/ scared. He always seizes the moment and attempts the best outcome for himself. He's not a timid mouse- he's a rat.

His betrayal was disgusting, and his framing of Sirius was a stroke of genius. Everyone knew Sirius was a wrathful and vindictive person. Especially Remus, considering Sirius dared Snape to go to the Shrieking Shack on the night of a full moon.

I'm just saying that initial moment of weakness is extremely plausible in most nearly anyone. If a gun was pointed at your head, chances are you'd do what you're told to survive. It's a slippery slope from there on. At least, that's my thoughts on it.

I'm not sure how Azkaban can be compared with regular prisons, but in regular prisons, you can visit prisoners on occasion. If we are to assume that Azkaban too has this, then we can safely say that neither Remus nor Albus visited Sirius once while in prison.

Sirius is someone who broke several laws just to give Remus an easier time for his monthly transformations. He goes against everything he's known from his family for the sake of his friends. And after all that, he is instantly thrown away without a second thought of even the possibility that he might be innocent.

Also, not forgiving either Albus or Remus and developing a deep distrust of them, even if it is irrational (not that I think it is) makes Sirius' character somewhat better than having him adopt a forgive and forget attitude. If you think that is flawed, let Sirius be flawed.

***** You're looking at it from the point of view of already knowing the answer- that Sirius is innocent.

Think about it this way, what if you had a brother and loved your brother, but one day your brother was found by the police in his basement with the remains of multiple women's bodies who had recently disappeared from the area surrounding him- including your mother and sister- and he was laughing madly and confessed to killing them? Well. You wouldn't like it, certainly. It might not feel right, but are you seriously going to believe that it's a conspiracy masterminded by your sister, whose body was faked, and push for a trial against your brother's wishes? That's not a sane assumption to make. You'd most likely just put down any lingering feelings of unease to the total shock that you were feeling that this had happened at all.

If you assume Pettigrew is dead, there's simply no one else it could have been. I don't think it's that odd that Lupin never visited, even assuming it's possible. Some people would feel the need for a confrontation, or to ask why, but some people would just withdraw and find it too painful.

Disagree with his plans? Sure. You can't deny that Dumbledore was an incredibly intelligent person. His plans succeeded even after he died. You're telling me someone who isn't intelligent can pull that off??

Maybe the wise part is a bit stretched, but Dumbledore has experienced a lot in life, and is old. He's held more power than pretty much any other wizard of his age, and decided to teach, rather than conquer. He went from an angry young man to a wizened teacher.

I agree that his wisdom fails him at some points. As I've said, though. No one is infallible, as much as we'd like to point out his flaws, Dumbledore /is/ human.

We also know that he at some point concluded that a fragment of Voldemort's soul was bound to Harry when Voldemort's Killing Curse rebounded and destroyed his body.

Extrapolating from this, Dumbledore hypothesized that these two facts would enable Harry to survive Voldemort's attack once more, creating a window of opportunity, assuming all the other Horcruxes were destroyed, to permanently kill him. Either Harry or someone else does it. Ideally Harry. And it is on this basis that his entire stratagem(laid out gradually in DH) is built.

How would Harry conceivably accomplish this!? Certainly not by casting Expelliarmus at the guy!

*********** Yes, because your average old person has lived through two wars between the second most powerful dark wizard of all time, and the most powerful dark wizard of all time. I forgot!

Dumbledore personally led two wars against two of the greatest dark wizards in history. His character developed from an angry boy who was ALLIED to Grindewald, to realizing that he was wrong, and eventually defeating him in a duel to end the war. You're going to suggest that a man who realized through-what has been suggested to have been a romantic-love for Grindewald, that he was wrong, and needed to stop him?

I agree that people that are old does not immediately give them wisdom. However, Dumbledore was never your average wizard. Even from the start, he was immensely powerful, and intelligent. This already throws that argument out of the window.

Furthermore, do any of these quotes ring a bell?

"It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live."

"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself."

"Curiosity is not a sin. But we should exercise caution when it comes to our curiosity...yes, indeed..." Hmmm, this one sounds almost like he knows from personal experience, no?

I understand where you're coming from, and I used to agree with you. It's easy to make an almost antagonist out of Dumbledore, and say that he's dumb, or he's foolish. He really wasn't, though, and his very presence in the books shows that. Pretty much every book went according to his plan, and his plan only.

Does it?

Here's what his presence in the books actually shows *cracks knuckles* let's do this boooois:

- He gets completely bamboozled by 2 different Dark Lords
- fails to prevent Myrtle being murdered in a school where he teaches even though he was incredibly suspicious of Riddle (or at least he claims to have been, because he's wise)
- fails to protect his friend Hagrid from being framed, even though he knows or suspects the real culprit
- leads a paramilitary organization in a civil war against Riddle, but they get constantly defeated and/or murdered by Riddle's thugs (who FYI later lose against a bunch of 4th and 5th year school children... goes to show how effective Dumbledore's leadership must've been if they lost against these guys)
- gets completely fooled by Pettigrew who's spying on his organization
- fails to enact any kind of effective security measures, even though they believe there to be a spy (like mandatory truth serums, Legilimency, Unbreakable Vows, magical contracts)
- fails to effectively protect *both* of his most important war assets (the Potters and the Longbottoms) after a prophecy falls into his lap that could save him from his inept leadership
- has to be saved by the miracle that is Lily's sacrifice and Harry Potter
- fails to uncover the real spy again and is complicit in sending an entirely innocent man to prison
- sits on his ass for 10 years doing nothing even though he suspects Riddle might not be gone entirely
- refuses to fix Britain by becoming Minister and instead tolerates a bumbling fool like Fudge
- hires literally Voldemort as the DADA teacher. Can't detect a Dark Lord when he stands in front of him. This seems to be a theme with the guy.
- builds useless (in terms of Voldemort deflection) protections that could kill students. *It's a miracle that no curious pupil found their unfortunate death.*
- hires a fraud for the DADA position, ruining the DADA education of 7 years of students (among them OWL and NEWT students) for a second year in a row
- needs a little girl to figure out the Chamber of Secrets monster for him, while being completely inept at protecting the students from petrification or worse. *It's a miracle no one died.*
- hires an unreliable Werewolf for DADA, who is left unsupervised during the full moon. Said Werewolf then proceeds to almost maul/murder a bunch of students. *It's a miracle no one died*
- tolerates soul sucking demons around his school
- can't protect his school from a deranged escaped criminal. If Sirius were actually evil Harry and his friends would have been dead. *It's a miracle no one died*
- can't tell apart one of his oldest friends (Moody) from a Death Eater (Crouch). *+It's a miracle no one died+ Cedric died*
- still doesn't have any kind of security measures against espionage (like Polyjuice security questions, which even the inept Ministry later recommends)
- fails to protect the Goblet of Fire - an incredibly dangerous magical artifact - from being messed with. Having said artifact in a school full of children is probably reason enough to question how wise this man is.
- fails to protect Harry from being abducted
- tolerates a teacher in his school that literally tortures students. A wise and intelligent man would find a way to at least prevent the torture.
- thinks it's a good idea that Snape, who loathes Harry, is a good person to teach him Occlumency (which Dumbledore thinks is of the utmost importance to learn for Harry)
- lets Draco Malfoy stage assassination attempts in his school, embracing the possibility of Ron or Katie almost dying. *It's a miracle no one died*
- gets seduced by a ring of power like fucking Boromir, the opposite of being wise
- because of his Draco-machinations (/"Oh, i know what he's doing, it's all part of the plan"/) his school gets invaded by Death Eaters, *through sheer dumb luck no one of importance dies*

So... these are 27 examples of Dumbledore being either stupid or unwise. I'm quite sure I missed a bunch. The evidence against him is *staggering*.

You act like him seeing the Resurrection Stone was just for shits and giggles. You do realize that his little sister's death was his greatest regret?

Ah, right. Dumbledore has total control over Snape's actions. Should he have been more involved? Absolutely, I agree with you there! Let's just get this out of the way. Snape was one of the best Occlumens of his time. He was able to spy for Voldemort for years without being detected...Do you truly believe anyone else was fitting to teach Harry how to avoid Voldemort's mind magic other than someone who was constantly exposed to it??

I honesty think Dumbledore had begun to become aware of Sirius' innocence in PoA. Once he escaped, I believe that he began to truly look into it, and revisit the case, as he did with Voldemort's life. You're right on this one, though.

Just because Dumbledore is much more competent and capable than Fudge doesn't make him fit for power. His history suggested exactly against that, actually. He didn't see himself fit for power. It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.

I agree about Lockhart, but no one else knew that, either. Suspected, but there was no evidence as to what or who he was. Until Harry and Ron exposed him, of course.

Bamboozled by two dark lords?? When? He defeated both when he directly confronted them.

Accidents happen, in Myrtle's case. I'm sure it killed him that he couldn't save her in time, but you cannot simply point fingers without evidence. Especially at a school child, dude. You think he could've just outwardly accuse him without the evidence to back that up?

They found Aragog. It doesn't matter if Hagrid was innocent or not, there was irrefutable evidence of him harboring an illegal creature as a pet. No shit he couldn't stop them from expelling him! He did do more for Hagrid than anyone else, though.

When falling in love with a nascent Dark Lord leads to you or your crush murdering your own sister, I'd call that pretty bamboozled.

And, uhm, Voldemort bamboozled Dumbledore for decades. Until Dumbledore got a break through a lucky prophecy. He has accomplished nothing himself when it comes to Voldemort. Almost all of Harry's successes happen despite Dumbledore, not because of his help.

But I'll grant you the defeat of Grindlewald. Though I don't really see what fighting a magical duel has to do with intelligence or being wise. No one doubts Dumbledore's magical prowess. He's a magically powerful moron.

#+begin_quote
  I agree about Lockhart, but no one else knew that, either.
#+end_quote

Lockhart's incompetence is obvious. Apparently you can just tell from reading his books that he couldn't have possibly done all that he claims himself. Not to mention that, during the hiring process, a simple test of ability would have shown that Lockhart can't cast anything right except an Obliviate. Which means Dumbledore is so desperate for Professors that he just hires just anyone without any kind of test or background check, which again, makes him stupid and unwise. (btw, Pottermore disagrees with you on this and claims that Dumbledore knew that Lockhart was a fraud. But Pottermore is dumb. Kinda funny though that even they have to decide whether Dumbledore is incompetent or evil)

*** No, I believe Sirius-in canon, anyways-always prioritized Harry's well-being. Yes, he knows where the Dursley's are, but this Sirius does not know that Harry ended up with them.

I'm not sure of the /exact/ timing, but I made it so that Sirius believes that Alice and Frank Longbottom are the new guardians of Harry, as the torturing of those two happens as he's hunting Pettigrew at the beginning of the story. I'll make it so-like in canon-he understands the reasoning behind Dumbledore's actions, but attempts to better Harry's life.

I think it's mainly to do with Sirius having no way of figuring out how Harry's with the Dursley's? If Azkaban was some hell hole prison, why would they give their prisoners access to news on the outside? Kind of defeats the purpose, no? Rather than escape and head to Surrey, or even where the Longbottoms had previously resided, I had Sirius travel to Hogwarts. It just made more sense to me in my head.

Generally, it is the logical step to make. In spite of everything, the Dursleys are Harry's closest blood relations; it is only natural that he goes to them, as James does not have any siblings.

Since it is likely that there would have been an after-wedding party of some sort at the Evans house, Sirius would have known exactly where to find him.

You can also have James and Lily mention it in their wills, although I'd advise against it. The wills usually feature in trash-tier fics.

As for the Longbottoms, maybe the Lestranges or Crouch bragged about their deed while they were in Azkaban. If Azkaban is to have a wing for the prisoners who've committed the most heinous crimes, I'm quite sure that the Lestranges, Crouch and Sirius would be in it (Sirius, of course, being wrongly thrown there).

Of course, you can choose to ignore that if you like. But I like to think that Sirius would always prioritise Harry's well-being - if he were to break out early, he'd at least search for Harry's location first thing, just to see how he's doing.

That's something book-Sirius says as well -- he says that the prisoners, the Death Eaters, murmur Harry's name as much as Peter's name.

So he does have one way of finding out without ever having anything to do with the outside world - he can learn it solely from their ramblings inside the prison itself.

And once he's out...well, he's a wizard with a wand. He can pretty much disguise himself thoroughly while he's getting up to speed on the current state of Britain and have no one bar Alastor Moody be any wiser.

****** On this point, and one thing I have rarely if ever seen addressed in fics, is just the simple effect of being in the "hole" for however many years--even apart from the influence of the Dementors. Sirius clearly didn't have a cellmate (otherwise goodbye to the dog). I think it's safe also to assume that a prisoner kept in maximum security, where most inmates are driven mental, seemingly without proper hygiene (emaciated, matted hair, yellowing teeth), and where they will deny you medical care if you are dying (Crouch Jr.), wasn't mucking around in the showers or in the yard. This was hard core solitary confinement for over a decade. Even in America's entirely fucked up system, most supermax prisons get an hour of isolated yard time (whether they actually get that hour is a whole other story...but I digress), and these prisoners routinely report that it was absolutely, intolerably, life-alteringly terrible. Isolation like that is torture in many countries and in the U.S. for juveniles now. Research shows that after three months, your brain begins to rewire under these conditions. After two years, those changes become permanent.

Your post-Azkaban Sirius, if realistically written, is someone who is lonely almost beyond comprehension but would find normal human interaction very challenging. Rowling actually nailed his character in the fifth book with the explosive anger, bitterness, withdrawing from company, it's just a surprise he didn't show much of it before.

** If you really want to keep Sirius IC, then I think one of the main traits you should consider is his recklessness, as well as his reluctance/inability to plan ahead. He does what seems right at the moment and doesn't really think of the consequences. You see that over and over again with him; Sirius is the ultimate "seemed like a good idea at the time" sort. He definitely has a brain, he can be quite devious and even insightful when it suits him.... but he has this tendency to let his emotions get the better of him and act rashly.

Also... "Taking advantage of Dumbledore's arrogance" does not seem to me like something Sirius would deliberately do, especially since Dumbledore's level of arrogance is... complicated. (That's a post for another time though,) I mean, he might still hide on Hogwarts grounds with the reasoning "they'll never look for me here!" but I can't see him mentally bashing Dumbledore like that.

More likely he'd become a victim of his own arrogance and just naturally assume that nobody would ever see through his dog disguise.... Sirius does have a tendency to underestimate other people, or at least insist that they can't/won't do anything that could put him in danger.

So yes... I think that's the best way of keeping him IC. Recognize that he has a lot of intelligence, a lot of cunning, and NOT a lot of common sense. ^{_^}

*** See, I think after a decade of thinking about Dumbledore and what he's truly up to, he'd be able to realize how he thinks.

True, and you're right! Dumbledore's arrogance is very complicated, as he is also a very complex character. However, he is shown to have arrogant qualities. Such as allowing a Voldemort possessed Quirrell teach students.

Do you really think he'd think Sirius would hide under his nose, right in his face? Maybe he'd suspect, but I think one of his flaws is believing that'd be preposterous. Maybe my story is inherently flawed.

**** See, while I do think the plan could WORK, since Dumbledore doesn't know Sirius is an Animagus, I just don't think it's in Sirius's character to think "Dumbledore's so arrogant, he'll think he has the school completely safe!" That's just not the sort of attitude he would have... he'd be a lot more likely to think "I'm so good at this, nobody'll know it's me!" More likely to focus on his own strengths than others' weaknesses.

And I don't think he HAS had a decade of thinking about Dumbledore... remember, he was in Azkaban for that decade, where he only got to keep his non-happy thoughts. There were only two reasons he was even remotely sane after that: One, his innocence wasn't a happy thought so they couldn't take that. Two, he could turn into a dog, which apparently shielded him somewhat from the worst effect.

I don't think Dumbledore would be in his thoughts much at all. Wormtail, however, would.

***** Hmmm maybe, but Sirius's innocence ties into Dumbledore.

Dumbledore is a very high ranking, and highly respected wizard throughout their entire world. He held several important offices, and easily had the power to visit Sirius, or even attempt to reason with him. This is the man who tries to save Draco Malfoy, who throws unforgivables at students, or Snape.

It may just be me having a hard time writing it while knowing the story already.

****** The thing about that is that Sirius never gave Dumbledore, or anyone else, an opportunity to reason with him. The Secret-Keeper ploy, where Sirius told people HE was the Potters' Secret-Keeper (even refused to let Dumbledore be the Secret-Keeper, which in hindsight would probably have been smarter than the "clever ploy" they had going) ensured that everyone thought that Sirius had betrayed the Potters because NOBODY ELSE COULD HAVE. Then, when Peter's betrayal was imminent, Sirius does not try to tell anyone what happened; he just goes bananas and heads off to try and kill Peter. Then, when Peter fakes his own death, Sirius is found by the Aurors, completely out of his mind, ranting about how it was all his fault, how how killed James and Lily.

I mean, it's like he was TRYING to make people think he was guilty. Of course he wasn't; this was yet another example of Sirius not being able to plan ahead and just getting carried away with his own emotion. But given that there were DOZENS of other cases, Death Eaters and people who had been Imperiused, and the Ministry had a total mess to clean up here in trying to find out who WAS guilty and who WASN'T... an open-and-shut case like Sirius's must have seemed like something not worth spending a lot of time on.

Sirius was the only one who could have sold out the Potters. Sirius essentially confessed to the crime, after having killed thirteen people with one curse. Sirius is raving like a total madman, even laughing as they take him away. And... Sirius is a Black, and everyone knows Blacks are Voldemort sympathizers. Even if Sirius was estranged from his family and at least publically was against Voldemort, the odds are just stacked against him here.

If he'd had a trial, the truth might have come out... but the head of the law enforcement AND the head judge is Barty Crouch Senior, who ALREADY hates all Dark wizards. And so, in face of this overwhelming evidence, Barty just sentences Sirius to Azkaban without a trial.

Is Dumbledore supposed to just KNOW that the water-tight case against Sirius is a sham?

Sirius was so perfectly framed, partly by Peter and partly by his own reckless nature, that there was no reason for anyone to think he was anything but 100% guilty. At most they might lament "I would never have thought HE would turn out to be evil," but there was no reason for anyone to question it.

So there's no reason for Dumbledore to give Sirius any special treatment here... well, no other reason than that WE, the READERS, know Sirius's story and sympathize with him... but let's look at it from an in-universe perspective. Dumbledore says it himself: "Sirius has not acted like an innocent man."

Fair is fair. If Dumbledore has to visit SIRIUS in Azkaban, then he also has to visit ALL the Death Eaters in Azkaban. If Sirius is to be given that courtesy, so must the Lestranges, Barty Junior, and everyone else in that prison.

And Dumbledore does have a school to run, and tons of other duties. It IS pretty reasonable that he believed Sirius to be guilty and did not investigate further. If anyone should have done the investigation, it should have been Lupin, who did NOT have those responsibilities and DID have a reason to give Sirius special treatment.

******* Ahh, but you're forgetting that Remus runs away from his problems. Throughout the entire series, we see Lupin as someone who hides from what's wrong. Whether it be his self-loathing due to lycanthrophy, or distancing himself from Tonks when he begins to fall in love with her.

Dumbledore doesn't have such issues. And you're telling me that he focuses on the school, and everything else when he spent majority of OotP locked up in his office, doing jack shit? I get he has responsibilities, but he is obviously willing to sideline them for something within his personal interests. As we see also when he begins to backtrack through Voldemort's entire life.

So, yes. I expect Dumbledore-someone who is willing to look at the very last detail of Voldemort's life-to be able to say, "Hmm. Doesn't make much sense that someone who turns his back on one of the darkest families in the wizarding world would kill someone he clearly loved dearly." It was poor judgment on both sides that got Sirius in Azkaban for as long as he was in there.

Sirius does think with his heart more, and I agree with you. He went through zero effort to make himself look innocent in that case, but can you truly blame him for it? His best friend and brother in all but blood had been betrayed by another person he loved dearly. That would make literally anyone snap.

******** Sorry, but if you're willing to make excuses for the behaviour of Sirius and Remus, then you should also be willing to examine the possibility that Dumbledore had reasons for acting the way he did. You can't just say "you can't blame this person when..." and then not be willing to extend that to everyone.

As for the "spent the majority of OOTP locked up in his office, doing jack shit" .... how do you know that? All we know is that he wasn't interacting with Harry. We don't know what he was doing, other than the fact that he was spending some time organizing and coordinating the duties of the Order of the Phoenix. He also DID have his duties as a Headmaster... and unless you've actually worked as a Headmaster (or known someone who did) you might not know what a full-time job this is. To the students, the Headmaster might very well seem like someone who only sits in his office and waits for students to be sent to him or something like that... but that's far from the case. Headmasters are busy people, and given that Hogwarts has not TOTALLY fallen apart in the forty-plus years Dumbledore has had the job, we must assume that he has at least done an okay job there...

Thing about Dumbledore is, since the books are from Harry's POV, we only see Dumbledore when he directly interacts with Harry and/or shows up at mealtimes to be quirky. We know NOTHING of what he does -- but I'm very willing to bet that he does NOT just sit in his office, eat sweets and think about what a clever man he is.

I still say that it's a far bigger failure on the behalf of Remus, who not only knew Sirius a LOT better than Dumbledore did, but who also did NOT have any other duties, and did not have to be there to sort out the entire huge mess of Death Eaters after the war.

It's obvious to US that Sirius was innocent, because WE know the story. Neither Remus nor Dumbledore did. They knew there was a traitor in the Order, so they already knew that ONE person in the Order, whom they thought they could trust, was keeping them fooled.

So any sort of "wait a minute, this doesn't make sense" moment would have to apply to everyone. Does it make MORE sense that Peter, who everyone knew ABSOLUTELY ADORED James and Sirius, and would never have lifted a wand against eioher of them, would be the traitor? No, it doesn't... and yet we know he WAS the traitor.

I understand your argument, and it's a very strong one. However, I hold less slack with Dumbledore because of who he is. Dumbledore is not infallible, and I agree! He does have room for excuse. However, he shouldn't have nearly as much as two increasingly troubled practically boys.

Dumbledore was not directly tied to them like Remus and Sirius was. Could he have been upset with his student? Absolutely! Not on a personal level, though. Sirius was nobody to him but a face in the Order, and a former student. As was James, until the prophecy was said.

Dumbledore saw the best of everyone, or attempted to. You're going to tell me he was willing to reason with even Grindewald, but not with Sirius Black? 13 muggles and the Potter family isn't even close to an attempt at the entirety of Europe.

AND at the time Dumbledore was a free agent, AND he was the one who actually defeated Grindelwald. There's a world of difference here.

Dumbledore had nothing to do with the capture and imprisonment of Sirius. If Dumbledore had been the one to bring him down, then I would have said you had a point, but he wasn't.

Again, Dumbledore had no reason to think Sirius was innocent, nor did he have the personal connection he had with Grindelwald. So again, if he was to investigate Sirius, he should investigate ALL the Death Eaters. Most of them had been his students, after all, and I'm sure not all of them had the airtight case against them that Sirius did.

Dumbledore treats people with compassion and consideration when he interacts with them, but that necessitates that he actually has the chance to interact with them. If Dumbledore had been the one to catch Sirius, and just thrown him into Azkaban, or tried to kill him without subduing him, THEN that would have been a contradiction.

Dumbledore can't be everywhere and control everything. There are tons of events in the series when Dumbledore can't intervene or talk people into going easy on their enemies because he ISN'T THERE. He wasn't there when the Ministry arrested Stan Shunpike either. Why aren't you blaming Dumbledore for the arrest of Stan?

Sirius is just really bad at communicating... I mean, even when he meets Harry in POA, he's ominous and just says cryptic things like "there'll only be one death tonight" and then he explicitly agrees with Harry that he killed his parents.
