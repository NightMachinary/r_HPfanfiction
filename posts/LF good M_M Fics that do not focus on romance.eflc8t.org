For a bit of context, I'm gay and have disliked every slash fic I've tried over the years. The genre seems riddled with tropes that I find anywhere from annoying to offensive (to be fair, this often depends on the mood I'm in). It may be generalizing, but every single one of them seems like the sort of thing a woman that has no knowledge of gay relationships would daydream about.

Without fail, regardless of their canon characteristics, one of the protagonists will become more feminine. Inevitably, he will: spontaneously grow long hair, learn to cook, love cleaning for some reason, become more emotionally sensitive/unstable, spend every moment thinking about his significant other, etc. Alone, some of these traits would be innocuous, but it's difficult not to put them into a pattern that sours any enjoyment I find in a fic. It's like we've moved past the stereotypes that affected female characters in the past and decided to copy-paste them in every gay relationship (only for one of the characters though; can't have two feminine characters in a relationship, that would be /queer/). I'm aware that fanfiction is more predisposed to stereotypes than other forms of media, but most of the top fanfiction I've read/seen recommended are filled with badass female characters that actually exist beyond the world of their significant other, while every m/m story seems to be about a genderbent female stereotype from the 70's masquerading as a man.

With that rant over I'm looking for m/m stories that do not focus on romance, are set in the time-frame of the first 7 books, and do not engage in the tropes mentioned in said rant. I'd prefer fics that do not focus on noble culture, and feature characters that you would not think are gay, like Ron, but that is not a requirement.


** Here are some slash fics I've enjoyed where the characters are gay, but there's a ton of plot happening and no stereotyping. I enjoy Marauder era fic quite a bit, so I'm going to include some Sirius/Remus here, but they'll be towards the end of the list since they aren't in your preferred era. :)

linkao3(11951) *In Between Days* is a Book 7 AU where Percy and Oliver Wood run a safe house. Percy/Oliver

linkao3(8274067) *Or the Look or the Words* where Ron and Harry go to the Yule Ball together. Harry/Ron

linkao3(7331278) *Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run* is an AU where Harry doesn't find out about magic until he's 17. Harry/Draco

linkao3(3652266) *And the brave man with a sword* is an AU set in 5th year where the Founders are basically immortal and come back to Hogwarts as students due to the rise of Voldemort and Ministry corruption. Pairings are Godric/Salazar and Helga/Rowena

linkao3(15465966) *The Second String* is an AU that diverges at the beginning of OotP when Harry is kissed by the dementor on Privet Drive and his soul is sent to another place/time. This fic takes a long time for any romance to happen, but it's eventually Harry/Gideon Prewett.

linkao3(5986366) *Face Death in the Hope* where Harry time travels, saves Regulus from the inferi and they go about destroying horcruxes two decades early. Harry/Regulus Black

linkao3(6854605) *The Devil's White Knight* where Harry wakes up in an alternate timeline where he was raised by his parents. Harry/Draco, James/Regulus Black, Lily/Marlene McKinnon

ficao3(13760487) *the dogfather* is an AU where the Dursleys don't keep Harry and he is adopted by muggles. Sirius escapes Azkaban early, and he and Remus keep an eye on Harry. Sirius/Remus

ficao3(20097676) *My Sun Sets to Rise* where Sirius has a preview of other realities after he falls through the Veil. Sirius/Remus

linkao3(11344203) *The Dog You Feed* is about the summer Sirius runs away from home and how he ends up at Lily's Great Aunt's home. It's part of a series, but I think it stands alone, though definitely check out the rest if you like this one. Sirius/Remus

ficao3(12559768) *The Truth in Potions* is an AU and deals with the truth potions Sirius has taken throughout his life. Sirius/Remus

ficao3(18352022) *Calamity's Child*, ok I haven't read this one yet, but I have it in a tab to read. Looks like it's about Teddy Lupin finding out he had an older half sister. Teddy/James Potter II, Sirius/Remus

​

Hope you find some good slash fics to read! :)

  Wherein book 7 is completely ignored because wars don't tend to happen so quickly; Percy Weasley runs a safehouse [because that's as close to administrative work as you can get in a war], and everyone gets a chance to play minor character bingo. Get your cards and markers ready!

  The Founders have spent the last fifty years separated and drifting, but with Voldemort rising, they're headed back to Hogwarts once more. Between a wary Golden Trio, Umbridge, and Voldemort's shadowy plans, there's little time to deal with their own problems, even though Godric knows it's tearing the four of them apart---maybe even irreparably.

** If you don't like Snape, then you'll want to skip most of these. Also, only a few are set during the period of book canon, and several are old enough that they were written before the series ended and are therefore AU. Ordinarily I'd give you a brief synopsis, but it's 2:30 am and my time would be better spent sleeping, so apologies for that. Also, partial disclosure, one of the fics I'm linking is mine.

  A restricted spell goes awry, and Severus Snape is left scrambling to cover his tracks. Meanwhile, Argus Filch turns out to be surprisingly good with small children, the nature of time is proven to be fiddly and anyone's guess, and (at least one) Severus gets a second chance at life.

  Snape swooped around the room like a giant bat, adding ingredients to some cauldrons and stirring others. Then he stopped and tapped his wand against the benchtop impatiently. "Well? What is so important that I must risk a vital brew of Animaserum by having you in the room with it?"His tongue was so dry, he didn't know how he would ever get the words out. "Heartsease, Professor." There, that wasn't so hard. He took a deep breath. Dementors were worse, surely.

  From the private journal of John. H. Watson MD; not intended for publication. Being an account of the strange case of the Fourth Deathly Hallow; in which Dr John H. Watson and Mr Sherlock Holmes save a life, discover the true secret of Professor Moriarty, unravel a time loop or two, encounter a femme fatale, imbibe potions, break into and out of a wizarding mansion, hide in a male brothel, go shopping, track down a magical artefact, almost attend a ritual sacrifice, fail to be Obliviated and totally ignore the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy of 1692, all in the company of a lank-haired, irascible but secretly besotted schoolmaster, a bemused aristocrat and an increasingly perceptive and enamoured young hero.
