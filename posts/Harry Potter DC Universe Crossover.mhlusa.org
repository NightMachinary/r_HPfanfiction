So MoD Harry somehow gets transported to the DCU and Doctor Fate meets him because he's a transdimensional/reality tresspasser.

Harry is confused but recognizes a Horcrux when he sees one as he's been searching for and destroying them for ages. So he defeats the Doctor, and destroys the Helmet.

In the end, he fills the void he created by killing Doctor Fate and becomes the new mystical protector of the DCU.


** Nabu (or is it Naabu?) is a Lord of Order occupying the Helmet of Fate: it's not a horcrux/soul jar type thing.

Although the MoD thing has been done to death, a trope subversion could be pretty cool:

He arrives but instead of moping rolls with the hand dealt to him, and he settles onto DC Earth: he gets a job, rents an apartment or house, and settles into to something he craved: normalcy.

Unfortunately to people who are knowledgeable about, study, or are "in-the-know", it looks like something straight out of Lovecraft's higher deities has just decided to randomly stop by their world and... settle down like a normal mortal, for some reason.

So they, such as the League, Constantine, and the more evil magical elemeents like Ras'a'Ghul, watch him from a distance, feeling disconcerted.

And that's not counting on the deities, like the Olympians or even the New Gods like Apokalypse, freaking out about something so /alien/ just chillaxing in the mortal world.

What'd be more amusing? He starts dating a junior League member, like Kara or Courtney, in their civilian life after meeting them in a normal way (such as asking for their number after they meet a coffee shop, or something), and no-one makes the connection until later on.

I think Terminal Justice had something like this, albeit in a very vague way, and there was a Harry Potter/Buffy crossover where he starts dating Dawn but they all think he's literally Lucifer walking about on Earth, doing random shit.

*** Fallen linkffn(8796596)

It's super hilarious. Especially as Harry is a clueless, bumbling idiot, but everyone treats him as if he's the Devil. It's a stupefyingly side-splitting comedy of errors. It even hints at some point that he might have some connection to the Devil or something on this new world, but that was never explored after the fic was abandoned.

  Harry Awakens from a 68 year coma which he went into after defeating Voldemort. Then he gets summoned... to buffyverse, everyone seems keen to calling him a big bad for some reason.

**** IIRC there was another chapter on the old Caer Azkaban site, but it wasn't ported over to groups.io. The author basically wrote himself into a corner and started to introduce anime elements to try to keep it going, like using adrenaline on someone who's flat-lining and failing miserably. Still, it was utterly hilarious while it lasted (the odd HP couplings aside at the start).

*** It also comes up a bit in linkffn(Invincible). Him becoming MoD freaks out multiple deities or deity level powers.

Seems to be more of a Marvel crossover trope for some reason though.

ETA: fixed link. Linkffn(Invincible by Kathryn518)

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.
