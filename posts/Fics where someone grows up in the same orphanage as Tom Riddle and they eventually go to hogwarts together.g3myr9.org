  "Now I have three heads: one for speech, one for sex, and one for second guessing." - Analicia SoteloHer door clicks open and nearly clips her in the face. It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)

** There's a relatively common trope wherein Harry gets transported back in time and grows up with Tom at Wool's. Here are some examples that I've loved:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]] - One of the earliest and most well known fics that popularized this trope. The author does an excellent job portraying their earlier lives as well as Grindelwald's war heating up on the continent. The fic has been dead for years, but the author recently posted a note about continuing the story at some point later this year. linkffn(5925524)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20997323/chapters/49933835][Ripples Across the Water]] - A very well written story-in-progress that is currently midway through Harry & Tom's second year together at Hogwarts. linkao3(20997323)

#+begin_quote
  BOOK ONE of 'Not a Good Man, but a Great One'. An infant Harry is thrown across time and delivered to 1927. When, at age nine, he meets a young Tom Riddle at Wool's Orphanage, he is immediately pulled into Tom's orbit. As both young boys navigate their entry into the Wizarding World, they soon learn that Harry's past is not as simple as it seems, and that their strange connection runs deeper than they'd imagined. [As of 1/2/2020, this book is fully complete.]
