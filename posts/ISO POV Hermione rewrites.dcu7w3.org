I often think about how different the books would be were they from the perspective of Hermione--or, honestly, anyone who had read /Hogwarts, A History/ and is more inquisitive than Harry is in canon. Is there a great fanfic out there of canon but from from Hermione's perspective?


** Well, it's canon-divergent, but I recommend linkffn(The Arithmancer) and its sequels

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

**** And I am not sure whether particularly “Hogwarts: A History” was on the top of reading list, she was more into math and arithmancy.
