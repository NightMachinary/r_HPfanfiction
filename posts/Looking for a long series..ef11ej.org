I've read a few, years ago. Can't remember any titles though. Just a name and some graphic details from my favorite one. (Harry becomes Henry Bellamy, has been raped and tortured. Excels at wandless magic). It was a pretty long series though. That's all I'm really looking for, a long complete series. Any recommendations would be awesome


** The sacrifice arc (first is Saving Connor)?

Over 2 million words, complete. Well written. I really enjoyed it even though it is both slash and wbwl.

The arthimancer

Hermione is a math Wiz, not a book worm. Complete, and white squirrel is a /superb/ writer.

The cupboard series

A complete series, of 7 fics. I didn't really like it, too much indy!op!Harry.

** It looks like a 10-13 book series written by this author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4229739/Veronice]] according to their profile it was originally under a different pen name. The Henry Bellamy one is book 9.
