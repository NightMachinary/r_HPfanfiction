"[[http://imgur.com/a/D7xdY][No fic will ever top The Harem War for this. Here's the 'relationship scorecard' (yes it's actually a scorecard) as of the last chapter]]

Ages of Harry's /twenty-six/ women range from 9-68. Arthur finds out Molly is potioning him, moves to Harry's kingdom (oh yeah Harry inherits a secret island kingdom filled with both muggle and magical subjects) and Harry gets him 9 new wives ages ranging from 19-27 for this 48 year old man (btw the subjects love him for this because the wives were stolen by Dumbledore and sold as concubines in Britain, on a side note this means they're all really experienced and excellent in bed).

His godmother, babysitter, godfathers wife and childhood concubine (yes, Sirius' father bought him a childhood concubine) are all involved.

You need to at least read to about chapter 10 when he finds out he has to bang McG "who has a surprisingly stunning body". It's just awful. The ridiculous kingdom plot doesn't really get going for a while either, there's just chapter after chapter of Harry banging more people then eventually becoming king of this island, bringing everyone loyal to him over and getting them a bunch of wives. My favourite bit is when he finds out Dumbledore is selling all the muggleborns as concubines so he buys them all and spreads them out amongst his allies. No one has an issue with this. Like they go along with the "you have to cum in my mouth and vagina to bond me" thing and it's so good they willingly stay bound to everyone. Everyone. Even Arthur. They're just so good in bed. The author has actually written a few fics that are decent but this is designed for a horny 13 year old who just wants something to wank over.

If it had ever plateaued I probably would have quit but it just kept going and getting more and more ridiculous. Like how can you top Harry getting 24 wives and his own kingdom you'd think? Well he's 5th in line to the British Throne and his huge amounts of wife magic goodness cause Narcissa Malfoy to become a member of his coven. Wookiee you brought that up out of the blue you might say? Nope, that's how it happens in the fic too. He just has a coven now and Narcissa tells him that it's a thing before they, of course, bang to make it official. You might think the airforce makes it hard to cause a realistic villain once Dumbledore and Voldemort are weakened (never neutralised though because this needed to be longer)? No because Remus shows up and confesses that Sirius let him borrow Tonks (Harry's second wife, one of 3 of Sirius former concubines that Harry inherits) for sex because he's a werewolf. Scary stuff, how do they resolve it? McG (Bound to the Potter family to serve them sexually, James included) manages to calm everyone down by explaining shit happens and he was at least a kind rapist, Tonks reveals her love of anal to distract Harry and Remus becomes the Mayor of Harry's Kingdoms Capital City and get's a dozen wives who are cool with the werewolf thing (don't worry, Harry cures it later by locking him in a time slowing room so he experiences a month a day and therefore goes more than a month without transforming so his body just quits being a werewolf and becomes a wolf animagus instead).

I've read the entire thing. The graphic sex actually stops somewhere after the time-turner assisted, birthday gang-bang. Then the author basically makes Harry grind his forces until they're all super-powerful and are qualified jet pilots for some reason (their various training is actually in the scorecard).

This has nearly 750,000 words and almost 4.5K reviews. "


** linkffn(The Harem War) for the curious and yes it really is that ridiculous. I'm not even doing it justice there, I didn't even mention the Potter-Black war room or the distinction between wife, consort and concubine or the pregnancy announcements or the collars they wear (Minnie (yes Minnie) likes hers even as a cat!) or that Sirius used to bang his concubines as Padfoot.

I'd also just like to clarify that this is in no way a crack!fic. It is 100% serious and was written in 2010, long after this should be acceptable. The author does have some other pretty decent fics, this one just seems to have got away from him.

** It isn't even good wank material. It's just psycho-sexual power fantasy, taken to the nth degree.

Real porn has physical presence and emotional power. In Haram War, Harry just floats from one absurd situation to another, as volitionless as the women he inexplicably and awkwardly beds.

Also, "grind his forces". Heh.

** I nope'd out after the author had Harry discussing the purpose of Walden McNair's job as executioner for the Ministry. They came to the conclusion that his job was not to execute dangerous animals but rather unwanted muggleborn concubines. It was then never mentioned again. WTF!! The systemic rape and slavery is bad enough but the characters have more issue with that then murder.

** One major problem is that no one seems to say "Ok... let's find out how to break this slave enchantment that forces us to keep the kidnapping victims we saved as concubines." They use Magic to improve muggle gear, and vice versa, but that stuff can't be touched? They don't even try to find a way to free the witches? That's a major plot hole.

** It truly takes first place when it comes to ridiculous. Its also a good candidate to take first place in the categories "chauvinistic", "(borderline) pedophilia", "rape apologetic".

I'd even add some "pro-slavery" there just for good measure, since they never even try to find ways to break the concubine bond (or however that shit was named).

This fic is the epitome of the dark side of fanfiction. I don't know what the fuck the author was thinking while writing this, but I'm sure it would be disturbing to know.

** Had some good ideas not related to the actual harem part. Mainly the automated potion making the twins took care of or the enchanted firearms that pulled ammo from another area. Mainly the muggle technology being used to improve the magical world or magic being used to improve muggle stuff. Rest of it is ridiculous. I feel the reason it hasn't been updated in over 4 years is because theres no where else to go with it besides making it a crossover. It's extremely long and a mess at this point. Basically if there has to be a scorecard for relationships at the end of every chapter, then it has gone too far. Some of the chapters are just stuff you can skip because they don't really impact the rest of the story enough. First time I read a good bit I was drunk. When it got weird I figured I was taking stuff the wrong way because of the alcohol. Read it sober and wished I was drunk because it seemed better that way.
