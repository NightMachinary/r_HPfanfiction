NewfoundHope is basically where Harry gets turned into his animagus form (a Newfoundland) and just lives his life as a dog. And he's fine with it. He doesn't WANT to turn back because life's better as a dog. No boy who lived, no Voldemort. Nothing. All seven years. He even gets noticed for having magic but they don't think he's an animagus, just a smart dog (his “owner” was a werewolf) and it's really good.

Are there any other fics where Harry just decides to live his life as his animagus form WITHOUT ever being forced back or found out early on?

I see a lot of fics where it starts off as Harry being in his animagus form but it almost always forces the narrative to make him have to stop using it.

Why can't we have Harry going to Hogwarts as say, Lupins dog. No one has to randomly learn he's an animagus, especially if he never changes back or can't (I mean Peter was a rat for 10 years so obviously it's possible)

I'd link NewfoundHope but idk how to get the bot to do its thing.

  Since Ron got a new owl, it's only fair that Ginny gets her own pet. She adopts a big black dog.

** Hmmm.. there's one I'm thinking of, but it's unfinished, and I think he is going to eventually return to his human form, if he is able to. I don't remember the name, I'd have to look for it.

  Voldemort smiled. It was a cold, creeping thing. Truly human despite it being on a serpentine face.And it was then Harry could see the real Lord Voldemort. Not the madman throwing curses around indiscriminately, but the man who had lured legions of purebloods to his cause, Tom Riddle who had blinded all his teachers bar one.It was calculating. The long-game personified.--Harry would never have guessed that his animagus would have been a snake. Nor the trouble it would bring when Voldemort found out. After all, who needs to kill an enemy when you can keep them?
