So, I'm after something a bit like Bungle In The Jungle or the Fantastic beasts movies. As in, what I'm after is a tale that is set outside of the happenings of the canon, Hogwarts, adventures. That isn't to say it can't also follow Hogwarts/canon; I'm easy - I just want to read something new, with a completely new plot, & ideally exploring a bit more of the magical world outside of the castle.

Bonus internet cookies for Dungeon Delving, Adventure, escapades, etc. Maybe the Aurors & Magical Law Enforcement Patrol are dealing with a crime wave; maybe its ministry politics; maybe its goblins & cursebreakers; or dragon-tamers; maybe it's a backstory or ending-story for a canon character, or maybe it's just someone off exploring; or just trying to live their life in a time of upheaval like any of the wizarding wars.

Specifics:

>100k; any Rating; any pairing; NSFW is fine; any timeperiod; reasonably well written; doesn't need to be complete or still being updated so long as it's a good length. This is a trope, fanon & bashing friendly zone, I have and will read anything & everything.


** The Red Witch and the Nightmare Queen linkffn(13098062) is a really solid fic with a complete OC cast. Basic premise is the main character released a thousand + year old witch and it wont stop coming after her. She's got to scramble to figure out how to stay alive and kill it.

Really creative uses of magic especially blood magic. There's definitely a bit of Hogwarts involvement though, but its all set a while after canon

  The Cabal decried Pyrrha's course as doomed, so she went on alone. Upon an unnatural isle she found the haunting witch she sought to end, let free the unraveling bonds, and lost control. Escape was hardly the word for what followed when so little remained.

** If you don't mind almost no connection to canon at all, linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) is a completely original story set in a non-canon version of Wizarding America. It has one of the most developed worlds, interesting characters (the protagonist is /extremely/ polarizing) and best overall writing of any fic I've read. As I said though, it's polarizing. Not for everyone.

I also really like Slide's Stygian trilogy (linkffn(Ignite by Slide)) which is next gen, but after staying at Hogwarts for the first book basically breaks out into a worldwide wizarding war. It's also brilliantly written and has a bit more of a romantic aspect to it. This ticks pretty much all the categories in your second paragraph.

More recently there is linkffn(the imposter complex) which is similar to the Stygian trilogy but a bit more unreal, very much in the realm of jbern.

** I can recommend linkffn(resonance by GreenGecko) and it's sequels though last isn't finished. Series are really long and been written before half blood prince but this is the story that actually got me addicted to hp fanfiction over 10 years ago. The first part is still during school years but afterwards it is one of the most realistic magical life fics I've ever read. Life and school, adoption and family, magical house in nonmagical neighbourhood, extended relatives, travelling, training, history, new talents, new friends, bits of different cultures - it's just amazing in a very down to earth way and smoothly incorporated.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...
