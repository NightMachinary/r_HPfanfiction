There's a fic I read years ago which I think is set in fourth year where Harry and Hermione give the elves in the castle gallons etc when they help them with stuff and two elves do a job for them and so used to being paid by the couple, are embarrassed when Hermione has nothing to give them expect a ribbon that they halve tie around their wrists. (They're excites by the ribbons) They might be in the room of requirement at the time. There was also something about the elves grandfather boasting about his granddaughters at a later date (I think).

If anyone can help me find it that would be amazing, I've looked up everything I can think of and can't find it anywhere.
