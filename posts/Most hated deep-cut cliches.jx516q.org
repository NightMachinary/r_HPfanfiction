We all know the classics: “It's for the greater good”, “My god you said hello to a Goblin, no one ever shows them that kind of respect”, “the bushy haired missile launched at him”, “I'm Harry Potter-Black, Lord Potter, Lord Black, Lord Gryffindor, Lord Slytherin, King of the Vandals, Keeper of the keys”, and so on, and so on, ad nauseam.

But I've read so much fan fiction that there are now “B” level cliches that are driving me insane. Such as...

1. The overly long description of purchasing and/or receiving Christmas presents - Hermione likes obscure books, Ron likes sweets, Neville likes plants. We get it. This is not ground breaking information. Move on.

2. Showing someone from the wizarding world “Star Wars” - “Oh Merlin, how did those muggles get into space?? Don't they know that wizards believe that stars are made of centaur tears?? What, it's not real? How are muggles so advanced? My pure blood ways have kept me blind to muggle technology! Next you'll tell me they have something better than the horse and buggy!

(Quick side note: I recently read a fic that title escapes me where Harry showed some people “Sleeping with the Enemy” as their first movie. I legitimately laughed out loud in a good way)

1. Quick jaunts into Shakespearean literature - “Would the good lady care to dance with mine self?” “Of course good sir, let me doth my dancing apparel whilst finishing this delightful drink”. Gag.

What are some others I've missed?


** Harry having an all-caps temper tantrum every other chapter, where he complains about how shit his life is, and then proceeds to insult everyone in the room, and then leaves without any repercussions.

This one may be a tad controversial, but I'm not really a fan of Fred and George in most fanfics. I swear in 99% of the fanfics I've read they are exactly the same person, with no character traits to separate them. I also really don't like them finishing each other's sentences for every single conversation.

Wizengamot factions that literally have "light" or "dark" in their names. Harry Potter isn't some fucking spaghetti western film.

I really hate animal based nicknames. When the Hogwarts head of houses call the students "my snakes/lions/eagles/badgers". Don't even get me started on Sirius and Remus calling Harry "cub". I'm pretty sure I've literally cringed when reading some of them.

Them finishing each other's sentences is not only infuriating to read, its also not how it was done in the books, there Fred would say something, finish saying it, and then George would say something that was related, but that wouldn't need them to be telepathically linked to say. There it came across as two people with very similar trains of thought bringing up something they've probably discussed beforehand, in fanfics it comes across as two people who are sharing a hive mind.

Also fanfic twin speak completely breaks up the flow of the story. I dont know about others, but when I read dialogue, theres usually a half second or so gap between two characters speaking, so having the twins swap back and forth every couple of words makes their dialogue infuriating. As much I dislike the idea of them sharing a hive mind and not being similar but ultimately separate people, changing the way its written would do wonders for it. So instead of...

"Harry, we heard..." said Fred.

"...you need our assistance!' Continued George.

You could instead have.

"Harry, we heard you need our assistance!" Said Fred, followed quickly by George.

It doesn't ruin the flow of the story by breaking up their dialogue, but sticks to the idea of them sharing a hive mind, which again, I am not a fan of.

*** Read a story long ago that had a mild explanation for the faction thing; something about a person's choice in magic uses causing their auras to become certain colours. Darker variants of colours were those that are more power focused, whereas lighter colours were more finesse/skill based.

The factions were named after Dumbledore and Voldemort (who was more akin to an evil Dumbledore rather than an insane terrorist). A lot of Voldemort's charisma came from him having a dark green, almost black aura..

The story was really interesting, though the author deleted it for a "rewrite" almost 10 years ago, so doubt it'll ever be posted again.

**** Bonus points if the MC matches zero wands in Ollivander's shop, so they get one 'custom made'. Which usually consists of putting the MC in front of a bunch of blocks of wood and asking them which one 'feels right'. And then repeating the process with a bunch of cores, usually including some that Ollivander doesn't work with. And then Ollivander will proceed to make the wand and it will match /perfectly/.

Anyway, more bonus points if this isn't actually done in Ollivander's but in some shop in Nocturne, almost always with the 'no trace' benefit.

Along similar lines, unless Harry having a custom wand is somehow plot important (it usually isn't), there's no need for him to have a super special and unique core of basilisk venom or erumpent horn or whatever.

Why would they include the erumpent horn as a possible wand core when canonically, it's an extremely volatile potion ingredient that almost always explodes when mixed with magic and is only used in very specific potions, whilst being handled carefully and mixed delicately with other ingredients that neutralize its explosive nature?

"Hello, /sister/," Harry announced, jutting his chin up superciliously, trying to ignore how ridiculous he felt. He attempted to quietly slam his hands on the table, but failing and drawing snorts from the other students.

"Hello, /brother/," Hermione replied after a long moment, making eye contact and silently snapping her book shut /(Harry still didn't know how she did that)/.

The two stared at each other for a moment, the other students' snickers in the background, until Hermione cracked with the slightest snort and a tiny smile. The two burst out into giggles, Harry coughing from the built-up pressure of holding in a laugh.

Singing

I haven't seen one of these for a while so maybe that sort of thing is declining, but it was in a lot of romance fics, like for Hermione/Malfoy

Typically would be at a bar or at Hogwarts. Either for karaoke or a charity event or something. If it's for Hermione/Malfoy, then she would get up to sing and Malfoy would suddenly realize his feelings for her or they would do a duet and kiss or something

In their first Transfiguration class, only Hermione managed to make her match pointy and silver, and she didn't manage to make it a needle. Wingardium Leviosa wasn't taught until Halloween, meaning it required 2 months of background teaching before Professor Flitwick deemed them ready to try the spell. I can only imagine that curses, especially curses that can kill, are not taught and would be extremely difficult to learn on one's own. Sure, basic spells like the Leg-Locker or Everte Statum could have lethal consequences if misused, but that would require malice aforethought that I don't think a 11 year old or 12 year old could muster (other than, of course, Tom Riddle).

**** Absolutely untrue. That's the impression given in CoS when they seem to think Harry used the hover charm when it was Dobby, but the entire first half of DH and the information about Harry's 17th birthday makes it quite clear that the Trace is on the individual wizard - and when they don't know about the taboo they hypothesised that the ministry had kept the Trace on Harry, specifically, so as to be able to track him down.

Additionally, in OotP, Tonks uses a cleaning charm on Hedwig's cage while at Privet Drive, and the ministry doesn't pick it up - the trace must only be on Harry, if it was on location not individual they'd have got a notification that magic was coming out of Harry Potter's home. In HBP, Dumbledore uses magic at Privet Drive. No one from the Ministry comes to check. And again, if it was on location alone, you think they'd have gone to investigate why magic was being used at a home with only one wizard, underage, listed as living there.

In GoF, Arthur uses magic at Privet Drive, although "off screen", when he fixed Dudley's tongue with a shrinking charm. No investigation from the Ministry. And, ok, maybe in that one instance the Ministry knew Arthur was there, as he had asked for permission to temporarily put a floo connection to Harry's house. But in OotP, the ministry absolutely weren't advised that Tonks and co were going to pick Harry up so would have had no foreknowledge that an adult wizard would be there, ditto with Dumbledore in HBP. No way did Albus MF Dumbledore advise the Ministry of his movements.

It's only the situation with Dobby that gives the impression that it's just magic they can determine, not magic user, and I don't think JKR had thought through the full implications of the Trace at that stage, as it contradicts latter information. Either that or Dobby deliberately made it look like Harry's magic - we know that house elves are really quite powerful, and we also know that his whole plan was to get Harry into trouble.

****** Yeah that's my point. I think all canon evidence, other than the Dobby incident, points to the fact that the trace is on the individual not the vicinity. In fact, I'm sure there's something in DH that confirms that- when they're found in the coffee shop (and they don't know about the Taboo), Harry and Hermione briefly hypothesise that the Ministry have deliberately left the trace on him and when he (just Harry, not the other two) did a spell it drew their attention.

I've always assumed the trace is on the individual, not the "vicinity of the wizard" and the only reason Harry gets in trouble in CoS is that Dobby uses some sort of house elf magic (which we know works in ways wizards don't understand) to make it look like it was him. Otherwise, how can Tonks clean Hedwig's cage and not set it off? How can Dumbledore send magical glasses of whisky at the Dursleys heads?! In fact, how can he even apparate off with Harry when both OotP and DH seem to imply that apparation will set off the trace?

They deliberately circumvented the Trace, for all the good it did them. The magic that was performed in the vicinity of Harry would've been enough to tell the Ministry that a battle was going on, and the obvious conclusion to come to is Death Eaters, whether those deducing such are on the side of the Death Eaters or not.

Of course, it's entirely possible Dumbledore "mentioned" that he was going to collect Harry from the Dursleys in HBP, and such an occurrence in OotP would be (technically) plausible, as they wouldn't have to say anything other than "someone magical is picking him up", which wouldn't tell them anything about /where/ they were taking him, although they would need a plausible cover story for /who/, exactly, was picking him up.

There is also the possibility that the small amount of magic Tonks was able to use to partially clean Hedwig's cage was not enough to alert the Ministry. /Lumos/ seems not to count, at any rate, so a half-hearted /Scourgify/ is probably not that "alert-worthy" either. But I really don't think Tonks' /"Pack!"/ spell would go unnoticed.

** I'm losing my mind to the pointless angst regarding subjective Light v. Dark.

Some authors take chapters and chapters to explain how Harry has cracked the code, and there is no such thing as objective Light or Dark magic. But their philosophizing is not especially compelling, and it comes to nothing in the story. Usually, it's just an excuse for Harry to do blood magic, which is lumped in with dark magic because the ministry. So nobody, not even the badguys, are doing blood magic now. But Harry can, if he wants.

I understand. You want certain characters to have certain advantages or mysterious magic. You want to justify your characters' actions, unlike JKR who would just throw another magical item at them. But you know what? Having a DADA teacher who can see through invisibility and behind walls is a cool idea for a character in a story. You don't need 10k words describing how he lost his eye and accidentally cursed his eye socket with a glass eye but the curse intertwined with Trelawney's patronus magic so that Moody could use scrying devices as eye replacements. Because that subplot is not that cool and lends nothing to the story.

** - Nicknames; I mean it's alright for characters to have nicknames, but the ones I see in fics are absolutely terrible: cub, pup, prongslet, Remi, Siri, Rubby, Minnie (I'm cringing as I write this).
- Changing the names of characters to make them sound more regal /(cough - Hadrian - cough)/.
- shopping trips, wand holsters, magic trunks and other shit MC buys on his trip to Diagon Alley.
- Sirius being a womanizer or joking all the time.
- Wizards identifying themselves as Dark, Light or Grey. I doubt Lucius Malfoy thinks he's a Dark Wizard or that his family is a family of Dark Wizards. Also, why the word always starts with a capital letter, is it a title or something?
- The Marauders being all about pranks and nothing else. The Weasley twins finishing each other's sentences every time they speak.
- Lord Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Peverell-Black-Malfoy-Merlin.

*** Tbh, I don't mind if some characters are given more regal names if it fits with the setting or changes made, and the original name still ties back in.

I've read some fics where the change from Harry to Hadrian /(or Harrison, but this one less so)/ really nailed it, especially in fics more focused on political world-building. I loved it and have come to appreciate that trope when it's well-done.

I've also read some fics were that change was just really effing unnecessary. It doesn't contribute to the plot, doesn't add anything to the character itself, just overall pointless.

There's a time and place for that trope in fics. In a world where most wizards and witches tend to have exotic, old, or elaborate names, "Harry" just sounds really underwhelming. A name change from Hadrian to Harry doesn't necessarily have to change the character, which is what a lot of people assume has to happen.

​

I do agree on the nickname front tho. Some names aren't meant to be shortened (goddammit, why does Rubby exist), and some names are only meant to be shortened as a joke/to piss people off (Minnie).

** For me, there are three things that really rustle my jimmies.

1) Harry being written as a powerful politician while having zero skill in it - and it being /extremely/ obvious. I have no qualms with political fics overall, but they tend to go "Harry sue, Harry win because he's Harry" - even in cases where he shouldn't win.

2) "Gray" Harry. Especially since the cliche tends to be anything but neutral, with a lot of views that are just plain fucked up for a character that's supposed to be the good guy, "but he's a good guy so it's okay". Like you just can't claim centrism while having strong views. It makes you look like a moron.

3) Ice Queen Daphne Greengrass. Mostly because she's literally the same character every time she appears. I like having a non-canon character as Harry's love interest. Hell, some of the best fics I've read were Haphne. But fucking hell, this particular cliche usually has the exact same lines in every fic, making her more boring then canon Ginny.

This is what's wrong with it. The bad guys don't consider themselves Dark except perhaps when they enjoy the fear they cause in the good guys. They certainly do not worship darkness. So, why would the good guys place "Light" on a pedestal? Unless "Light" is some kind of a deity (which it is not in Harry Potter), that is the good guys defining themselves by their opposition to the caricature they have made of their enemies. That is outrageous. Good guys should define themselves by virtues like righteousness, justice, altruism etc., not "Light" that doesn't mean anything.

In Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality Harry uses "Light" as the opposite of Dark, but in the context of the story it makes sense. He is a child who is familiar with fantasy and sci-fi literature and games, but even he doesn't use it very seriously. If I encounter a story where Dumbledore makes a serious statement for the "Light," I usually stop reading in disgust.

Except that's completely wrong. Terms like "dark lord," "dark wizard," "dark magic," and "dark arts" are frequently used in canon by both sides. And if one side self-identifies as "dark," it makes sense for the other side to identify as "light," even if canon doesn't use the term.

As evidence:

Lucius:

#+begin_quote
  “You have told me this at least a dozen times already,” said Mr. Malfoy, with a quelling look at his son. “And I would remind you that it is not --- prudent --- to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear --- ah, Mr. Borgin.”
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  “Oh, you don't know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,” said Malfoy softly. “He has a great weakness for heroics; the Dark Lord understands this about him. Now give me the prophecy, Potter.”
#+end_quote

Snape:

#+begin_quote
  “The Dark Arts,” said Snape, “are many, varied, ever- changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.”

  Harry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  “You are lazy and sloppy, Potter, it is small wonder that the Dark Lord --- ”

  “Can you tell me something, sir?” said Harry, firing up again. “Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord, I've only ever heard Death Eaters call him that --- ”
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  But Snape ignored this. “Apparently I underestimated you, Potter,” he said quietly. “Who would have thought you knew such Dark Magic? Who taught you that spell?”
#+end_quote

Bellatrix:

#+begin_quote
  “Get it himself?” shrieked Bellatrix on a cackle of mad laughter. “The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so sweetly ignoring his return? The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin?”
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  “That was not my fault!” said Bellatrix, flushing. “The Dark Lord has, in the past, entrusted me with his most precious --- if Lucius hadn't --- ”
#+end_quote

(And the rest of that conversation between Bellatrix, Snape, and Narcissa has all three of them constantly calling Voldemort "the Dark Lord." And Bellatrix in particular calls him that every time she appears.)

Voldemort:

#+begin_quote
  “So ends the famous Harry Potter,” said Riddle's distant voice. “Alone in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged."
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote

**** That's why I mentioned that "except perhaps when they enjoy the fear they cause in the good guys." "The Dark Arts" seems to be a common figure of speech in the wizarding world, and "the Dark Lord" a common title. Certainly Voldemort doesn't mind being called "Dark" and so he doesn't demand people to call him something else. Probably he even liked the title when he was reading history as a young megalomaniacal child and wanted to follow on the footsteps of people who were commonly considered "Dark Lords." However, I think no "Dark Lord" would choose that as his title if it was not an established part of the culture they live in. It's not about the literal meaning of "Dark" but the connotation attached by centuries of non-literal usage.

#+begin_quote

Only if the non-dark side's identity is based purely on their opposition to the dark side. That is just what the good guys are not in Harry Potter.

They didn't want to defeat their enemies because they simple hated them.

Except it kind of is. The Order of the Phoenix was created specifically to fight against Voldemort and the Death Eaters, the self-proclaimed dark side. Regardless of their actual motivations, their goal was to fight the dark side. The could easily have named themselves "The Order of the Light" or something instead, and it would have worked and fit just as well. They aren't the cliché fantasy paladins who are determined to stamp out any trace of evil, but they are the reasonable fantasy paladins who stand for what is good and want to protect the innocent from evils that are trying to harm them.

It even makes sense from an in-universe marketing perspective. If the other side is identifying themselves as dark, why wouldn't you try to identify yourselves as light? It invokes ideas of goodness, righteousness, safety, and the like. And that sort of imagery will help to draw people to your side because it reinforces the idea that you are the good guys.

This is why I don't mind when the word "Dark" is used in fanfiction. My issue is with "Light" used as its counterpart. It's not based on canon, but probably on video games for children where the "Dark side" needs to have an easily understandable opposition. I admit it works in a video game context because there it is impossible to explain thoroughly the philosophy of the good guys and it has to be kept simple. Literature has higher standards.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I don't agree. The Order was created only after the "Dark side" started a violent revolution, and it apparently was disbanded immediately after Voldemort disappeared. Several known Death Eaters were allowed to go unpunished because they claimed to have been under the Imperius. Clearly restoring the non-violent ways was the only thing that mattered to Dumbledore. The "Dark siders" were free to advocate their policies as long as they were not violent. So, the Order's goal was not to fight, but to stop fighting by using the least required amount of counter-violence.

#+begin_quote
  If the other side is identifying themselves as dark, why wouldn't you try to identify yourselves as light? It invokes ideas of goodness, righteousness, safety, and the like.
#+end_quote

Does it really? I don't think light is inherently good. It's just a physical phenomenom. It makes life possible, sure, but all its vile and violent sides too. Light represents all those good virtues only if culture associates them with it. In Harry Potter canon it doesn't, because no one uses "Light" as the opposite of "Dark." When fanfiction writers bring "Light" to their stories, I'll have to ask why. The good guys have totally valid virtues about peace and justice. Why should they be replaced with "Light" that apparently means the same thing but makes it sound like the good guys define themselves by their enemies, not their virtues?

It is also important that the Order was a supporter of the status quo, and status quo doesn't need slogans like "Light" to justify itself. What if after Voldemort there came the next revolution led by a "Blue Lord?" Would the Order immediately abandon "Light" and declare "Yellow" as their "side?" The point of this thought experiment is that you should never define yourself by your enemies, because if your enemies change, you'll have to change accordingly. That doesn't suit the advocates of the status quo.

  This is why I don't mind when the word "Dark" is used in fanfiction. My issue is with "Light" used as its counterpart. It's not based on canon, but probably on video games for children where the "Dark side" needs to have an easily understandable opposition. I admit it works in a video game context because there it is impossible to explain thoroughly the philosophy of the good guys and it has to be kept simple. Literature has higher standards.
#+end_quote

First of all, I imagine that Star Wars is probably the main source of the dark side/light side idea for most people these days. But I'm pretty sure that very similar ideas, if not the phrases themselves, have been around in philosophy and religion for centuries.

Your only actual argument here is "'Light' is not based on canon." And that's true, and I don't think anyone is seriously arguing that anyone in canon is called "light." But that doesn't mean that it's not still a perfectly valid term to use. It's just like how the word "ward" is never used in canon to describe a protective enchantment, but the concept is firmly established in canon, so it is reasonable for a fic to use that term.

#+begin_quote
  I don't agree. The Order was created only after the "Dark side" started a violent revolution, and it apparently was disbanded immediately after Voldemort disappeared. Several known Death Eaters were allowed to go unpunished because they claimed to have been under the Imperius. Clearly restoring the non-violent ways was the only thing that mattered to Dumbledore. The "Dark siders" were free to advocate their policies as long as they were not violent. So, the Order's goal was not to fight, but to stop fighting by using the least required amount of counter-violence.
#+end_quote

I would argue that they disbanded after Voldemort disappeared because they didn't need to coordinate their secret war plans and such. Individual members clearly continued to push for legal reforms and other changes to progress the "light side" politically (like Arthur's muggle protection act), but they didn't continue to fight violently because they are not violent revolutionaries. They were trying to make changes legally.

#+begin_quote
  Does it really? I don't think light is inherently good. It's just a physical phenomenom. It makes life possible, sure, but all its vile and violent sides too. Light represents all those good virtues only if culture associates them with it. In Harry Potter canon it doesn't, because no one uses "Light" as the opposite of "Dark." When fanfiction writers bring "Light" to their stories, I'll have to ask why. The good guys have totally valid virtues about peace and justice. Why should they be replaced with "Light" that apparently means the same thing but makes it sound like the good guys define themselves by their enemies, not their virtues?
#+end_quote

Human culture as associate "light" with "good" and "dark" with "bad" for thousands of years. It might not be explicitly spelled out in canon, but that's like saying that wizards don't poop because we never see them poop. And the fact that they explicitly use "dark" to refer to bad things makes it frankly ridiculous to think that there wouldn't also be some connection between "light" and "good." The fact that the patronus is probably the one explicitly purely good thing in the books and is also comprised of light is a strong piece of circumstantial evidence.

#+begin_quote
  It is also important that the Order was a supporter of the status quo, and status quo doesn't need slogans like "Light" to justify itself. What if after Voldemort there came the next revolution led by a "Blue Lord?" Would the Order immediately abandon "Light" and declare "Yellow" as their "side?" The point of this thought experiment is that you should never define yourself by your enemies, because if your enemies change, you'll have to change accordingly. That doesn't suit the advocates of the status quo.
#+end_quote

No, but the difference is that "dark" is a firmly established concept human and wizarding culture, just like "light" is. And even without a dark side, light does still have positive connotations, so it still makes sense to use as a name. And I think that is the crux of the argument. You see "light" as just meaning "not dark." And I admit that from that point of view, it doesn't make sense as a term to use. But everyone else attaches virtues like righteousness, virtue, safety, and wisdom to light, because that's what humans have been doing for millennia. And with that perspective, it makes sense for a group of people to want to fashion themselves as the light side.

*** Gotta be honest, my favorite usages of light/dark/grey/whatever are when it's not used as euphemisms for good and evil (I have so many problems with that, particularly because it gives me flashbacks to older video games that give you pretty much two choices, good or bad) but is an actual magical thing, either magical affinity, or as a euphemism for political leanings (e.g. Dark being Traditionalists, Light being Liberal/Progressives, and Grey being Neutrals)

**** I gotta agree with you. While it might make head-canonical sense based on canon, it's kinda cringe-worthy to use Dark and Light to describe the two sides unless it's deeper than surface-level goals and opposition. If the story makes the two sides more political or magical affinity-oriented, it becomes so much better. Gray/Neutral isn't canon in any sense, but it adds a layer of depth and realism when used correctly.

***** Pretty much, and even better when both sides have valid view points, because honestly it's rare for anyone to be pure good, or pure evil. Sure it happens, but it's far more likely for everyone to be morally grey and have opposing viewpoints in politics, or to have a magical affinity.

** Some female character(usually Hermione) gets kidnapped by Death Eaters and instead of killing her they brainwash her and turn her double agent. This would not be bad on itself since it can be a good setting for a tragedy where she is used to weaken the good guys from inside and then discarded and killed after her usefulness ends.

However most fics have Draco or even Voldemort fall in love with her(which goes against everything Voldemort stands for) and then they make her the leader of Death Eaters or something for some reason. Then she turns out to be Voldemorts long lost sister and they "happily live ever after".

Of course lets not forget to whitewash the death eaters and make them the good guys and give moonlogic explanations for why muggleborns are all bad and purebloods are all good and how Dumbledore uses virgin sacrifices to keep himself immortal etc...

However, in canon, things were not that convenient.

So Snape can take that line and shove it up his backside and stop talking shit about things he does not understand.

#+end_quote

Hp has a ton of thematic logic that takes precedence over in-story-plot logic. The Dumbledore thing is a perfect example of this. We learn in ps that Harry's mom's sacrifice (selfless, based on love) is the one thing tom riddle can't understand, and that's the true cause of his power/resilience against the dark lord.

The series is both (a) a ring cycle where the two halves (1/2/3;5/6/7) run parallel to each other, and (b) a piece of alchemical literature where the male and female halves of the central protagonist are united. HP makes the thematic argument --- from the first book, btw --- that harry was being groomed to follow in his mother's footsteps, not because of Dumbledore, but because of the unification of opposites: sacrifice/love (feminine) w/ power/immortality (masculine).

It's never made sense to me how fanon simultaneously holds that Lily's sacrifice was good and righteous and Harry's sacrifice was wrong as they were both (1) a means to the same end, and (2) /catalyzed by exactly the same person/. The qualms about Dumbledore, at least from fanon-perspective, then, seems to be more about the HP series's stance on the ethics of personal sacrifice than the moral choices of the man himself.

That's a /vastly/ different argument than saying Dumbledore is evil.
