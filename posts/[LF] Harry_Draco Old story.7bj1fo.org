Looking for a story that is Harry/Draco, started with them separate and opens with Ginny taking Polyjuice to look like Draco. Eventually Harry leaves Ginny, he and Draco reunite, Ginny and Molly get revenge involving the Lestrange Brother, Good Lucius and Narcissa. Think it was Romance with either Drama or Angst. I can't completely remember.
