Hi! Like a year ago I started reading this drarry fix on ao3 but I never finished it due to exams coming up. When I wanted to continue it it was unfortunately not saved on my account and I still haven't been able to find it.

It mainly follows Draco's pov and starts out with Ron (maybe head auror?) driving him to Harry's place, which is a surprise because Harry has been off the radar for months (or years?). He's working as a mechanic, a muggle one, and hides Draco at his place for some reason I can't remember. He might have infiltrated some place? I also believe Harry had a kind of power boost because of a huge plot point with a group both Draco and Harry have been tracking, but at different points in time (Harry was an auror before he retired due to his sudden power surge). Also I think Harry and Draco had to try to free Hermione and Ron from Azkaban? My memory is kinda fuzzy about that part...

Anyways, I'm forever thankful if you can help me with finding this fic because not knowing the end has been bothering me for months now. Thank you!


** Hi. You also try asking on [[/r/drarry][r/drarry]]. Or even [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]], they have a pretty big drarry following over there.
