Saw a fanart on tumblr where Harry takes Hagrid shopping at Diagon Alley to return the favor, with a picture of Hagrid sitting in a class of full of firsties, was wondering if there was a fic like that.

** I haven't. In one of my stories he has a p-wand---Preparatory Wave-And-kNow-Device, a wand designed to teach movements and words. I think I'll add this idea if Hagrid survives the war.

*** Heh, reminds me a bit of Wizards of Waverly Place, where wands are more fashion statement than spell-casting device.

** Yes I have! There was a link to it on here actually - just a short tumblr one-shot iirc. I'm sorry I didn't save it but I think it had a line like "you're a wizard hagrid."
