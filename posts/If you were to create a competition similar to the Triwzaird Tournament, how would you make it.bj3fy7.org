I for one would make it bigger, on a global school where multiple schools could participate rather than just 3. More tasks and competitions would be included, and I'd make them more exciting. If the crowd can't possibly observe from where they are I'd provide them with a way to. For people not picked I'd also add additional side tasks where they could participate. You can also as a main champion pick your partners if a task required teamwork of you.

How would you go around making a tournament?

** A dueling tournament. No killing but maiming is allowed (healing magic can heal splinches and regrow bones, I think they can heal such injuries). Its a thing every four years and a way for schools to show-off their students.

The format can be one-on-one or group fights. The dueling arena is randomly configured to mimic a habitat. Think of Pok√©mon gyms but the theme changes for every fight. It tests the adaptability of contestants and their creativity in using their environment.
