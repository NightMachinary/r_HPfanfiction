** Dear Lord, Malfoy and his cronies would have tortured Luna if she were in Slytherin.

And she would have driven them absolutely crazy...

**** I suspect the bullying would have been a lot worse.

Say what you will of the Ravenclaws hiding her things, it doesn't appear that they ever hurt Luna physically or jinxed her in canon.

And given that Luna would have been outnumbered, it would have been easy for them to do so.

That said, a Slytherin!Luna would be interesting if she's still someone Ginny has a soft spot for.

And imagine what would happen if Luna wore her lion hat during Gryffindor-Slytherin Quidditch matches.

***** I disagree.\\
I would like to bring to your attention 2 things.

First, the Slytherin class in her year would not be overly smart, thus she would not have to deal with it alone - they would not cover their tracks as well, and be shamed for their lack of that skill.

Second, Slytherin is already a target for other Houses, with stunts like Dumbledore's last minute point awards and Snape being Snape driving the wedge deeper. The older years would not appreciate youngsters making a mess over someone that mostly sticks to herself anyway. Younger Slytherins would be chastised for threathening to disrupt the illusion of Slytherin unity and being crude. Self-interest at its finest.

As a result, there might be strict social isolation, but unless S!Luna decides to rile them up by overt statements of loyalty (DA, BFF's with HP, etc...) they would not go out of their way to harass her.

Exactly! I think, at least in public, they wouldn't let anyone bully her. Because of the "house unity" they want to portray.
