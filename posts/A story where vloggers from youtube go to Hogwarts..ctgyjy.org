Probably a terrible concept, but the thought of terrible vloggers terrorizing Hogwarts just seems funny.


** /The Scene: the Halls of Hogwarts, during Chamber of Secrets./

/COLIN CREEVEY, holding a SELFIE-STICK, stalks quietly through the halls. The effect is ruined by his loud voice./

COLIN: Hey hey, Creevey-Creeps. Colin here, from Hogwarts, and we're going to the place where Filch's cat died! Remember to like and subscribe!

/Colin pans the camera up to the bloody writing on the walls./

COLIN: The Chamber of Secrets has been opened... enemies of the heir beware. Cool prank, bro!

/He points./

COLIN: That's where Filch's cat died. Now we're going to sneak up to see Mr. Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived-through-something-I-can't-tell-you-about, and get his hot scoop on the sitch!

/There is a hissing. Colin/ dies /to the basilisk. The basilisk eats him. His body is never found./
