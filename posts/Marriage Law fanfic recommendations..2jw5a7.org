"Almost all of my fanfics are Alternate Universe and NC-17 ... primarily HG/SS."

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3814832/1/Care-of-Magical-Creatures][Care of Magical Creatures]] is the classic SS/HG Marriage Law Fic. Personally, I only thought it was okay (I had problems with a couple of things in the story) but many fans of the pairing adore it and you might enjoy it as well.

My personal favorite is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/311126/chapters/498237][Second Life]] by Lariope. It's not a Marriage Law fic in the traditional sense, but inspired by the Marriage Law trope. It's also a SS/HG fic.

*** Thanks. I also liked Care of Magical Creatures, but it's not my absolute favourite but thanks anyway.

**** Searching through my bookmarks, I have a few others I can rec. These are all SS/HG.

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=14050][Bride of the Potions Professor]] by SamusAran (need to sign up on the site to read it) is one. I thought it had a great plot and characterizations but it was quite angsty (a bit more than I truly enjoy), so beware if that's not your thing.

*Tyger! Tyger!* by bloodcult of freud is another classic and Marriage Law fan favorite. I also only thought that one was okay but many people love this fic as well. I can e-mail an .epub version to you if you like.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4161096/1/Polyandry-and-Other-Problems][Polandry and Other Problems]] by refya was pretty good. It's a LM/SS/HG Marriage Law fic but it's mostly SS/HG. It's not a PWP smut fest despite the threesome pairing but actually a decently plotted fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8967842/1/Denial][Denial]] by little beloved is another popular SS/HG Marriage Law fic but Hermione is not married to Snape in it.

** Apologies for the off-topic question, but are there any fics out there that have the protagonists violently resisting the Marriage Law, not in the sense of fighting with their intended or of domestic violence, but in the sense of a violent guerrilla campaign against those implementing and enforcing it and against the Ministry in general?

*** I'm pretty sure I once started reading one where Hermione didn't want to comply, met people for pretend-marriages on blind dates, where she had to be careful not to meet one of the Ministry guys out trying to catch pretenders etc pp and I stopped reading when I could see the drama of Hermione getting caught and whatever punishment she would have gotten on the horizon. Tried to find it, but couldn't because I don't even remember if her "intended" partner was Severus or Lucius. But yes, she and some other 7th year students in Hogwarts did try to fight it in several ways

**** Thanks for replying. On the one hand, I am glad that it exists. On the other hand, that doesn't sound nearly as violent as what I was looking for. Did anyone at least try to simply kill the "Ministry guys out trying to catch pretenders" whenever they showed up? They couldn't all be trained Aurors.

***** I don't know. I'm bad at handling "watching someone get in way over their head" and stopped when Hermione started or tried to rebel in a way that would have her end up in Azkaban or something. I can't even remember what exactly she wanted to do, and due to not reading further, I have no idea how far it went. I'm really really good at losing fanfictions though, tried to find it again, but no luck.

  This is my response to the Marriage Law challenge after hearing about it and reading some stories... and thinking about what MY reaction would have been if I was Harry. Oneshot, complete with epilogue.

  A marriage contract. They want him to sign away his freedom and his future and his life on a girl who didn't even attend her best friend's funeral. Harry has other ideas.

Not /quite/ what you meant but all I can think of off of the top of my head.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3484954/1/The-Marriage-Stone][The Marriage Stone]]

#+begin_quote
  To avoid the machinations of the Ministry, Harry must marry a reluctant Severus Snape. But marriage to Snape is only the beginning of Harry's problems. Voldemort has returned, and before too long Harry's marriage may determine the world's fate.
#+end_quote

It's sadly incomplete, but what there is is pretty enjoyable... and it's not just 'hurr we married now I bend you over a barrel and hammer you like you're a bent nail,' there's actually plot.

*** Not sure why you were downvoted, The Marriage Stone is one of the best SS/HP fics out there. I suppose it's not technically a "Marriage Law" fic but it is about forced marriage.
