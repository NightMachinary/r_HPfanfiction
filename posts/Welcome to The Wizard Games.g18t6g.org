“Hello...HELLO!” Harry was roused by a voice on a intercom shouting. “Can you all hear me? I'll just assume yes for now.” I bet you're all wondering where you are right now, aren't you.” Indeed Harry was, because as he blearily looked around, rubbing his eyes he realized he was not in bed with Ginny, but on a small cot in a tiny, dull room with metal walls. “Well all you badass witches and wizards, I'll tell ya! You're not in Kansas anymore. Ha! But in reality you are far, far away from all you've ever known. The why you're here is I've brought you all, gathered the strongest magical throughout space and time to compete in a deadly competition where only one team will come out alive for my own amusement. And my viewers' amusement of course, can't forget them.” -kind of hunger games but all famous witches and wizards, everyone from Harry to Gandalf to mother talzin from Star Wars acceptable. Up to you who Harry's teammate is


** Interesting. What kind of plot do you imagine there? Because for me, it looks like plot strainght from Teen Titans... <[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Jv5l9JrqSY][Here]]>

So, as far as Prompts go, it is kind of lacking. Too little information, and what is there is rather generic.

*** Huh, I had no clue T.T. Did something similar and I left it vague so people could do what they wanted with less restriction. My personal thing that I was going to write about was a bored god brought a bunch of magicals from different universes together, forming 2 person teams and forces them to fight hunger games style to be sent back to where they came from. I was half debating having Harry teamed with a dumbledore in his prime or a pre-horcrux prodigy riddle, but I might also team him with someone random like Morgana or Stephen strange or anyone really. This was just a thought I had and wanted to see if anyone wanted to write about it

**** Well, main problem with having a wizard tournament is getting people who spend their entire lives telling reality "No, thank you." to actually obey. There are a few other minor problems like that, but let's see if someone creates some words anyway =)

*** I don't know about the Teen Titan thing...but as far as prompts go I have to disagree and say it's a good prompt. Prompts should inspire (which I think this one does well), and shouldn't include much detail as it puts constraints on the writer.
