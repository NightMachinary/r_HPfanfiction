I'm looking for fics similar to Relentless, We Survive by Araceil (Ao3). Not necessarily the crossover part but Fifth Year fics where the DA plays a bigger role, or with more intense training, or anything that has a focus on Harry in a leadership and/or teaching position.


** I'm just waiting for her to update. I binge read that in one night last June and now I'm just waiting.
