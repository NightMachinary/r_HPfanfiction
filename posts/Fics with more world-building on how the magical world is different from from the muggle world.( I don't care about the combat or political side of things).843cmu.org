With the magical world being presented as being a bit like stepping into a Si-fi world that is at least 500 years into the future.

I would be more interested in entertainment like instead of wizard chess they instead have a game more like a Real time strategy game were you possess the leader of your army on the game board and wage war against the other player/s who are possessing the leader/s of the other army/s. Or a mmorpg were you possess your character and every one is playing in the same world because every board is connected threw the protean charm.

Also infrastructure like a restaurant that makes it feel like you are dining in the clouds looking down at the world bellow And other stuff equally as magical.

Pretty much stories that make the magical world more well magical, without getting bogged down in angst,political bullshit and combat.( a story were the magical world doesn't loose its wonder)


** The best answer to every worldbuilding request: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome).

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.
