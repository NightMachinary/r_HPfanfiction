Like she is super smart but she isn't in all aspects and there are others smart in ways she isnt.

Ron is the one who stops her from taking out the troll because he realizes it will result in crushing everyone. He sees the bigger picture when she may not.

Fred and George are the ones who actually invent new things something Hermione doesn't do.

She lacks alot of people skills and is too oblivious sometimes to realize she is being accidentally insensitive or read the other person appropriately to be like smart in a minipulative way.

Hermione is actually smart in a really specific way. But stories highlighting her intelligence often make her smart in all these ways. Which is frustrating not because its not canon accurate but because everyone elee becomes boring. They don't get to have cool moments of competence. Or if they do the importance is undercut because Hermione can so it better.

And like alot Smart character stories the plot becomes boring. Because the plot still designed to be challenging to book harry or book hermione. Not this super genius Hermione.

Its especially bad with Hermione in Smart Harry stories at least occasionally he will be smart in one set of things and someone else usually Hermione will be smart in another.

But Hermione because she smart to begin when its emphasized becomes smart often in all ways one can be considered smart.

It kinda reminds me of fictional scientists who somehow specialize in all scientific fields. But at least in that set up its usually they are with a set of experts in non scientific fields. Its a group of people good at different things working off each other to come to a solution and its interesting.

But here Hermione kinda takes all significant roles. Others do sorta get to matter but not enough to really feel equal . I see this with Smart Harry too but Ive been seeing it way more with Hermione lately. And its a shame because I did love to see Hermione being smart and skilled before and now i find it tiresome.


** I agree with this so much! Hermione shows practically a complete lack of creative thinking and the ability to think outside the box or view things from different angles. Her intelligence may be great, but narrow as a result.

I'm sometimes thinking that some things that she did wasn't necessarily as extreme as people make them out to be. For instance, Snape's potion riddle in PS. Who's to say that Ron wouldn't have been able to do that? He is a strong strategist from chess-playing, where you have to be able to see patterns and steps far ahead to beat your opponent. That ability I think can be transferred to other things too. And I also think it's a bit funny that Harry didn't even try. He just relied on Hermione in that instance, though I'm sure he could have solved it too. He solved the Sphinx' riddle, and while that might have been somewhat easier, it was in a high pressure situation, and he showed the ability to solve it anyway.

This is kind of pointed out in linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure) linkao3(Victoria Potter), in chapter 12 at the end of first year. Victoria reviews first year material to really get a feel for what she's learned and form new connections between the spells while Hermione just moves on to second year material.

*** I don't think I can agree with Hermione not having creativity! She took inspiration in death eathers to create a new way of communication with DA, she added a curse to the signing paper for the DA, etc. I'm not saying she is perfect, but she is fairly creative and also cunning, which is used several times through the books. She is also a good planner, preparing herself (and her friends) for a lot of situations. She is not smart all the time because she is human, but she is not only a book-eater.

** When I read stories like this I just think to myself, "FFS why isn't this fic titled 'Hermione does it better' or 'Hermione is the best'? If she can do it, why not she save the day 100% on her own w/o any assistance ASAP?"

It's like in the pairings w/Hermione where she's this perfect partner dating some buffoon that makes her look oh-so-wonderful for giving them the time of day even though the person is dragging Princess Hermione down. That's not how any real, long-term relationship works but that's wish fulfilment at work, I guess. Kinda sad.

*** Exactly! its made me really dislike alot of Hermiome romance because they got to make her look better but they make the love interest look worse often by doing this especislly in plot driven stuff. Which makes the romance un appealimg

** I totally agree. Fanfics are going crazy because we are becoming adults and realizing that if you depend on luck or external factors or other people's compassion you die. and the new young fans seem to be more rational children than we were then (or more cruel lmao). That is why canon Harry is so criticized today. Another reason is to give prominence to her as a way to center the story on a woman in some way. I feel your pain, but it is understandable what these fics do

*** Personally I think growing up means realizing you can't do it all on your own. No matter how good you are you are in your field and skills life wont just give you challenges that fall within your expertise. And there isnt time to learn to exel in everything. So you do what u can and got have to learn to reach out to others when you can't and know how to. Networking is a skill you need as an adult. I think as a kid you imagine yourself becoming skilled and self sufficient to a greater degree than you actually do. Maybe a greater degree than possible. Its a fantasy of being strong enough, smart enough, invunerable enough. And I dont think that fantasy goes away as a adult. It didnt for me anyway. So def understandable.

But this complaint more is about fanfic and story telling not life. And I think that this uber powerful mary sue effect isnt bad because its more unrealistic but more boring.

** Well this problem is created by JK herself, saying that Hermione is super smart , instead she should had made her with good memory to recall anything, that would had been better, and let's not forget that she had to nerf Harry to fit the ( Weak Harry without Dumbledore what he gonna do now ) Plot. I appreciate that JK created such a beautiful wizarding world but still she lack in some areas to fill the loop holes and consequences.

*** JK does highlight her intelligence alot and not so much others.. Not in Hermione's year anyway.But I would still argue she presents flaws and limitations for Hermione. Like making her frazzled easily struggling to work under pressure or be impulsive and think about the most efficient way to solve the problems without seeing the bigger picture like in the troll scene. And of course the struggle with people skills. Its not many but they are some. But in fic I just see Hermione get over them or not have to begin with.

But I agree thar not emphaizing the flaws enough in canon is the start of the problem.

** Because it's not canon. Hermione is very knowledgeable and has an amazing patience to think over a problem in non-critical situations. But Harry is way better at thinking on his feet.

** I think this is actually the main issue: heaping all the glory and accomplishments on the main protagonist. Do you think a super Harry is any better? If so, then I smell quite a bit of double standard here.

I personally don't like Harry (Hermione, or anyone else) get all the credits for winning. The series says friendship is great, and I think that's a great message. But for god's sake let his/her friends be useful and make some key contributions. There is absolutely no need for Harry or Hermione to outduel Voldemort in a straight fight. War is all about deceptions, fighting unfairly, and maximizing your own advantages anyway.

*** I don't think super Harry is better as a concept and im pretty bored of it too but in my experience ive found super harry ones where his intelligence limmited in some fields and they have him needing the help of someone else usually Hermione. Though heaping all the glory and accomplishments on the main duo isnt much of a improvement. But at least the dynamic with rhese two are equal. Its not much better but its something. But Ive also read Powered Harry fics where thats not true and its jusy the same as the Hermione ones and I hate them equally. But ive just seen more Hermione ones lately.

Idk if its just the fics i read but i think the reason was Hermione was already super smart in the books so exaggerating that intelligence gets you to that boring Super Hermione trope faster

**** There is that aspect too. I think its because Harry is not super powerful or super smart in the books. So this highlighting of power, status, or intelligence in Harry is giving a different set of skills he didn''t have.

But for Hermione at first glance highlighting her intelligence and using it to figure out more skilled magic is just exaggerating skills she already had at first glance. So it seems less a big deal. Less of a change. She's smart and the world building in the fanfic figuring out harder magic is a logic reasoning thing so this makes sense. ( I say world of fanfic and not canon because while some magic can be lots of magic is emotion/desire based. Like all the unforgivables, the patronus, hell even flying the broom won't come to you if you are too nervous) .

Its only when you consider how she was intelligent and in what ways she wasn't that you realize that there's actually alot of added skills you gave her and alot of flaws you dismissed. So you actually got a equal level of power wank but you just didnt consider that at first.

Kinda similar to putting negative qualities on Ron. Even in non bashing fics Ron sometimes gets dickish qualities. And he definetly had big dickish moments. But they didnt actually hsppen often. It was just a huge deal because he and Harry were so close so it had alot of narrative weight . It was usually a particular set of circumstances which he learnt from its usually not as much of a reoccuring thing. But even if it is its a very particular set of circumstances unlikely to be hit again.

Like being splinched travelling in the woods for months with no progress, while a wizard faccist is running the government, and finding out your sister was sent out into the woods with all the magical feral things that want to maim people while wearing a cursed object that fucking with your head.

But most just make him like naturally jealous and unsupportive or struggles to be supportive as a result. Which initially feels right because he was in the books jealous at times but on closer inspection it not as integral to the character at all times in all circumstances like many default to . In fact he is usually very supportive and doesnt hold back on that despite his insecurities.
