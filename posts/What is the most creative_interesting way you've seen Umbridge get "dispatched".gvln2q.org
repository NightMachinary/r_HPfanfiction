** Eaten by cat-McGonagall is probably my favorite.

#+begin_quote
  McGonagall shrugged. “She was a slippery little thing.”

  Snape gave her a sharp look. The deputy headmistress was alarmingly blasé about having let Umbridge slip through her fingers. He would have expected her to be livid at the Pink Toad's escape from justice.

  Abruptly Minerva let out a loud belch. “Oh my, excuse me!” she exclaimed, patting her chest. Then she locked eyes with Severus who was just lifting his teacup to his lips. “It must have been something I ate,” she said, very deliberately.

  Snape promptly spit his mouthful of tea all over Fawkes, who screeched in protest and huffily vanished in a burst of flame.

  Snape stared at Minerva, who gazed placidly back. Surely she hadn't meant...!

  His mind worked busily, considering Minerva's absolute devotion to her students, her well-hidden Slytherin tendencies, and her uncharacteristic lack of concern over Umbridge's potential for future harm.

  Snape gulped as he realized that one seriously enraged Transfiguration expert who is also a cat animagus plus one minimally powerful toadlike witch who has done the enraging equaled... one partially digested threat to Hogwarts's children.

  “I---er---have a potion for indigestion,” he offered, trying not to sound as terrified as he felt. Suddenly Albus was no longer the scariest person in the room.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

***** A very old idea from the early 2000s

The world kinda broke so now select people are looping through time and space with more people and series being added as time goes on.

They keep all the items and abilities they had in thier past lives so you get some hilarious results.

Here are some HP loops
