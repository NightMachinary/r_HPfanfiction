** There's some stuff in HP/Hobbit crossover too:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10951863/1/The-Lonely-Company][The Lonely Company]] Which is a fairly vanilla HP-Hobbit insertion which follows canon closely but is simply written very well.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate Be Changed]] Bit of a strange one. Its claim to HP-Crossoverdom is rather tenuous and it's a bit of a Sue-ish insert to a Thorin romance but it has a lovely attachment to the lore of the LotR that I can't help but enjoy it. Also very well written in my opinion.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8250381/1/Forging-A-King][Forging a King]] I remember enjoying this when I read it. It has its issues but I'd still consider it a decent afternoon. Plays a bit fast and loose with LotR lore though.

Also, teensy bit of a shameless plug for my own fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]] which is a bit of a fix-it fic rolled into a romance and unleashed upon the Tolkien lore without mercy.

** Not Quite a Maia

Features Neville instead of Harry(and Molly(and one more!)) in Middle Earth, but I'm telling you, you will not regret it. Hilarious non-crack follows the events of the book from Lorien and atm is up to the battle of pelennor fields. No pairings besides canon.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8879660/1/Doomsman-s-Herald][Doomsman's Herald]] is a truly fantastic start to a fic, and one of the most intriguing and captivating openings I've read in a long time.

...but it's only 4 chapters and 20k words in, and hasn't been updated in two years. What's there is top quality, but the plot hasn't really started yet, and I doubt that's about to change.

It's by Morta's Priest, the author of Wand and Shield, btw, in case you need any reassurances as to quality.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10131514/1/Back-to-the-Beginning][Back to the Beginning]] This one is really high quality for a crossover fic, imo. Give it a try. (Male Harry perspective in a female body. There's an explanation there, but it's up to you whether you want to buy it)

**** Legolas isn't female, silly.

I know he's pretty, but come on.
