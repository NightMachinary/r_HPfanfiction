  ETA: People, please stop mass-commenting and faving this old doodle. I have far more complex works in my gallery sitting nigh-on ignored, while this gets plastered with the same umpteen-times-repeated questions and whatsits all over again. I'm not even following this fandom any more. If you'd like to extend the courtesy of giving actual feedback, then please consider writing something constructive, say, beneath one of those drawings that has eaten up 30h or much more.

  Thank you.

**** I blame Alan Rickman for hiding Snape's worst side. He comes off as a stern teacher, someone like McGonagall, rather than the utter bastard that he is. Without classroom scenes from the novels, we don't quite get true Snape nastiness, like Neville and his toad, or vanishing Harry's potions, etc.

** My theory is: people conflate book versions and movie versions of characters. They get a more positive view of Snape/his appearance, because of Alan Rickman being not ugly and a very likeable guy. Could've been different if there never was any movies or the character was played by some other dude.

** That's the reason I don't understand any ship with Snape. The guy was ugly and had bad hygiene. He spends most of his time surrounded by, let's be honest here, absolutely disgusting stuff like animal guts, ground beetles and Flobberworm slime. Unless he goes through a Sci-Fi level decon for hostile environments twice a day, his /odour/ will make 95% of all people puke before the clothes, which will reek at a similar level, are even off. And that is not even taking his absolutely toxic personality and disturbing obsession for Lily Evans into account.

*** I actually have fun with him for this reason, in my never-to-be-published terribad fics. He's just so awful, you end up playing the game 'what would have to happen to cause...' Well, you probably don't, but I do.

Generally though, he's greasy, narcissistic and misanthropic and even his few likeable qualities are covered in a layer of Snape being, well, Snape.

There's always time travel, a mentor and lots of therapy though.

BTW you brought up some excellent description there that I am going to let influence me the next time he appears in a fic. It's not plagiarism, it's 'homage'.

*** This is true. I don't know why you got downvoted. Snape absolutely does not have a goatee. This comic has also been posted before where the consensus was that the actual canon Snape was somewhere in between these two comical extremes. I personally see him looking like [[https://vizen.deviantart.com/art/Harry-Christmas-Snape-106746993][this]] or [[https://vizen.deviantart.com/art/The-Light-in-the-Darkness-493683043][this]].

** One thing in my head cannon that I always thought of was this. In cannon his hair is greasy, which to me wasn't because of fumes of options but some sort of protective conditioner in his hair. Both to keep his hair from falling into and ruining a potion, and because his work matters more than his appearance. Like a doctor smelling heavily of disinfectant all the time. It's not great but it is important. I always figured Slughorn had hair like that too, but shorter and slicked back. Maybe it doesn't smell bad but it doesn't smell good.

Fannon Shape is hilarious to me when I'm in the mood to read it. The the "silky hair" always threw me off of it ever came up though. The only other thing that threw me off was his thing for Lily not being creepy. Because it is. Like really creepy man. I don't care how you dress it up, having a woman's husband and child killed in exchange for her life. Is terrible no matter what your past relationship. What I do like about Fannon Snape is fan Snape can be aware of how creepy it is and be self loathing about it and try to do some good.

Which is where Movie Snape is worse, than Book or Fan Snape. "...Always."

Fuck That Noise. Sorry for swearing
