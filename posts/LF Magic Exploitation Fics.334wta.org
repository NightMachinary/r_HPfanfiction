Looking for fics where a particular kind of magical skill or spell is exploited really badly.

Crack is fine.

Other reqs: Just please let the fic have conflict , i find fictions without conflict really dull. (i've read Runemaster and it falls kinda in this cathegory).

To give a reference once i read a oneshot in which harry asks moody to imperius him in order to study the whole summer and in the end ends up nuking (more litteraly than you think) Voldemort because he didn't want get bothered during his study. That's what i'm looking for crack-wise :)

"No-nos" : slash , hermione/draco or snape etc

I hope i'm not being too specific , i kinda did that =/

Thanks in advance :)

*** And as anyone who's ever watched Elfenlied should know, that's one fucking scary power to have. Played seriously, that would make for an awesome grimdark fic.

** By any chance, is the oneshot you referenced [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3427377/1/Harry-gets-Motivated][Harry Gets Motivated]]?

*** Yes! Just re-read it. My favourite one-shot so far, it's mostly beliveable because a person with such an ammount of motivation for a single goal would act in the exact same way. Thanks for reminding me the title :) If you know similar oneshots please link them :D

**** :) I read your post and thought "that plot sounds really familiar..." And you're welcome.

I don't know of any other similar oneshots, but I do know of a long fic where Harry (and some other characters) have that mindset of investigating and creatively exploiting magic, with no compunctions against game-breaking exploits, common to Harry Gets Motivated and Honestly, Harry. The magic system isn't obviously broken (or everyone would be exploiting it and the story wouldn't be long), but Harry manages to do some wickedly cool stuff anyway. Cutting through thick metal walls, riding a rocket-powered broomstick, defeating Voldemort, and lots more all /in his first year/ through creative and well-researched use of limited magical ability. The fic is called [[http://hpmor.com/][/Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/]]. Enjoy! :D

***** I don't really dislike HPMoR (i haven't read the last arc yet , but untill ch 105-106) but the setup at the end doesn't really attracts me. Too much Wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff for my liking , i think i will finish it sooner than later but at the moment i'm searching more "exciting" lines. On the line of Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation.

It's not really updated often (which makes me sad) but it plays arround Transfiguration and Radioactivity so i'm really intrigued. As i said in the main post i liked Runemaster a lot too but the lack of conflict made it a pretty dull experience. There are far too many wish-fufilment fanfictions , i love the ideas behind them but i just quit because it's just harry/hermione/someone else steamrolling the shit out of the badguys. It's as fun as having a lv 100 PG in a MMO and going to pvp lv5 noobs , woo so fun...

****** It wasn't updated much for a while, but it is finished now. Whether you consider the ending "steamrolling the shit out of the bad guys" is up to you. (Also, there are now assorted continuation fics.)

I don't have any more recommendations for you, but good luck! :)

** This [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588][oneshot]] is the perfect magic exploitation fic. Short, sweet, and chalk full of juicy ways someone could exploit magic to become Crime Emperor of the World. There isn't any conflict... but as short as it is you owe it to yourself to give it a try.
