Not asking for him to be good or a hero, just wanna see fics where the dude specializing in mental manipulation is shown to be putting on a mask of inanity instead of just being a flamboyant credit-stealer with skill in the one spell needed to do so.

Edit: "Reasonably competent" is much more concise than the above. Reasonably competent Lockharts, good bad or too gray to label.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/Like-a-Red-Headed-Stepchild][Like Red Headed Stepchild]], linkffn(12382425): The Lockhart is so popular in this fic that the author decides to spin off his adventure into a new story.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

  Formerly Defense for Two. Adopted from Perspicacity with permission. They thought Lockhart was a fraud. They were wrong; he was their guide into a world of danger, adventure, intrigue and other Unspeakable Things.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
