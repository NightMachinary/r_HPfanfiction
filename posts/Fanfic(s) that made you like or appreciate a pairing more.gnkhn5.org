We all have pairings that aren't your thing, maybe they're even canon pairings, or they can be non canon pairings. Can be het/slash/femslash or whatever you can think of. Just stories you were like, okay this really made me love this pairing!

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.

Can be on any site, can have any warnings, be any era, anyone can be the main character.

Would rather not have Weasley bashing (if at all possible). But other then that, that's the only real requirements.

Can be canon compliant or completely AU, the story itself can be anything, Horcruxes can be a thing or not.


** Linkffn(13491812) was recommended to me, and at first I was sceptical, but it was a nice and fluffy depiction of a pairing I haven't seen much of before.

** I generally prefer Hinny, but even I have to admit that there is just not enough about Ginny in the canon to make it much sense. Thus for me the basic idea how the relationship could work comes from stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] (start with “Grave days” for their relationship). And I am also the last person to say that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the best book of the series, but linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince by RRFang) made their relationship much more possible.

** Harmony has always been a bit bland for me, and their relationship dynamics in pretty much every fic I've read was horrific. But then I read Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift, and I was sold. Seriously, everyone should read it, it's a damn masterpiece when it comes to treating the characters right.

** I've been on hermione reading spree this week. This is few of my recomendation. Linkffn(Pet project) HG/SS is surprising for me, considering the age gap. The characterization of snape in this fic is helping me like this pairing. Story: The Debt of Time Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10772496]]) this fic made me appreciate HG/SB and HG/RL. But i am dropping it because i couldn't handle polyamorous relationships. (poor sirius)

Other than that, Linkffn(delenda est) linkffn(stepping back) made me love HP/BL pairing

***** I can't tell you all that without spoilers.... I can tell you the Mia/ Sirius is deeper and more lasting, but Remus does make one real comeback. Keep in mind what they've said about bonds- Mia and Sirius aren't ready to have a sealed bond. They still have to evolve and grow up a bit

I think that the big thing to remember with the Pack bond is that it's not about romance or love or sex. It's closer to being FAMILY.... she wants to make the Pack bond to Remus because she loves her friends and they're like family to her. She doesn't want to do it because she just wants closer to Remus. She wants them all closer to each other, to draw strength from the magic in the bond. If you want the one big spoiler

Debt of Time is my all-time favorite fic, so I really recommend finishing it. I know it's long, but there is so much amazing stuff coming.

I will tell you that Chapter 71 is the end of Mia and Remus's romantic relationship, if that helps. You can get through!
