:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey, everyone! First time posting here. Or anywhere... Anyways! I'm looking for two fics that I haven't been able to find for a long while.

The first is where Harry isn't raised by the Dursleys, and is raised 'properly'. He has long hair in this one. When he goes to Hogwarts, he thinks that 'he can feel his hair losing its (something) due to the cheap shampoos and conditioners that Hogwarts has'.

The second is I think either Harry/Harem, or at least Harry/Hermione. A reoccurring theme in this one is that Hermione is so smart that she can speak along with someone once she figures out their plan, down to the exact word. I feel like this one is a werewolf! Harry fic, set during the forth book...

Anyways! I hope that you all can help me! If you can't, then that's fine!


** I wish I could help, but I don't recognise either of these in the slightest (although to be fair on the second one I avoid Harry/Hermione like the plague).

If you can remember particular sentences or stuff from the fics though, then try typing them into Google (with 'Harry Potter Fanfiction' written before it). It sometimes randomly leads you to the fic your looking for.
