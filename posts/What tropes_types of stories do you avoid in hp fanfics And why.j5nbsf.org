Apart from like ship preferences

The more specific the better.

like for example I avoid the uber competent and/or uber powerful Harry and Hermione stories.

partly cuz I'm kinda burnt out on them with Harry and Hermione and partly cuz it often makes all obstacles too easy for mc ( in my opinion) and that can sometimes be boring. Though Im more ok seeing it from characters other than Harry and Hermione just cuz i'm less used to that.

So what are specific things you guys avoid?


** Bossy Harry. I just can't do it anymore. I live with children, and JKR did a better job with writing their temperaments than most.

Kids are happy when they have money, not scheming. They spend it as fast as they can on candy and games, not bribing goblins to prioritize arranging their fiscal matters.

Kids are stupid when they're angry, not conniving.

Adults who deal with petulant and angry children don't just roll over and give them what they want.

I don't mind a powerful, competent Harry, but I can't stand one that just shouts down all of the experts around him.

** Any fic that has near every pureblood with a title. The nobility irl were mostly arseholes, I don't want to read that shit.

Bashing, it's been done to death and just boring now.

Dark Harry. I don't want to read about Harry the dick.

Abused Harry. I can just about stomach canon abuse. A Harry beaten black and blue or sexual assaulted makes me rage and it's not good for my blood pressure.

** Unfortunately I avoid fem!Harry. I really wish there was an effort there because I am a girl and I love the idea of ​​a heroine, but nothing that these fics show is realistic, I don't know if it's laziness or fear of running away from the canon (which should happen since the JK herself said that you can't put a girl in Harry's shoes and move on. Changing gender can change everything in history even if your lazy ass doesn't accept it, young author). And all the repetitive shit of the tiny, sassy, ​​not-so-pretty girl with black hair and glasses and called Harriet (WTF) is complete rubbish. Have a little creativity there for the God's sake!!!

I know that for me, personally, I want to read about Harry put into different situations, and changing his gender would flat out make him a different person (and let's be real: people would /react differently/ to a girl-who-lived instead of boy). Ivy though... Ivy is her own person. And a clueless!Harry is there too. So that's a great story :D

** This is really nit picky but fics that have Snape paired with literally anybody. I just can't picture Snape falling in love lol (unless it's an AU or a Severitus and even then I avoid the Snape/Lily stuff because I feel like you can't have a Snape/Lily pairing without bashing James Potter heavily and usually bashing goes much further than how he acted as a teenager in canon). Yeah basically can't read Snape in a romantic relationship or Severitus in any way bc I cringe

** - Gamer Fics: I've tried several, including the original webtoon, but they all turn into a mix of grinding and being too overpowered for anything to matter, which are generally the most boring parts of gaming.

  - linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20 by Sir Poley) is not actually a Gamer fic, but it's close enough in concept that it should serve as an example of how a good gamer fic could be written.

- Reading the Book Fics: The books are better without a crappy MST3K knockoff thrown on top of it. The authors usually only have maybe one good idea per chapter, but they have to add commentary after every line, so you end up with a bunch of unfunny and unoriginal padding.

  - linkao3(A Dramatic Reading by White_Squirrel) is the only one I've read that was actually decent. I think it was because the reading supported the plot instead of being the plot. But the sequel so far has turned into a standard Reading the Books fic, and isn't nearly as good.

- Marauders Era/Next Gen/Founders Era fics: I've tried them, but they're not for me. I think it's mostly that I don't care about those characters at all, combined with the fact there's very little canon info to go on, so writers have to make up more characters and plots. And maybe most authors just aren't good at doing that.

  - Time travel is a major exception here. I've enjoyed many stories about Harry traveling to his parents' time and ruining the timeline. There have also been a few good ones about the Founders or Harry's kids showing up when Harry's at school.

- Any sort of Muggle AU: Why would I want to read a story about some completely normal people drinking coffee when I could be reading about magic instead? This is a bigger thing in other fandoms, but it occasionally pops up here too.

- Snape isn't actually that bad: Yes, he is. And so is Malfoy, but if the story starts early enough, I can accept him becoming a better person (though I still don't always like it).

- Shopping trips: I don't care about Harry's TARDIS trunk, 12-core wonder wand, or the 30 lordships he needs to pick up at Gringotts. It's never interesting to read and arely matters at all. I usually end up skimming or skipping those chapters, and then dropping the fic soon after, because any story that has those chapters probably doesn't have much else going for it.

  - Obviously there are some good stories with shopping scenes. But I think the difference is usually that plot actually happens in those scenes. Consider how Rowling handled it:
  - Book 1: Full description of Diagon and Gringotts and everything that happened there, because it's all brand new. Fortunately, now that she's done it, no one else has to.
  - Book 2: The scenes at Borgin's and the bookstore are the only parts of the trip that get more than a mention, because that's where plot happens.
  - Book 3: Harry stays in Diagon for a few weeks, but none of it is mentioned, because it doesn't matter. Just the part where the Weasleys show up at the end, because that does matter.
  - Book 4: No shopping at all!
  - Book 5: I'm pretty sure there was no shopping again.
  - Book 6: Shopping is back, but we only see Harry stalk Malfoy, because that's important, and WWW, because that's interesting and shows what the twins are up to.

- Talking with a Reaper: These scenes also never matter, and only exist to get Harry onboard the bashing train before the (potentially) interesting part of the story starts. Oh, and because the challenge says the scene has to happen. Speaking of...

- Challenges: They're terrible. Most of them are have so many ridiculous restrictions and guidelines that I'm pretty sure they're really just someone trying to trick people into writing free commissions for them. I'm not surprised that most fics based on challenges quickly lose the author's interest and die off. Obviously some good fics have been written based on challenges, but those tend to be good in spite of the challenge, not because if it.

- Flashbacks: They're almost always a sign of bad writing. Especially when they're just a few paragraphs long, and just exist to give us information that we could have just been told. Especially especially when they're just a few paragraphs into the chapter or story.

fics where it's found out that *gasp* muggleborns actually don't exist and they are just descendants from squibs. especially if the fic promotes "don't be blood supremacist". making muggleborns not muggleborns /is/ actually blood supremacist!

fics that take too much time with a thing that could be one paragraph. that is just *filler*. the notable example is an OOC indi Harry going shopping. so of course he would want a new wardrobe, new haircut, all the dark books, potion ingredients, a bottomless featherlight trunk you could live in obviously, and suddenly you have 150k words just for that! that is an average length of a finished fic. makes me not read the fic at all since I can't imagine how much time the actual story will take.

The harem almost always exists purely for wish fulfillment and has no bearing on the plot, and usually only one or two of the girls actually matter.
