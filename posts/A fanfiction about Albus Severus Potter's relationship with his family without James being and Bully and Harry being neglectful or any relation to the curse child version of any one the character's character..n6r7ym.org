Like the title suggest most of which I have read is where James becomes a Bully and Harry is emotionally abusive.

I really want to read a realistic version of his relationship with his family.

I feel like Albus could have had a very interesting story if the cursed child hadn't ruined it.


** Dudley's Memories and its sequels have pretty realistic family dynamics - James and Harry are often at odds because James is 17 and a little too much like Harry, and their conflicts reminded me a lot of the conflicts between Harry and Sirius. At one point James steals (and crashes) Harry's broom and Harry goes mad at him because he's freaking out that James might have been very injured, for instance, and James gets very upset at the reaction.

Harry and his interactions with all his children, and his wife, are pretty true to character and there's no random ousting of children for being in the wrong house at school. At one point Harry mentions that he “likes having the set [of Hogwarts houses].”

** G. Norman Lippert's James Potter series has a supportive and functional Potter family. Harry doesn't give a damn about the fact that Albus is sorted into the green and silver and James' freak out is clearly motivated by love as he thinks Albus only agreed with the Hat to spite Scorpius (who is sorted into Gryffindor) and is now under the influence of an upperclassman who James considers dangerous.

** You can try [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31886][Memories and Dreams]], although this focuses on Harry more than Albus or James.

** So this is technically compliant with Cursed Child (though I've never actually read CC so I don't know for sure) but it has such a great Potter family dynamic and its so so cute. First in a series. linkao3(put your guns away, its tea time by ellizablue)

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.
