Also, _Red Weasley was red, G_orge Weasley was a really big eater, and Hermione _Ranger went to live in the African jungle.

...Yeah, the fic had a tendency to have 'one letter off' puns a lot.

*** Funnily enough, actually the latter, minus the fever, add day to dream.

Since my previous Request for a fic wasn't too well received for whatever reason (I thought it was a /good/ pun...), I decided to fib a teeny bit and frame this as a search for a fic that most-definitely-does-exist rather than might-exist, in order to get people to think more positively about the idea.

Think it's working so far?

** What will you substract from Albus Percival Brian Wulfric Dumbledore?

Severus Snap will be retrofitted to the creator of exploding snap? Or you want to have severus Nape, a serial killer working as a teacher in Hogwarts?

  What will you substract from Albus Percival Brian Wulfric Dumbledore?
#+end_quote

A Bus: Public transport mogul.

Bran: Breakfast cereal mogul.

Ulfric: Leader of a rebel faction against the established government, seeking a return to traditional values...wait, is this Dumbledore or Voldemort?

Dumble Ore: Mining mogul and sound amplifier saleswizard...or if you care more about the pronunciation than the spelling, mining mogul and exercise gym manager (dumbbell).

...I've got nothing for Percival, unfortunately.
