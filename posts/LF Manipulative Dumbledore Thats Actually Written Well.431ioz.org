I know we've all read tons and tons of senile! manipulative! evil! Dumbledore fics and most people are really tired of them. I got tired of them too and have avoided them for a while yet I just read part of a very short abandoned story that had actually a competent very manipulative Dumbledore. This put me in the mood for these kinds of stories so please give me your recommendations. I would like Harry to be smarter than canon but not be able to suddenly out maneuver Dumbledore. That being said I don't want Dumbledore to just get away with everything either. I want their conflict to remain undecided for most of the story. I want something really political. I would also like their to be a pairing that has a main role in the story of some kind. I don't really care who, just no slash please. Also I would like it to be set at least in fourth year or later. I find it very unbelievable unless its a time travel fic that Harry can beat Dumbledore as an 11 year old. Let me know. Thanks!


** Linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind) While this doesn't have some (admittedly a lot more than some) of the aspects your looking for I thoroughly enjoyed this fic and thought it was the best manipulative Dumbledore I'd ever read. While it doesn't have many of the elements you want it is well written with an interesting plot that avoids most of the tropes from manipulative Dumbledore series.

** I completely agree with you about how a lot are written horribly but I've just finish linkffn(Second Chances by Zaxarus) and I find its a whole lot better written then in many others and its the first and a 3 part series (there may be more but the author is in the middle of the 3rd installment).
