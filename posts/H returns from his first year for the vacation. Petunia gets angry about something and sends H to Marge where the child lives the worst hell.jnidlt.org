Well, I'm a sadistic little shit but I also need to create a breaking point that year. I thought about writing this idea, but I don't want to escape Petunia's reality. Would she let her sister's child spend a month at the home of the woman she knew was a demon? Too much?


** She probably would. Petunia is that bitter and twisted.
