Harry Potter as everyone knows, survived the battle of Hogwarts.

Well, except for that confusing bit where he got carried back form the forest by Hagrid.

Harry Potter vanquished he-who-shall-not-be-named. (Again!)

And was seen kissing Ginny Weasley, a Griffindor Sixth Year.

Harry Potter's companions, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley were seen after the battle Hugging.

There are a lot of funerals after the battle. (Lets ignore that bit.)

This story starts about a week after all of that and runs for a few years in-story.

What do you do after you've been a child soldier all your life?

Good thing the war's over.

Everything can go back to normal.

​

*META:*

First fanfiction, so, kind-of rough around the edges.

This one is finished (enough) and it's nearly 200k words.

Fair warning: PTSD, Alcohol abuse and use of dark magical objects.

It's rated (M) because people do adult things, but not (very) graphically.

Kids, get out of here right now! (They won't learn anything, if they read it, fortunately)

Bits are rather talky. Remember not to tip is you don't like it.

Ends up with [HP/DG] Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass, that girl who's just a name in the books.

I'm aiming for not cringefully tropey.. but still fun.

​

Strictly an EWE thing (Epilogue, What Epilogue, so the last chapter of Deathly Hallows doesn't happen)

So, in this story, Harry Potter and some of his friends survived the war.

Maybe not too happy about it. :-(

Harry stumbles and bumbles his way along (trying for nearly Canon Harry)

Bad things happen. Good doesn't just triumph over evil instantly.

Some Canon relationships wither and die. Some die in flames.

​

Oh, and there's this girl... maybe she just likes Fireworks.

I'm only human therefore the story didn't get written perfectly, I've gone back and fixed some mistakes I made along the way; you'll see mentions of those in the reviews.

People looking for power-tripping Harry... well, you're going to go away a little hungry. He's good.. but not that good.

I hope that anyone stuck at home right now needing some more Harry Potter.. well this is free. I really hope some more people enjoy reading it.

Might be construed as Ginny Bashing. Not my intent. Ginny and Harry have baggage.

Someone else put it better "At least she looks like your mother."

And they've both been possessed by Voldemort, so they've got that in common with each other, right?


** Harry/daphne huh, I'll give it a whirl
