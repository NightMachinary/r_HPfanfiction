Title say it all. I know it's vague but I'm wondering if there are any fics where something happen to Harry during the Death Eater attacks similar to what happened in the movie, or worse. Could be like Harry duelled a Death Eater and got injured in the process or got abducted or whatever. Just looking for something like that.

Would prefer if it was important in the story, not something that happen in one chapter and is then forgotten for the rest of the fanfic.

Bonus points if he's not alone (Like, let's say for instance, he's helping Ginny run away and crash on a tent before being knocked out by the crowd.)


** There was one where things did not end well. Not necessarily for harry. But the Riots where much worse than how it originally happened. In this short Hermoine ends up dying when everyone is separated. And Harry ends up being more brutal as a result. It's a Harry/Fleur story. Features a Good Friend!Ron!.

  A better prepared Harry survives a much more devastating Death Eater attack after the Quidditch World Cup. Harry is kept on the edge of sanity and has never felt more alone. Voldemort is not the problem, only a symptom, and Harry is determined to fix wizarding Britain as a whole. Warning: Character death, brutal magical combat Harry/Fleur

** Started looking for fics due to this prompt. Haven't completely read them but here is two I found with something like this around the beginning chapters.
