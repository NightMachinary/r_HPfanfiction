I just got through Shezza's Denarian Trilogy and I think that one of my favorite aspects was Harry's personality. He was an utter asshole to everyone, even people he likes, but not unlikable at the same time, he was snarky and always had something rude/funny to say to someone, and he was casually perverted at the same time and pretty much had no issue saying whatever the hell he wanted. He got a bit less abrasive overall as it went on, but that aspect of him never went away.

What I want to know, is there anything else like that? Preferably a longer (and good) story.

If not, then maybe just something similar to the trilogy in that it mixes in another series seamlessly while giving it many more options that add to the fic. Also preferably a long and good story.


** I dropped [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] because the main character was an unfunny asshole who /thought/ he was funny. So... have a look at it, I guess?

** Ahh what's the one I'm thinking of. Basically an adult Harry who defeated Voldemort accidentally travels back in time to year 1.

Instead of angsting about it, he just decides to enjoy it, prank people, and wrap up the whole voldemort thing early so he can hang out.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

**** He got a good deal less abrasive as time went on. In Renegade he was going full blast, almost all of the time, but it dimmed down a bit in Knight, and then more in Lord. I agree that with certain characters (Dumbledore and Amanda in particular) he should have probably been better to (though I think the transition was smooth with the Dumbledore), Amanda a bit more more so considering the events of Lord. I honestly expected something a bit more drastic in terms of changes after the end of that one arc.

***** You're right, I think his interactions with Dumbledore were fine and I was pretty happy with where they were by the end of the story. Those mock fight scenes were the best. It was more Amanda, Michael and the rest of the Carpenters, and Amaris that were frustrating.

****** To be honest he was never very close to the other Carpenters. The eldest brother hates him and Harry brutalizes him in particular, Molly and him have a mutual, moderate dislike of each other, Harry (the little one) never really did anything, Hope just got saved that one time and comes across like a BOS Amanda but younger, not much there, Charity kind of hates him but is thankful toward him while Harry heavily dislikes her and kind of pervs on her when she's not around, and Michael respects/is thankful to him somewhat for a number of reasons but due to his status isn't overly friendly (their relationship is rather cordial actually beyond the whole Denarian/Knight thing).

They're pretty much fine because not much is done with most of them. Amanda was weird in that while I liked their relationship, he didn't seem to visibly warm up to her (though he was especially when it came to tutoring her) very much, and I didn't quite like how that whole thing with her was put to the side because Shezza wanted to get the story over with by a certain point. Denarian Lord needed some more chapters to solidified what exactly they ended on and that spin-off oneshot he did made me feel a bit weird about it. The thing is that her character kind of revolved around Harry and there's nothing wrong with that, but I feel like there should have been something more there for that reason amongst others.

Amaris is kind of weird because of her situation, but pretty much everyone is at a loss when it comes to her. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what her exact view of him. She played tag-along in Knight, to be honest I don't think that helped very much since Knight felt a bit filler-y compared to the other two but at least I got her role there. It's also weird on Harry's end, she's his daughter and she grew on him and that makes sense, but then there's however she managed to capture him when he wouldn't kill her, but then there's the torture and I honestly don't think him with his personality would just let it go so easily even if it wasn't the time.
