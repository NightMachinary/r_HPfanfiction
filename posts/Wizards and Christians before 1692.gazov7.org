Does JKR ever actually how wizards and Christians got along before the secrecy act? In my mind, it would be much more likely that wizards went into hiding waaaay before the Salem witch trials, perhaps during the christianization of britain. Also, if wizards lived along-side Christian muggles for centuries, I don't see how they managed to completely vanish ALL tracks and records of magic being real. I mean, if wizards and magic were suddenly gone from a world where they were just there, surely it would be easier to convince the muggles into thinking all wizards died or whatever, instead of them just never existing. Then they wouldn't have to mind fuck every single scholar and historical text in the world.


** Look at actual history books and older religious texts, they talk about magic all over the place, but as you read primary sources about the Catholicism spread, they talk about how the catholic church would seek out areas that were considered "magical" and either destroy it and build a church there or just destroy it.

Stories of actual magic existing tended to start dying out in those regions around those time frames. Whether due to enlightenment, religious belief or people being afraid to speak out, take your pick.

But yes, wizards should have gone into hiding much earlier than 1692.

** I think wizards began retreating from muggle society, or living among them in secret, a long long time before the Statute. After all, muggle-wizard tensions were clearly high enough even back in the 10th century that Slytherin refusing to take muggleborn students wasn't seen as /that/ weird by his friends.

It is likely in my mind that the Statute effectively just made official and compulsory what had already been broadly adopted by most of the population at that stage.

** There are two options:

1. The separation was really a way earlier. There is a group of Czech fanfiction writers, gathered around the server [[http://budec.net/]], who believe that separation of the Czech magical school at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(Kladno_District][Budeƒç]]) was what really happened after the death of the Duke Wenceslaus I (yes, that's the Good King Wenceslaus from the Christmas carol) at 935, when the castle has been suddenly abandoned.

2. There was for centuries very tense relationship between the Church and wizards since at least the Fourth Lateran Council at 1215, when the Church abandoned its official position that magic is just a fraud and nothing real. I like how linkao3(The Friar's Calling by Chthonia) describes it.

#+begin_quote
  Long before the Statute of Secrecy, when Kings still sought counsel from wizards and scholars debated magic at the great centres of learning, England seethed as her nobles struggled to check the power of the King -- and one young friar found his new path taking an unexpected turn.
