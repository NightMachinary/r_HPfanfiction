** The moment Harry starts calling out Dumbledore in the great hall, I cringe. The moment adults agree with that obnoxious little shit of a character, I make a hasty exit.

Oddly enough my tolerance for "Know-It-All-Smart-Ass-Harry" seems to decrease as I get older. Back when I was 22 (when I first started reading fanfiction) I used to cheer on seventeen year old Harry telling Dumbledore to go fuck himself but now I just want to hit him over the head, tell him to shut up and sit down. I guess this is what being an adult feels like.

** For me Its very hard to read a fic when the dialogue is very stilted and formal, with minimal (if any) contractions and people (especially kids) are speaking like that. Its very jarring and awkward for me.

Like age 11 harry saying something like "Whilst I agree with you Ronald, I can not and I will not agree to such a proposal as it shows cowardice and is lll befitting a wizard such as I."

I'd prefer something like "Are you barking mad Ron? Yeah, its a good idea but it sounds cowardly to me."

** Relationship/social interaction-wise, or anything?

Whenever I'm reading a story that starts describing every detail of clothing/hair/makeup/jewelry, I gag a little and stop reading. Give me just enough detail that I can get the "feel" of the scene, but don't describe every outfit in a let's-decide-what-to-wear scene in excruciatingly minute detail (or just leave the scene out altogether, for a preference).

Terrible dialogue and progresses-too-fast romance is pretty cringy as well. Anytime the author feels like they need to add something like "[Romantic Lead] couldn't believe how comfortable s/he felt around [Other Romantic Lead] already. They had only been dating for [ridiculously short amount of time, like three days or something], but s/he felt like s/he had known him/her for his/her whole life," or something similar, it should be a major red flag that their characterization needs some work.

**** Amusingly enough, you can build characters that legitimately do that in Dungeons and Dragons. If you have a Bard with a high enough persuade score, you can use /a single conversation/ to turn an archenemy into a friend. It's commonly referred to as 'Diplomancy' and my headcanon is that Naruto is a min-maxed character being played in a pseudojapanese ninja campaign where pieces of D&D keep crossing over.

I mean, c'mon, most of the techniques they use are very similar to the list of spells in D&D.

It's rather hard to ignore a teenager when he's beating the crap out of them, and there's a good chance that whatever they were planning to do when he started beating the crap out of them, it's probably not a good idea to do any more, so sure, they'd turn in an instant.

Also in fics where Draco turns good, it is completely cringe-worthy that people completely skip the getting to know each other part.

** Cringe is something I came to expect in fanfiction by now. Here are some of my favorites:

- Katanas.

Ah, the true weapon of the weaboo. Slices and dices the enemy like nothing else... except any other slightly curved blade. But sabers and kriegsmesser aren't wielded by the most fierce warriors that have ever slain countless farmers - the samurai. If you write this in your fanfic, I assume you also run like [[http://orig15.deviantart.net/fbcf/f/2007/287/a/e/sasuke_and_naruto___ninja_run_by_beethy.jpg][this]].

- Teen Witch Weekly intermission

"Here we see Harry Potter, wearing a emerald green robe with silver thread, accenting his eyecolor. His robe comes with a set of Hebridian Black skin boots and gauntlets. To his side is Daphne Greengrass, fitting in a light, silver summer dress......"

I hate shopping trips in my fic.

- The Underage Sex

I am undecided whats worse, the scene that sound like the author has never even seen anyone else's genitalia, or the one that obviously has had sex and is now imagining two underage teens doing it.

- Pagan rituals as imagined by the catholic church

As I grew up in a "pagan" family this isn't just cringey but also kind of insulting. We do not require our spouse to drink the semen of every male in the family to ensure fertility, thank you very much. We also don't slaughter little children - not even if they're annyoing little shits.

Seriously, this makes me pretty angry. If you have to include norse, ancient greek, celtic,... pantheons and rituals, at least do your research.

- Edgelord McShadowkiller

Basically, everything that sounds as if Reaper from Overwatch writes fanfiction.

- Any sort of romance kickstart

Soulbond, marriage contracts and whatnot. If you can't write a decent buildup to a romance, don't brute force it with a cop out.

**** While I think that the whole age of consent thing is stupid as far as that particular issue goes, most 14-year-olds aren't even remotely prepared for the possible consequences of engaging in said acts (and I don't mean “oh they aren't adults yet, blah blah blah”; rather, they simply discard the possibility of it happening without thinking about it at all), so there's a whole lot wrong with it.

Also, it's more about people that age writing that stuff and releasing it to the net without warning, where it can cause issues for people who read it because of the law possibly being screwy ... or because it damages their sanity when written by virgins with ... particularly colourful imagination.

** This is a little bit of a different one, but I cringe when characters use each others names too much in dialogue. Like

"Good morning , Harry."

"Good morning, Ginny."

"Are you going to work, Harry?"

"Yes, Gin."

Like no. Stop. Nobody talks like that. In real life we only use each others names for emphasis, not at the beginning/end of every goddamn sentence.

Also, while we're at it:

"I love you, Harry James Potter."

"I love you too, Ginevra Molly Weasley."

STOP IT WITH THE FULL NAMES. Okay, done.

** What really chaps my hide is when I take the time to read a story with pretty decent characterization and a pretty good plot, and then the couple finally gets together.

Yes! Hooray! At last!

And then the plot takes a complete back seat to endless sex scene after endless sex scene.

I think this bothers me more than most things because at this point I've already invested quite a lot of time into reading, but once it's just sex sex sex, I can't deal with it.

** When a pairing is finally established, the characters in question aware forever joint at the hip with PDAs abound. H/Hr is notorious for this, which is odd because Harry and Hermione are quite far removed from that sort of behaviour (except for occasions like that one Quidditch match, but emotions were running pretty high).

** The main reason I nope out of stories is when they add too many layers to the story and it falls over (for me).

Like:

Canon Harry finds his mother's specially-prepared disaster trunk at the Dursleys'. It has a ton of information that Harry will find useful, as well as his mother's cool sword that she forged and enchanted herself!

And then they add on magic-binding, thieving (maybe?) Dumbledore, etc. This story is fairly popular. It lost me when... [[/spoiler][Harry happened to stumble across his still-living parents in Diagon Alley, along with their daughter, and they thought he was dead all along/they're obliviated/I dunno. I noped out before the explanation.]] It toppled over and I didn't look back.

** When Harry buys a magical trunk that has a whole apartment inside. Better yet, where time moves at a fraction of the pace of reality! I understand that trunks with enlarged compartments are canon, but I can't get on board with the idea of an 11 year old living & training inside a piece of furniture.

** When there is no tension or actual plot. It can happen when it is just focusing character interaction with no opposing force, or there is the canon plot which is just knocked over easily to focus on the characters again. And the last type is having canon plot changed to have a different character do the same things as another character Examples: Harry's horcrux which is just removed cause of some magic bullshit. "Hey what is that book in Ginny's cauldron" Peter Pettigrew getting captured early in the story, then just happens to escape during Harry's 3rd year.
