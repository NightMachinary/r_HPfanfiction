I really like the horror aspect of the story where the horocrux inside Harry is an actual twisted entity that manifests. I like how Tom is something/someone Harry can actually talk to because it leads to a certain lever of darker sophistication? to what's inside him instead of the passivity of the horocrux in the books. I liked how hard Petunia and Dudley work with everything through trial and error to help Harry deal with what is happening to him. I like how it's from Snape's point of view but that isn't necessary. If there is anything out there anywhere similar to this I would absolutely love to read them especially if they are on the longer side with a good plot. I am really looking for something I can sink into. Any help from you guys is greatly appreciated.

  Professor Snape is tasked with delivering the letter to the boy nobody has set eyes on in ten years... Horror Oneshot: Pretty messed up.

** Not really anything that I know of. It's a very unique story. The closest I could think of are The Eyes and a few things by Ruskbyte and Voice of the Nephilim.

Eyes - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/]]

Ruskbyte - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/226550/Ruskbyte]]

*** I feel like a complete idiot for forgetting to say thank you for your suggestions. I ended up doing a deep dive of those links and their bookmarks saving everything that was interesting that I forgot to come back. While not finding anything exactly like I was looking for you did line me up with reading material for quite a while so thank you thank you!

**** No worries. I'm glad you've enjoyed the hunt for more stories. :)

Have you read any of them, and if so, have you enjoyed any of them?

***** Funnily enough I have amassed a frightening HP to-read list but I'm currently on an Avengers bender and can't seem to shift my focus. I'm sure when I come up for air I'll get to one of them.

****** Fair enough. :D

Avengers fics or HP-Avengers crossovers, might I ask?

******* The series I'm reading now pure Avengers but there are some crossovers going on. I just can't seem to stray too far from Tony right now.

******** Ah, nice. I've only read a couple of Avengers crossovers - that one where Harry works as a mechanic and Tony breaks down outside his workshop, and another I forget - but they were interesting enough. I'm not a big superheroes fan, so I can't really add anything to your rec list for that. :)
