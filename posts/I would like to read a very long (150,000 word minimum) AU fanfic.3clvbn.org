Hello! I'd like to find something new and something good. I don't want it to be HPMoR, Partially Kissed Hero, The Sacrifices Arc, On the Way to Greatness, Wastelands of Time, The Lionsnake Chronicles, They Shook Hands, Applied Cultural Anthropology, Delenda Est... the list probably goes on, but I've read all those already and most of them reread recently.

I'm looking for something AU. 'Harry in a different House' is something I like, but isn't necessary. I don't mind slash but would prefer no harem fics. I want it to be more or less serious. Preferably set in the UK.

Anyone have anything they would recommend?


** I read The Dementor's Stigma a little bit ago, and I think it fits most of your points. It's roughly 250,000 words, set years after the seventh book, in a zombie apocalypse. Definitely a nice change of pace in terms of setting and worldbuilding compared to a lot of other fanfics.

** linkffn(Enveloped in the Darkness by Brigade) also has a WIP sequel (updated yesterday) that's at 80K words, so those two together are over 200K words.

linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) is at 155K words now.

I'm a little hesitant to recommend this, but linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation by NoahPhantom) and its 6 sequels (all over 100K words, about a million words and counting now). These improve with time; the earlier ones, in particular, are less engaging then most fics I've recommended. It does feature good grammar and a cohesive plot; it's just that most of that plot doesn't show up until later (a lot of things in the first few do turn out to be part of the setup for stuff in later books, but that doesn't improve the first few much), and there's quite a bit of fluff. I would give it a try; if you find the first one OK, you'll probably be enjoying it quite a bit by the last few.

linkffn(Forging the Sword).

linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom)

linkffn(Magics of the Arcane by Eilyfe)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Children of Change). Some bashing, some weird stuff (veganism?), but also some really funny stuff.

linkffn(Too Young to Die by thebombhasbeenplanted). The first chapter is really cringe-inducing and sets off all sorts of alarms (I abandoned it several times before getting to chapter 2), but after that it's really good.

linkffn(A Curse of Truth by butalearner). Pretty good for an SI.

linkffn(An Old and New World by Lens of Sanity). Lots of typos and stuff, but a /really/ good story.

**** It does. The sentence structure and such are still spotty for a bit. A lot of cliches show up in some form in chapter 2, but it's not as bad as chapter 1, and it's pretty decent by chapter 3. The story is /very/ cohesive - it's all focused on the quest that chapter 1 sets up. The ending is as perfect as the beginning is terrible. There's excellent AU world-building too, and some really epic sequences.

Honestly, you could probably just skip chapter 1. Essentially, Harry's little sister Natalie, who he's rather close to, dies as a result of an explosion Harry's brother Zach (the BWL) accidentally caused. Harry swears an oath over her dead body to bring her back, using whatever means are necessary. It's established that Harry and Natalie are less than fond of their parents and brother. I think that's everything important.

It's twice as long as /OotP/ and was started after /GoF/ and the epilogue was published the same day /OotP/ was released so it's basically AU.

  Gryffindor isn't what Slytherin sees in it, and the reverse is way more true than that. Lily Evans doesn't know she looks different depending where you're standing, the Blacks know exactly how they come across and like it that way, and Severus Snape isn't exactly who anyone thinks he is---least of all himself.

  *Canon Compliance* It is advised that the reader be familiar with the biography of Harry Potter written by Ms. Rowling. The reader should be aware that this seven-volume series was fact-checked by Ms. Skeeter rather than Miss Granger, and cannot be relied on in the matter of dates. Furthermore, Ms. Rowling's books are written from the point of view of the subject, and not only contain a distinctly pro-Gryffindor bias but largely confine themselves to what Mr. Potter saw, heard, assumed, and speculated.

  This is a Slytherin story, and truth is subjective.

*** SPOILERS CHAPTER 1!

Note to others: I was really excited to read this, but be warned that there's (in chapter 1) heavy, heavy bashing on Dumbledore, all the Weasleys (especially Ginny), and Harry's family. Harry seems way too OP as well. Also, here's a quote:

#+begin_quote
  'I won't go then.'

  'You have to. I want you to... even when I don't.'

  'I love you beyond the moon and back.'

  'That's not very much, I'm not that far away.' Luna replied with her usual taunt.

  'I would give you anything.'

  'Even a crumple-horned snorkack?'

  'Especially a crumple-horned snorkack'

  'Well okay then.'

  Luna stepped onto tip-toes and pressed her lips against his forehead as her hand pressed a small purse into his hand. 'Don't forget me.'

  'Impossible!'

  'I love you.'

  It was small and quiet, and the first time she had admitted it out loud, even after six years, and Harry had hoped she wouldn't have tears in her voice at the time, but it still meant the world.

  *'I love you with all my heart and being my sweetest moonchild.'* Harry too was crying, but with resolution turned and strode out towards the stone circle at the edge of the Rookery's fields. He didn't have the heart to turn back and watch Luna crying on the doorstep, but he knew she was there.

** If you have not already done so read the Denarian series by Shezza. Is a crossover with the dresden files and Harry potter. You do by no means have to have even heard of the dresden files to enjoy the fics (3 about 100-200k words each) since the aouthor does a very good job of introducing you to the small part of the dresdenverse that is in. The first 10 chapters can be abit slow but then it really takes of. This fic is by far the best I have ever read! So if you have not already go do so!

** Have you read the Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity? Not sure if they top that individually, but cumulatively they'd easily be beyond that.

Set in the U.S., but wildly AU.

Also, have you read Renegade Cause? linffn(Renegade Cause by Silens Cursor) Long, not AU initially but diverging rapidly from its premise to a very, very different version of OotP. Quite Indy!Harry, but the best of that genre that I've read.
