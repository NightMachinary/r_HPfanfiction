Anyone know of any fanfics where Dobby leads a revolt or about how they originally became servants? There is such little info in the series that I think someone could do a really good story on the subject.


** Well, I've got a tale of the end of Elf Servitude... Though not through rebellion in my story Legion

  In the 31st Century, Mordru has won. The United Planets is in collapse, EarthGov destroyed, and the Legion decimated and scattered. The Surviving Legionaries decide their only feasible way of fighting back would be to recruit a legendary Magic User. After much debate, they settle on Harry Potter... who turns out to be a bit different than his legend would suggest.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** Can't remember which one, I think it was a Warcraft crossover... Anyway, it was mentioned house elves are actually chaos demons and Merlin placed them into wizard servitude lest they destroy the world.

** In [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/index/][Blue Steel by Jeconais]], Harry allows all the elves to partake of his magic without obligation, which frees them from being servants to other wizards, and allows them the opportunity to come up with a way to stop relying on magic from wizards.

I can't come up with a title, so I suspect it's one chapter in someone's collection of one-shots and story starts, but I recall one in which Harry and Hermione tell Dobby and Winky they want to be friends without bonding them as servants, which allows the elves to reverse the situation, leaving wizards world-wide bonded as slaves to house elves. The enslavement of elves had been how the wizards ensured that they weren't wiped out by the house elves.

I recall another story where there was an actual contract that the elves made to put themselves into servitude (I don't remember the reason why they did it), but treatment of them had deteriorated over the centuries. None of the wizards remembered the existence of the contract, and they were surprised when the elves declared that the contract had been broken (I think). Again, I can't remember the title. Sorry.
