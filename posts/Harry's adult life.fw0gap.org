I'd like to read some stories where Harry lives his adult life. He can be an unspeakable, a healer, a professor, etc, etc... anything but not an Auror. Several chapters would be better, but I can also settle for one. It would be even better if he had no children and was not married to Ginny (however is optional). Thanks a lot!


** Harry becomes a professional quidditch player in linkffn(a game of style and brutality)

He becomes gringotts board member and vice minister of magic linkffn(bearings by MattD12027)

Harry is a healer linkffn(bloody but unbowed by lomonaaeren)

About 40 years old harry is magical furniture maker, Ginny has just been killed and he has been accused as one to do it. Fantastic world building and drama, pairing becomes eventually harry/Kingsley/Severus linkao3(fate is a four letter word by Philo)

  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.

  After leaving Britain to continue his education, Harry tries to bring the British Wizarding world into the 21st century. Author's note: This was written before the seventh book was published. Character-driven drama with a lot of introspection.

  HPDM slash. Nothing in Harry's life has gone the way he expected, and that includes being the mediwizard assigned to treat Lucius Malfoy. But he's Harry; he can deal with this. And he can deal with Draco Malfoy's nonsensical flirting, too.

Edit: ok no, disregard. I read the last sentence of your request. TECHNICALLY he's not married anymore, due to Ginny dying a few years earlier, but he does have kids. Still it's a great read. I still recommend reading it.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
