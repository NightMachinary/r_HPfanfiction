Hermione & Snape are colleagues at the Ministry of Magic, and eventually enter into a relationship, though neither want love, just sex. They somehow maintain this pretense through years of dating, marriage, and raising children. Idk, I just remember it was a really funny and well-written conceit, I'd love it if someone could tell me what this fic is called!
