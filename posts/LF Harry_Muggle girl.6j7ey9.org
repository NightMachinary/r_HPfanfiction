*** Agreed. More like super angsty. There was always something dark or stressful going on even when the characters were relaxing...

I don't think OP is looking for something like this. Lol

** Linkffn(5244417) takes place during the summers of Harry's years at Hogwarts. He does tell her about magic but it's not angsty from what I recall. Sadly, I don't know of any other Harry/ muggle girl stories. (Somehow I'm aware of more Percy Weasley/ muggle girl stories...)

*** I've come across this a few times now but the tags kind ofmput me off.

I'm not a big fan of Remus, which is a nice way of saying i really can't stand him, and i'm not even going to start on my opinion about Remus/Tonks.

How important are they in the story? Is it more Tonks or more Remus and are the two of them actually paired up?

**** They both play significant roles in this fic. I would say Tonks has a bigger role, but you can't really scroll past their scenes without missing some of the plot. Yes, their relationship also is featured.

Sounds like this story may not be a good fit! I think you may enjoy the Harry/OC parts but if you hate Remus and Remus/Tonks as a pairing then you may want to skip it.
