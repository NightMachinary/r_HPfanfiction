:END:
I am looking for two stories that are both drarry and are similar but they are two different stories.

1. Starts out with Harry being in prison for some reason (I don't remember) but is released. He then leaves the wizarding world and becomes a famous singer in America. The OOTP recognized one of his new songs from something that was written on the wall in his cell and eventually find Harry living in California with his twins sons, and Draco is the father. Harry and his sons come back to the U.K. to help finish off Voldemort.

2. Harry thinks that Draco cheated on him (but it was actually a set up, I think Harry walked in on Draco sleeping with someone in the leaky cauldron, but Harry didn't see who it was but it was someone who had taken polyjuice to look like Harry)and runs away, and Harry is pregnant. He moved to America, has the baby and marries a wizard (I think it was Anthony Goldstein, but it was definitely a canon character) but the husband dies so Harry and his family (I think that Remus moved to the US with Harry) move back to the U.K. Lucius figures out that Draco is the other father of Harry's child and works to get Harry and. Draco back together again.

Please let me know if anyone can help me find these stories. Thanks!
