** I enjoyed what you've written so far. In the section where she ends up in Myrtle's bathroom, it's not entirely clear from how it's written why she ends up going there because she couldn't make it all the way back to Gryffindor tower rather than using whatever's closest. Anxiety over how girls in other houses would react if they found out she was trans?

*** Thank you! I'll give it another read over and see if I can make it a little more obvious, but that's exactly it. Coming from a home where she could use the bathroom in private, to a school where the bathrooms have stalls and people around, Par's still working out what she's comfortable with and right now that's her privacy.
