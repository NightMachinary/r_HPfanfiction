Like why did both Tonks and Remus have to be their? Why not Remus and Andromeda while Tonks watches Teddy? Or vice versa?


** I get the impression that that was their original plan--- Remus went to fight and Tonks (who was barely post partem) stayed with the baby. But when the battle was starting, Tonks couldn't stand not being there and she broke the agreement.

In her defense, she WAS the only person selected for the Auror program in years, and had a better chance of making a difference than most. Though I do wish JKR had made her entrance line “I don't want my child (or any child) to grow up in a world ruled by Voldemort, I trust my mother to raise him as well as she raised me, and so I have to be here because one more skilled wand could swing the battle in Harry's favor” rather than “I can't stand not knowing about Remus.”

They were probably wrong to do what they did. But with the future of the world at stake, and their unique skill sets, they get a free pass from me.

  “Will it be Aurors who catch them?” 

  “Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it'll be the ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol - ah, Harry, this is Perkins.”
#+end_quote

Aurors are badass dark wizard hunters. There aren't many of them. Most magical law enforcement is done by people like Arthur Weasley, who we see involved in both legislation and law enforcement despite being the head poorly respected two man sub department of the DMLE.

**** I like to imagine that Aurors aren't just cops, they are literally dark wizard hunters. True dark wizards (not just criminals) must be quite rare, and so not many aurors are necessary.

** It was to show the godfather parallel between Harry/Sirius & Teddy/Harry. Story comes full circle and the War ends with an orphan with a godfather, however this time they won the war and the cycle is broken so the orphan gets a better life.

*** Honestly, it would have. Tonks is a metamorphmagus. So is her son. Of all people who could try to hide in the world, they're innately more likely to succeed at it.

There's no right answer on how parents should act in these situations, but I do think Tonks prioritized Remus over Teddy. And part of it might just be being young and fearless and very Hufflepuff.

**** It wasn't about prioritizing Remus over her son. It was about being at war and doing what she felt was necessary. For Tonks to remain at home safe while others fought and died would've been against her values. It's not like she chose to orphan her son, she didn't have hindsight to make a decision with. She acted according to her character, she made a noble decision even if it ended in tragedy.

** Yeah you shouldn't send two new parents into a battle. That's just begging to make an orphan.

But JK seemed to do character deaths via a spreadsheet - saved Arthur, better kill Remus. Percy's back, better kill George. She appears to have decided there need to be some deaths to create emotional weight, but then assigned them more based on what would cause the biggest reaction - the last of the Marauders and a fan favourite, splitting the twins up etc - without too much worry about logic or satisfying story arcs. Hence how Percy returns and then boom the wall explodes, killing Fred and leaving everyone else unharmed, conveniently right when Fred, Ron, Percy etc are all in the same hallway and right as Percy and Fred bond.
