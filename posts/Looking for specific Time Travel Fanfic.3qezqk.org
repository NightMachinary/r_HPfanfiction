Hi all,

Am looking for a specific Time Travel fanfic. All the details I remember are below:

- Is most likely H/Hr
- Harry, Hermione, Ginny and Luna travel back in time, to when Harry and Hermione were babies
- Hermione convinces her parents to take her to Harry's home
- All parents are shocked when Harry, an infant, starts talking
- Ginny and Luna are unborn spirits, and are able to perform recon missions while staying invisible
- Ginny and Luna communicate by a form of ghost writing

That's all I remember about the fic, and I'm not sure if it's completed. Also, am almost certain it was on FanFiction.net

**** Yep.. just read through the fic and, that's the one...

/Oh. Dear./ *GOD!!*.

I do *NOT* remember this being so.. /Porn-y/.. Guess my mind just took the good parts and left out the rest..

Thanks a ton lordcrimmeh, for finding this fic. Was driving me crazy not being able to find it..

Kudos..

*** I gotta say, when I saw this rec my first thought was, 'Huh, dat summary.'

Then I saw the tags. Those are certainly not the tags I would have envisioned for the story described by the OP. I thought the OP was talking about some fairly vanilla time-travel fic. How wrong I was, apparently. And now I'm all curious.

**** Yeah... It starts off kind of interesting, but turns crazy godlike Harry harem fic pretty quick.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.
