Hi! I'm looking for some good fics that involve time traveling! I'm not super picky, but one thing I need is good quality writing. Preferably, I'd like a fic that's:

- longer

- has some smut (don't @ me, I love a bit of spice in a story)

- Can be slash, het, or have genderbent characters. Whatevs. Just as long as there's a bit of smut.

- no evil Harry (or Ron or Hermione, for that matter)

- preferably not a crackfic

I would love some recs that fit these conditions, but again I'm not super picky so if you have a really good gen one or something, lmk! Only thing I seriously care about is good writing. Thanks in advance!

I'm kind of frozen on updating it because it seems too topical right now.

It has no smut though, sorry. If you want smut, my other story, The Last Pureblood Malfoy, has plenty, but that one has no time travel.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** Like a record player with a stuck needle, I have a recommendation for you, linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh)

Your criteria:

#+begin_quote

  - involve time traveling!
#+end_quote

It definitely involves time travel.

#+begin_quote

  - one thing I need is good quality writing.
#+end_quote

I think it's pretty well written, I'm not sure if the fine people at DLP agree but they're certainly welcome to their own opinions.

#+begin_quote

  - longer
#+end_quote

It's +well over 100k words+ 203k words.

#+begin_quote

  - has some smut. Can be slash, het, or have genderbent characters.
#+end_quote

There is maybe a slight amount of het smut (I honestly don't remember how explicit the scenes between Jasmine & Merlin get), and a major character is genderbent.

#+begin_quote

  - no evil Harry (or Ron or Hermione, for that matter)
#+end_quote

No canonically good character is shown to be evil. Some canon characters are mildly critiqued but it's nuanced and doesn't come anywhere close to bashing.

#+begin_quote

  - preferably not a crackfic
#+end_quote

It's definitely not a crackfic.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

** The debt of time is one of my all time favorites. The pairing is Hermione/Remus and Hermione/Sirius and she travels back in time after the war to the marauders era and grows up with them. It stays (mostly) canon-compliant.

It also does have smut in their later years. This story made me laugh and cry and cry more. It's also insanely long, about three times longer than the Order of the Phoenix.

  After a long day of fighting the final battle, Hermione was sent back in time by Snape to the Marauder era to live out her life as Alexia Potter, twin of James Potter. She was scared and tired and traumatized, and it was all she could hope that she could heal there. So, Dumbledore turns her eleven and send her to the Potter home. REWRITTEN and in progress.
