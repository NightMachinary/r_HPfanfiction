** Hmm, business, you say?

There's this story called “Business” (linkao3(1113588)), it just wouldn't feel right not to write about that one.

**** Not really, at least as far as Harry running a business is concerned.

That being said, the author of this particular story has a lot of other stories as well, and many of them are enjoyable too. I recommend getting started with her “Tumbling [...]” series of anything you are familiar with, and then proceeding with the longer stories.

I can provide links or write what I enjoyed most from her stuff if you want, but I presume that you can find her stuff with one story of hers already posted and that you now have enough stuff to entertain yourself for a while (just the “Tumbling [...]” series has 200k words combined, assuming you know all that stuff and thus will read the whole series).

  Harry Potter knows that money can give you power and influence. He has learned that from a young age on, seeing how his relatives get away with many things. And others having way much more than you do can be a problem. Thus he starts his path to cause a small revolution in its own right. No matter if Dumbledore doesn't like it. Two-shot.
