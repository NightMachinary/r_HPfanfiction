For some reason, I cannot get the idea of Umbridge being a good character out of my head. Has anyone more skilled than I at writing taken a crack at this? If there are no straight up 'Good' fics, what about ones that portray her as 'Not Awful'?


** Umbridge is the best villain ever, wouldn't want to ruin that. I'd love to read a fic from her perspective though. See how twisted her thoughts are.

****** She doesn't write the good guys as very attractive either, though. Most of the characters are described in the books as somewhere between ugly and handsome - e.g. Harry has striking eyes, but is skinny; Hermione has bushy brown hair and large front teeth; Ron is gangly and ginger.

I like that a lot, to be honest. Other than Lockhart and the Veela (who have a reason for it) there aren't any really stunning people in the story at all.

****** Tbh most characters in Harry Potter are average looking/unattractive. It's mostly the films and fanfics that make everyone sexy (and therefore people make their favorite characters sexier).

Compare canon Hermione (nerdy, bad teeth, bushy hair) with movie hermione (emma watson) or fanfic Hermione (no joke every Harry/Hermione fic makes her super attractive).

******* Not every H/Hr fic makes Hermione super attractive. But she's certainly not ugly but rather pretty, otherwise the Yule Ball would have gone differently. A problem many fics have is that they seem to assume that a boy wouldn't fall for a girl who's "just" pretty, instead of "the most beautiful girl in the entire school" (or a girl for boy who's not a demi-god in the looks department). But that's not limited to H/Hr stories.

  Following Voldemort's downfall attempting to kill Harry, the Hogwarts professors appeal to the Ministry of Magic to allow the young boy to live and grow up at Hogwarts, away from the world's dangers. He grows up unlike any other child in the Wizarding world, meeting years of students before he is allowed a wand. Now, he will meet his fellow classmates to finally learn magic.

** I can't remember what the title was but there was some sort of Harmony soul-bond fic where Harry is pretty powerful. In it, Umbridge is hyper-powerful and is some sort of ancient being(I remember that she uses some sort of ancient spell to banish a demon using "words of power"). I think it actually might have been one of the series LGreymark is working on. If anyone knows what I'm referring to, feel free to link the story.

** I've actually thought about how the Ministry and Umbridge could be sympathetic in book 5; mainly, it boils down to:

- The only evidence for Voldemort's possible return is that Cedric Diggory was killed by (as a half-decent autopsy would find out) the Killing Curse, the flaring up of the Dark Mark, Death Eater activity at the Quidditch World Cup earlier that year, and Harry's testimony...that's actually a decent amount of evidence, but only as cause for investigation, not proof.

- When Fudge comes to Hogwarts, Dumbledore immediately starts in on him that Voldemort has most definitely returned, and (this is important) immediately tries to pressure him into sending envoys to the giants, and removing the dementors from Azkaban.

- Hypothetically, when Dumbledore announces to the world that Voldemort has returned, that would be enough to discourage foreign investors from entering the British wizarding market, and might even cause some domestic businesses to flee; hence, whether or not Voldemort is back, Dumbledore's claims are damaging to the economy in themselves.

- So, it's possible, in fact potentially plausible, for Fudge/Umbridge/etc in the Ministry to believe that 'Dumbledore is using Voldemort as a bogeyman to try and push around the government, using Cedric as his 'evidence' and endangering the economy to get us to capitulate'. The headmaster forming his own combat-capable private organization (the Order of the Phoenix) can be seen in a worrying light due to this belief.

- (I suppose there's also that Fudge just doesn't want to believe that the philanthropic Lucius Malfoy and various other members of the civil service like Macnair are Death Eaters; far more likely, to him, that Dumbledore is playing on old allegations to try and sow paranoia.)

...That said, the Ministry is hardly sympathetic, owing to putting Hagrid in Azkaban without trial, putting Sirius in Azkaban without trial, trying to Kiss Sirius without trial when he escapes, and Kissing Barty Crouch Jr. without trial (or without questioning).

Umbridge could still be written as a sympathetic character, mind, if not for two things (not counting her anti-werewolf legislation); sending dementors after Harry Potter to try and silence him, and, perhaps more importantly:

#+begin_quote
  "Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident."
#+end_quote

I think that one line in particular is integral to destroying any sympathy for the Ministry, and for Umbridge; rather than investigate the one thing that could shed light on the truth either way (Cedric Diggory's death, and who his murderer was), they instead sweep it under the rug.

So, I think, Umbridge could be a 'good' character, but only if the Ministry investigates the causes of Cedric Diggory's demise.
