If anyone's interested, I'm thinking of turning [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/vlkso/lets_lay_down_our_favourite_hp_fan_fictions/][this]] thread into a google doc, organizing favorite fanfics. And I'll list summaries, ratings, etc. I'll use every fanfic listed there that provides enough info. I'll also look at some other threads, but not all (because that would take forever.)

So, if you have a fanfic you want me to add to the list, please comment with the link, short summary, rating, etc.

Might take me a few days to compile. And I'll keep adding to it.

Edit: Sorry I'm so slow! It'll be up eventually.

** Too bad I deleted my account, I could have taken credit for my thread.

I tried contacting the mods of this sub-reddit to create a few sidelinks, I haven't gotten a response yet.

Goodluck though, we all appreciate it.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The_Life_and_Times]]

Work in Progress

This is a Marauder Era fanfiction. It is about when James, Sirius and Lupin are at school. Right now it only has 34 chapters and she only updates like once every 6 months but it is still a great read! Story sticks fairly close to what you could have guessed times would be like then based on the original series by JK

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7919030/1/Resistance]]

Complete

This story is about what happens during book 7 while Harry, Ron, and Hermione are out hunting horcruxes. It is told from mostly Nevilles point of view. It's pretty much exactly what you would imagine went on while you were reading about what the trio was up to. It starts off at Bill and Fleurs wedding and ends just after the Battle of Hogwarts.

[[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/]]

3 books complete, 4th in progress

This is the James potter series, it's fantastic! Centers around Harry's first born son and his first 3 years at Hogwarts. Features old and new charecters, but the story is great. Good news, the author is working on the 4th one now!

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/16/On_the_Way_to_Greatness]]

Work in Progress

This is an alternate universe fanfiction. It's the entire series written as if Harry had been sorted into Slytherin instead, and it's amazing! I actually found that I liked this version of Harry a bit more than the one in the original series. He is just a lot more of a badass and much less of a whiny bitch. Beware though because this fanfiction is 10 chapters shy of being complete. You end after reading one chapter of year six.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledores_Army_and_the_Year_of_Darkness]]

Complete

This is another version of what happens at Hogwarts during year 7 from Nevilles POV. It is much darker than the fanfiction resistance, but I actually enjoyed the intensity of it. Very good read, it is complete with 25 chapters.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize]]

Complete

This is a completely amazing one shot about Dennis Creevey and other members of the DA and I believe some from the Order of the Phoenix. Basically Dennis takes pictures of the scars left behind from the second war, its beautiful and touching despite being around 1,600 words.

** /Copy and pasted off a different thread to save fingers/

Here are some goods ones!

Allegiance by mugglehugger

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7753649/1/Allegiance]]

When eleven-year-old Ginny Weasley is sorted into Slytherin, she is thrust into a world where the line between good and evil is blurred and where the boy she was supposed to hate becomes the man she was never supposed to love. DG, AU.

Envy and Manipulations by rabbit

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6622766/1/Envy_and_Manipulations]]

Sixteen year old Ginny Weasley has her first summer job at the Folk Hills Country Club, the most prestigious high society club in the wizarding world. When Draco Malfoy comes home from his summer internship at the Ministry of Magic things get complicated.

A Phoenix Does Not Fear the Ashes by KatyTyler

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5530828/1/A_Phoenix_Does_Not_Fear_Ashes]]

GWDM Draco joins the order, Ginny is raped. When he becomes her savior, who would have guessed that the two would become more? Or that together they would form the most badass team the Order has ever seen? A story of love, revenge, protection & sacrifice.

The Beautiful Trilogy by KatyTyler

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5920484/1/A_Beautiful_Distraction]]

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6152109/1/A_Beautiful_Lie]]

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8437138/1/A_Beautiful_Mess]]

And yet, he had still told her, every night, after they had untangled their sweaty limbs and each retreated to their corners to gather their clothing, avoiding the other's eyes, that she was nothing, meant nothing, she was merely a beautiful distraction"

That starts with A Beautiful Distraction and then moves on to A Beautiful Lie and A Beautiful Mess. It's a really interesting, incredibly poetic series of one-shots. But I thought I would explain how it's set up because the author made it kind of confusing.

** How is this going? Do you have any updates?

If you make the google doc public, I could help sort and organize it.

** One of my favourites is right now [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=241161][Pirates]] which is a OOC (think that's the right term). It's a WIP Dramoine, but the plot is good, and the characters have depth. It was the premise that drew me in initially, although I was worried it might fizzle out in the end. Needless to say, that didn't happen ;)
