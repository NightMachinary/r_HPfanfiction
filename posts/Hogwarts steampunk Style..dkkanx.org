Would magnets work in Hogwarts?


** Steampunk would make a lot of sense with magic. There's interference with electronics, but not with mechanical or hydraulical systems. Aguamenti provides infinite water. Magic fire runs without fuel and you can put it in a jar. Steam power is much more compatible with magic than any other technology.
