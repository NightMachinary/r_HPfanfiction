The Dangerverse is a series of 5 main stories (with quite a few spin offs) written by whydoyouneedtoknow on FF.net. stories in order are "living with danger", "living without danger", "dealing with danger", "facing danger", and "surpassing danger".

The story follows Gertrude "danger" granger (Hermione's older sister, an OC and the series' namesake), Remus Lupin, Aletha Freeman (another OC, I think), Sirius black, and Harry Potter and Hermione Granger.

Its a very interesting story and I've read it all through multiple times


** One of the series I recommend the most. I've read the latter stories the least because the last one was still being updated when I was reading it regularly.

** I liked the first few stories in the series, but it is getting too long and too repetitive, so I haven't managed to finish it. The first story (and everything pre-something-like-CoS) is really great and highly recommended!
