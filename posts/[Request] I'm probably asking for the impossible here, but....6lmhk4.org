...is there such a thing as a harem fic that isn't terrible? Or at least a fic that takes place in a world where harems and/or polygamy are common?

Maybe it's because I've had this little fantasy of BEING a harem girl for years... I mean, I know very well that I wouldn't enjoy being one in real life, but as a fantasy it's kind of hot. And I've seen a lot of HP fics adversising themselves as "harem fics" and I'm always curious about them... and I start reading in the hope that perhaps THIS time it's going to be different... but it never is. Bad writing, bad characterisation, usually the entire thing is Superpowered!Harry who just gets all the girls Because He's That Cool And Special, but to me as a (female) reader he just comes comes across as annoying and overbearing and I have no idea why all these girls would agree to be with someone like that in the first place.

The closest thing I've found to a harem fic that was actually good was the Firebird trilogy. And that turned out not to be very good at all... it started out as very interesting, but ended up as a terrible and borderline unreadable mess. But at least that fic tried to do something more with its harem set-up, even if it didn't quite work.

So... ARE there any harem fics that aren't completely awful? Doesn't have to be Harry with the harem... in fact, it's a bonus if it ISN'T. Doesn't have to be anything like a perfect romance. I'm fine with just about any pairing, tone, setting or interpretation of the canon world. Just... a harem fic that doesn't totally suck.

And isn't the Firebird Trilogy.

Does that even exist?


** I dislike harems for the two paths they tend to follow:

1. *Harem girls are all the same.* In this option, each harem girl is, on a meta-level, substitutable with each other because their personalities are all the same. It makes things easy for the writer - no complex social dynamics needed - but it also makes things boring for us because the only relationships are =[Hary X GENERIC GIRL] * Harem_Size=.
2. *Harem girls are unique characters.* In this option, the author treats each character /as/ a character, with a fully fleshed-out personality. But this way, for a harem of size N, including Harry, there are N-pick-2 relationships (=N!/((N-2)!*2!)=, which means for a harem of 4 girls plus Harry, there are 10 relationships to consider and each additional member radically increases that size. Either the plot utterly grinds to a halt as the author tries to give time to all these girls, or their relationship is utterly glossed over.

Fundamentally, if you want plot, you get a crappy romance. If you want romance, you get a crappy plot. At the end of the day, it's a tyranny of numbers and time.

*** This is also the reason why trios and duos are so common in fiction in general.

For a duo the reader has a single relationship to follow, for a trio three.

And if you want a quartet it's suddenly 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 relationships to keep track of.

--------------

Also, I think you are +wrong+ unnecessarily complex with your formula: If you have a harem consisting of n characters with f(n) relationships, the (n+1)th character would add n new relationships (one with each existing member), so f(n+1) = f(n) + n which is quite obvious and doesn't need faculties. :)

Edit: In the image: f(5) = 10, obviously. Not being able to do 6+4 or count to 10 is emberassing.

**** Yours is the recersive formula, while mine is the combination formula =C(N,K)= (a.k.a. N pick K) where K is the number of people in a combination (in my case, two). For all values N, =C(N,2)=N!/((N-2)!2!) = F(N) = N+F(N-1)=.

Of course, since K is fixed, the combination formula can be simplified to =C(N,2)=N*(N-1)/2= --- that is, for each harem member, there are N-1 partners, then divided by 2 to prevent double-counting.

This is why linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches) is so bloated and (at times) super slow. And even then, not everyone interacts with everyone else.

It has a ton of issues, but it's the best harem fic imo simply due to the weight it gives the relationships between the girls.

But i think Harry is popular precisely because he is so bland. He's the reader-substitute character, the one that you experience the wizarding world through and the one you're meant to identify with. That's why you see so many "Harry becomes super-powerful" stories, and not all that many stories where Ron or Neville or Ernie Macmillan become super-powerful, even if all three of them are more interesting, personality-wise.

As for Hermione, she's the main female character... and Fleur, Tonks and Bellatrix are hot, or at least the fanbase has decided that they're hot. ;)

***** Harem is definitely a relic from very patriarchal societies, where male's physical strength offers significant competitive advantages. It's definitely beneficial for producing lots of descendants from the dominant male, and I believe anthropoids such as chimpanzees and gorillas have similar social structures in their clans. Many apex predators, especially the lions, are living in harems too.

In magical societies, where magical power overwhelmingly trumped physical strength, males no longer had significant advantages over females. Hogwarts were founded by both genders who were seemingly on equal footings. Female British Ministers of Magic appeared on stage in 1798, almost two centuries before the first Muggle woman was elected the PM in 1980. I have a hard time imagining harems in a society where both genders were almost equally powerful.

I know perfectly well that harems have all sorts of stigmas tied to them, and are highly implausible for the canon world as-is. I'm also very well aware that most harem fics suck. That was kind of why I wanted to ask people if there were some that didn't; some that could actually take the concept and make it work on a story level if nothing else.
