Has anyone got stories where Harry (or others) keep Dumbledore disarmed, under house arrest, and incommunicado "for his own safety"?

Much like Harry was every single summer..


** Linkffn(blood of the Phoenix) is a decent story where Harry forms his own group and defeats Voldemort with next to no help from dumbledore and he has no idea what is actually going on.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

*** Basically Dumbledore in a retirement home.

Which probably will overwhelmingly be bashing.

Rorschach's blot has an omake in Hermione the Harem Girl, The rune stone path has a similar idea, and we'll I can't really think of anything else.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
