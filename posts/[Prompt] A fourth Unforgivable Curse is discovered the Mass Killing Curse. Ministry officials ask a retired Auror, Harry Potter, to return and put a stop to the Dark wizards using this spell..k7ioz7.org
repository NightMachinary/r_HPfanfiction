*** That could great. Then the only ones who would know about it would be his friends. So he has to end up investigating Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny etc. Could turn into a tense thriller/ whodunnit

** Mass as in killing a lot of people, or Mass as in killing the concept of inertia and resistance to applied force?

Could be two very, very different stories in that one word. :D

*** Temporary inertial mass killing charm would be very interesting. Imagine a simple machine moving a piston back and forth, with a rune at each end that removes or adds inertial mass depending on which direction it's moving in. Effectively the mechanism would break conservation of momentum, providing a force without an equal and opposite force, F=2fvΔm with f the frequency, v the velocity when the mass change is applied and Δm the amount of mass that is added or removed. Now imagine a bunch of these machines running at 1000 RPM, it'd produce a similar amount of thrust as a rocket engine. Could make it very easy to build spaceships. Start mining asteroids for gold, who needs a Philosopher's Stone?

And of course it it falls into the wrong hands, the charm would make it significantly easier to put a thousand ton asteroid on a collision course with your enemy's house at a significant percentage of the speed of light. Accelerate at 1g for a few days, then give the asteroid its mass back, and the result makes the Tsar Bomba look like child's play.

Now that I think about it, inertial mass killing would be significantly more dangerous than a curse that kills an entire crowd. At least a crowd killing curse can't be used to wreck an entire planet. But the inner had it coming, milowda.

** "Did you finally discover who was behind all of this Potter?" Demanded the Minister of Magic.\\
"Yeah, the Ministry." Began Harry. "Do-"\\
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE MINISTRY!"\\
"Well, if you would let me finish... Do you remember that law that was enacted five years after Voldemort died? That required everybody to swear an unbreakable vow to not commit treason, sedition, become a dark lord, blah blah blah."\\
"Yeah, but how does that explain how it affects large groups of people and seems to have a delayed reaction?"\\
"It was one of the asinine laws Umbridge passed during the second war that defined sedition. She included THINKING about it. All it takes is one person to call whomever is responsible a monster, or thinking about getting revenge. They die. Someone else sees them die. It keeps spreading. Sometimes there are enough vows being broken in an area that the magic becomes unstable, hurting and killing even more people... Just think, this is all because you guys didn't want to repeal that law because it would remove more of your power. I warned you that this was a possible outcome. But you ignored me, as per usual. Why do you think I retired? You kept ignoring me. And now everybody else is paying for your mistakes... Dumbasses..."\\
"Then why aren't you affected by it?"\\
"Didn't you hear? I'm a Potter! The Potters 'are an upstanding family!' Which makes me exempt..."

** Plot twist: It's not a curse, but an alchemical transformation. Nitrogen to carbon monoxide, simply moving a proton and a neutron from one atom to the other in each molecule. N^{14} 2 -> C^{12} O^{16} .

Colorless, odorless, tasteless, wrecks your hemoglobin.
