Is it just me or are marauder nicknames in fan fiction always terrible?

In canon Padfoot, Wormtail, and Prongs, all give away characteristics of the animagus' morph, but only don't actually give the animal away, just toe the line nicely. In fanon the nicknames never seem to fit, and usually are stupid sounding enough that I facepalm unintentionally.

*** You know what would've been a cool Marauder name for Harry if he had a bird form? Something like Roughbeak, or that jazz. Most of the names were supposed to be funny, not spooky edgy words like Talon, and BLACKCLAW. C'mon, it's a group of pranksters.

**** Roughbeak is better than most attempts, but I don't really like how the "beak" part immediately makes you think of birds. All the canon marauder names are pretty subtle with their animal references. Something with "plume" or "down" in it would probably be obscured enough to work better.

*** To make it fit with the others, you need something that 1) references some aspect of the animagus form, 2) could /also/ be a mobster from a noir detective story, and 3) is not excessively "cool" (the other mauraders wouldn't have it).

For example, a snake could be Forktongue, or a lion could be Shaggy. For the lion, the underwhelming nickname balances out the over-the-top-ness of a lion animagus form. I don't know if it's possible to balance a magical creature or a dinosaur, so if you do that, maybe don't have a marauder nickname, or lean in to it.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
