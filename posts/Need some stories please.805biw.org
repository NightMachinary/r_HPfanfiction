Going to be on an 18 hour bus ride later today and would like to download a couple stories to read! No male slash please, just not into it I'm one of those that can't stand Draco/Hermione so please no stories with those two. Would prefer Harry as main character. Romance is a huge plus for me. Doesn't matter who the female is, multi is ok too, not a fan of Ginny but ok with her if in a Multi relationship. No Fem!Harry. Would prefer long stories. OP Harry is ok too. Rated T or higher please! I know that's a broad area of stories, so what are your favorites?

Probably the newest story I have read.

Pretty decent overall, there is going to be romance, but the story is only barely in second year, so no major presence.

300,000 some words and only in second year, that may or may not be a deal breaker for you.

Fairly AU, a lot of canon plots points are pretty much non existent.

Harry is raised by Arcturus Black and sorted into Slytherin.

Oh, the age of enrollment into Hogwarts was changed from 11 to 14 I think. Not something I was super excited about, but it is fine. Made the dialogue a bit more believable too.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

*** Thanks! I do have this on my currently reading list, usually this would be a deal breaker for me like you say, but I was reading this after the first couple chapters. So at this point I'm just reading it as they update. Thank you though!

** "Call Me" is a very refreshing take on the "post-OotP brooding Harry" which shows teenagers acting as teenagers. Summer after the fifth year Harry/Lisa Turpin.

"The Favour" is a postwar fic where Harry spends some time with Mrs Malfoy as a favour for Draco. Harry/Narcissa.

"Ice Princess" is a completely different take on the Daphne Greengrass character and features a Harry who does what is smart during the fifth year.

  Harry agrees to do a favour for Draco Malfoy - with delightful results for Draco's mother. Guilty pleasure Harrissa in two acts.

  A found phone number, the decision to tale a risk. What does a different summer of 96 hold for Harry? A tale of light romance. No secret training no major angst. For once Harry meets someone normal. Now completed. A tale of one summer.

  Building a romance from a fanon cliche turned on its head.
