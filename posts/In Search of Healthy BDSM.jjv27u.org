First of all, mobile, so sorry for formating and grammar. Also sorry as I couldnt find an NSFW tag, so hopefully it auto applies, if not, sorry mods

Second, this isnt me moralizing, what people get off to is their own business.

What Im looking for is a fic with a healthy BDSM or other kink relationship. I've seen loads of fics where there is a dom and a sub, and initially both are careful and sane. However rapidly the dom forgets that the sub is a person and begins to casually disregard their agency and emotions in a way that makes me mildly ill, just assuming their sub is okay with anything. Again, not moralizing, but I dont like it myself.

Things can get kinky, in my case the kinkier the better, get me a dom who uses their sub as a footstool or makes them write their homework for them for all I care. But afterwards the dom needs to acknowledge the sub and reassure them. They need to check in and stay healthy, and the sub should reassure in return, and it needs to keep happening, even if its only mentioned.

I know its alot, but any fics like that?

** For all your Drarry needs I direct you to "Little Prince, Kneel" by DragonGirl87.

Little Prince is easily one of the healthiest relationships I've seen in fic period let alone BDSM ones. It is also now a series and the story they weave about the relationship of Harry and Draco post Wizarding War is interesting because it gives both characters room to grow individually and also gives us a BDSM relationship where one partner is being introduced to the world and safe practice. Plus Teddy is always adorable and a welcome addition, even as a background character!

Happy reading!

  Almost immediately after the war, Harry Potter took his godson and Andromeda and left England behind. He returned five, nearly six, years later; changed, healed, and a very different man altogether. Now an extremely handsome bachelor in his late twenties, and with a promising career at the Ministry, he suddenly finds his life turned upside down after unexpectedly bumping into his former school nemesis, Draco Malfoy, Prosecutor Extraordinaire.Is Harry going to be able to stay away from Draco? Does he even want to? And exactly how will Draco react once he discovers how the Saviour prefers to spend his free time?

  Friends. If they were asked to describe their relationship in one word, they would pick friends. Lovers. Soulmates. Deeply damaged people who had somehow found redemption in each other. They were all of that, and much more. But they had always been, and always would be Friends.Post-War. No bashing. Harmony.Disclaimer: I do not own any of the characters, nor am I aiming to profit off of this story. This is simply a tribute to one of my favourite ships in one of my favourite fandoms!

** I am conflicted about â€œBecoming Harriet by Teaoâ€œ linkao3(4876630). I still believe it is one of the best fem!Harry stories around, and although I generally don't object to hormonally teenagers (of relatively safe age) behave as ones (and I was just yesterday kicked out of [[/r/HarryandGinny]] for it), there is a problem in this story that the smut clashes with the story, which is there. It is like the author couldn't decide whether he writes a smut or good story which is hidden there. And yes, there is BDSM involved, but nothing crazy, that even I (who thoroughly don't like the practice) was able to swallow it as authentic.

Edit: Unfortunately I haven't been in here in ages, so could get the bot to work properly, sorry!

I'm far from knowledgeable on the topic, but I thought this was a brilliant read and represented a good healthy relationship

Edit 2: guess the bot did work ðŸ™ˆðŸ˜‚
