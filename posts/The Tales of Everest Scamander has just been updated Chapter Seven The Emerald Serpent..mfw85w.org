New Chapter of The Tales of Everest is Out Now!

Chapter Seven: The Emerald Serpent.

This is the very exciting chapter where Everest gets her wand.

For those who have not yet read this story let me tell you a bit about it.

My name is Janey and I am the author of a book called The Tales of Everest Scamander. It is a teen rated fanfiction, however it does have general triggers for abuse. Future pairings will be DracoxOC and FredxOC.

This story is about a young girl who was born into the Scamander family during the time of Harry Potter. Inheriting the legilimens ability, her Grandparents decided it was best to send her off to America to live with Queenie. As time passes the young Everest follows her natural path to attend Ilvermorny. Everest thrives there, but due to dark and terrifying circumstances she must transfer to Hogwarts. At her new school she must face her own darkness, along with the great danger that is to come.

Let's go on an adventure together!
