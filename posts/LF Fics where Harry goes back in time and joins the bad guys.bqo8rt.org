Maybe Dumbledore was an uber manipulator andVoldemort is a nicer choice. Maybe muggles were jerks and Harry wants to help eradicate them. Maybe he's just bored with living the good life and wants to be naughty. Whatever his reason, Harry decides to go back in time but rather than try to make things go better than they did in canon, he wants them to go “worse”.

OP!Harry, Dark!Harry (duh), bashing, slash and crossovers fine. Please no mpreg, pottercest, harems, gender bending or smut/romance-centric plots. Thank you!


** What I would like, within this context, is crazy ass Harry wanting to murder baby Harry just to see if he could.

  In the depths of the Ministry, there is a cell for the world's most dangerous man... and he wants out. Read warnings. No slash.

** Hmm...I remember seeing a fic years ago where Harry was cast back in time by one of Voldemort's spells, to his first war. He ends up joining the Death Eaters as a spy, later going to Atlantis to learn more magic after the war, and then when Voldemort comes back, he teaches him the time-magic spell that Voldy used on his past self in the first place.
