With so many stories out there for Harry Potter, I find that we get the same basic kind of plotlines over and over again.

Harry being raised by Severus Snape, Harry ending up in Slytherin, The whole Wrong Boy Who Lived Trope, Harry or another character going back into the past, Marriage Law fics, Harry is Lord Potter-Malfoy-Gryffindor, and other stories like that.

So, I'm curious, what's a story with a unique, different or just interesting idea, that you really enjoyed?

Harry DOES NOT have to be the main character. It can be ANY ERA once so ever.

To make things more fair, it can have any pairings, it can be as canon as possible or as AU as possible.

I'd like for it to be completed, but if not, that's fine as well.

Bonus points if Harry is in the story, but is not the main character. I know people generally like to read stories centered fully on Harry Potter himself, but sometimes it's nice focusing on other characters. Although this IS NOT mandatory.

Bonus again if it is in fact another ERA. Although if it's in the Marauder's Era I'd like Peter Pettigrew to be used more, then he normally is in fanfiction, and for the rivalry between the Marauders and Snape not to get too out of hand, if possible.

I'd also rather not have character bashing, character bashing takes me out of the story, now characters hating another character is fine, but the author going out of their way to bash that character is normally a no go for me.


** In no particular order, here are some of the more unique stories I've read:

linkffn(2857962) - Browncoat, Green Eyes takes place in the 26th century and has some interesting things to say about the nature of magic. Features a time displaced 154 year old Harry and the cast of Firefy. Knowledge of Firefly isn't required, though I'd recommend it because it's great. (If you want a TL:DR introduction, watch the movie called Serenity or LMK and I can give you a summary.) The rest are in a scattered order, but this is absolutely number one.

linkao3(15861804) - Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider is an alternative arc to the novels with Petunia working as a badass squib curse breaker for Gringotts. I'd argue that this is Starfox's best work, and I'll fight anyone who disagrees lol. This is almost exclusively from Petunia's POV, and is an AU from whole cloth - it doesn't follow stations of canon. If you found things like Divided and Entwined plodding, give this a shot instead: I found it a /much/ easier and enjoyable read.

linkao3(4629198) - Say A Prayer is the first installment of the Mischief's Heir series, clocking in at 450k -ish words. Eventually turns into a Wizarding space race, and says some interesting things about the various alien races in the MCU. The first fic is a bit rough, because you aren't sure if its bashing or if flaws are just turned up to eleven in the name of ridiculousness/crack humour... but the characters do eventually grow up and it goes away. Try to muddle through though, its toned down a lot by part two and the payoff is worth it. A crossover, but doesn't require anything beyond passive knowledge of the MCU.

linkffn(3503388) - The Birth of a Phoenix. Sorta WBWL, but not really... it's not the point of the story. Where do phoenixes come from, anyway?

linkffn(12005496) - The Elvenqueen. Crossover with... pretty much all of Tolkien's work. A little weird at the beginning, but a fantastic finale that'll really make you wonder. Being a Tolkien nerd would be helpful, but passive knowledge of the LoTR and Hobbit franchises works too.

linkffn(9783012) - Reign of the Serpent *incomplete/abandoned* - Even with it being abandoned, it's over 200k words and one of the most unique and interesting AUs around. I wish this would update lol.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Petunia Evans might not have been a witch, but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. As a squib, Dr Evans found her niche: Discovering and exploring tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew as a single aunt.

** Oh man do I have a long list for you! I love AUs, secondary characters, character study fics, and dislike bashing.

My first two recs won't work with the bot, so I'll put them first. They are also old fics and were written before the series was finished! Despite that they hold up really well, and I highly recommend them! [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2339&chapno=1]] and [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2681&chapno=1]]

*Shifts* and *Shades* by Fernwithy are Remus/Tonks fics from their POVs and are about what the Order was up to during OotP and HBP. Their summaries are-

#+begin_quote
  During the year of "Order of the Phoenix," Remus Lupin is assigned to protect Dudley Dursley by posing as a teacher at Smeltings.

  With the wizarding world at war, Nymphadora Tonks and Remus Lupin find themselves separated and facing a world with no masks left to hide behind. Alternative point of view of Half-Blood Prince; sequel to Shifts.
#+end_quote

linkao3(1038392) *Teddy Lupin and the Forest Guard* is essentially a sequel to Shifts and Shades. It's the first in a four part series about Teddy's time at Hogwarts and the growing pains of the Wizarding World post war. IMO this an excellent series, though heads up its old enough that it doesn't match up with info from Pottermore, so Teddy is in Gryffindor, not Hufflepuff.

linkao3(14074770) *In the language of flowers* is one of my favorite fics, where Petunia is a witch and Lily is a muggle. If you want something completely different from tropey fics, here you go.

linkao3(1439872) *Broken pieces make a man* is about Bill's decision to join the Order and his memories of the First War.

linkao3(5147618) *Eleven Up* is about a study that follows six muggleborn students during the Second War.

linkao3(9484514) *repeated a thousand times in golden ink* is a oneshot about Luna, her art, and her friends.

linkao3(9636572) *we don't know what happened to anyone else* is about George and Andromeda grieving after the war.

linkao3(5986366) *Face Death in the Hope* where Harry time travels, saves Regulus from the inferi and they go about destroying horcruxes two decades early.

linkao3(11914698) *renascienta: from the ashes* is the first in a regularly updated series about Regulus who did not die and instead hid in France until Voldemort is resurrected. One of my fave fics.

linkao3(7549384) *Sunshine In My Eyes* where Lily and Petunia are raised by Minerva McGonagall.

linkao3(11344203) *The Dog You Feed* is about the summer Sirius runs away from home and how he ends up at Lily's Great Aunt's home. It's part of a series, but I think it stands alone, though definitely check out the rest if you like this one.

linkao3(9042050) *82 Years* is a dark AU where Ariana never died.

linkao3(10774779) *Susan, Afterwards* is a oneshot crossover with Chronicles of Narnia where Susan is Lily's and Petunia's mother.

linkao3(4669313) *burning brightly* is basically a long character study about Luna, her family, and three times she bought a wand from Ollivander.

linkao3(12424344) *Grey Space* is an AU where Hogwarts doesn't start until 14, so Harry spends 3 years at Stonewall.

linkao3(16586783) *dear forgiveness i saved a plate for you* is about Dumbledore's appointments with a muggle therapist in the 1920s.

linkao3(15735828) *La Magique etude du Bonheur* is the first fic in a series where Regulus is sorted into Ravenclaw.

linkao3(15465966) *The Second String* is another AU where Harry can't produce a patronus when he and Dudley are attacked and the dementor displaces his soul to another time. It's incomplete but updated regularly.

linkao3(20097676) *My Sun Sets to Rise* where Sirius has a preview of other realities after he falls through the Veil.

linkao3(6623293) *Realignment* is POV of Tom Riddle while he's at Hogwarts during Grindelwald's war, except some unknown madman is trying to kill him.

linkao3(235547) *The Prisoner's Remorse* where Dumbledore gets Remus a job at Nurmengard after the first war.

linkao3(16703788) *our endless numbered days* is a oneshot about Dumbledore and Grindlewald's relationship over the years.

linkao3(5164526) *Finally Found My Hallelujah* is a big AU where there's no Voldemort, Sirius is a Slytherin, and Remus is a wedding planner arranging Sirius' wedding. The pairing is Wolfstar.

linkao3(9657848) *Professor Black* is an AU where Regulus starts teaching History of Magic in Harry's second year.

Edit-Splitting this in half even though I counted 33, not 60...

  Lily remembered her sister, how there had been a time she was curious and delighted about magic, before it slowly sank in that she could look and not touch.The last thing Petunia had said to Lily before she died was a chilly goodbye, ending a holiday dinner where they'd had a shrieking row in the entryway. Petunia had said 'freak' and Lily had hissed 'better than this, better than this being my whole fucking world, Tune, do you even see yourself, are you happy--'And now here was Dudley Vernon Dursley fussing himself to sleep as Lily walked the halls of the Godric's Hollow house. His tiny soft hands with their tiny soft fingernails curled under her chin, the same way Harry's always had.She passed James, who was gently bouncing his way up the hall the opposite way. "I think he's asleep," James mouthed over Harry's tousled head. His hair was the same mess, his head bent down as he peered at his sleeping son.Lily stopped where she stood, her nephew heavy on her chest, her husband smiling, her sister buried. "James," she said. "How are we going to do this?"

  It is the night before Petunia Evans' wedding. As she stares at herself in the mirror, she is satisfied with her appearance. The dress is perfect, cleverly cut to give her curves, and she looks like a dream. Yes, the dress is perfection ... but what of the veil? She has promised Vernon and his formidable mother that she will wear the Dursley veil. It is an antique. A family heirloom. It is hideous. What she needs is a miracle to rid her of the ugly thing ... or perhaps a touch of magic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727911/1][Black Sky]] - has completed it's Harry Potter arc a long time ago, the things I like about this one is the writing style and it being a stomp. Heck I find it hard to explain the "interesting ideas" I feel qualify this one to be recommended here, I guess it can be boiled down to interesting magic stuff (they discover SoulFire^{Flames from /Katekyo Hitman Reborn!/}, sentient-Family Magic is a thing and so on), I also enjoy that Dumbledore is simply old and set in his way and a bit senile^{or whatever one would call it} as a reason for ineffective manipulative!dumbledore.

** I still love linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) for its crazy AUness. It was started before OotP and abandoned before HBP, so it takes the end of the canon story in an entirely different direction, adds an entirety new dimension to dueling, and features my favorite "Power He Knows Not", bar none. It doesn't really feel like a Harry Potter story, as much as a story set in the HP universe, if that makes sense?

** Some of my absolute favourite fics are those that do things differently, in some cases very very differently, so in no particular order :

Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus : linkffn(9911469) is a journey in absurdity, but there's consistent themes it uses that aren't just weird things for the sake of being weird. It's one of my all time favourites, and if you enjoy it (and the hundred side-fics and spin-offs) The Carnivorous Muffin's other fics are also amazing.

Horry Patter and the Philologer's Stone : linkffn(12717474) is sadly one of those fics the author probably knew a majority of people will skip over just looking at the title, but it's magic system and sheer uniqueness makes it one I highly recommend if you want something new. It is a bit difficult to read because every name is... off, but that's by design too.

Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone : linkffn(7287278) was just a great adventure/fantasy fic with a lot of great writing and a unique setting.

Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue : linkffn(8034380) is a little-known, well written fic that I recommend you try and that's all I'll say, though it's not quite as out there as the others on this list.

Ectomancer : linkffn(4563439) is an old classic, sadly abandoned but still worth the read, though it will leave you wishing there was more.

Then there's a few little-known fics doing some different plot lines but not really "different" as the earlier group was:

My Life as a Teenage Gladiator : linkffn(13387005) is a great ongoing fic featuring Lavender Brown as Triwizard Champion.

Harry the Blood Demon : linkffn(12410115) is short and abandoned, but still unique enough that I think it's worth a read.

Innocence and Roses : linkffn(5136938) is short, complete, Luna-centric and just great.

Billywigs : linkffn(2668843) is a fun little (complete) Marauders era fic.

Becoming Neville : linkffn(2736892) is an absolutely fantastic fic and the best Neville-centric fic (maybe the only one too) I've read.

And lastly there's Fate : linkffn(13170637) a fic that's gone on my personal top 5 list, it's Ron-centric, Slytherin!Ron that works, and in my opinion the best fic in the fandom for it's side-plots and pacing, wherever else it may be lacking.

There's also those quite popular fics most people have probably read but are still amazing and do something different, so just off the top of my head : linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle; Hogwarts Battle School; Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past; Hermione Granger, Demonologist; Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them; Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) and a lot more but oh well you'll find those all over.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them.

Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

linkffn(8096183) - Harry Potter and the Natural 20 - quite a lot of interesting ideas when merging HP and DnD.

linkffn(4025300) - Reverse - The basic premise is that light magic users are the evil ones and they own enslaved "house-wizards" from the dark families. TMR is leading a rebellion.

linkffn(4379372) - Ruthless Revenge is a one-shot based on a pretty interesting idea. Won't spoil it here, though.

[[http://hpmor.com]] - HPMOR has a lot of interesting ideas in there, mostly about experimenting with magic.
