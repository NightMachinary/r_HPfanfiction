I have already read Prince of Slytherin, Antithesis, Too Young to Die.

I am not interested in Saving Connor because I don't like DM/HP.

Any good WBWL stories? Preferably with a twist to the trope?


** Not really much of a twist, but I like the Sarcasm and Slytherin series. It's in the fifth book so far. I don't remember if it's NBWL or WBWL though.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

*** What is "NBWL"? Does the "N" stand for "Neville", "No" or "Not"?

Sarcasm and Slytherin is currently maintaining the mystery about whether "The Boy Who Lived" is Harry or his brother. So far there are hints that could go either way.

**** Usually "Not Boy-Who-Lived" I think, though upon reflection it might be used more for when there is no boy-who-lived rather than when he's just not. If you want Neville as the boy-who-lived it's usually written BWL!Neville.

** There's

linkao3(14462256) Has two girls instead of two boys

linkao3(13521369) Has dimension travel in it, although a lot of the fic is still shrouded in mystery, and it definitely has some bad parts. Based of I'm Still Here

linkao3(5058703) Both Harry & the WBWL have time traveled in this one

linkao3(2118546) A one-shot, both Harry and his twin are mad at Dumbledore

linkffn(13071966) A happier fanfic, which is also a one-shot

linkffn(12852781) A crack one-shot with WBWL.

  Karma is real. It's a lesson that many have to learn the hard way. James and Lily Potter made the biggest mistake of their lives. The daughter they abandoned was more than they thought, and she becomes everything they wanted her twin to be. Belladonna Potter has her own plans for her future and no one will stand in her way. Hard work forever pays. A/N: Fem!Harry, Wrong-GWL, Tomarry.

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

  It turns out that treating your son like garbage for fourteen years because you preferred his more famous brother is pretty damn low. And pretty damn stupid when he turns out to have been the Chosen One after all. What's more? His twin isn't too impressed with you, either.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
