I'd like to read a story that involves people eating at KFC in the Wizarding World. I don't care what characters are in the story or what the plot is about, I would just like to see story that involves KFC.

I LOVE me some KFC and I'm absolutely sure that people in the wizarding world eat at KFC and love it too.

** One day Harry watched his best friend eating chicken at lunch and said “Hey Ron, have you ever been to KFC?”

“No. What's that?”

“We'll go tomorrow.”

Ron Weasley was never seen again. Legend says if you time it right you can see the flash of red hair when fresh chicken comes out.

*** A properly accurate fic featuring fried chicken in Britain would see Harry visiting one of the many quality chicken shop establishments in London, such as Perfect Fried Chicken, king Fried Chicken, finger licking Chicken, etc. All greasy and on the border of being shut down for hygiene reasons, but an important part of London living.

***** I'm intrigued to try it in America then because here it is overpriced shit.

For anyone who is interested in the cultural significance of chicken shops, last year a 1e year old boy went viral with his YouTube channel reviewing every chicken shop in north London. It's hilarious and I would recommend watching it to see the real london.

****** I don't recall seeing a lot of chicken shops when we were in London in 2016. Tons of Pizza Express, tho! We found Tortilla to be surprisingly good.

I was surprised to learn that KFC has become /the/ meal to get for Christmas in Japan.

******** Nice. We were staying in the Bloomsbury district right by the British Museum, so a bit touristy. We stayed there because it was walking distance from the Cursed Child. Funny story---on the way back from the first night of the play, a spare-changer complimented my boots!

********** You know, I did enjoy the play. I know there are so many quibbles with it and overall, I don't think it meshes too well with the established HP canon, but there was something /magical/ about having characters that I have loved for so long living and breathing right in front of me. When Jamie came out on that stage, I thought to myself, /"Harry!"/ and I was all in. My husband and I absolutely loved the Anthony Boyle as Scorpius and he pretty much steals the show. The stage effects were very well done and I still don't know how they managed a couple of them.

I deliberately kept myself ignorant of the story until I saw it, so it was all new to me and I really think that's the best way to do it. I never in my life thought I would get the opportunity to see a smash play with the original cast and by a complete stroke of luck, I was able to.

I loved being in London since the last time I was there was in 2003 with my BFF and that trip didn't go very well--we ended up not speaking for a year. We spent a day with a good friend just walking around. We went from our hotel (Montague on the Garden) down to Trafalgar Square, had coffee at St Martin In The Fields, went to the National Gallery where I got to see Van Gogh's Sunflowers and The Portrait of Arnolfini (my favorite ever) and I even tried to get up on one of Lord Nelson's lions. (Many embarrassing pics of my husband pushing my ass exist.) We went by the Charing Cross, down to the Horseguards, the Eye--just taking all of it in and I've been able to integrate some of those experiences into my writing.

On that trip we did 3 nights in Edinburgh and we have to go back and spend at least a whole week.
