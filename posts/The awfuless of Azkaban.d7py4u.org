The most obvious factor when someone talks about Azkaban is the dementors, they basically drain you of all your happy thoughts and leave nothing there but the most awful, negative, saddest and humiliating thoughts your life has given you. Sirius said that the prisoners were never quiet at first, always screaming but later got 'quiet' unless when they shriek in their sleep, which also implies no escape in your sleep as well, nightmares also seem to be induced by dementors. Most prisoners stop eating at the end, committing suicide. Sirius said that the dementors got excited, and clumped around the prisoner. Imagine dying with multiple dementors around you, happy at your misery. As you die the only thing that you're thinking of is your worst memories. What an awful way to go.

Then there's the fact that there's no medical aid. Mrs Crouch under the guise of her son, wasn't treated when she got sick and she eventually died because of it. You have severe and life threatening pneumonia? Well good luck chap, it's not within our control since there are only dementors to manage you on this island. The prisoners are severely malnourished, Sirius looks like a corpse or a vampire and is completely unrecognisable by the time he gets out. Harry literally describes him as a different person. Bellatrix and Sirius have 'skull like' faces. Their thinness is so much that they look like skeletons. There seems to be also no personal hygiene at all, Sirius's teeth were completely yellow and rotting (dunno about the others). His hair is described as filthy and even in his mugshots he's thin af and has hair till his elbows. Azkaban literally starves it's prisoners.

In addition to being surrounded by dementors with constant negative effects like feeling cold, hearing voices of your worst possible memories, you are also completely isolated from the rest of the world in the middle of the North sea. There aren't even any human guards and some prisoners like Sirius are in solitary confinement. It's very possible that the only face people such as him saw were like those of Fudge in his 'annual inspections'. Why are there even inspections in the first place if you aren't going to improve it.

Sirius was so maltreated, he jumps at being called by his freaking name or a formal address. He's been so abused, it's something very foreign to be referred to as 'Mr'. They deprive them of any dignity and respect at all.

Sure, one could argue that people like the Lestranges and Dolohov entirely deserve it but what about the other prisoners like Mundungus Fletcher? Sure he's morally reprehensible but he doesn't deserve all of this...

I find it entirely plausible that Azkaban doesn't even have beds. Just sleep on the stone floor and I wouldn't be shocked. Chains that bind the prisoners even when they scream and thrash in their sleeps? Sure, why are you even surprised.

The dementors weren't even the worst thing in Azkaban, as per Pottermore. I wonder what other shit is hidden in there.

Sure.

But you can't have your cake and eat it too. Either he's a maladjusted, abused child, or he's a relatively normal kid that doesn't like his relatives.

Pick one, and stick with it.

But don't write him as a normal - if bullied - kid, then turn around and say he's had a /uniquely/ traumatic past... As if memories of getting bullied in school and doing all the chores will make you faint, when there are people who have experienced much worse, and don't.

Then again, asking for consistency from Rowling would be asking too much.

***** Harry was a toddler and should have no memory from that day. The power of the dementors is such that he remembers the exact words James and Lily said as they were dying, even the rush of the spell. He hears Lily screaming. He hears James shouting to them. I think it's implied that being around a dementor produces a feeling stronger than a memory, more like a flashback.

Being dropped in the moment of your parent's murder is going to go pretty high up on anyone's list of oh shit moments, child or not.

***** Personally I like the fanon idea that Harry is more susceptible because of the horcrux inside him. I've read some fics in which Harry's memory of his mother's death is actually the worst memory of the horcrux. In other fics, the dementors are more attracted to Harry because they sense the little extra bit of soul inside him.

As Harry put it in "No Glory":

  Harry noticed Hagrid's flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin. Harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression that Hagrid's old school wand was concealed inside it. *Hagrid wasn't supposed to use magic.* He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year.
#+end_quote

Hagrid's punishment was explicitly said to be that "he isn't supposed to use magic". If the punishment was that /criminals aren't allowed to have wands/ in order to perform magic, the Ministry expulsion hearing Harry attended would have mentioned it. And the Ministry would have destroyed all the wand pieces - which can still cast magic, as Ron's snapped wand did in CoS. Yet they gave the pieces back to Hagrid, since he still has them 50 years after his expulsion.

***** It's a cultural thing in the wizarding world, mate. Wands are special, your wand chooses you, and when you die, it gets buried with your body. Wands make wizards special, look at the Fountain of Magical Brethren - other creatures can have magic, but only wizards are allowed to have wands.

And look at how humiliating it was for Lucius Malfoy to have his wand yoinked by Voldemort, when Voldemort didn't want to risk another Priori Incantatem with Harry. Lucius could have afforded 100 new wands. But the wand that Voldy took was his.

** Azkaban is a human rights violation, straight up. It's awful, and humiliating. I wouldn't wish it on anyone, not even Voldemort. Considering the afterlife is basically a confirmed thing in Harry Potter, death is preferable by far than that awful place.

Dementors consume souls. They eat happiness, and is literally the darkest creatures known to wizard kind. This place is not a prison, it's an island of torture.

I'm pretty sure Azkaban was a way to keep the Dementors pacified, considering the wizards had no other way of dealing with them. So originally it was more to keep the 'guards' there, than the prisoners. The criminals are just the 'acceptable sacrifice' that the wizards decided to give them. Over time, it turned into an accepted practice though, and considering how small magical Britain are, they simply have no other prison.

Yeah, it's fucked up.

One should stop evil from happening, but once that has been achieved, punishment is not delivered to make people feel better. It is a preventative measure to stop others from doing the same, and to try and make the evil person good - rehabilitation. Torture may help with the first point, but there are other things that can do that as well. Everyone deserves empathy, and thus torture is bad by default.

I went to law school. You are required to take criminal law in American schools. We studied theories of punishment (retributive, rehabilitation, etc), which got us to solitary confinement. You touch on some pretty fucked up things in law school, but the stories of prisoners in long term solitary messed with me more than almost anything.

** I have a pet theory that JKR wrote Azkaban as some sort of political commentary, similar to how members of Slytherin House were characterized as racist, posh inbreds, which was a veiled allusion to British elite public schools.

Based on info from the Pottermore history page written by JKR, Azkaban only exists as it does in the books because of one "Tough on Crime" Minister who solved the problem prisoners regularly escaping from Low-Sec prison, by dumping the baddies on a haunted island. All the ministers who came after accepted it as the most convenient solution, and were too lazy and complacent to do anything about it.

#+begin_quote
  "No Minister ever seriously considered closing Azkaban. They turned a blind eye to the inhumane conditions inside the fortress, permitted it to be magically enlarged and expanded and rarely visited, due to the awful effects of entering a building populated by thousands of Dementors. Most justified their attitude by pointing to the prison's perfect record at keeping prisoners locked up."

** It's important to remember that Sirius is not a reliable source of information - he does not remember anything happy that happens to him. The only reason he remembers his innocence is because it wasn't a happy thought (because he was being punished for something he didn't do). There could have been things like toothbrushes, but he forgets to use them because he enjoys the feeling of clean teeth. There could have been meals he forgot to eat.

Also, Mrs. Crouch was dying anyway, so they could well have given her medical treatment, which she would have refused in any case since she didn't want her deception known.

The fact that Fudge visits implies that visits aren't unheard of (or else why would a cowardly Minister for Magic feel secure in doing so?). The prisoners probably just forget.

*** If "Barty" had been the only one to die, that might be the case. But there's an entire graveyard on the island. Prisoners routinely starve to death, so there's no medical intervention or re-feeding procedures, at the very least.

We know of three visitors, actually: Crouch, Fudge and Dumbledore. All of them are inordinately powerful in their society. Crouch's visit only comes when his son is thought to be dying and Sirius suspects it's because he's pulled some ministry strings. It doesn't seem likely the average witch or wizard can go visit someone incarcerated; at least not the most dangerous offenders.

Well, yeah. There are a lot of life sentences, and if you do something that gets you a life sentence at Azkaban, your family probably doesn't want your body back.

Honestly, probably a kindness.

We don't have any information one way or the other. It's perfectly reasonable for you to assume that they aren't allowed, but it's not canon either way.
