Basically what the title says. Some of my favourites from ao3 were deleted and I want to read them again. Is there some way I can find these fics again?


** Have you tried the [[https://archive.org/web/web.php][wayback machine]]? There's no guarantee that it saved the fic you're looking for, but if you still have the url you might be able to find it.

** If you have the url of the deleted fic, you can check on Wayback Machine or see if someone has previously downloaded it on [[http://www.ff2ebook.com]]

** If somebody has them downloaded (as ePub or something), or there are various dumps of some parts of HP fanfic archives on the net (perhaps [[https://www.archive.org][www.archive.org]]?). Which stories are missing?
