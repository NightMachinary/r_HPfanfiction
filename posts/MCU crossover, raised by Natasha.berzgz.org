As headline says, I'm looking for crossovers with the MCU where Harry is raised by Natasha. I've already read ‘Hadrian Romanoff', which I loved, and ‘my name is Yakov Romanoff'. Looking for stories over 40k wording which aren't on ff.net

Or just if you have any other great stories where Harry is raised by an avenger (not tony, or the long one with Bruce)

Thank you!


** Does it have to be Harry? There's a great story where Ron's raised by Hawkeye (with Widow's help).
