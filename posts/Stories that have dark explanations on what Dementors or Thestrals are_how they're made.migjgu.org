If there are any pairings am fine with het/slash/femslash. Asexual/Bisexual, etc.

The explanations don't have to be the main thing in the story. And it can be one explanation for either creature.


** linkao3(How to be Happy by TheDivineComedian)

You should also read linkao3(Calibration by TheDivineComedian) if your looking for monster stories...

Oh and linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13823533/1/If-you-could-choose]]) is verry good!!! And linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13824044/1/Burn]]) which isn't anything you asked for but I like anything.

  The Patronus charm requires a happy memory. Harry Potter doesn't have many, and the Dementors get Sirius, after all.But the story is far from over.

#+begin_quote
  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/7784][The Hush of War]] series by zeitgeistic. Harry cooperates with Voldemort in order to prevent all-out war. Dumbledore and the Ministry are incompetent and not prepared to handle a global crisis regarding the Dementor population. It's a good thing Voldemort knows just what to do. Very interesting Dementor lore, an interesting twist on Lily's sacrifice, and a unique take on why Voldemort went mad in the first wizarding war (and why he is now recovering). This is a quality fic, I love zeitgeistic's work. Oh, and it's Draco/Harry!!!

Now on hiatus, but the dementor origin is covered. The author's version, anyway.
