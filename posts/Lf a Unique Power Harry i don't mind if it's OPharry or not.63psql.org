***** There aren't really any. It just started second year, and already pairing up 11-years-olds is just silly. The only thing that comes close to what would usually be called a pairing here on reddit comes when Harry visits an alternate dimension that, in a hilarious twist, is a compound of fanfiction clich√©s (Evil Dumbledore, etc.), where there's a pairing between a fem!Harry and Hermione.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** Linkffn(Breath of the Inferno) Harry is a dragon animagus and is bigger than most fully grown dragons also there is family magic (Ex. the Greengrasses can turn themselves into a lightning form). However it is on hiatus and Harry is rather OP for an eleven year old so if that's not your thing this probably isn't a book you would want to read.

  [HIATUS - Read Profile!] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi

  The venom of the Basilisk burnt through his brain while the tears of a phoenix repaired it. But it didn't stop at that, it improved it, giving him the powers of a psychic, powers to change his world. Slowly the chosen one grows into something new, something unseen by the world of magic. OP Harry! Swearing! MATURE THEMES!
