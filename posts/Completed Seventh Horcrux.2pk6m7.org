I stumbled upon the completed version of Seventh Horcrux tonight and finished the reading the additional 5 chapters that have yet to be posted on fanfiction.net. There are also various omakes that I have yet to read, but I figured I'd share this before going to be as I've seen links to the fanfiction.net version of the story posted a few times recently.

*** That was the threat I had originally stumbled across. The one I posted is from the "*Thread 2: A Harry Situation*" The link I posted has the same story, but many more omakes.

** Hope it's published on FF soon... I dramatically prefer downloading stores to ebook format and reading them on my tablet. Reading them with my desktop computer is out and using my old laptop isn't very comfortable.
