*** James sacrificed himself for both Lily and Harry, and his love for Lily was strong, but not as much as their desire for Harry to live. Voldemort was weakened after attempting to kill Lily, but he didn't understand why, so he continued with attempting to kill Harry, and Lily was knocked unconscious by the Killing curse, so Voldemort thought he had killed Lily at first, and in any case Lily wasn't conscious enough to further defend Harry.

His attempt to kill Harry, of course, ruined him.

Harry possibly didn't even flinch when the spell hit him, but Lily was knocked out for a few days, and barely survived.

Lily's scar is much bigger than Harry's. But she wears it proudly and doesn't give a fuck about what others think of how she looks.

It also turns out the failed curse split her soul, and Voldemort became her Horcrux.

**** Interesting idea, not sure it would work. I would think an actual.sacrifice would be needed. For example James died for Lilly, but Lilly being unconscious isn't really a sacrifice. Would magic accept "well I meant to die for Harry" as an actual sacrifice? I think if James saved Lilly it would result in a double stacked protection for Harry. Like Lilly rejected the Saving effects in favor of saving Harry. But who knows it's called the arcane for a reason.

** My issue with this idea is that protection against the killing curse would be significantly more common than in HP canon, so it really wouldn't be a "boy-who-lived" sort of deal. Plenty of parents die for their children, most aren't given a deliberate choice of whether or not to be murdered to slightly increase their child's chance of survival. Voldemort was going to kill James no matter what, it was Lily's choice of living or dying that made the protection stick. If just dying for people triggers it, a large amount of aurors/soldiers in wars would also have this protection and it would be nothing special. Also, since this is a much more common defense, you'd think Voldemort would be prepared and wouldn't kill anyone who was defended by a sacrifice.

I suppose you could fix this by Voldemort also giving James a chance, but then it needs an explanation for /why/.

*** I feel this is no different from canon. There is never any explanation as to why Lily's self sacrifice does what no one else in history has managed to do, let alone also providing a protection to Harry and the Dursley's house that lasts right up until the day that Harry is legally and adult by the Ministry's laws.

This is why I consider Dumbledore's 'Lily's sacrifice' explanation as him giving a simplified explanation of one hypothesis he has pieced together from evidence left at the scene. Also bare in mind that I am pretty sure that the theory is never much expanded on beyond what Dumbledore tells Harry when he is eleven at the end of PS. Not only would Dumbledore have kept it simple, but this is before Harry had the dementor induced flashbacks of Voldemort's offer to let Lily live (if they are reliable) or there was any evidence for Horcruxes.

I have always preferred the theory that he was attempting a Horcrux ritual with Harry's death (asking Slughorn about making seven, and creating one from Nagini before he even resurrected shows he was planning to make another one, and cementing his immortality through the murder of a prophesied threat seems like his kind of hubris). Given the fact that while Horcruxes are well known enough for Regulus and Slughorn to know about them and Voldemort found instructions while he was still in school, yet apparently actually making one is unheard of, presumably they are hard to create and dangerous to get wrong. Something, perhaps the prophecy or James and/or Lily's sacrifice (why should only a mother's love count?) interacted with the ritual to blow Voldemort up. The scar being caused by the killing curse is entirely a baseless rumour, as the only person who could have known were Voldemort and maybe Peter, neither of whom had a chance to tell anyone.

I mean, both Dumbledore and Voldemort agree on the explanation, and neither sound like they are guessing. Just re-read Voldemorts return speech, it seems like a magic thats known to those who study it.

While you could say they are both just making it up/guessing, I would argue that we could apply that logic to literally every piece of magic we are told about no matter by who.

If there aren't very special rules and circumstances, this sacrifice should be much more common if all it takes is dying for someone. If this has nothing to do with the sacrifice, then both Dumbledore and Voldemort are just making up the exact same story for some reason independent of each other.

#+begin_quote
  Horcruxes are well known enough for Regulus and Slughorn
#+end_quote

Two people with a history of dark arts knowing some rare piece of dark arts doesn't mean it's well known enough for others to be avoiding it solely due to the danger. Nothing in canon supports the idea that Horcruxes are so dangerous to make that no one does, let alone that such backfires are common knowledge.

Might be a baseless rumor, but again, both Dumbledore and Voldemort confirm it has something to do with the killing curse. Why would they independently come to that conclusion without it being true?

***** In a story, just like in real life, characters rarely have perfect information and don't always tell absolutely everything they know, out of expedience if nothing else.

While it is very possible that he made a mistake in the heat of the moment, I always assumed that if Voldemort knew what Lily did then he wouldn't have walked straight into the trap, you don't reach your fifties as a Dark Lord by being careless. Also if anything would give you a bit of magical amnesia, it would be becoming disembodied. Given it took him a decade to get enough of his shit together to do anything, he might not remember much about that night.

His speech at the end of book 4 is a marketing spiel to persuade his followers that despite losing them the war and spending nearly a decade as a wraith, it is worth their while to join up again. While that doesn't mean everything he says is a lie, from his perspective it was probably easier to work with the accepted story than give a comprehensive presentation on what actually happened. In addition, even if he is now more wary of it, do you really expect him to tell people, even his 'loyal' followers, exactly what sort of magic can beat him? Especially if it involved his Horcruxes? He is actively benefited by spreading misinformation.

By encouraging the belief that Harry's survival was a completely unique, unreproducible freak of magic, he limits the damage to his own reputation. This also helps build up Harry as the 'Chosen One', both discouraging the general public from opposing him themselves as they wait for their saviour, and magnifying the victory when Voldemort inevitably (in his eyes) kills the untrained schoolboy.

I am not saying that Dumbledore is absolutely wrong or intending to mislead, but the ELI5 version that he gave Harry probably isn't the full story, and Dumbledore himself doesn't know everything as he wasn't there. Even when it comes to magic, his specialisation is alchemy. Unless you make it so he was involved in whatever Lily did. There are loads of fanfics of her turning to 'Tomes of Ancient Magic' and doing it all herself, but she could well have asked him for help, or even been working off his suggestion in the first place.

  Two people with a history of dark arts
#+end_quote

I mean, not really. Regulus was at best just out of his teens, and Slughorn was a potions master, teacher, head of house and profession networker. Neither of them had the time to become Dark Arts savants. If both of them were sufficiently familiar with Horcruxes that they immediately recognised the name/the object from a house elf's description, then it stands to reason that there were quite a few witches and wizards in Britain alone that knew about them, and given Voldemort's example, could find out how to make them. Yet the only other example of Horcruxes being created /ever/ was Herpo, thousands of years before. While there are obviously cases that Harry doesn't hear about, there must be a reason why the likes of Lucius and Bellatrix don't have Horcruxes, it is not as if they would baulk at the killing part. Difficulty and a high cost for failure, as a form of karmic retribution, is a common trope in limiting the use of 'dark magics' in fantasy, and it seems to fit here.

Given that the killing curse is explicitly stated to leave no trace, I struggle to see how Dumbledore could confirm it (although it is very possible there are entire fields of magical forensics which Harry never hears about). See above for why Voldemort never bothers to challenge the official story.

#+end_quote

I don't think that assumption is supported by canon. He says it outright, he just didn't expect she would use this very particular, ultra specific old magic that he didn't think about at the time, or expect her to know. He doesn't say /how/ to do it either, so it's not like he's spreading the information around, and he already proved to his follower's he's immortal.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It wasn't the accepted story tho, the accepted story was "Boy's the boy who lived ¯\/(ツ)//¯". No one mentioned it was Lily's sacrifice to the public, and no one knows how he survived. They didn't even know the prophecy until year 5, it was just accepted as a miracle. Dumbledore told no one except Harry, not even McGonagall when she asked Dumbledore how Harry survived was told why.

If it's just a marketing spiel, why /the exact same story as dumbledore/. Not a similar story, not something with the same general theme but the /exact/ same story. Two liars who don't work together don't come up with an identical tale.

I'm repeating myself here, but again, if it was just a guess why did Voldemort come to the exact same story as an explanation? I already explained why he couldn't have just pretended to go along with the story, because the story wasn't known to anyone.

#+begin_quote
  I mean, not really. Regulus was at best just out of his teens, and Slughorn was a potions master, teacher, head of house and profession networker.
#+end_quote

Regulus was a son of the Black family, that Sirius said was very comfortable with the dark arts, as well as the fact that Regulus had Death Eaters as his main company of friends. We can safely assume he knew something of the Dark Arts. As for Slughorn, re-read Riddle's conversation where he asks Slughorn about Horcruxes. He outright states he knows Slughorn is versed in the Dark Arts. He didn't just randomly ask someone who might or might not be a user of dark arts about Horcruxes.

#+begin_quote
  Yet the only other example of Horcruxes being created ever was Herpo, thousands of years before
#+end_quote

Maybe I misrecall, but I thought he was the famous example, not the only. I'm not confident enough to say for certain either way.

​ There is literally nothing supporting this. Sure, but I could just as easily say that it's an utterly risk free procedure and we'd have the exact same canon backing. Edit: This isn't entirely true, but there's a hell of a lot more evidence for the canon reason than for this to be the case.

Sure, we don't know how Dumbledore confirmed it. Sure, we don't know how Riddle knew/found out about the protections. But from everything in the story we are implied they are correct. The story paints Dumbledore as a reliable source for this, and Voldemort has no reason to be lying about/cannot realistically have come up with the same lie as Dumbledore independently. That we don't know everything about magic is due to a lack of source, not proof it doesn't exist and everyone is just making shit up as they go along.

I think a large part of your theory is based on misremembering canon.
