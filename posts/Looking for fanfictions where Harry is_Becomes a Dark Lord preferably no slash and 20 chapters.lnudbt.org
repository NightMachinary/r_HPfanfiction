Hey i'm looking for fanfictions where Harry is/becomes a Dark Lord preferably no slash and that they have some length, Idc wether he fights for pureblood traditions and supremacy and for magic to be free or all magicals. It's important that he's a dark and is against the light.


** I don't know if it fully fits, but I loved it

Wait there's slash? I totally forgot about that. I messed up, but it's still really good. One of my favorites.

Edit: WAIT A SECOND. There's a TON of slash, which I forgot about because he doesn't like anyone romantically. Only as servants or people to sleep with.

  He was a genius. He could paint, play music, talk to snakes, control fire. He was more powerful and intelligent then any knew. He had strong 'friends'. The problem was, he had few emotions. Dark Harry. I Do Not Own Harry Potter. -Slash-

** I have only ever enjoyed a pair of Slash fic's, though I forget what the other one was. It seems if you read enough fanfiction you'll find you like /everything/ atleast twice.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
