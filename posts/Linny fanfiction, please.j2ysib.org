**** Well actually that second one could be okay! If it was one of those time travel to marauders era fics, but with ginny as the MC and bi, she could fall in love with lily! :) It's no worse than HERMIONE falling for James, or SIRIUS or LUPIN who she actually knew as adults and a teacher! I have read some of those before.

EDIT: I DIDN'T SEE THE SECOND "L" AND I FORGOT HARRY'S STUPID KID'S STUPID NAMES BECAUSE THE EPILOGUE IS DUMB ANYWAYS!!!! OH MY GOD! :( :( :( :( :( BLECK.
