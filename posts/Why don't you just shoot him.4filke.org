So, this is about something that's bugged me for a while. Why bother with the Horcruxes? What I mean is, we know Voldemort can be killed while he has Horcruxes. I know it would be very difficult, I'm not denying that. But it would be just as difficult with all his Horcruxes as it was with no Horcruxes. So...why not just try and kill him? That eliminates one Horcrux, and it takes Voldemort out of play for a while. Eventually he'll either run our of Horcruxes or else his followers will get sick of resurrecting him. I get why J K Rowling didn't do this in the book, because it would have killed the tension, but why not do it in fanfiction?


** the nature of horcruxes aside, it could work. it would put riddle into cool down and give the good guys time to deal with his band of merry men once and for all. give harry time to gain experience.

*** It is a logical course of action. Not only does it remove the only one able to stand up to Dumbledore from the ranks of the enemies, it also demoralises the Death Eaters, improves the morale of the Ministry forces, and makes hunting down the Horcruxes easier. If the good guys can "disrupt" Voldemort, they should do it. It would save a lot of lives.

*** The problem (from a writing perspective) with having Voldemort's body killed then doing a horcrux hunt/war fic is that you've already overcome the biggest challenge at the start of the fic. Everything else, after you've established an ability to kill Voldemort, is one drawn-out anti-climax. Finding and destroying the horcruxes is significantly easier than killing Voldemort, and (assuming he resurrects before you get rid of all the horcruxes) killing him for a second time won't feel special. It will feel like "here we go again..."

I discovered this to my detriment in The One He Feared. Having Voldemort lose his body at the end of the first Act sounded clever in my head, but once it was on the page it became clear to me that I'd just written a premature climax.

*** Sorry, the shooting thing was just a quote, referring to the trope that I think relates to this conversation.

Wait wait, what? So, the pieces of souls in Horcruxes are just anchors for the main one? How does that even work? I thought Voldemort was reduced to 'less than the meanest ghost' because that's what a Horcrux is, a fragment of the soul, less than what even a ghost has. If that's the case, why split the soul more than once? He was convinced the Hogwarts one was hidden perfectly! I thought he wanted 7 because, you know, 7 is magic and it'll give him 8 lives. So you're telling me Voldemort just went and split his soul for redundancy's sake, not because he wanted as many lives as possible?

**** Yeah, the "meanest ghost" was an incomplete piece of soul, but it wasn't any of the horcruxes, it was the master soul from which the horcruxes had been detached.

He intended to make 6 horcruxes because 7 (6 horcruxes + master) was a powerful magical number. We can only speculate what that means in practical terms; perhaps it made his spells even stronger than they would normally be.

****** We cant say that for sure, unfortunately, because arithmancy is never explained in cannon.

It seems likely that voldemort chose seven because it was a 'magic' number, but its a good number geometrically as well, as is 3. a hexagon is made of 7 equidistant points, each vertex and the center, and is composed of 6 triangles (2x3) each with 3 sides. good stable number, as well as prime. 7 is also the second smallest happy number, the sum of the square of its digits is equal to one.

Its uncertain whether voldie chose 7 because it would make him 'more' immortal or for magical power reasons, or because it would make the horcruxes safer or... lots of possible reasons.

To kill Voldemort permanently, every horcrux had to be destroyed.

Hunting horcruxes would certainly be easier if Voldemort did not have a body. But that would be pretty difficult to do.

** I think what you'd actually want to do is imprison him. Cut his limbs, pump him full of Draught of Living Death and bury him in a old, abandoned saltmine. Fill the thing with concrete, use the Fidelius Charm and obliviate the Secret Keeper of the fact that he has a secret to keep. Finally, make a loyal houselve (Dobby maybe) keep him alive.

Then go for the horcrux hunt.

If that is done, give the houseleve some basilisk venom (you have some handy in the Chamber, so there you go) and poison Voldie with it. Then his corpse rots away in the mine where later muggles dump their atomic wastes.

***** I've read zero fics like that at all. I'm not really into mixing the muggle and magical worlds really. I'm okay with non-magic AU and all, but anything that does a lot of magic/muggle world mixing often has a lot of politics involved, and I'm just not that interested in it.

You would have to have the charm on you /before/ the gun is shot for that to work. So I agree that, sure they'd figure it out and do it /eventually/, but the way she has it in canon right now they are so confused by the muggle world there is no way that all wizards and witches place anti-bullet charms on themselves every single morning before they go about their days.

Or are you imagining a person can be enchanted once and never, ever again? I'd think that probably not on people (and I think JK Rowling even said that charms on objects /do/ fade, but that's word of god so really doesn't count/matter imm), but even so: they'd have to have invented and used it first.

Which is the whole point of it bringing up guns. Voldemort didn't have a charm on him to stop bullets. And we know that just because they are wizards doesn't mean they can't die. It also doesn't mean only magic can kill them. The only reason Harry didn't die from falling off his broom was because Dumbledore used magic to break his fall and have him slow down before impact.

So there is no reason to believe that guns can't kill wizards. They could certainly use magic to make guns ineffective /if they have the foresight to do so/, but the argument around Harry using a gun in the book was always surrounded with the idea that /because/ Voldemort looked down on Muggles and rejected everything from their world, /he/ wouldn't have the foresight to protect himself against it. And a vast majority of wizards as well, because they know nothing about the muggle world.

*** I think it's a matter of how magic actually works. Do we ever see (in canon) shield charms beings used to defend against physical projectiles instead of just magic? HPL gives no examples of it, so it may be that /Protego/, the most common shield spell (which apparantly a number of grown wizards don't know how to cast) can only defend against magic.

If it can, or there's a specific shield charm for physical projectiles, are there limitations? Can a poorly cast charm defend against a low-powered gun but not a better one? Does the effectiveness of the charm alter depending on the size and speed of the bullet? What about armour-piercing rounds or those exploding bullets that [[/u/Kazeto]] mentioned or whatever other types of special bullets might exist?

But even if you can defend against bullets, you still have to be quick enough to do so before the other person shoots you. And you're completely screwed if it's long distance or you otherwise aren't aware you're being shot at. Are there shield charms you can put on in the morning and hope they last all day? If there are, most wizards probably won't bother. Depending on exactly how paranoid you consider Voldemort, he might do it, but personally I think he's too arrogant and full of disdain for Muggles to think that he needs to take precautions against snipers.

**** Armour-piercing rounds probably wouldn't do shite, as they are good against armour but go like a heated knife through butter when used against flesh so the damage is even lower than with normal bullets. There were cases in history of people pretty much being turned into pincushions with AP bullets and still living through it because the damage was only localised and overall low for how many shots there were.

And if we consider the fact that magic does have some passive effect (which is why it's no big issue for a wizard to fall down dozens of feet, whereas a muggle would be likely to damage themselves) so we are basically down to guessing whether normal firearms would actually work against them well enough that they'd even need a charm unless they were quintuple-tapped or so.

Honestly, I'd like to see a fic with firearms that actually accounts for the British situation with firearms and explores the situation as a thought exercise and does it well. So far I'd only seen one snippet of that, which is something but leaves one hungering for more.

If you are willing to go illegal, you can get firearms almost everywhere, and sometimes with surprising ease. But Harry and company do not strike me as people who would do that “just because”, at least not before the events of the seventh book started happening; and the government wouldn't get involved because Fudge is an idiot, Scrimgeour wouldn't care about making them involved, and Thicknesse was a pawn.

*If* someone wrote a story in which there actually is an in-story reason, that actually makes sense, why the characters decide to go illegal (because getting involved with questionable people who sell illegal firearms, even if you neither steal nor buy but simply copy, is something I would count as that because you simply don't get in contact with them via legitimate channels; and likewise, confounding someone into believing that you have a firearms permit is not exactly legal, and even then many authors make that result in them getting firearms that definitely aren't available that way to the civilian populace in Britain), I would count it as accounting for that situation. Likewise, if the characters went around the proper channels to notify the muggles high enough in the command chain to get the army involved (as the prime minister is monitored by the ministry of magic so it's a no-go), I'd count it as that too.

My point was that far too many people who write those stories just go “and then they got guns, that's it”. For fuck's sake, that's a terrible attitude with this and it's just cringe-worthy and that is what I am against, not guns in general.
