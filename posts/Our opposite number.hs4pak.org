This story focuses on original muggle characters and is an exploration of how the wizarding world interacts with the non-magical world, an area that the lore never gives a good explanation in my opinion. Trying to promote it on here because as it basically an elsewhere story its sunk like a stone.


** Good pacing and nice hook at the end of chapter 1, especially for a fic with an OC protagonist. However, it does seem like the risk for Mugglewank is high here. The fact that MI5 is even permitted to know about magic by the Ministry is kinda drifting into that area from the outset.

Ok had to look this one up. Don't think the story is going to fall into that, Wizards are still going to be scarefully powerful.
