** Ollivander may only enter the eternal rest when he has passed on the mantle of premier wandmaking. Alas, his successor must be as good or better than him. If only he hadn't spent his life honing his skills of wandmaking.

Alternatively, you have Ollivander, the eldritch abomination.

Edit: Another option is "Ever heard of a juice cleanse?". The amount of Death Eaters that died to an angry killing curse was high over the next few weeks. Voldemort never let a potential immortality method pass him by.

***** Nevyn is one of the major characters from /The Deverry Cycle/ series, by Katherine Kerr. It's Celtic fantasy, and part of Nevyn's backstory is that he was studying magic against the wishes of his father. Eventually he's stripped of his titles and even his name(Nevyn=no-one), and his betrothed ends up dying in a rather tragic fashion.

He swore that he would not rest until he made it right. The Great Ones accepted his vow, and made it so he couldn't die until his betrothed reincarnated, he reunited with her, and taught her magic. This lead him to be functionally immortal for a long time.

** Olivander looked at Tom and said:

" I invented wands and so I was cursed to oversee how my creation ruins old magics. I am to never have rest, I am to be a warden of old lore, I am The Olivander of olden Roma. The first wandmaker, the contract-breaker."

Old tired eyes watched him. And even Voldemort in his inhuman heart felt the chill. 'Maybe just maybe immortality was a trap.' But such thought was antathema to him.

** Ollivander returned the Dark Lord's gaze.

"There are more things in Heaven and in Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy," he quoted quietly.

Voldemort's eyes narrowed. "You would quote the stories of history to me, a man who will create it? A pity, Ollivander... perhaps you /have/ aged. Only old fools fight the future."

"I am doing no such thing. I know quite well how foolish it is to fight time." The two men began circling each other slowly around the room. "But I am, perhaps, amused, Tom."

"Do not say that name!" Voldemort snarled.

"Ah, but I think I will, Tom. I know the power of names. All too well, perhaps..."

With a flick of his wrist, Voldemort made a jet of yellow light fly out of his wand, causing the wall behind the old man to explode violently. Ollivander fell to his knees.

"You are testing my patience, old man," hissed the Dark Lord. "You have a secret. If you are not willing to tell it to me, I shall have to resort to... more extreme methods."

"I have many secrets," Ollivander said, getting to his feet.

"I do not doubt it. Wand-makers are rare..." Voldemort stroked his own wand lovingly. "It would be such a shame if one were to die... much knowledge would be lost."

"It will take more than what you are capable of to kill me."

"Oh?" Voldemort raised his eyebrows. "Let us see. /Avada Kedavra!/"

A jet of green light shot from his wand and struck the old man in the chest with a whooshing noise. Ollivander fell on all fours, and, with a labored grunting noise, pulled a strange metal wand out of his pocket.

"What..." Voldemort inhaled sharply. "What are you?"

The old man pressed something on the metal wand. There was a rhythmic noise like wind, fading in and out, becoming louder each time. Ollivander struggled to his feet once more.

With a loud clunk, the noise stopped, and a large blue box stood where there had been nothing before. His skin glowing yellow, Ollivander straightened his back, standing proud, the metal wand pointed at the Dark Lord.

"I'm the Doctor," he said.

** The door swung closed and locked with a quiet click, the shade fell down over the window, and Voldemort felt a ripple of magic unlike any he had felt before, he somehow /knew/ that they wouldn't, couldn't be disturbed. "Who are you? /What/ ... are you?"

" When I was young I was a mighty warrior, eager to prove himself. I fought for Hedju-Hor with sword and the few wandless magics that were all that existed at the time. Seeking new adventures I slew the guardian of the sacred grove with this knife and cut off a branch. From that branch I fashioned the first wand and became a mighty ruler of men, first at the king's side.

" After many generations of men I sought new challenges. I gave up my first name Heka and became Narmer and made myself king. I became Imhotep and spent centuries researching magics old and new. I became Medea. I became Herpo. I discovered great things ... and in my foolish youth - I was only 2000! - I attracted the attention of the gods.

" They cursed me to both have what I wanted and to be what I hated. They made me keep my immortality, but to be ordinary, a mere craftsman. I hear them jeering at me in my dreams even now after millennia.

" But even the gods make mistakes. I may have no other strength but I have my great skill and have been honing it for eons waiting for the right wizard to come. You, Tom Riddle. You. I saw greatness in you even when you were a child. Many of the wands you tried that first day would have served you well but I wanted to make you a special tool. I poured all my skill into your wand that afternoon while you shopped for your books and robes. The wand chooses the wizard, ah yes, but the wandmaker always has its first loyalty and through your wand I have /your/ loyalty.

" Don't I, Mr. Riddle.

" Now, you have some gods to kill. Then, perhaps, I can get some rest. "

With another gentle click the door unlocked and light flooded back into the shop.
