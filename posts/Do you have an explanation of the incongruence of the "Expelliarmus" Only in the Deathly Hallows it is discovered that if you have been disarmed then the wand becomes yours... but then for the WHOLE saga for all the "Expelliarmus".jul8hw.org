Do you have any explanation for this?

What's the purpose then to go buy a wand (with all the thing that "The wand chooses the wizard") if with a simple Expelliarmus it will no longer be yours?

*** I think this whole sorry confusing mess could have been avoided if JKR had just written that the "allegiance" thing was a peculiarity of the Elder wand.

There was no need to make it so that all wands had this weird trait that most people would experience, but then no-one seems to know about.

Just stick with Ollivander's original explanation about wands: namely, a witch or wizard can use another's wand, but won't get results as good as if using their own.

That's a perfectly good explanation for why Hermione could use Bellatrix's wand, and Harry could use Draco's, and Ron use Pettigrew's, though less successfully than they use their own - without introducing any plot holes.

*** The idea that wands are sentient is pretty dumb. Let's be honest, JKR wrote herself into a corner by having Harry be so fucking /useless/ in Book 6. She recognized there was no way for H to beat LV, so she pulled a ridiculous and stupid deus ex machina out of her ass.

***** I would argue that Harry defeating him wasn't a deux ex machina. She could have left the wand and hallows out of the story completely and it would have still worked. All the way back in book 1 Dumbledore straight up says that the reason Quirrel couldn't bear to touch him was because of the power of his mom's love. All through the series that's given as the sole reason for him having to stay with his abusive horrible blood relatives during the summers. And it's brought up repeatedly that the thing that makes Harry different isn't power levels, it's that Harry can love. Love is one of the core recurring themes in the story.

The appearance of the hallows was kind of annoying to me because it hadn't even been hinted at before this. Like yeah the cloak was introduced early, but it's was never mentioned in that context. Like when Ron said "whoa they're really rare!" he could have added, "There's one in a story mum used to read us about three brothers that tried to cheat death," and left it at that. Or done something even more subtle if she didn't want to leave an obvious clue.

Up until the hallows were introduced, I had a strong inkling it was going to end with Harry hugging it out or letting Voldemort kill him and surviving through the power of love. Which would have worked regardless of the wand Voldemort used, because the thing that allowed him to survive the second time was that he willingly sacrificed himself so nobody else would die in his place.

****** Just because a story has magic in it does not mean it should lose internal consistency. Magic is portrayed as a subject that takes a lifetime of practice to master. Voldemort has had a lifetime of practice in addition to possessing legendary potential.

It simply does not make sense that Harry could best him if we are to respect magic as an art or science of any difficulty. If you wish to abandon that notion in your fic then feel free - I am glad that J.K Rowling did not.

There was no way in the beginning that Harry would win in a straight 1:1 duel. Voldemort is decades older and more experienced than Harry who's barely a legal adult, Harry is not a wizarding prodigy (except for flying on a broom but that's pretty much useless in this situation).

Besides, the Elder Wand is not "just" a stupid plot, it is actually an important thing - Voldemort, like many powerful people, falls because he thought he was immortal, infinitely powerful and knew everything. And like many before him, he discovered in the end that it is very easy to fall even from a small mistake.

***** I disagree. Book 6 entirely changed the tone of the series, because JKR has a ginger fetish and got distracted.

Book 2 - Harry kills a basilisk w a f-ing sword.

Book 3 - Harry chases away a hundred dementors with a spell most adults cannot manage

Book 4 - Harry bests Voldemort in a magical battle of will

Book 5 - Harry trains his school chums and they defeat more than twice their number of LV's best Deat Eaters / /then/ Harry throws off LV's attempted possession

Book 6 - Harry forgets all of the things that happened for the last 5 years, spends all his time thinking about his best friend's little sis/his roommate's girlfriend ðŸ¤®

See? There was a clear arc of Harry building to defeat Voldemort that could have been utilized. It's silly to say "oh LV is older and more experienced".

Grindelwald was what, 40 when he almost took over the world? Gee, if only the ICW had thought to find an old man to fight him, there never would have been a war in the first place! After all, /no one can win against someone decades older/!!!

****** Two things: (1.) JKR had always written herself into a corner with the whole Harry v. Voldemort thing; it's why to my tastes, PoA is the best book in the series. It's the only one where 'prophecy' isn't the asspull that gets Harry out of things with serious plot armor and instead, actually feel as if he's in real, no-s**t danger from Sirius. (It also highlights the whole BS 'prophecy' angle because it shows how the MoM and the Wizarding World goes on high alert for Sirius, but can't stop falling over their feet and losing control over bodily functions anytime Voldemort's name is mentioned.) BTW, WHY THE HELL is the ICW even mentioned if they can't even come in and help out with such a huge problem as LV and his coalition of evil? After all, if they take over the UK, it's a staging area to start into Europe proper, and to expand from there! Why didn't we see MACUSA or any of the other magical governments being asked for help, or at least to send 'advisers' to assist? Why didn't an ICW task force of THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS of wizards and witches just drop into Scotland all 'Omaha Beach'- style and overrun the Death Eaters, et al. with absolute overwhelming force? After all, people are still alive who fought in the war against Grindenwald, and the world simply would not want a Second World Wizarding War... especially considering that now, all of the major Muggle powers have access to NBC weaponry and pinpoint delivery systems worldwide. Really, several cruise missiles launched at the Death Eater locations outside Hogwarts would have solved the issue - but then again, it seems that the British WW would rather have allowed LV to take over rather than appeal to help from the Crown. (It also seems VERY hard to believe that if the British Muggles haven't found ways to deal with problematic magical British subjects, the American No-Maj - I always thought that term should be used as a descriptive for both singular and plural - certainly would have for similarly problematic American citizens... and would have shared. 'Special Relationship' and all, you know.)

(2.) Book 6 should be called 'the Twilight' of the HP book series because of the romance angles (and Book 5 was horrible enough with the Cho subplot). I mean, from the description we've been given of love potions, listening to Harry's inner monologues concerning Ginny and his actions, it seems to me that he's definitely been dosed with a low-level love potion alongside an equally-powered compulsion potion keyed to her. I mean, all of the girls around him (including Hermione, who IMHO has been more of a friend and companion than Ron, but that's another story) that he could notice, and he suddenly starts to drool over the girl who can't even speak in whole sentences around him... (This is also real shady when you consider that since second year, he almost always spends a good portion of the summer around Ginny and it's just when he turns of legal age in the UK - sixteen in England, Scotland and Wales - when Harry suddenly starts to grow horns around Ginny.)

He only manages to do this with a sword with special properties and survives by the sheer luck of having a phoenix come to him - without his tears he'd be a goner.

One might argue that adults can't manage the Patronus spell not due to a lack of magical ability but rather by the lack of happy moments they can focus on. Let's face it most of adult life is one fucking drag.

#+begin_quote

... supported by the spectres of his dead parents and by the sheer dumb luck of his wand being the twin of Voldemort's. Again, more luck than skill.

They manage to survive, which I grant shows decent abilities. Harry does get possessed by Voldemort and only saved by Dumbledore.

Not just that. They were surviving being the No. 1 on the Most Wanted list for an incredibly long time. However, survival skills are different than fighting skills, shown by them being bested and captured by Snatchers.

The problem with dark lords, dictators and similars is that too many adults don't /want/ to fight them. Either they're too terrified to do anything (and to lose what precious they have), or they are comfortable with/benefitting from the situation. It's no coincidence that most rebellions start at universities or in youth movements...

******* I must have missed the part in Book 6 where they left Hogwarts and started the Horcrux Hunt.

Yes, Harry had help with most of his adventures, but he still was the one to do it. If it had been Ron in the graveyard, would he have been able to "push the beads of light" back towards LV? Of course not - not because Ron is stupid, but because Harry is the goddamn hero/protagonist. Of course he is strong enough to take on LV!

And I'm sorry, saying "oh, just because this little boy can cast a spell most people can't isn't that impressive" is like saying "yea, that 9-year old piano prodigy is neat, but if I spent 30 years playing I'd be just as good". The whole point is that a little boy has so much ability/skill/power that he is doing things adults would need years to accomplish.

That is, I assume, what JKR was going for. It was the "hero's journey" for the first 5 books, then a bumbling clown show for 6/7.

Not really. The point is that (especially adult) wizards are stupid and ignorant to what is going on. They live their lives and that's it for them. They don't /want/ to do anything, to improve - some are outright /resisting/ any attempt of doing so.
