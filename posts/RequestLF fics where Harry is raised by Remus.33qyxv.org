I'm looking for any sort of fic where Harry is raised by Remus and maybe he is also a werewolf or any sort of thing like that please.


** /Remus Lupin, P.I./ by Larry Huss is a decent feel-good one. Harry is never turned.

  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.

I loved this one too!

** Making Remus-as-guardian work in a canon world usually either means kidnapping or something really non-canon happening early. I like the idea of Remus just being an actual part of Harry's life, instead of hiding in the shadows even after being his professor for a year. Seems really irresponsible of him otherwise, which always struck me as out of character for Remus. Hiding and /pranking/ from the shadows, however...

In that theme, I've got a femRemus short story that leads into Harry being mentored by Lupin. It's the second part in my small short story collection, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10784029/1/Two-Tales-The-Seventh-Son-and-The-Wolfmother][Two Tales - The Seventh Son and The Wolfmother]]. Maybe I'll have the time to turn it into a full-length fanfic novel at some point. I'd see that short story as being the first chapter.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2737363/1/Twists-of-Fate][Twists of Fate]] got a nice premise.

vampire!Harry and also a pretty ooc Harry. But the story is nice, even if incomplete and abandoned. Definitely worth a read if you don't mind half-done fics.

Knowledge is power. Harry is a dick and cocky, but I remember enjoying it a lot.
