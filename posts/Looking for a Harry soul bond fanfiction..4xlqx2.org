Any GOOD HP soul bond. Ideally completed, but doesn't have to be long. Rating doesn't matter. Just no Darry or HP and any other male character please! Could be fem harry, tho still no fem harry with male bond. please!


** Not completed, but updates still happen, very, very slowly. My favorite soul bond fic (though some grammar issues are present). linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond).

Also has BEST Dumbledore.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

  For almost three years now Harry and Ginny have continued on as if it never happened; as if this colossal thing was not weighing down on them. You can't just read a diary and save a life without consequences. Now, at age fifteen, Harry is finally seeing that he and Ginny are far more tangled than he ever realized. New Epic Length novel!

***** Sorry, I was talking about bond of time. See the thing is, I'm really not into soul bonds fics. I'm sure there are some good ones out there, but I'm really more likely to enjoy a soul bond with a twist rather than a regular soul bond. So I can't really follow the usual recs there.

For example, I found this one intriguing but it really didn't go very far. Also, it was tropefest, which doesn't bugs me (in fact I really enjoy it when we'll done) but it's a clear no-go for some people.

****** Well, it is a little different from normal H/G soulbonds, as this one involves time travel. It does have the characters repeating obvious things sometimes in the story. I don't want to spoil main events, incase you read it, but they do plan on killing Voldemort at the end of Harry's fourth year, so that may tell you about the pace of things.

Voldemort brings all her cunning and guile to rip open the mystery that is Harry Potter.
