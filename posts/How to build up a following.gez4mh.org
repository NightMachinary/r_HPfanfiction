** Update frequently, pick a set of characters that gets the attention, look at your summary to see if anything's 'off,' disliked tropes and the like.

** Oneshots with the same writing style as the bigger story. Or, you can just post chapters once in 3 days with word length of 5-7k. It piques the interest of readers very well

** Updating frequently (even if that means shorter chapters) , helps getting visibility

Decent title and summary. I cannot stress enough how many stories i've skipped because of bad ones.

Interact with commments/reviews (not so relevant on ff, but on sites where discussion is visible)

There are hp discord server/ hp fanfiction writer server out there, i'm sure. Join and look around.

Link your story and summary in this thread.

*** How does this sound? I'm going for a book that is very similar, tonally, to the original series. I'd like to consider it a spiritual successor to the HP series, but that's just me being a little too proud of my own writing, I think.

Also, I used 'Bob Joe' as a fill-in name, because I absolutely love the name I came up with (lol) and would rather not publish it just yet. 'Bob Joe and the Radical's Key' (working title!!!) Bob Joe has been locked up by his family and not allowed to leave the property for years. When he discovers a chest in the forest leaving him the owner of multiple odd relics, he finds himself caught up in a whole new world of magic, but even for a magical school as odd as the one he attends, something sinister is afoot, involving a mysterious locked door hiding a secret power and the key to Bob's past...

I came up with all this on the spot (title and summary) so it can definitely be improved upon. In fact, I'm going to give it a second go here, perhaps you can give me some feedback on my title-making skills, lol :P

After being locked away by his parents for the first eleven years of his life, Bob Joe sneaks out one day only to find a chest filled with fascinating relics, beckoning for him to come a fantastical world of magic and mystery... but even in this world of witchcraft, where the abnormal is the new normal, something odd is afoot, and the future of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry -- and the Wizarding world as a whole -- may depend on Bob and his newfound friends.

**** Writing a story that follows the spirit of another one also has it's issues, which I am sure you are aware of.

Readers will have expectations as high as the original story, but will also want to read something new and refreshing. Does you story have something distinctive, that improves upon the world of Harry Potter ?

Improved or adapted Magical system, heavily expanded world of magical creatures ? World building ? I'd include this in the summary, perhaps with a hint.

If not, the summary is fine. It's miles better than most fan fiction, but do be mindful that a story like this will have readers come in with high expectations, because what your story promises is more Harry Potter and not more fanfiction. Because the summary is a bit generic and if a story is not carried by it's content, it needs to be carried by its prose.

I like the title, because it follows the intent of HP.

Does this help ? Again, I'd recommend finding on of the fanfiction writer servers and ask there. I've only visited one from a different fandom, but i'm sure they can give you decent advice, certainly better than mine.

Edit: I prefer the first summary

***** See, I don't want to draw people's expectations too high if the writing doesn't come out that well, but at the same time, I'm not going to deliberately write a subpar summary so as not to cause excitement.

As for the individual notes --- I'm writing this as a stand-alone from HP, so the first book is quite similar in tone to the Sorcerer's Stone, as it still introduces Hogwarts, Quidditch, etc... that's why there isn't as much of a massive overhaul of the worldbuilding (or at least that I have planned yet) as one might expect. My focus is on the plot and characters and making those very unique and with a different feel from HP, so the story can take place in a relatively similar world but not feel like a carbon copy of the original series. Your comments have gotten me thinking, though, and I'm already brainstorming a few more ways to set things apart... thanks for the help!

** You could also look at [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]]

Generally, if it's a long fic, it will be highly visible. If you update once or twice a week (don't post all chapters at once!) you'll be at the front page once or twice a week, so many people will see it after a while (it always takes some time to get attention, but if you keep on posting, you will). Have a good summary. Look at common writing mistakes and also make sure there's no typos and grammar mistakes. Have your chapters be at least 1k long. Crosspost. On AO3, use the tags correctly. If you ask some questions in the AN at the end, you'll get more reviews/comments. Reply to your reviews/comments. In [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] there's a weekly fic showcase. Also reply to people looking for certain types of stories if yours fits.

*** Thanks for the great info! If you don't mind, I'm going to copy and paste the two draft summaries I whipped up a minute ago for showing someone else. If you have the time to tell me if they're decent or not, that would be great, but of course if not that's fine!

​

1). Bob Joe has been locked up by his family and not allowed to leave the property for years. When he manages to sneak out one day, he discovers a chest in the forest leaving him the owner of multiple odd relics, he discovers that he is a wizard, and finds himself caught up in a whole new world of magic, but even for a magical school as odd as the one he attends, something sinister is afoot, involving a mysterious locked door hiding a secret power and the key to Bob's past...

​

2). After being locked away by his parents for the first eleven years of his life, Bob Joe sneaks out one day only to find a chest filled with fascinating relics, beckoning for him to come a fantastical world of magic and mystery as a wizard-in-training... but even in this world of witchcraft, where the abnormal is the new normal, something odd is afoot, and the future of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry -- and the Wizarding world as a whole -- may depend on Bob and his newfound friends.

​

My working title is "Bob Joe and the Radical's Key" but like I said, that's a working title. And if you couldn't guess, Bob Joe is a placeholder because (even if this is a kind of weird reason) I love my character's name and don't want it to get taken.

**** What precisely does locked away mean if he can go out into a forest? (Not quite clear in the first one) And is he a muggle who finds magical relics and meets wizards that way or is he a wizard who will attend Hogwarts? Will there only be OCs in this story or will there also be canon characters?

Summaries both sound good. Good writing style.

***** Thank you for the response! As I'm sure you know, as writers we sometimes forget what the reader does/doesn't know, and as such I forgot to mention that he gets into the forest after he manages to sneak out.

He's a wizard and will be attending Hogwarts.

It's pretty much all OC, set in 2015 and having just about no canon characters. The only character I can imagine returning at the moment is George Weasley for future plot reasons. The whole story is as practice for writing a real novel some day, thus why I don't want to recycle old characters (but I didn't want to focus on worldbuilding so I'm just writing an HP fanfic as practice).

Again, thanks for the feedback! I'm trying to make the writing feel Rowling-esque in tone, but the actual prose has a bit extra of my own invention.

** Generally, if you write to be successful you hold it wrong. There are so many stories out there that expecting popularity is just asking for hurt. Write because you enjoy it, and if somebody cares it is just an additional bonus.
