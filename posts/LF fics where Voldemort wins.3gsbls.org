Preferably Hermione-centric, along the same lines as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8982722/1/Cruel-and-Beautiful-World]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11304578/1/The-Silver-Mage-s-Captive]]


** linkffn(11076424) sort of counts, though it's a bit crack-ish.

For that matter, /are/ there any Hermione-centric fics where Voldemort wins that /aren't/ a romance with a not-as-evil-as-he-seems Death Eater? Something like, maybe, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3f3lpo/post_your_favorite_alternate_media_fanfiction/ctlfo3o][this outline]]?

  "Sometimes I think my life would have been easier if I just walked away and let them catch you." Following Voldemort's victory, Hermione is Undesirable No 2 and in constant danger. Forced to accept help from Lucius Malfoy, the last man she could ever trust, she learns that maybe her first impression was incorrect. Some people really do want to help and others just want her dead.

  After years of captivity, Hermione Granger fights her way onto the streets of Voldemort's London with only the knife in her pocket and the blood on her hands. There's a checkpoint on every corner, a curfew enforced by Voldemort's most trusted followers, and the only way back to the Boy Who Lived is through the Death Eater who let her be captured in the first place. DM/HG. COMPLETE

** There's Prince of the Dark Kingdom, although that's Harry-centric. I also started reading Resolution, which is from Hermione's point of view.
