** This isn't exactly what your asking for but it's similar. The basic premise is an awful Harry show up in a close to cannon universe. Linkffn(12307886)

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

** Snape's not in it, but linkAo3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6854605]]) is about Harry waking up in an alternate universe where he was raised by his parents and apparently grew up to be a complete dick lol

  When Harry wakes up in an alternate timeline--a timeline where Voldemort was defeated long before the first war--he discovers everything is different. His parents, his godfather, his friends--and him. Harry must deal with the consequences of who he would have been if he had been raised by his parents, and figure out where he stands with his casual hook up, Draco Malfoy.
