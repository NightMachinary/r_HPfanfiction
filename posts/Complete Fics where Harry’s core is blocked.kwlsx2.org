Fics where Dumbledore or his parents had blocked part of his core when he was young and it wasn't removed until Harry discovered those blocks. 60k+ words preferred

***** To be clear, this is not canon. It's a fanfiction concept that is often used to give Harry a massive power spurt without writing anything about him actually gaining power.

****** I like this concept because I don't think any prophesied person can be below average like how Harry is in canon. It would have been alright if 16 year old Harry was as powerful as 16 year old Tom, and then he had “love” or something else as the “power he knows not”. But canon Harry is too pitiable, gullible and weak throughout the series except for rare cases....

******* I think you're mixing fanon with canon. Canon Harry wasn't as pathetic as the fandom makes him out to be. Yes, he was mistreated but it wasn't like he ever bowed down to the Dursleys. He talked back and he wasn't exactly a pushover as a wizard either. He fought adults and outmaneuvered a dragon at 14! How is he below average!? Just because he's not god level? Also prophecies making someone powerful is lazy writing as well. Just saying he can be powerful because "HE'S THE CHOSEN ONE" is boring and uninspired. Instead we see Harry make mistakes, get lucky, and with a lot of help he wins.
