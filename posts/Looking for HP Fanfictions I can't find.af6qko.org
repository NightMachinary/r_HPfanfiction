There are two Fics that I read a while ago on FF.net and would love to read them again.

1. Takes place in GOF where the champions work together. They are punished for it and have to wear bracelets that put them through pain if they help one another. would be a big help if someone could tell me the name.

2. Snape is Daphne Greengrass's godfather and after Ron and Hermione abandon Harry on the horcrux quest they find him and help him. Harry/Daphne pairing.

Hopefully they haven't been removed.

Cheers!


** The second one is "The Wrong Choice". Doesn't seem to be on FFN anymore, but could be elsewhere. It was like 56k words written in 2009 or 2010.

*** Cheers, at least I have the name now, you're a legend, do you know maybe why it isn't on FFN anymore?
