So I know it a past time to degrade and laugh at the stupid decisions of the movie.

And also complain about Movie!Ron.

But is there anything that you think was done better in the Movies.

This can be a change or a plot point you are glad was dropped.

As an example: I prefer Umbridge in the movies.


** I agree on Umbridge.

I also think Snape's arc was handled better. Mind you, I think Book Snape is a far more compelling character as such --- dramatic beats stoic any day, as good an actor as Rickman might have been --- but he was not at all suited to the attempt by Rowling to make him into a flawed but ultimately admirable figure. Movie Snape is less amusing in the first four stories for losing most of his sharper edges, but in exchange, his shift into a tragic figure is much smoother, and his death is genuinely heartbreaking.

*** It helps that Rickman is charismatic as hell.

His introduction in movie 1 is basically his entire character and it works so well.

And on umbridge its because I really dont like her moral.ugliness equals physical ugliness thing.

Umbridge is a kind old woman in appearance in movie 5 and that works she looks like your mother.

Then she opens her mouth. That is more realistic.

Concerning Rickman --- yeah, undeniable charisma. But then again, I never /quite/ bought him in those early movies simply because I still wish we'd gotten to see "ever-irritated ball of nerves" Snape on the big screen instead of that stone-faced impostor.

Perhaps. I haven't seen that, I'm just going off how his character is portrayed in the books vs the movies. It's possible she had it in mind throughout the series, but it's still a shit arc. He's still shown to be pretty horrid in DH but he does a few good things and all of a sudden he's a full on hero who really didn't do anything wrong the entire time.

The redemption arc works in the movies (one of the few good things the movies did) because really Snape was just sarcastic and an unpleasant guy, who fucked up but what never shown to be really bad. We see a bit of his history and find out that the only really bad thing he's done in the movies, killing Dumbledore, was actually planned. Whereas the books show him to be a spiteful, abusive teacher, completely selfish, at least somewhat racist, with a strange and downright disturbing obsession with Lily, who, while seemingly regretful (at least that his actions led to Lily's death, not really for his other actions), doesn't really do much to repent.

- Dolores Umbridge is not ugly and toad faced

** Sounds ridiculous to bring up something like music -since obviously a book doesn't come with a soundtrack- but I think the Harry Potter franchise wouldn't be as culturally relevant if it wasn't for the aesthetic-setting atmosphere brought to the film by their soundtracks. It just THROWS you into the world, a few notes at the start of A Window to the Past and it's October, Sirius Black is on the loose and there's Dementors around Hogwarts. Same with the Hogwarts March for Goblet of Fire, each film has its own themes that suit it perfectly.

The films and their music have an also Spielberg/John Williams relationship, instantly recognisable and so mood-setting. When the inevitable remake/tv series comes I sincerely hope they use either similar themes or remaster the old ones.

Or get another composer in to create themes of similar quality; if the remakes want to stand as their own thing rather than forever be in the shadow of the originals, I think that might be wisest.

Although I also think it might be nice to just take the best themes from all composers and then apply them /consistently/ across the whole series (and it will be a series, I have no doubts, not seven live-action films; I fear it may still be live-action, but a series it will be), rather than go the way of the original eight films, where the first two films had consistent leitmotifs only for Cuaron to wreck everything as early as #3. The Hogwarts March as early as the first Quidditch Match on the one hand, variations on John Williams's Voldemort Theme throughout the /HBP/ flashbacks on the other --- now you're talking.

Because it's undoing one of Voldemort's last crimes --- remember, the wand was supposed to lie with Professor Dumbledore forever, and the Dark Lord only got it out by desecrating it. It's not a matter of preference; the /right/ thing to do for Harry is to put this desecration to right.

But remember Voldemort was never the master of the wand and was still able to do some horrible shit with it, even though he was not the master of the wand he was still gifted incredible power from using it. What stops some other Dark Lord, down the line, from also desecrating Dumbledore's tomb (again) and stealing the wand (again)?

However, in the movie, Harry becomes the master of the notorious Death Stick, a wand so powerful it even tempted Voldemort AND Dumbledore (in his youth) to seek it out. And instead of using it to make himself even more powerful (or possibly make his life even easier) he does what someone should have done centuries ago and snaps it. Finally ending the cycle of bloodshed. Fittingly doing so at the end of a bloody final conflict of a war.

Been a while since I read /Deathly Hallows/, but are we sure the Elder Wand performed any better for Lord Voldemort than a regular wand would have? He does do amazing things with it, but no less amazing than what he's capable of in general, I believe.

Even if you were right, though, I think the idea is that since the magic of the wand is so reliant on being passed on through murder, it will outright /die/ alongside its last owner --- flat-out stop working, if not disintegrate into ash.

******* As far as I'm aware (been a while since I read DH too) but Voldemort was clearly satisfied by the wand's power up until he killed Snape and, though it is a bit disingenuous because we don't get much in the way of Voldemort's thought process, he doesn't have any further complaints about the wand after he does the deed. I think it may be a placebo effect or Voldemort felt a marked difference between using his wand, Malfoy's wand and then the Elder Wand, otherwise he probably wouldn't have kept using it.

And I'd like to believe that the wand would just wither but I don't believe that to be the case. It isn't even reliant on being passed on by murder because it's final masters were Dumbledore (who didn't kill Grindelwald), Draco (who won its loyalty by disarming Dumbledore) and Harry (who did the same).

******** Yeah, I meant "defeat", not "murder".

Actually, if one buys the Tale of the Three Brothers at face value rather than assume it's an exaggeration of the Peverells /building/ the Hallows, it could be that the master of the wand dying naturally would mean the wand's ownership reverts to Death himself, allowing him to finally withdraw his reluctant and dangerous gift from the mortal world.

At any rate, there /is/ a precedent on Pottermore for wands dying with their owners, though not Elder ones. So there's that.

I'm the total opposite. The muggle clothing ruined my suspension of disbelief. See, the Wizarding World is at a civil war fought on cultural and racial lines. The most stuck up defenders of pureblood supremacy dress... as upperclass muggle. Malfoy's appearance in the 6th movie, when the war is at the earnest, is like the leader of the Hitler Youths dressed in traditional Jewish clothes.

On the contrary, the racial and cultural divide could have been told through fashion, with characters showing their support for one side or the other through the way they choose to dress as well as their actions.

In the books, he avoids her and agrees with her parents to keep her safe. In the movies, they walk hand in hand towards their doom, acknowledging they are in this together and will both fight. In the movies, they kiss before departing with both understanding they have their own battles to fight going forward. Harry doesn't stop her from fighting, she doesn't stop him.

In the books, McGonagall is the one to yell out upon seeing Harry's "lifeless" body. In the movies, it's Ginny.

There were some good moments for Hinny in the book, like how she was his last thought. But overall, I thought the movies showed Harry accepting and embracing the bravery of Ginny much better. Also, the movies omitted the few scenes in the books which showed everyone around Ginny treating her like a child. This would be irrelevant if the books then gave Ginny a moment to prove herself, but they did the opposite. So in this case, it was addition by subtraction.

**** Ginny is a background character only in the sense she isn't a main character like the trio or Dumbledore. But she has as much presence in the books as Neville, and arguably more. Certainly as much as Luna, who was developed significantly. In the books, we learn many things about Ginny that a reasonable person would consider interesting. She has a sharp, cutting sense of humor. She has a short temper and can be a bit mean, especially towards Ron. But she's also fiercly loyal and defends her friends. She did so for Luna (don't call her loony) and Neville, when she told him he wasn't worthless. She's very good at Quidditch and even has a backstory of sneaking out at night to steal her brother's brooms. We get into her dating life and find out how much she hates being coddled and treated like a princess. She doesn't suffer surliness in her partner, and she also won't let anyone shame her for kissing her boyfriend. But she can be vicious when defending herself, and is too independent for her own good at times. Most notably, she gets on incredibly well with Harry, knowing when to stand up to him and when to have his back, and when to let him go.

We literally get none of that personality in the movies. Just a couple awkward stares, a weird single line in each movie, and that god-awful shoelace scene. Ginny in the movies is a wallflower and incredibly submissive. This is the exact opposite from the books. She doesn't even have a coherent narrative in HBP, which is the character's showcase books. We see her talking to Dean, kissing him once, then she's flirting with and kissing Harry in secret. Did she dump Dean? Is she actually with Harry? We don't know!

Most discussions here are basically strongly-held opinions. But I'd argue "the movies butchered Ginny" argument is as close to an objective fact as one can get.
