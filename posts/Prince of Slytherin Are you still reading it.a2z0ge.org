I'm genuinely curious. I just found out it updated a week ago, looked at it, thought, "Meh," and moved on without reading the update. At this point, I can't bring myself to even skim it.


** I'm not. I couldn't stand the Snape glorification, the Potter bashing, and the lack of subversion even at chapter 105 (which is around when I stopped reading). Also I'm not going to wait for an update that yet again fails to move the plot forward.

**** I /almost/ stopped reading when Snape "put down" Lily, and then all of the reviews were like, "Yeah, go Sev! Leave that tart behind, she doesn't deserve you." WTF people? Snape was bullying Mudbloods. That's /in canon/. Lily was right to cut Snape off and I admire her for it. It takes a lot of guts to leave a toxic relationship.

Edit: It reminds me of how people blamed Ariana Grande for Mac Miller's death. For some reason, it's the woman's fault every time a man makes a mistake.

***** Oh my god. I never looked at the reviews, but these are disgusting:

#+begin_quote
  I mean really when you think about, from what we know of Lily and James, they were horrible people,\\
  James mercilessly and cruelly bullied people for 7 years simply because of their house, whilst Lily abandoned her best friend of 10 years simply because he insulted her once in anger after being bullied by James, and then she proceeded to Date and Marry that same guy who spent 7 years bulling her best friend.

  I mean what kind of person must you be to do that?
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  Hurray. He was always too good for her.
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  Wow. Lily seriously disgusts me. That woman is a coward.
#+end_quote

Then there's these people who give me hope for humanity:

#+begin_quote
  Snape sure has a holier than thou attitude considering what a horrible person he is.
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  I know it's necessary for their characterization (every WBWL fic has to have evil!Potters and good!Snape) but it gets annoying... Plus Lily's reaction to Snape when they were children had good grounding. If I were in the same position (and I have been in one close to it), I would stop being friends with him, too.
#+end_quote

I also took a look at the reviews for the last chapter, which really clenched it for me.

#+begin_quote
  In canon, Snape knew Lupin was a werewolf BEFORE he entered the Whomping Willow. He brought it all on himself. Also it occurred BEFORE the pantsing incident. James probably attacked Snape to get back at him for trying to get Lupin in trouble, but he couldn't really say that to Lily since Lupin had to remain a secret, hence the, "It's because he exists."

  I also love how you implied that an attempt at murder is excusable, while pantsing someone (which we don't know if it even happened, the scene cut off before then) is absolutely unforgivable. Snape is far worse than James ever was. I don't understand why you glorify him while bashing James.

  Also, when are you going to invert the tropes? I haven't seen real evidence of that yet, and this is Chapter 108 already.
#+end_quote

Tl;dr: Take a look at reviews before you start reading stories.

***** You stopped reading because of the reviews? What a weird thing to do. This fic, as entertaining as it is, has a lot of reasons to drop (like the apparent incapacity of the author to understand the concept of 'show, don't tell'), but this one has to be the dumber by far, IMHO.

****** I feel like you didn't read my response at all. I said I /almost/ stopped reading because of that scene and the reviews. That implies I didn't let it stop me from continuing and, if you read further in the response thread, you'll know I at least made it up to the Lockhart reveal (in fact I dropped the story at Ch 106).

Also it's not /dumb/ at all to drop a fic because of the reviews. Authors appeal to their reviewers and write what's expected of them in order to retain their audience. As a result, the reviews can tell you a lot about the direction of the story. But thank you for your honest opinion. :)

******* You're right, I didn't read your post with enough attention, sorry. I get the point, however I think it's the other way around. The author wrote and the public reacts. Sometimes the author listens to the reviewers (or to some reviewers) for good or il, but it's besides the point. It isn't the reviewers who write the fic. Besides, a good author seldom gives the audience what it wants, as it doesn't usually promotes conflict in the story.

Whoa there. I don't like to be insulted, but don't insult someone for something /I/ said. I was the one who ultimately gave up the fic based off reviews (which is a legitimate way to decide if a fic is good or worth continuing, btw).

******* I guess it came out wrong there, no insult was intended. I do find that dumb, yes, as amongst all the legitimate reasons this fic contains which would justify dropping this fic (Providing you need one, which isn't a given), you're choosing one which have very little to do with the story, and a lot with how others view it. There's nothing personnal here, and no attack on anyone.\\

I don't really mind the tropes not subverting as promised, I don't mind tropes as long as they're well-written, but I hate boring training and studying scenes and there are just so damn many.

One thing I've thought about doing is unfollowing and just coming back every three months or so to read a good chunk of chapters, hopefully there might be something satisfying in there rather than just ending each individual one feeling let down.

** No. I lost interest during summer after 2nd year. It kind of jumped the shark a bit, you know? Like, I'm all for the basic concept of WBWL fics and Slytherin fics. I enjoy the premise. And up until then, this one was really good with its treatment of Lockhart and actually having somewhat competent antagonists and excellent esoteric magics and the whole Fred/George thing. But once summer after 2nd year came along... You've got Jim and Ron going to India and learning magic martial arts, the parselmagic is literally just saying the same spell name but with a longer s, Su Li ending up becoming a "Chinese-British computer geek Goth witch", Anthony Goldstein making really out-of-place Holocaust references... It just doesn't work as well for me.

*** I'm all for developing side characters, but actually focusing on them? It takes me out of the story, it detracts from the plot, and I'm simply not that interested. I'm of the opinion that you shouldn't have more than 3 POV's in a story; more than that creates too many mini-plots and the author loses the main story line, as PoS has done.

Also Anthony making comparisons to the Holocaust is /especially/ odd when the author has Death Eater-apologism at the same time. Were the Nazis human? Yes. Should we study their choices so it doesn't happen again? Most definitely yes. But that does /not/ mean they are forgivable.

I don't really like the Theo plot though, which was the last chapter I read and is probably somewhat why I stopped reading updates as they come. It just seems to dark/depressing, and also a bit over powered that it's even possible.
