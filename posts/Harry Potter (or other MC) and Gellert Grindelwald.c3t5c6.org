Any time traveling fics that include interactions between Harry or any other MC from Harry's time? Thanks.


** Also not time travel, but a reformed Gellert Grindelwald is now a supporting character in linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) as of Fifth Year, having been wheeled in from Nurmengard as a Judge of the Triwizard Tournament for complicated reasons.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** No time travel (I don't like those), but still linkao3(18009311) is a great story of meeting with Grindelwald.

  Gilderoy Lockhart landed himself in St Mungo's after his 'Cornish Pixies' class. Where can a headmaster now find another Defence teacher, one who's knowledgeable beyond doubt, willing to face the curse on the position, and available to start in a few days? In Nurmengard, that's where.
