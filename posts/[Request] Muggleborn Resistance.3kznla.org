Hey guys,

it's another request (yes I know, but posting them separately makes this less messy) from me, this time I would like stories that involve muggleborns demanding more rights in the Wizard world or resisting the pureblood laws that curtail their freedoms (Hell, a fiction involving Voldemort as the champion of the muggleborns - instead of the purebloods - would be great (if such a thing exists...I've read one such fiction and I've been reading fanctions for over a decade now), I mean the guy is a Halfblood and he could have easily been bullied (by purebloods, as that seems part of the Hogwarts experience - teachers seem to be ignoring it and they probably don't even feel guilty about it!) and have decided to do something about it, only to be ignored by Dumbles and the teachers (thus he creates his movement!)). The resistance can be peacefully (and/or through the legal system) or by force (and use of political power, publicity etc.), I don't care.

Please though: Don't give me Slash (at least not involving the main character) - Het is ok (Smutt is ok, too) and Gen is acceptable as well :) and please indicate if Harry is the main protagonist (I prefer those stories but will check out others if they come highly recommended)

  All is seemingly well in Wizarding Britain as the last aftershocks of the War against the Dark Lord fade away, but a series of murders lead ace Auror Daphne Greengrass to a threat that may throw her world yet again into imbalance.

** Not sure if it is what you are looking for, but my first story and its prologue, linkffn(10993575) linkffn(10595005) deal with muggleborns in Britain revolting after Voldemort's fall. It's not really a civil rights movement though, but an armed revolution, and the main part of the story focuses on dealing with Magical Europe's reaction to that.

*** Indeed, stories like that (armed revolutions) are part of what I am looking for - same as stories where they use other means (peaceful resistance/civil disobedience, trying to acquire political power or even pay a lawyer to represent them/use the legal system to get what they want) - so, thank you, I'll check them out (well: Prologue to a Revolution anyway, I've read the other one already -.-)

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
