This idea just popped in my head, and I'd like to read it, if something like this has been done skillfully.


** There's one called Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday by bobsaqqara. I don't know if it's exactly what you're looking for, but it's really good and only four chapters long. I can't link on mobile but here's the summary "AU Sixteen years to the day after her first born son was murdered, Professor Lily Potter must deal with the arrival of six unknown people. Post OotP. Reedited and reposted"

** The closest I can think of is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/][Dimension Hopping for Beginners]], where a super!Harry meets a canon Harry and a bunch of AU Harrys borrowed from crappy fanfics.

** This does sound really interesting... Thinking back, I can't believe I've never read something like this! (and I have read a lot of fic.) You'd think such an interesting idea would have been at least attempted! I'll have to have a look.

** Sly and griff is sorta like that but its cracky

Cant find the link but its basically they are two different dimension Harrys (one sorted slythern the other gryffendor) and they have a pet raptor. Thr story starts off with a proffesor lily and rose potter. Oh and daphne and Hermione are the Ice queens of hogwarts
