I'm looking for Percy Weasley fics that go into the time he was 'cut off' from the family. I would like these fics to mostly follow canon and without unnecessary bashing. Can be one-shots or longer.


** linkffn(12181042) is partially from Percy's POV, in a mostly canon-compliant DH setting where Fleur and Percy's future wife Audrey were best friends and they all work together to create a a way to help those being targeted for Azkaban by Death Eaters. I remember liking it.

** link ffn(The scarlet pimpernel)

There's one post-war that I quite liked but can't find. Percy had a fake relationship with his secretary (Bulstrode?). Perhaps someone else will know it.

  What are you going to do?" she asked softly. "I'm going to fight back." Percy replied calmly. What Percy was really up to during Deathly Hallows. Teaming up with some unlikely allies, he tries to bring the persecuted to freedom... and stay alive.

** linkffn(4007457)

Also linkffn(3784000), though it did have some Weasley bashing, closer to the end. I actually quite liked most of the story but was disappointed by the last few chapters.

  Percy Weasley recieves some fictional inspiration before realizing that Authority, though Authority, is not always right. Through DH, he tries to do the right thing, rescue Muggleborns without losing his life or his job, and find the right laws. Complete.

  It's been coming on for a while," said Percy ... "But I had to find a way out and it's not so easy at the Ministry, they're imprisoning traitors all the time." DH, ch30 . This is Percy's journey to that point.

  It's the summer after OotP, and Percy Weasley is a man without a mission. Mildly crossover-ish with Angel the Series.
