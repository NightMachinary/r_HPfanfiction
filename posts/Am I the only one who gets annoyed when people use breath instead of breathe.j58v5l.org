It's literally a basic grammatical point, but I see it done so much. Just wondered if I'm the only one given how widespread it is


** You are not alone. I'm annoyed when writers use 'than' when it should be 'then.'

*** And then there is 'should of' and 'could of' which is an extra layer of annoying.

** - Breath/Breathe
- Were/Where/We're
- Then/Than
- There/Their
- To/Too
- Rein/Reign (you "rein someone in" or "give them free rein", in reference to controlling a horse)
- "Tow the line" when it's supposed to be "Toe the line" (as in, put your toes to the line so you're properly aligned with everybody else)
- "Imperious Curse" instead of "Imperius Curse" (HP-fic-specific)

Plenty of others I'm sure I'm forgetting...
