The Cursed Child feels like a big mess of wasted potential to me. I like the idea of one Potter kid, stuck in the middle, not being able to find a way to fit into the wizarding world like their siblings (e.g. popular James or sociable Lily), but I hated everything about how CC did it.

So, I was wondering if there are any stories along these lines out there:

Albus wasn't just a not-very-good wizard - he couldn't do magic at all. The quiet, squib child of the most famous wizard alive, in the middle of a loud, widely magically talented family. He reluctantly goes out into the muggle world, expecting his life to be a constant downward trajectory, but is surprised to find a place where he fits in, with people who understand him. Almost like a reverse of Harry's story, only without the abuse (though I also like the idea of a well-meaning if misunderstanding Potter-Weasley clan). He finds his own place, his own people, and then steadily realises his life is split in two; the wizarding world and the muggle one. (I also like the idea of a story where the Potter-Weasley kids have friends who aren't each other.)

Anyone have any ideas?

â€‹

EDIT: I think I also just really like the idea of one of the next-gen kids having their own friend group/life outside the family clan. Anything like this, with non-squib elements, would be great too!


** I don't think I've ever come across a squib!Albus fic, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/287028][We Were the Potters]] linkao3(287028) has squib!Lily, so maybe it's of interest? (It's not a cheerful fic.)

  How does one deal with a child who is different? Some do, some can't bring themselves to.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
