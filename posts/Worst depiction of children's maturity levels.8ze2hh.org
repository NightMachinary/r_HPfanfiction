Just re-read Wit of the Raven, It's interesting, but half of the fun of it has been how inappropriate everyone has acted for their age. Neville thinks with his dick, Snape acts like Harry's work colleague, Hermione curses more fluidly than Malcolm Tucker, the list goes on.

Which story have you read with the most inappropriate maturity level for their ages? Does it bother you? How can writers improve?


** Personally I don't really mind mature kids. Children get annoying really fast. By mature of course i mean wise and non impulsive. A 11 year old really shouldn't be hormonal and all those start dating at first year, married by 3rd year plots, ugh. And a first year being in the Wizengamont with everyone taking him seriously...

I do despise infantilizing. You can see it in many fics with Snape in a parental role. Situations where a 14-15 year old Harry breaks down and starts wailing and sniffling and has to be sat on Snapes lap... I'd give you fic examples but i've gone to a lot of effort to forget such... abominations.

I'd do much rather the dialogue be standard English that the reader can sound out however they'd like. Hagrid and Fleur also tend to have badly written accents.

This may be more on point than you realize. Off the top of my head, I can't say I know how 5 year old kids speak. I certainly wouldn't be confident trying to accurately write dialogue for one.

** Anytime an author has a character holding Harry like a 5 year old on their hip when he's 11+, Ive seen fics where he's 16 and he has that happening to him because of his height. This is ridiculous. This would never happen. It is stupid. Do you remember being 11 and having yourself picked up, placed on their hip with your legs wrapped around them like a 5 year old? No. I bet you didn't even want to be picked up like that at that age. It is one of the easiest things of bad writing to spot. It's just bad. It may be difficult to write children, but pre-teens and teens are slightly easier and really just think back to when you were that age 'would i have allowed someone to do this to me' sure for things that need more of the characters own personality in there that wouldn't work but there are a LOT of things that could be solved by asking yourself this.

If you want Harry to act lke he's 5 than make it a pre-hogwarts fic, not one where he's fucking 16. Or de-aged. Drives me insane, it is so cringey.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** I tend to remind myself that I turned 12 and started swearing, and at my school kids started going on “dates” when we were 11. So kids acting too “grown up” isn't really something that bothers me unless they're emulating Shakespeare.

But. I've read some bad fics where they try to work through Harry's depression and ptsd. And suddenly he's sitting on Sirius' lap sniffling. And it makes me so fucking uncomfortable it's unreal.

**** Everyone is different so there isn't one correct way to portray someone at a certain age. They were likely just thinking of their own experiences and did not realize that other people experienced things differently. I was a late bloomer myself and I really don't like fics where characters curse, smoke, and think about/have sex all the time because it's completely not relatable for me.

At age 12 I remember really liking Pokemon and being super naive. I did not start caring about dating, boys or anything like that until I was 16/17.

Although I agree that some characterizations of Harry in mentor fics are just absolutely terrible. I like fics that put him in the middle of the two extremes but it's kind of hard to find those.

*** My god, you've just made me realize why I have a problem in /another/ fandom. There's this one (adult) character that fanfic writers like to write as just falling apart and sniffling on his love interest's lap because he's had a cold, hard life up until that point, and... well, sometimes adults really do cry and need to be comforted, but it's just how childish it comes off as. I'm into some kinky infantilism on occasion, but when that's not the intent, it comes off as supremely awkward to me.

On a more on-topic note about the Shakespeare, as a preteen and young teen I regularly had people commenting that I spoke like a novel. According to a course I took on speech in child development, kids typically sound like they're reading straight from a book at age 11. It's just that their speech and narrative abilities are at that stage where they're emulating stuff they read.

A 4 y/o is going to have a lot of repetition and simple sentences telling you a story, a 7 y/o is going to be more coherent but still lacking in that creative description, and an 11 y/o might just launch into the most cliche purple prose you've ever heard if they love to read. A 13-15 y/o is going to tone that down a lot since they're refining more of their own speech style.

** I actually don't at all mind smart kids. I myself was a (fairly normal) smart kid and I know plenty of smarter kids than me at young ages who were /very/ skilled and knowledgeable about certain fields if they'd been raised that way and had tutors etc. and were single-mindedly focused on certain things either from their own desire or by pushy parents. So for that reason, exteremely smart!precocious Hermione, and AUs with oddly polite and socially trained Pureblood 11 year olds and even things like young!tactical genius Harry don't bother me so much. It's perfectly possible for kids to be like that - they'll just end up lacking in other areas because they haven't developed them as much as other kids if they've put all their development points into one zone. I actually think that sometimes makes for interesting flawed characters who may make interesting mistakes in the eyes of 'normal' readers.

What breaks immersion for me though is sexual kids. Sex itself is icky to think about or read about happening, so that's dealbreaker #1. Kids of age 11 or 12 talking about sex among themselves or about /having/ sex with other kids they know is dealbreaker #2 - if anything, most would be too shy to talk realistically, they might boast, or talk about older adults (them /doing it/, dirty jokes etc.), or laugh at sex, but they wouldn't be serious about it. Dealbreaker #3 is kids of a certain age - preteens and early teens especially being...raunchy. Most kids of that age just aren't confident enough to talk openly about such things or well-developed enough to have any desire to actually do them - and I most frequently see it in characters like Harry who are otherwise portrayed as a little shy and socially awkward, so it doesn't really stack up for me.

I guess those are my main dealbreakers. One that's not /as/ common I guess but is still there enough for me to mention it would be Hermiones that fall back on 'oh, I'm only a girl, what do I know?' Even if Hermione /does/ have internalized sexism or whatever or doubts herself, she'd never admit it to strangers! And probably not even to her friends. If she's anything, Hermione Granger is self-sufficient to the point of making herself ill and /does not/ ask for help, which gets her in trouble more than once. I just feel that's the sign of an author falling back on stereotypes to try and write a /girl/ instead of, y'know, looking at the /person/ the source text portrays and just remembering to use she/her pronouns for her.

*** Interesting thoughts about "sexual kids". Thinking back in my own memories (rusty, crusty things), I definitely remember some things.

•Being called "sexy" by a boy in Kindergarten. This was the very late 70s and this kid wore a Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders shirt nearly every day, so he might have been ... advanced.

•Dirty jokes on the playground in third grade. I have a specific memory of one boy saying, "Yeah, we'll 'pry it open' (I think in the context of prying open a window?), but gesturing at my crotch.

•My BFF in 5th and 6th grades was a boy (gay, but didn't know it then) and we were constantly asked if we were "going around".

•In 7th grade, I remember being in the school library and one of the "cool girls" just waltzed right up to me and asked if I was a virgin. I was the bookish fat girl and I'm sure she was trying to embarrass me. I remember somehow feeling like a failure, but then like 20 years later I was like, "Of course I was a virgin! WTF, Angela?"

I started developing around 5th grade and I definitely got comments from 10 and 11-year-old boys. And then the rest of my junior high and high school years were of course full of good old-fashioned American raunch. I used to be a substitute teacher aide and I saw a group of boys hold a girl so another boy could kiss her. This was in kindergarten and at another school, a group of third grade boys dragged a first grade girl into the boy's bathroom and pulled up her shirt.

These are my own experiences which I know certainly don't match everyone else's but I do think it's a bit disingenuous to think that kids around that age don't have sexual thoughts.

And too add, from personal experience: Kids of ages 14 is not unusual (from personal experience), and 13 is certainly not unheard of.

I also remeber hearing of pictures of a 12 year old that had somehow "gotten around" in our school (her boyfriend gave them to everyone, afaik he got in deep trouble). I never saw those, but apparently they were somewhat sexual.

Dirty jokes were always traded from 11+, especially in dorms (for example when staying in hostels), or when having sleepovers.

Now, when I look at 14 year olds it's kind hard to imagine, because they are so young, but I know from my memories that at least a few probably have some "experience".

And yeah, the boys pulling the girl into the bathroom was really bad. If I remember correctly, those boys got expelled from the school. Oh, and! In a first grade class I worked in, one girl learned how to masturbate and taught several of the other girls. She was an English language learner and her mom was pretty religious, so the teacher didn't tell the mother because she was afraid of the mom carrying out retribution on the little girl, so we spent a lot of time reminding her to keep her hands on top of the desk.

**** Oh yeah. I remember from my school days... As young as nine or ten, my classmates were delighting in sex talk. I was a total prude when I was a kid, so I was mainly just annoyed by it, but a good number of the kids LOVED making sexual references and innuendoes... usually not directly to the teachers, but to each other and around each other. A lot of it had this "teeheehee, we're so naughty" edge to it... they KNEW they weren't supposed to talk about or be interested in such things, and that made it all the more fun to talk about.

When I was around ten, the kids my age had a game going on about who could trick who into saying something sexual, so that the victim could be made fun of. "Ha ha, you just said you had sex! Lots and lots of seeex!" And of course, there was this group of girls who delighted in LOUDLY singing bawdy songs in the schoolyard, about how they had sex and got pregnant, hallelujah.

Even prudish little me had several sexual thoughts and feelings at that age... I was just in total denial about them. It's only now, more than sixteen years later, that I really realize what sort of feelings I had. I had my first wet dream when I was ten... I just didn't realize that it WAS a wet dream at the time; I just woke up all confused and discovering that I had been masturbating in my sleep... the fact that the dream was about another girl was also something I didn't realize what meant until I was an adult and found out that I was bisexual.

Kids are sexual beings, it's just that their sexuality is different than adult sexuality. At that age sexual feelings are more about curiosity and exploration. You're usually immature about it, you don't actually KNOW anything, and for the most part the thought of actually HAVING sex is just.. icky. But when you're a kid your body is constantly growing and changing, and you sometimes get thoughts and feelings you don't understand and aren't quite ready to understand yet... but there's this little voice in your head that says "hmm, maybe boys AREN'T all gross..." and there is this feeling about something exciting and forbidden that you're not supposed to talk about or know about, and the thrill you feel knowing that you're being naughty...

Not saying you should turn Hogwarts into a porn campus and turn all the students into sex-obsessed sluts, but... they ARE at an age when puberty kicks in and hormones run rampant. It's generally more awkward than sexy for everyone involved, but it's probably just because Harry Potter is a kids' series that we don't get more innuendoes and sex jokes among the students....

And let's be realistic, when romance begins a-blossoming between the older students, probably not ALL of them keep it at a few chaste kisses.

I think JKR is definitely AWARE that such things would go on, but because she's writing for a younger audience, she keeps it to some VERY subtle hints and references. Ron definitely gets the most blatant, even if he's usually censored so that you don't actually hear which words he's using... but it's definitely not a coincidence that Ron is the one to make a "Uranus" joke at the age of fourteen.

*** I agree and disagree. I was a smart kid, as well. I picked up everything insanely quickly, but I also had some serious faults and they were obvious. I couldn't work in groups because I was a bit of a, “I know everything and you all know nothing!” kid. I also refused, point blank, to learn anything I did not instantly understand. The instant I was confused, the work was pointless. The whole pointy is that I was a rarity. Each class had, maybe, one smart kid that simply excelled. There were no geniuses in the class that could do things no one else could.

Essentially, I am stating that the whole ‘super genius Harry' and ‘mastermind Harry' fanfics are bullshit. Tom Riddle may have been intelligent and ahead of his peers, but he was not creating spells at the age of eleven. Hermione is exactly the same.

However, I do disagree with the sexual part. Kids are... quite perceptive about sex and picking up words they shouldn't use. I went to a Christian all boys' private school, so my experience is quite different due to actually being in a dormitory with 9 other boys on the best of years.

1. Sex was heavily discussed. Granted, at 11 it was more about boobs and porn mags that boys had stolen from their older brothers/dads. The dormitory may as well be a locker room.

2. Most boys are already masturbating by 11 or 12. I know, it's awful to think about, but it's true. Quite often it would start with talking about sex and then everyone would scurry to their beds and that's how it went. Then, people who didn't know, would simply ask or watch and repeat it.

3. You underestimate how nonchalant people can be when someone else talks. You don't want to be the boy that did not talk about boobs. Even if you're shy, you've bonded with these other people and they're your friends.

4. The stories are often exaggerated, but most people that spoke about it actually did do it. Experimentation was ripe. I know quite a few people who sucked dick or masturbated together.

5. I was a shy kid and I did most of it, too. I was highly socially awkward, afraid, and had very little to no friends, yet I would speak up.

I'm not sure if it's different between boys and girls, but boys give no fucks and brag about everything. I remember one boy would touch girls' boobs (who would stand near the fence after school) at twelve. He even got pictures!

Aside from this, teenagers as a whole are raunchy as hell because that's when it all starts. Puberty and being curious makes them do dodgy things. I remember I went to pick up a friend from high school (he went to a public school) and saw multiple girls leaving the boys' bathroom with their shirts messed up.

I'm Australian, so I cannot comment on swearing. I was swearing when I was 7.

Don't understand what the last paragraph has to do with anything.

***** I think poofter was the big one I learned and said as a young kid. I remember, at age 7 - 8, some boy stepped on the back of my shoes and I twisted around and said, "Don't step on the back of my shoes, you poofter!" He ran off, crying, and it was after I was pulled aside and spoken to did I realised I just said something highly offensive.

Once I realised that it was offensive and hurt feelings, I said it even more. Hahahaha.

**** fellow Aussie here,

I went to a public school, and I can honestly say that most of my experience lines up more or less with what you have said. substitute dorm room for a sleep over, and that's it.

I remember just starting at high school and it being a big deal when one of my male classmates got to feel up the boobs of the hottest girl in our grade. he wasn't even well liked by me/my friends, but every boy spent that homeroom crowded around him, asking him all about what it was like.

12 year old's can be horny idiots who do stupid stuff, especially when they think they can get away with it. This goes for both men and women.

*** Man people sure do hate MOR. It has a lot of flaws when it comes to the characters, pacing, prose, and stuff like that. Gag-inducing flaws, actually. But it also has some basic things that put it in the 99.9th percentile of fics in this Fandom. A foreshadowed (if anticlimactic, :/ ) climax. A thrilling middle scene where they break out of Azkaban. A plot that goes somewhere other than Canon and moves there steadily. A surprising twist. Interesting new magic that's plot relevant.

If MOR was even close to the worst fic, I'd never feel embarrassed to tell someone I'm reading hp fanfiction.

**** The real issue people have with it is the fans. The fans can act like it is the single greatest divine text ever put to work. Exaggerating a little, but that's the feeling a lot of people get whenever HPMOR shows its ugly face up. I was "meh" on it. There are some things in it I thought were really great, some of the standout HP fanfiction in my experience. There are some parts where I was, quite literally, shaking with rage at how completely fucking /inept/ the author was at basic science or psychology while acting like they were the fucking world authority on it. And a lot of it was just "meh". That's my personal opinion. But when you've got a not-insignificant amount of the story that's utter bollocks psuedoscience and the like, combine it with the author's attitude and combine that with the fan's uberdedication to the fanfic... it can lead to some heavy pushback from those who weren't as impressed.

****** The one that I recall most vividly, due to my fiancé at the time having PTSD, was the utter /smugness/ he had about "repressed memories don't exist, they're complete pseudoscience". Repressed memories are highly controversial, mostly because they're super hard to distinguish between false memories, granted, but they're certainly a fucking thing because I spent six years picking up the pieces after I accidentally kicked the trauma lying underneath one of them.

** There needs to be a balance otherwise it comes off as completely fake. They're not adults so their speech and thought process should be simpler. Even Hermione, brilliant even in /Philosopher's Stone/, was rather simple minded and had some really off priorities.

But at the same time, they shouldn't be infantilized by the older characters in the horror stories some of the other commenters mention. Really, JKR mostly got this right in canon so just look there.

** I'm not sure if it's the /worst/, but Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw

You've got these active political party 11 year old kids. It's not just super genius Harry, it's like half of them. On the Hogwarts train they separate into the three factions, strategizing, making plans on how to improve their political capital, recruit independents and possibly turn opposition. It's ridiculous.

Honestly though.. this particular fic manages to suspend my disbelief surprisingly well. Idk how. It helps that, for some reason or other, I tend to forget how young HP characters are. I usually subconsciously imagine them as ~15 at the youngest.

As others have said, overly mature is better than overly immature.

Maybe it's satire or something along those lines, but their maturity levels being silly isn't changed just because it's deliberate.

** Any fanfic where an exceedingly mature character convinced all the other kids to behave just like them is a huge turn-off for me. I don't remember what their titles were, but I remember reading several.

Things like talking like novels, reading scientific journals, et cetera aren't that unrealistic. I've been guilty of them when I was a kid. What turns me off is when said kid manages to make all their friends behave exactly the same as them. Um no. People aren't that homogeneous. They don't change their characters so easily, too.

Bonus negative points if the other kids who refused to be brainwashed and continue to act like kids (/which they are!/) get bashed throughout the fic.

** Linkffn(7405386) /My Brother!/ by Oracle2Phoenix is bad because the two main characters start out as ridiculously mature and then stay at exactly the same level - at least up to the point where I stopped reading. The story has them solving everyone else's problems with insight and wisdom from age about 10. The only thing that ever really levels up is their spellcasting.
