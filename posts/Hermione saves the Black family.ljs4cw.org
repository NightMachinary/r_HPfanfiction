I've been looking for this for quite some time now and I still can't find it so if anyone can tell me the title I'll really be greatfull!

It's Hermione/multiple pairing

Basically Hermione revives the men of the Black family? Also Narcissa and Andromeda protected her in the Battle of Hogwarts because they know she can help their family.

Thank you in advance!

  There are legends among the pureblood families about Keepers-special witches who have the power to restore a fallen House. If any House needed a Keeper, it's the Ancient and Noble House of Black. Hermione/Multi (Cygnus, Orion, Sirius AND Regulus). Polyandry.
