*** Dudley would be reach for any house. Brave? Only against 10-year olds. Bookworm? Yeah right. Loyal, hard working? Pbht. I'd be inclined to put him in Slytherin for ambition, he'd likely form a new trio with Crabbe and Goyle.

****** At 17, yes, at 11, not so much. Then again, theoretically the Hat is supposed to be able to see your potential to match the attributes the houses look for, not just what you're like at the time you're sorted. So spoiled Harry could still end up in Gryffindor (or Slytherin). Dudley could end up in Hufflepuff, he did eventually discover working hard to achieve something he wanted.

***** Of course they are! They want to get the best dang minions they can be! It doesn't really matter to who, and they aren't going to be following them into battle, but it's the minion life for them, and under the heir to an important family no less!

Do you have any idea how much ambition it takes, to actually hope to achieve such a privileged position? Of course you don't, nobody ever understands!

**** Dudley is a Hufflepuff through and through. We only see him through the eyes of a resentful Harry, but after book 4 he puts in the work to lose weight and change fat into muscle. Also, of all the Dursleys, he is the only one to worry for Harry and regret the fact that they are parting ways.

Sure, Dudley was a bully in his younger years and he was also raised to hate Harry and his kind (and he had the right considering that one wizard gave him a pig tail and another one gave him a candy that made his tongue purple and increase) but I think he was genuinely nice and sweet and the encounter with the Dementors definitely made him rethink his attitude.

**** The only fic I can remember that sent Dudley to Hogwarts had him as a Gryffindor and Harry as a Slytherin. Felt pretty weird.

**** Ok, which ambition besides be spoiled? I feel like the hat would actually have to take a page out of “Lily and the art of being Sysiphus by Carnivours-muffin” and create a new ‘Default' house for him.
