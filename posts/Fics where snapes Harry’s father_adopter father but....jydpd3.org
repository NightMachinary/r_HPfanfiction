But I really want it to be like they hate each other at first, like really hate each other all up till anywhere between 3rd and 5th year ish then either they find out snapes his actual dad or that snapes forced to adopt him by Albus and they really slowly start to get along?

Or where Harry's a baby/child and Snape has him from the start when lily and James die, r he rescues him from the dursleys

Maybe he's friends with Draco too that would be nice But absolutely no relationships please if they aren't: Draco and Harry, Snape and Lucius/Remus, or Sirius and Remus (if Sirius is there) I'm not against other ones but I don't wanna read them atm ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

I know I could find some myself but I want good suggestions ðŸ˜‚ and I can't seem to find any good ones atm cos I'm lazy despite looking on a site which is LITERALLY ALL of them are Snapes Harry's dad/guardian whateverðŸ˜‚


** I replied to a similar request the other day, here u go. They're all on AO3
