Come here and defend some tropes/cliches that you think get too much bad rep. Here are some of mine.

*Fleur's 'Allure' and other Veela things:* If I want to read a Fleur centric or Fluer paring fic, I want to see what makes it different than others. If I go just by canon, then Fleur is nothing but another gorgeous and talented girl. Might as well just choose someone like Katie Bell. The only thing that makes her stand out is that she's foreigner. The 'Allure' makes things spicey. Her being a Veela makes her clearly distinct from others. These makes things interesting especially in romace.

Sure some people go overboard with her making overly sexualized and "always on allure" and "flash puberty" /is/ stupid. But I'll still take those over her canon counterpart, who has a barebones of characterization. Say whatever you want but things like "no such thing as part Veela", Veela Bonds, Veela mates, fire affinity makes the lore richer.

Same goes for Harry being immune or resistant. It makes him stand out. I do think being resistant is much better than flat out immune. It showcases his willpower.

*Abusive Dursleys:* Canon Dursleys were already kind of abusive. They /did/ starve him, not to the point of dying, but still. Going from there to beating him from time to time doesn't seem so far-fetched.

Now, regularly breaking his bones, literally starving him to death, /raping?!/ That is on the too much side.

*Life Debts:* Now, I don't remember how literal Life Debts are in canon, but I do like the idea of some kind of magical binding if you selflessly save someone's life. Ginny, a certified Boy-Who-Lived fangirl, being owing a Life Debt to Harry makes things infinitely interesting. Here's a girl who was already starstruck with Harry, and now he has been a knight in shining armour for her, she magically owes him somethings, and Harry doesn't really care about all that. That's goldmine for drama.

*Marriage Contracts etc:* The wizarding world is so much stuck in the past, that these kinds of things are really not that unbelievable. I also like the theme that Harry wasn't allowed to have a good childhood, and now he wasn't allowed to be a free young man.

*Manipulative Dumbledore:* I personally don't really like this trope. But canon(intentionally or unintentionally) does have some basis for this. And it does make sense for a guy who has achieved so much in life to be a little grey. As long as you make Dumbledore a good guy in the end, I think it's fine.

​

Let the downvotes begin.


** One thing I don't like about fanon 'life debts' is the way characters announce that they owe someone a life debt in an overly formal and pretentious way. In canon life debts aren't necessarily acknowledged or even called 'life debts', but are still real in some mysterious magical way.

#+begin_quote
  "Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt... When one wizard saves another wizard's life, it creates a certain bond between them... and I'm much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter... This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry."

Much better than 'I, Peter of House Pettigrew, acknowledge my life debt to Harry of House Potter etc etc' or whatever.

*** Also, we don't know what effects that debt actually had on canon, but they're much less potent that fanon life debt. I mean, Pettigrew went on to resurrect Voldemort using kidnapped Harry's blood, he didn't live his life under a compulsion to serve Harry to the best of his ability.

**** Not under the compulsion, but (chapter 23 of DOH):

#+begin_quote
  The door flew open. For a split second Wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar, ablaze with light from the three miniature suns floating in midair. Then Harry and Ron launched themselves upon him. Ron seized Wormtail's wand arm and forced it upward; Harry slapped a hand to his mouth, muffling his voice. Silently they struggled: Wormtail's wand emitted sparks; his silver hand closed around Harry's throat.

  “What is it, Wormtail?” called Lucius Malfoy from above.

  “Nothing!” Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail's wheezy voice. “All fine!”

  Harry could barely breathe.

  “You're going to kill me?” Harry choked, attempting to prise off the metal fingers. “After I saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail!”

  /The silver fingers slackened. Harry had not expected it: He wrenched himself free, astonished, keeping his hand over Wormtail's mouth. He saw the ratlike man's small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise: He seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his hand had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had betrayed, and he continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to undo that moment of weakness./

  “And we'll have that,” whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail's wand from his other hand.

  Wandless, helpless, Pettigrew's pupils dilated in terror. His eyes had slid from Harry's face to something else. His own silver fingers were moving inexorably toward his own throat.

  “No ---”

  Without pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but there was no stopping it. The silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; he was being strangled before their eyes.

  “No!”

  Ron had released Wormtail too, and together he and Harry tried to pull the crushing metal fingers from around Wormtail's throat, but it was no use. Pettigrew was turning blue.

  “Relashio!” said Ron, pointing the wand at the silver hand, but nothing happened; Pettigrew dropped to his knees, and at the same moment, Hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead. Wormtail's eyes rolled upward in his purple face; he gave a last twitch, and was still.
#+end_quote

I think exactly the italicized paragraph is how the canonical sould bond is supposed to work: some small slip of magic, something doesn't work exactly as it should. And in this case, it saved both of their lives (and killed Pettigrew).

- Did the life debt force the silver hand to kill Pettigrew?

- Or did the silver hand, a magical gift from Voldemort, detect betrayal in Pettigrew (or somehow "listened" to Harry's words and realized that Pettigrew was compromised by a life debt) and acted like a killswitch?

The magic from a few books ago finally got around to it just feels a bit unsatisfying in comparison.

*** I think part of it comes down to why Pettigrew was sorted into Gryffindor. Deep down Peter /still/ wants to be like Sirius and James, still wants to embody bravery and loyalty. He believes that he owes something to Harry because of what happened in POA (and, I guess, Godric's Hollow) which is enough to cause the hesitancy (and Voldemort's silver hand does the rest).

Reading your quote there, maybe there's something a bit... I guess Narnian (reciting the deep magics) about it, but I've always seen it as more a "of course it's in your head, but why should that mean it's not real" type thing.

  The wizarding world is so much stuck in the past, that these kinds of things are really not that unbelievable
#+end_quote

So the wizarding world is somehow stuck in the past... even though Magical Britain in canon had better gender and racial equality than actual Britain did in the 1990s, and showed numerous examples of magical innovation and creativeness within canon? Seems legit.

I think people have a really absurd view of marriage contracts, and use the term synonymously with arranged marriages. An more accurate marriage contract would be a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_tax][Bachelor Tax]], something that dates as far back as *Ancient Rome*. Similarly, an alternative to fanon's absurdly stupid arranged marriage contracts would be simply be the Ministry passing a new [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_on_childlessness][law that that increased taxes on childless adults]]. Another alternative would be a law similar to Nazi Germany's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensborn][Lebensborn]] which gave German mothers money for each child they had with their German husband. A magical-equvalent would be giving financial aid to married witches who gave birth to magical children, with the requirement that those childrens' father also be a wizard. If the Ministry needs to be presented as remotely antagonistic, then adding in even more money for each "pure-blood" child would help.

The reason I don't like marriage contracts might sound petty, but its really because what fanon calls "marriage contract" is just "forcing Harry or Hermione to marry someone they don't want, such as Draco". This is usually because the writer in question lacks the ability to convincingly have Harry or Hermione be in a relationship with Draco/Snape/Lucius/Bellatrix/etc without it being a forced marriage. Such an attempt would likely result in a completely OOC Harry or Hermione, and/or even more commonly, downplaying the villainy of their partner.

Contrary to the circlejerk fanon likes doing, Magical Britain was CONSISTENTLY more progressive than Britain was. The gap obviously get closer over time, but the magical world is far more progressive and modern than their real-world counterpart in the same year, and in many ways is more socially advanced than the current world.

What people don't realise that those arranged "marriage contracts" wouldn't be designed for pure-blood families to intermarry, but likely to prevent inbreeding and/or reinforce pro-muggle values. Most importantly, they wouldn't be something that Harry or Hermione would be trapped it; all it would really do is inconvinence them. For example, the aforementioned Bachelor Tax or Childlessness Tax. The idea of Harry or Hermione being forced to marry someone doesn't make any sense since even actual marriage laws from centuries ago never forced people to get married.

IIRC, even Nazi Germany (a literal dictatorship) never technically forced 'aryan' German women to have loads of children with their equally 'aryan' German husband, but just gave them massive monetary incentives to encourage them. What they ACTUALLY did was send people to concentration or death camps for marrying and procreating with those deemed genetically inferior (Jews, disabled people, non-White people, and anyone else who wasn't German). In theory, Germans were never actually forced to marry a specific person under the Nazi regime, but instead told the groups of people they couldn't marry (i.e those who they deemed genetically inferior). An extreme example would literally just be [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Rappaport%27s_Law][Rappaport's Law]] exactly as it was shown in Fantastic Beasts... which was repealed in 1965. If Magical Britain had a similar law, it would be far less extreme and would have been repealed significantly earlier.

*TL;DR: Marriage contracts are dumb because they are mistakenly used synonymously with forced marriages. It reflects poor writing skill that the author can't convincingly pair-up two characters without it being forced. Actual marriage contracts would be closer to FB's Rappaport's Law; real-world examples would be Lebensborn, or a Bachelor Tax or Childlessness Tax.*

Toss in the fact that Purebloods control majority of the British Magical world?

Revolution would only happen if it was on the massive scale with no exclusions on blood purity. A couple people? Psssh, people wouldn't care. "Sucks to be them, at least it isn't me!" Now, when the majority of kids are taken, that's when people start screaming bloody murder. Those kids belong to Aurors, Healers, clerks, etc. They just say "fuck you" and don't show up to work. Then the british magical world grinds to a halt. Think Fight Club.

Now before you say that it's not possible, part of the reason that Dumbledore hid Harry at the Durselys was so that people like Malfoy couldn't grab him. Which the way Dumbledore said it, sounded highly possible.

The wizarding world is full of sheep, we have seven books cementing that fact. They will blindly believe whatever the person in power says, and if two people in power say differing things? They will believe whichever is prettier ala book5. You have to set the pasture on fire and kill off half their number before they are even willing to do anything. And even then, they go and blame the wrong person.

​

Even then, revolution? The muggleborn would have had one by now with how Wizarding Britain treated them over the years. Let's face it, it's a totalitarian government.

Going even further, look at book7. Where was the revolution? People didn't give a fuck, they would rather live in fear. All of those rebels? That was a paltry amount compared to the population. But the non rebels sure as shit celebrated the rebels win once it happened though.

​

So yes, in a normal world, mariage laws/contracts wouldn't work. The broken world of Harry Potter? You can bet your ass that it would work. Unless it's on a massive scale.

*** *Bachelor tax*

A bachelor tax is a punitive tax imposed on unmarried men. Such measures historically would be instituted as part of a moral panic due to the important status given to marriage at various times and places. As far back as Ancient Rome and more recently in the legislatures of New Jersey and Michigan, the supposed libertine or delinquent status of bachelor men was debated and taxes proposed as a solution. Still other locations would find reason to instantiate a bachelor tax for racial reasons (such as in South Africa), nationalistic reasons, to help cover welfare programs, or more simply as a pure revenue measure.

If people think they were subjecting Harry to extreme physical abuse, they'll read what's there in that context. Petunia /must/ have been trying to kill Harry, because that's how evil Petunia is, and Petunia is that evil because she tried to kill Harry.

** I immediately thought of the Soul-Bond trope. There are /so/ many bad fics that feature it, and they mostly just boil down to the author trying to make Harry as OP as possible, and to avoid drama between the two Soul-Bondees because they /understand each other so well./ However all of what I've said does not a bad fic make.

Enter my favourite fanfiction of all time; [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]] by Sovran.

It has OP!Harry and the instant complete understanding of their bond mate, but the brilliance of it is that it explores all the ramifications of the bond and the other characters' true to canon reactions to it. It considers all these little things that would simply be glossed over, like how they can't play that many card games with each other because they always know what the other is thinking and seeing. It's story /about/ Harry and Ginny's life with the Soul-Bond, both during the everyday moments and the high stakes fights with Voldemort.

There is just so much you could do with the Soul-Bond trope and it's never used, poorly thought out, or just a footnote. There have been so many times that I try to find a fic that captures the same magic as MoO that I end up dropping.

** The tropes/cliches aren't the problem...the problem is the horrible/repetitive/simplistic stories that everyone has to wade through in order to find the unique and interesting interpretations. I'm with you especially regarding Fleur's veela powers/allure. Why would you want to strip the character of something that makes her unique and interesting?

The "Ice Queen" Daphne trope is the biggest example I can think of that has been mangled over the years. The characterization of a quiet and distant Slytherin is actually justified by canon. The fact that Harry never mentions her in the books means that she does stay quiet, she isn't obnoxious and could be sypmathetic to his views. The problem comes when most writers skip to the end (her being a cold and calculating Slytherin pureblood) and maker her a caricature. The story is about everyone telling us she is "The Ice Queen" instead of showing us why she is the way she is and making her human.

Stories based on Slytherin house are the most egregious example of lazy trope writing in my opinion. It seems like every character, whether good or evil, is manipulating/calculating/scheming/overly ambitious which goes against everything we know about the other houses. Hermione and Lavender are both Gryffindors but their personalities are nothing alike. Luna and Cho are Ravenclaws but are nothing alike.

Most of my favorite stories involve many of the most popular tropes. The difference is they typically look past the surface level implications of the trope involved and create a unique, human and realistic person based on it.

** I mean, it's part of the definition. A cliche is just a trope that's been done a lot that people don't really like/get interested by any more. What's boring and cliche to the millennial-and-over audience of the original Harry Potter books who've been in the Fanfiction scene for years will be completely new to the people who're just getting into the fandom now with the new movies (or to use the cliche - what's old is new to those who haven't experienced it yet). It's all intrinsically relative, so we're all going to see it differently. Just like bashing - if you see Ron as a selfish cunt, then fics portraying him that way aren't bashing, whereas if you see him as a loyal friend, then fics portraying him as a cunt are bashing. If you've seen a million bad Soul Bond fics, you're going to see it as cliche, whereas if you've only seen one, you probably won't.

Personally, I'm basically with Geairt on this one. There's no such thing as a bad trope (or even a bad cliche - Jack from Stargate SG-1 was great at making those fun and interesting), only badly done ones. A good writer/storyteller can make anything interesting or fun. But you've gotta write bad stuff and fuck up before you can learn how to do things better or come up with ways to do things that are fresh and new.

But if you're reading this and being original is something that bothers you, then I offer you some words from the Dan Brown Masterclass on Writing Thrillers - "Every single idea has been done, over and over. You don't need a big idea, you need big hows. How do you build tension? How do you build character?"

Essentially, everything is derivative of something, so put a cool spin or new paint job on it. It's not what you do, it's how you do it - which is why a story about a lonely orphan going to a fucking English boarding school has captured the imaginations of so many. That's not remotely an original idea, but adding in Magic and a Bureaucratically Stagnant Wizarding World was and Rowling wrote a world that felt enchanting and magical that we wanted to go into. A little kid called Harry Potter isn't original (check out the Troll movie in '86 - Harry Potter even fought a troll), but she gave him a scar and a tragic backstory and boom - original. Hows not whats, that's what makes a good story. :)

** I haven't found a well done manipulative Dumbledore but I can definitely see how you could write one.

Just in the first book -

Harry is 100% in the category of children more at risk for being groomed. He doesn't have parents or strong / healthy ties to adults in his community. His home life isn't great, and his guardians are at best inattentive to him. To add to that he doesn't have any of the community safety nets like cps

Dumbledore does a few things that could be kind of sketchy and are definitely seen in cases where a child is being groomed. 1. He singles Harry out with a familiarity he doesn't have with other students ex. Harry is continually called by his first name where as Hermione is ms. Granger through the books and Ron “mr. Weasley “. Especially that the Weasley children are continually called by the last names is weird. If Harry was Harry because of Dumbledores relationship with the potters the same should go for the Weasley kids. If Harry was Harry because he was a troublemaker the same should go for the Weasley twins, or even Ron and Hermione . 2. He gives Harry attention we don't see other students getting ( random “sage” advice during the mirror encounter etc) 3 right off the bat he gives Harry an expensive “secret” gift (the cloak) 4. Harry is shown preferential treatment that can be argued is at the very least condoned by Dumbledore (being the only first year in Dumbledores entire tenure allowed on the sports teams , points enough to win over Slytherin last minute etc)

Sure most or all can be explained away in different ways to do with the plot but there is still the fact that those things are there and could be used subtly paint a picture of manipulation

** In defense of some fanfic tropes:

Most of them are there to contribute to the self-indulgent wish fullfilment aspect of many fics. They are generally written and read by people who want to get lost in a fictional world they love without having the characters they are so invested in go through so many hardships. Lordships, super wands, life-debts, friendly goblins, trunks with a million compartments, they are mainly used to help situations that the characters wouldn't be able to solve quickly. It's relaxing to just sit back and read Harry speedrun the second war. It's not deep or meaningful, and it's not supposed to be.

** I'm okay with any evil/manipulative dumbledore tropes because the original literally doesn't make sense as a character. (He was never really meant to function as a character but rather a plot device, but that's another story.)

There are only three ways to fill in dumbledore's plot-holes, make him a manipulator, evil, or make him grossly incompetent.

And amateur authors have a pressing need to fill in plotholes. Plotholes that exist for the sake of plot, age rating, general storytelling, or rule-of-cool, are simply no-can-dos. It takes a long time to learn the need for them.

So it's expected. There's really no other way to write old dumbles. Fanfiction is all about correcting the world to your own view after all. And plot holes are the first place to start.

The best way I've seen his plot holes filled is basically make him afraid of his own power with a hint of "I'm an elder who knows best". So his inaction, manipulation, and incompetence in alot of places are no longer plot holes

That's another point which I agree with. I don't know why some people disagree with it. Harry has an exceptionally strong will- he could withstand Voldemort's Imperius curse at 14! Considering how powerful Voldemort was I'd say Harry could be able to resist a veela as well.

*** Neville Chamberlain really gets a bad rap, though. The common perception of him is that he tried to buy peace with Germany by surrendering Czechoslovakia without a fight; essentially, giving the Nazis a Danegeld and expecting then to settle down.

Realistically, the UK was fractured, indebted, and militarily weak; they stood no chance against a rearming Germany at that point, and there was little to national will to fight. Chamberlain was well aware that appeasement wouldn't last forever. What it did was /buy the Empire time/. Time to train, time to rearm, and time to survive. Even then, it was barely enough; the blitzkrieg smashed both the French army and the BEF aside and Britain came a stone's throw away from losing their army at Dunkirk.

Chamberlain lost his career over the whole thing, but his stalling saved the UK (even though the coming war would shatter the Empire). He's something of a tragic hero, especially in light of his service during the First World War.

**** The problem with this was that Germany's military was also not the war machine it was in 1939/1940 and that it needed more time to rearm and its economy was entirely dependent on mass borrowing and spending through legal loopholes and the MEFO bills program. Also, the German/Czech border was extremely rugged, mountainous and naturally defensible which was exploited by the Czechoslovakians who built up defenses and had a capable army. The Czech region of the nation also had lots of heavy industry and had a very advanced tank industry, so much so that many of the German heavy tanks were of Czech origin or design.

When the Sudetenland region was handed over due to the policy of appeasement and weak Czechoslovakian will, this allowed Nazi Germany to later take over the rest of the nation, seizing the Czech industry, tank designs and gold supplies allowing them to appease their lenders and continue borrowing. Finally, this act caused a schism between Belgium and France as the Belgian King lost faith in France and withdrew from their defense arrangement, opting for a non-aligned stance between Germany and France. This meant that instead of the Maginot Line funneling German troops in pre-prepared defenses with Belgian, French and potentially British troops manning them, the entire French strategy was ruined as now the Germans would be to invade Belgium and enter Northern France, consisting mostly of wide open plains with little natural defenses favouring the attacker.

When the Germans invaded Belgium, the French were forced to dash into Belgium to attempt to salvage what was left of the original plan, over-committing their troops and sending their reserves, causing confusion among French troops and command, further exacerbated by glaring flaws in the French High Command.

Although it is more obvious in hindsight and his motives are understandable caving to the demands of an imperialistic nation you fought within living memory, sacrificing a minor nation and expecting other nations not to distrust you doesn't necessarily make your actions justified. Although I understand the man and sympathize that he was between a rock and a hard place, I feel like being on the wrong side of history doesn't mean "he gets a bad rap".

There have been countless fics where I was drawn in by the premise, but the clumsy execution or unexpectedly painful/squicky plot twists have made me click off it, even if I've read 46 chapters of a of a 54 chapter, 250k+ word story. I felt nothing afterwards except bummed that I wouldn't get to see the characters I was rooting for (maybe, with the way the author was going) get back together after chapters and chapters of angsting.

In comparison, I bought a new copy of /Altered Carbon/ ($15) when the show came out and less than a third of the way through the book decided to get rid of it, because the author suddenly revealed his terrifyingly mysoginistic views in an unexpected and brutal rape scene. I was mad afterwards because 1) I'd spent money on something I wasn't going to finish and couldn't return; 2) I'd given the asshole author my money; and 3) some idiot at Netflix read the book with all of its issues and decided to bankroll a person who thought women are inherently dirty and weak during their periods and have no pain tolerance because of it.

***** The show is okay, but pretty heavy on exploiting women's bodies. They change the scene I was directly referring to because the female show runner felt she couldn't properly explain the "point" of the scene without it coming across as actual torture porn, given that, you know, it was.

Below be spoilers:

This is a link to a screenshot of a post I made a while ago about one of the more outrageous lines from the scene in the book: [[http://imgur.com/a/2Lwzacb]]

And here's a chunk of a news article where they discuss the scene in the book and the showrunner's rationale for changing it: [[http://imgur.com/a/TXD5O4M]]

The crop in the middle was to remove an unnecessary photo and an ad for Turbotax.

** Life debts are usually shitty because they're such a destructive concept. Like, I read a fic once which had life debts be able to turn someone into a squib. That's incredibly fucking stupid, based on how random they can be and how vague. Also, it is never explained how this is enforced? Because the concept seems uniquely human to me. I've always had it just be a honor thing in my fics, no magic attached. So if you have a life debt with someone and that person begs for your aid, the honorable thing to do is help them. Not helping is possible and can't be "punished", but you'll find yourself ostracized and shunned until you can repay the debt. The actual magic of the bond, if it has one, would be incredibly subtle.

Marriage Contracts I hate with a passion, except as an evil to be fought against. A story about two star-crossed lovers being married of to someone they don't want, then breaking free and tearing down the foundations of oppression together? Give me that. A story about two random people bound into a "love, or die" contract just accepting it and "coming to love" oneanother? nono, that's a big yikes. Also don't like the enforcing features fanon often attributes to these. Some are more yikes than others (It'll just /make/ you love them!) but they're all pretty non-canon when considering Andromeda just left her family and literally nothing happened.

Manipulative Dumbledore just bores me at this point. It reeks of angst when a story has him be like that, and he inevitably becomes an idiot to serve the plot. I prefer him being a non-important entity in the story to that. However, I much much prefer him being a supporting character instead of an antagonist. The story already has an antagonist, and if that one isn't savvy or sane enough, you can just make up one. It's your own story after all. I really don't understand why people feel the need to warp established characters out of shape instead of just inventing their own ones.

If you want a "greater good" type of political guy, you can for example create a character like this: "Ingrid Weißmann is a german witch who fought for Grindelwald. She believed and still believes in his ideology, that wizards must rule over muggles, because they are too destructive for their own good. In this pursuit, she has become an ambassador in the british minstry and is currently cultivating influence from the inside." There, you've got a political antagonist whose ideology is the greater good, without betraying Dumbledore's entire character.

***** The manipulative Dumbledore trope came out of a very valid, thought not universally acceptd, interpretation of canon Dumbledore's character. Has it devolved well past the point of validity in many stories? Yes! But the trope itself is not inherently anti-canon.

Hell, some of the "manipulative" moments fics talk about are also ways to explain stupidity in early canon - like having an obstacle course so difficult 3 first years could figure it out.

***** He manipulated Harry into suicide by Voldemort on the wild guess that he might somehow survive it. Also, during their argument in OotP, Dumbledore said that he had a certain goal to shape Harry a certain way by placing him with the Dursleys. He even went as far as saying that the abuse Harry had to suffer through was ok since he did not become a spoiled brat.

** One thing that I don't get about manipulative!Dumbledore fics is that the writer usually makes Dumbledore cartoonishly sneaky and evil (like stealing Harry's inheritance and blocking his true magical abilities evil) but then when Harry finds out about this they make him hyper fixate on something totally irrelevant Dumbledore also happens to have done. Like 'I can forgive you for allowing me to be abused all these years, stripping me of my magic and stealing my fortune, but filling out my Gringotts paperwork for me? Unforgivable!' ???

** Goblin Curse Breakers.

We know Gringotts employ Bill Weasley to go tomb raiding in Egypt (whose pyramids focused on life after death). It makes sense that they might have a team of curse breakers who know what horcruxes are and can cleanse Harry's scar. But when it's overdone it turns into goblin healers curing Harry of a decade's malnutrition by snapping their fingers and releasing his bound magic by tapping his forehead.

Bound Magical Core.

There's a lot of dramatic potential in this trope. Learning family secrets, being betrayed by authority figures, having magic be out of control and having to learn how to use it all over again. (Malfoy is bullying him, but his magic's only settings are Off and Murder. Shit, think fast.) But it's usually just a cheat code unlocking god mode with bonus bashing.

  *Abusive Dursleys:* Canon Dursleys were already kind of abusive. They /did/ starve him, not to the point of dying, but still. Going from there to beating him from time to time doesn't seem so far-fetched.

  Now, regularly breaking his bones, literally starving him to death, /raping?!/ That is on the too much side.
#+end_quote

First, they were most definitely criminally abusive. The kind of abusive that puts you in "you're going to become everybody's prison bitch because you abused a child" prison. Second, Molly Weasley disagrees with you. Right after Dobby shows that they did do that, months of living like that would put him in the hospital AT LEAST. That diet regiment they forced him and Dudley to do was not conducive to living either. Third, they did get physical with him, there's plenty of times when they swiped at him, manhandled him, and swung a frying pan at him (in such a casual way it seemed scarily normal).

This is my big problem with JKRowling. "Abuse builds character"... Yeah, a sprinkle. She dumped a whole sack of it in Harry's backstory, and dumped another three more during the course of the series.

I see them going that far at the start with the accidental magic. The stuff happening /during/ the books looks like they were scared of going too far when the freaks could come. I already covered starving to death above. The raping part I won't comment on.

**** I've seen a number of fanfics make the point that Harry's distrust of adults and need to rush into danger personally could be credited to the Dursleys' abuse. His whole childhood, adults abused him or believed lies about him. By the time he gets to Hogwarts, he believes adults are useless and it's up to him to protect the Stone/smuggle out a dragon/catch the Heir/etc.

Granted, this isn't spelled out in canon. But it's a kinder interpretation than "adults actually are useless, why is no one doing their fucking job".

I do like that moment as an illustration of a good character having character flaws. McGonagall isn't evil or malicious there. She's carrying a bunch of paperwork and some 11yo kids run up thinking they know better than all the adults. She should take the time to figure out why they think that (especially since they have info they shouldn't, i.e. the Stone), but for just a moment she gives in to frustration and impatience... and evil nearly prevails. That scene, done right, can be a gem.

I did a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fqzz94/harry_potter_has_no_shortage_of_traumatic_events/][post]] recently about this. I have plans for a fic that include semi-realistic consequences for things that happen in canon.

I had ideas ranging from Harry liking small dark spaces, due to his cupboard being safe, to him having tons of trust issues, due to never really having anyone he can trust.

More like she didn't think of it. This goes back to Ariana Dumbledore. If she got that traumatized from a group of muggle boys she met /once/... With Harry's treatment at the Durselys, Harry should be a Super Obscurial 4. Earth shouldn't have survived. The excuse JKR gave was a bunch of garbage. "it's because he didn't know it was magic!" Yeah, no. He still knew he was doing "freakish things".

** The one trope that I see has a lot of potential, but is constantly turned to shit is the *Harry is the heir to a bunch of families trope.* I just don't like the way people make him the heir of *All* the founders, Merlin, Morgana, 30 families he isn't even related to, etc. In most fanfictions, as soon as he gets this knowledge, he becomes super rich, gives him half the Wizengamot, Ancient vaults full of 'magic artefacts' which we never see, gets like 20 marriage contracts, and other bullshit. I mean, COME ON! Its pretty much just an excuse for a harem fic.

Usually, this also comes with him getting some *RIDICULOUS* inheritance of magic. How does making him a descendant of Dracula's house let him get superpowers in the name of /its a vampire thing/?

This trope has some serious potential. Make Harry the heir to those families, sure, but give him /complications/. /Tension/. Make it so that he has to do certain things to be worthy of that family name. make the family magics test him and find him lacking, and have a sublot of him trying to become worthy of a family's magic. Make his powers gradual.

In a lot of Manipulative!Dumbledore fanfiction, The Potter family charter, or Sirius's will, etc. emancipates him. So he instantly gets access to everything. Make it so that he doesnt get everything right away. Let him go through multiple tests, or have certain rules limiting his power over the house. Give him the *Rights & Responsibilities* without infinite resources. Make him *work* for it.

Also, the marriage contract subtrope (can it be called that?) have the girls he's to get married to instantly fall in love with him. They meet him ONCE and they're like, yep this is the guy i want to spend the rest of my life with. They dont even care that he's married to multiple people. The authors say 'They all love each other as much as harry' all of a sudden. Thsi has GOT TO be fixed. Give the relationship tension. Make it hard for harry to woo them. Make someone resent the contract, and try to break it at any cost, and let Harry try to prevent them from doing something stupid. People usually *don't* like being forced into something without their consent.

Another variation that I'd like to see more done with "grateful public naming the Boy Who Lived in their wills". I find that more realistic than "Lily Evans was the squib-born granddaughter of all four Hogwarts founders". But Voldemort killed all but one member of an ancient family? Sure, why not name Voldemort's killer your heir, what have you got to lose?
