Hi there, fellow readers!

I can't remember the fic, but I came across it months ago that had Susan, despite being a bit of a bitch like her friends in Hufflepuff, thinking that her and the others' behavior to Harry will just 'blow over' since they're just in school, and it won't affect any professional or personal relationships they'll have with Harry after they graduate.

Naturally her aunt is decisively unhappy and tries to give her a reality check, which fails to be imparted, and Susan is horrified when yes, Harry doesn't forget.

I'm not searching for /that/ fic, but the rough element of it did intrigue me, as did the one below.

Another fic had Susan sending a letter to her aunt complaining that Harry had cheated his way in, and Amelia found herself shaking her head at her niece's fickle nature, since she had a crush on Harry before the Goblet shat out his name. Harry ended up dating Hannah, after she apologized, IIRC, and it had Lily and James returning to life (wasn't that interesting/good, to be honest) via a Wishing Stone/goddess.

Anyway, my search...

Does anyone know of any fics that have the Hufflepuffs being horrid to Harry (behavior, badges, et cetera), specifically Susan or Hannah, perhaps with prior feelings for him being positive, over the selection issue, but do a one-eighty after the First Task or after it's proven he's innocent? That they try to befriend him or ask him out, only to be shut down hard by a less than forgiving or happy Harry?

Or anything along that theme? Even with Gyffindor or the other Houses, bar Ron/Hermione? I've gone on a bit of a Goblet fic kick at the moment, heh.

Thanks for taking the time to read my request!

*** The first, I have no idea, sorry: it's something I remembered from months back. I do remember it involved Amelia basically disowning Susan from being her heir, since she destroyed an alliance the Bones had with the Potters and Longbottoms for centuries and the former basically propped her family up, if that helps.

The second was linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11271762/1/The-Wish][11271762]])

It's not very good, IMHO, and I found it after a Google search for similar fics to my OP (not much luck there either, sigh!).
