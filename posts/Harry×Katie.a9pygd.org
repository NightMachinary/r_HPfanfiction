** Harry/Katie is a fairly popular pairing idea. I know I and many others have asked for recommendations in the distant past with little success. And yet there are still precious few fics even today that have the pairing (unless it's in a multi-scenario), especially 100k+ ones, so just be forewarned you are unlikely to find much.

I will look through what I have and try and get back to you but to be honest I don't remember a single Harry/Katie that comes close to 100k that I have read.

*** I really wonder why it's like that. Maybe it's because she wasn't featured prominently in the movies? I think that 2-3 actresses played her. There really is a dearth of good, long Harry/Katie fics though. I feel like people here always comment on how rare of a pairing it is.

**** So in my view, she suffers 1 simple fate. Just like Daphne Greengrass, she is barely there in the books/movies. However, unlike Daphne, she has just enough development to prevent her from being a blank slate and to some degree limiting interesting development.

This is for the most part simply because Katie being in Gryffindor with the main characters means we know more about her house, and because we also know she is heavily into Quidditch, again connecting her to the main character Harry. So she is "sorta" a blank slate, but not as freeing as Daphne for authors, has less potential for interesting directions due to being in the same house as Harry, and with just enough development on the Quidditch front, to cause authors to need to incorporate Quidditch into any story with her (or at least it feels like that).

Now keep in mind I'm not saying this is all true or without grey area, but I suspect it is how she is viewed by many. So she is stuck in a bit of limbo. Not quite developed enough to slot in easily to a story with a preconceived personality and backstory, but also developed just a bit too much to feel like an OC.

***** It is difficult to come up with a characterisation for her which doesn't make her Ginny 2.0 or a "better" Ginny.

You could shoehorn her into a big sister role, but someone like Tonks or Fleur is better suited there because they are combat proven and therefore make for a better protector.

******* Really, she's only a year older, so a protector role doesn't make much sense in the first place. A more traditional big sister role works fine, maybe even better--have Katie know a few tricks on how to evade Bludgers; give her a chance to show where some of the better books for studying in the library are.

****** Have to disagree here. Besides the Quidditch angle, it really not all that relatable to Ginny. (All this holds true for Alicia as well).

Katie/Alicia is Harry's senior (in particular being on the Quidditch team, where she was already established when Harry joined. That gives a relationship dynamic that you really don't see at all in the books).

Katie/Alicia can be used as a wedge to explore the year above Harry&Co, which is relatively undefined compared to Harry's year and 1 year younger. All of them are described as having pretty strong connections to their year. (Compare Ginny's relation with Luna)

The characters fit into the 'half-blood' mold pretty well, which is something you don't really have much in Harry's year to play with.

They never went through the 'fangirl' phase that Ginny went through in the books, and don't have the Chamber mess hanging over them.

And perhaps most important, they are mostly a blank slate.

Honestly, they seem more like a Hermione replacement than a Ginny replacement (Either as a character from a non-wizarding background, or as a 'smart female' character, if you don't want to use Hermione for her character baggage.).

**** It is almost done, 3-4 chapters left to update. Just cleaning it up to fit the way the story has gone. It started as a premise with 3 scenes in mind and has developed from there.

This is to take in some very good feedback I'd gotten and hopefully make it stronger.

**** I've run into this with Dawn of Darkness. The first chapter really sucked and I didn't want to write on when there was a very obvious issue to fix, yet at the same time I didn't want to deal with the "boring introduction" when I could be writing the interesting bits. Took me two months to break that deadlock.
