** Snape took out memories before his occlumency lessons with Harry. This might mean that they were gone from his head in case Harry was able to get into his head, or he might have put them there specifically for Harry to see to convince him that his dad was awful.

Slughorn removed his memory of telling Tom about horcruxes twice. This either means that you keep memories when you take them out, or the fact that he changed the memory the first time might have had an effect.

So you could make an argument for either option. It could be that you can choose either option when removing a memory. Or it could just be that Rowling was inconsistent.

*** Neither instance really makes sense. I'd understood Snape was removing memories incase Harry accidently got past his own shields so Harry couldn't see Snape's worst memory. Yet, it's still there in Snape's head. What's the point?

Slughorn tampers with his own memory out of shame for giving Tom info on horcruxes. Yet, the actual memory is still there in his head. What's the point?

That actual answer is 'whatever the plot demands.'

**** I think the Slughorn one actually does make sense. He didn't tamper with the memory to lie to himself, he did it to lie to Dumbledore. Or that's the way I always read it, at least. I suppose if you wanted to say that he did it to lie to himself, you could make something up about locking up the original memory behind all sorts of occlumency mind shields so he doesn't think about it.

The instance with Snape really doesn't make much sense though, unless the memory was fine from his head or he put it in the pensieve for Harry to see. I don't really like either explanation though.

*** I remembered Snape but had completely forgotten about Slughorn's Horcrux memory! Yes, this is seeming more and more like an author's choice than something determined by canon material.

** I think the canonical operation is “Copy”, but I saw couple of stories where it was “Cut” (as in Copy/Cut/Paste operations in a text editor). I believe the “Copy” is the proper one.

*** I think it has to be "copy".

- Snape got angry that Harry had seen his worst memory, and after pulling Harry out of the memory, talked about it. He could only do that if he still knew the content of the memory.

- Slughorn still knew the details of his conversation with Tom about horcruxes after having removed the memory.

I think at best you can say that extracting a memory might make it less vivid. But I think canon rules out the idea that extracting a memory deletes it from your mind.

**** Except, exactly the scene with Snape suggests it is a wee bit more complicated: whole purpose of putting those memories into the Pensieve was to get them out of his head, so Harry cannot stumble upon them. Perhaps combined with a small /Obliviate/?

**** If Snape did "cut" the memory (and I'm not entirely convinced that is how it works), then I think it's still possible that he had the knowledge of the memory without having the memory.

Snape probably has the recipes for many options memorized, but he probably doesn't remember all the time he spent reading his potions books. Legilimency, as far as we can tell, seems to just show memories, so of Harry did get into Snape's head, he probably wouldn't be able to pull potion recipes out. He might find memories of Snape brewing or teaching about a position, but he wouldn't be able to go straight to the knowledge of the recipe.

Similarly, Snape would still /know/ he got embarrassed by James and called Lily a mudblood, but his actual memory of the event would be gone.

** I always have my characters put the memory back (by drawing it out of the Pensieve with their wand and bringing it back to their temple), but I don't think we ever see anyone in canon put their memories back and I don't think it stated whether or not the person could still remember it. I think you can really do it however you'd like in fic.

*** Thanks, I love your solution! It seems like an easy and clean way to deal with the possibility of forgetting and also the biological waste (if we can call it that? lol). It's been some time since I read the books and I was scared of thinking too much about something that was already explained.

** I prefer where after the memory is taken out it is sort of vague, like seeing something in the corner of your eye, they can't clearly remember it, but know it happened and have an overview of events.
