Anyone have any fics where Voldemort isnt just some dude with Horcruxes but an actual lich who sacraficed his soul to a greater diety and locked it into a phylactery and is basically walking skeleton that can't die until said phylactery is destroyed?

** That... Is a fantastic idea, and as a D&D fan I'm ashamed I've never thought of it before. It does make sense in a weird way. Voldemort as a Lich is a terrifying prospect. Especially if he makes a pact with Vecna or Orcus!

#+begin_quote
  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.
