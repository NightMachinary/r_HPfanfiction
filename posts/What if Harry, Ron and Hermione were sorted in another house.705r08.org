If there a fanfiction where they are sorted like this?

- Harry-Gryffindor

- Ron- Hufflepuff

- Hermione - Ravenclaw

And let's add a Slytherin to the trio, Draco of course. Is there a fanfiction that involves all the houses like this?


** Are you just looking for the so called "golden trio" in a different house than Gryffindor? Or specifically that they are EACH in their own house? Or specifically the house setup you listed?

**** Ok, was not sure from the title. Sadly that is quite specific and I do not know of one with those 3 specific sortings. To be honest I would be surprised if you can find a FF that has Ron in Hufflepuff irregardless of where Harry/Hermione go.

**** He's really not that loyal and "abandoned" Harry on 2 major occasions when Harry needed him.

Honestly, Hermione is WAY more loyal than him in canon and would be more deserving of Hufflepuff (despite her Ravenclaw and Gryffindor tendencies).

***** He was influenced. It wasn't under normal circumstances, Ron when with Harry to the center of his very own fears.

****** I assume you mean the 2nd time he was "influenced" by the Horcrux. The problem with that argument has always been that Hermione did not leave.

However, that still doesn't explain the 1st time (year 4).

******* Lol he doesn't abandon Harry. He stops speaking to him in 4 year, and even through that he remains loyal. He passes down the info Hagrid told him, and makes sure Harry gets it even do they were not talking to each other.
