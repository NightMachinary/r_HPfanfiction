** Probably the best example of this is the Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider series by Starfox5. The second one has the globetrotting action stuff you want (so many freaking Uncharted vibes), but the first is kinda necessary foundation for the second so I'm linking that one here. I'd still recommend it as a read though, it's pretty dang good.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

PS, I've been told to warn people that it's sad, so keep that in mind.

  Harry Potter is 18 years old and he doesn't know who he is. It may be a bit dramatic to say something like that, because he realises he is Harry Potter. But he's just a random guy who doesn't even know what he likes to do for fun, now that Lord Voldemort has been defeated. Or, the one where Harry Potter doesn't know what to do with himself after the war, so he becomes an architect, makes new friends, falls in love, and accidentally changes the world.
