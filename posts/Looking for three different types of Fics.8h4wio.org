1. Harry who is very independent or doesn't rely on Hermione and Ron or Neville and Luna and does well or
2. Harry who has to work at getting the affections of someone he likes. or
3. A well put together wandless magic Harry story. ....or
4. (Wait what!? The title said three!) I know, but I am also up for any stories that have low views/ reviews that you'd recommend, or your own stories that you'd like some feedback on.

Thanks!

  Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.

*** I love your fic a LOT by the way. I maybe reviewed too much already but I adore your characterization; I think it's exactly how someone who was raised by Sirius would behave. I like that he's still a lazy jackass with a heart of gold and not some super parents like other fics tend to do. Holly is a lot of fun, and I would love to see her interact with others that perhaps Harry wouldn't've with his withdrawn nature.\\
I like that you changed up Quirrell; it means I have no clue how this is going to play out and that's exciting. The monster thing reminds me almost of the Face Stealer from ATLA and is the most exciting part of the fic so far. Keep it up!

** linkffn(For love of magic) definitely has 1 and 3 and kinda has 2. However, there is a lot of pointless smut, the story keeps rambling on with no conclusion incoming at all and almost everything Harry says is unbearable preaching. Having said all that the fic is a pretty good guilty pleasure.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Another "Voldemort Meets Discworld's Death" story. Written for the Spacebattles forum, shouldn't be taken too seriously.

** 3/ If by wandless magic you mean magic performed without a wand rather than the more restrictive magic performed without any tool at all, this one (and it's sequel) has a pretty interresting take on it.\\
Most people here should already know about it, though.
