Hello

I'm looking for fanfics where we see the scene when Voldemort and the Death Eaters bring Harry's body during the Battle of Hogwarts from the point of view of Ron/Hermione/ect

Thank you


** A Call to Arms is a great fic which features the perspective of Ginny, Neville, McGonagall and the various other good-guys of Hogwarts during the events of Deathly Hallows.

Because it tries to follow canon pretty closely, it gets to Harry's 'death' and everyone's reactions to it at chapter 35.
