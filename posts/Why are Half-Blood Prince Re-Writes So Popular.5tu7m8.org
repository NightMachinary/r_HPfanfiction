I've noticed that when searching by favorites on fanfiction.net, a lot of the really popular fics are ones set after OOTP where Harry decides to be more proactive, independent, and winds up stronger. He also gets with Ginny much quicker.

Now originally I chalked it up to the fact that a lot of interest in fanfiction occurred between books 6 and 7, so naturally such stories written in this time would become popular. But I noticed that many stories written well after HBP and DH came out also were incredibly popular.

So my question is what makes the HBP (and DH to a lesser extent) rewrite so popular? Sure, timing has something to do with it, but clearly something else is going on here. Is it primarily that many fans did not like how Rowling portrayed Harry during HBP (and DH)?


** I believe the age plays a key factor. At 16 they're almost adults so can do more adult things. I.e, sex/spend money/kill people. It also makes dialogue easier as there isn't the need to tone things down to accommodate the fact that they are essentially kids. It also comes just after the death of Harry's last real family. Neither Remus or the Dursley's really fit in so its perfect for Independat Harry. The death can give plenty of angst and provide a great motivation for summer montage = god mode Harry.

The sixth book is the time Voldemort comes out the shadows. If you want a more gritty war then its then. Fifth year is a bit more cloak and dagger while wading through heaps of Harry's teenage angst. Stuff happens in sixth year too, Dumbledore dies which affects the story massively. Harry's lessons with Dumbledore are seen by many as stupid and easy to improve. The horcrux hunt was handled badly, so a lot of people want to do that better which means they want to change the circumstances that led up to it which is sixth year.

I know at least for meit was the time I started to see the books as young adult novels not kids books so if that's a common trend anyone wanting to write a 'grown up' fanfic could gravitate to this point.

*** All good points.

I think the fact that so many writers focus on Harry being more independent and focused on getting stronger/winning the war is indicative of a flaw in Rowling's storytelling during this period, from these writers and readers' point of view.

Personally, I'm agnostic on whether Rowling's handling of Harry during HBP was correct or not. But I do believe a large part of the popularity of these types of re-writes is that a lot of fans don't agree with how she handled this aspect of the stories.

**** She wrote the last chapter so long ago you knew that she had a grand plan. It just was as convoluted as Voldemort's abduction of Harry in 4th year. The problem with convoluted plans is while they seem clever and neat under closer inspection they seem excessive. What would have happened if Voldemort used any curse other than the killing curse in the Forrest? Its the amount that could go wrong that frustrates people. People also see very little of Harry taking the idea that a Dark Lord is trying to kill him seriously. We can accept that Harry doesn't like his title but we never see him trying to not get murdered. Sixth year is just another year to him in the books but we know the prophecy and we know its on him to stop Voldemort. Harry briefly moans about Dumbledore not teaching him useful things but then rolls over an accepts it. Its hard not to want him to have a bit of fight in him. We can accept that Voldemort would wipe the floor with him but we never see Harry try and that's frustrating. If the whole dying for everyone thing didn't work out then they're all dead. Harry is a stubborn person who fights till the bitter end for everyone else when he feels no-one else will but when he's /told/ that its on him then he just chills. He might tail Malfoy a bit but that's not, in the grand scheme, going to stop Voldemort from killing him.

***** A guy on 4chan once said that he hated the show Sherlock because Sherlock wasn't a true smart person. He would preform nigh-wizard acts that may come across as clever, but they have no explanation and most of the time they're needlessly convoluted. I feel as if Jk Rowling being unintelligent herself, writing intelligent people, is the cause of this. As she doesn't know how intelligent people think, so we get plans by 'genius' wizards, that make no sense.

****** Personally I thought the memory in DH where Dumbledore revealed that Harry had to die to Snape and then masterfully manipulated Snape into falling in line with it was true brilliance. You can see how Dumbledore played Snape like a fiddle and seamlessly reversed his stance from "you must keep Harry alive for Lily" to "you must let the boy die for Lily".

However, JKR was truly uninterested in writing a book glorifying child soldiers, so... she didn't. Different goals =/= lack of intelligence.

Do you even see what you just wrote? So that better message is "never work hard, and love (don't forget luck, luck too) will always prevail"? In a world of true genius', things like luck and chance would never be relied upon by such people.

Honestly, it all boils down to the fact that the whole saga started off basically as a fairy tale, and though certain things got darker, it doesn't quite become a dark fairy tale instead (with the exception of the fifth book, at least in parts), so instead you have what still is a fairy tale but with darker elements that quite frankly are out of place. And when you have things that would fit in a dark fairy tale but with none of the consequences there would be to such a thing and all that placed in a world that is not quite so dark, it is easy to construe it all as nonsense. Additionally, the lack of any reason given for some of those things, when they already do appear out of place for the readers, does not make it any easier for people to accept them; I can understand why Madame Rowling made the system of magic somewhat ambiguous because I perceive that as a correct approach, but when the same ambiguity is applied to things that the readers probably should know about, like the reason why characters discard obvious solutions in lieu of some random whatever (e.g. “why can't the death eaters simply enter Hogwarts and instead have to resort to Draco being a carpenter?”), it does leave the readers with many an uncomfortable question and no answers that cannot be twisted into “the writer just didn't care” when they squint hard enough.

Now, why do people exactly centre on making Harry more independent and make the story darker but not in a “dark fairy tale” kind of way but the “dark action fantasy” way instead, I'll say that this is about the authors' preferences and wish fulfilment more than anything. And the series is a good series in any case. But when you create a whole world that starts out stained but overall pink and then want to make it darker it is not something you do by splashing walls with black paint every few metres, for all you will get is ... a thing that clashes terribly with itself.

** The idiot ball that was handed out at the end of OotP was glued to the hands of the cast in HBP. In order to push the plot through, many characters also acted horribly OOC - Ron thinking Malfoy is harmless? Really? Dumbledore wasting his last year on shitty lessons that could have been done in a single afternoon, and not doing anything to stop Malfoy from endangering innocents? Hermione flipping out over Harry using a book, instead of reading it herself? Malfoy trying to kill Harry with the Killing Curse, getting cursed in self-defense, and Harry feeling guilty about it?

Of course it's popular to improve on that.

** At the end of book 5, Harry is at his most obvious point of change; his last father-figure has died, he has ownership of a house, his Destiny has been revealed to him and this is the last time we get the sense that he's skilled as a combatant. He also in book 5 demonstrated enough command to run a classroom and lead his friends in a live-fire engagement.

And then in book 6, he's regressed. He is presented as an average wizard who needs Snape's secret notes in order to survive most of his classes. His position as Quidditch captain is a pale echo of his previous role as drill-sergeant and field commander of his own strike team. He needs the help of a magic-fixit potion in order to get a simple question answered, and in the midst of all this, his leadership is being second-guessed by his closest friends.

It's a whole load of crap that betrays the character arc being presented up until then. That's the sort dissatisfaction that prompts fans to say 'wait, no, it should go like this...'.

And not only that. The change in the ministry could have been used for something better, but instead it only got used to show us that Harry doesn't like the ministry. Ron's being made the butt of the joke with the whole Quidditch keeper thing when we could have gotten anything else to show that he lacks confidence (heck, the time for /that/ was one book earlier, at the same time when Neville started getting over his issue with that). The weird plan of the death eaters to get into Hogwarts doesn't seem to have much sense and thus the one “dark” element of what would make this book darker than the previous one (Draco's ... something, for I cannot call it “plotting”) is easy to take to be a piece of nonsense.

*** Yeah, I think you nailed it here. Book 6 is thematically lacking. It seems to me like many people don't really know why they dislike it so much and start to nitpick on minor details that would be perfectly tolerable if the book picked up on the promises from OotP. There was lots of excitement after that book and it seemed like Rowling was teasing a large change in the way that things are run, but at best it all remained extremely status quo.

I can appreciate the thought of trying to "humanize" her characters more, but it's just way too awkward timing after them all having their "Oh shit, this is seriously for real now"-moment. I'm not the biggest fan of Ron, but this could have been the moment to really make something out of his character, instead all he does is snog Lavender - which *really* isn't a bad idea, he's a teenager after all: Just don't make him seemingly forget that a few months ago they fought Death Eaters in a pitched battle and his best-friend/love-interest almost died.

Second, the last two novels are the most open in terms of where the world is at versus what happens in the books. Imho I think they are the worst two books in the series because large portions of them have nothing relevant happening to the characters and I suspect many have similiar, if not as strong, views. This would make them books where the need to 'fix' the main series is jigher, encouraging fanfiction.

Finally, I suspect the fact that snape being redeemed across those two novels Plays a big role in their popularity.

Long before that, I think. We waited a long time for book 5 to be published. A three-year-long abstinence, and the readers were getting desperate. I remember a lot of bad fanfiction being presented as leaked copies of the real thing.

** I haven't seen much commenting on the romance in the story. Since a lot of fanfiction is devoted to romance, and HBP is the most romance-heavy of the books, I can see why a lot of re-writes delve deeper into that aspect.

I find it interesting and unsurprising that writers pair Harry/Ginny much earlier and bring her into the adventures. It's fairly clear that a lot if the fan base wanted to see more of the actual relationship. It partly stems from the fact that we are conditioned to view the romantic interest of the main character as having a much larger role in a story than Ginny actually did. It feels off and wrong that she didnt so writers tend to correct this, particularly in DH re-writes.

** It's how silly everything felt in general. While I disagree that most re-writes start during book 6 (more book 4 or 5 imo) I sort of understand where most people come from when they do diverge the canon from those points. Harry should not be a cheerful person, he was verbally abused and generally un-cared for as a child. He had to deal with neglect, social exile, and many things that kids that age DO deal with. But, he comes out different. He doesn't have any semblance of self-awareness, nor maturity. In book 6 particularly, we see a Harry that doesn't even care about the war, he doesn't even want to ask Dumbledore to train him after seeing the amazing display of magic during the battle in the artrium. How is that possible? How does that not get brought up a single time? Why does Harry need to know the past of Tom Riddle if Dumbledore was going to allow him to sacrifice himself anyways? I think people dislike books 6 (and even 7) because we got these characters for five books, where we thought we knew them, or had some idea of what they were like. But then Ron suddenly forgets that they're on a mission to save the world, and walks away. Dumbledore suddenly stops being able to find traces of dark magic, and magically telling what spells did by staring at them. So naturally he puts on a ring that was almost certainly cursed. Suddenly, we're supposed to feel bad for this character. Suddenly, Harry views him as a mentor. There's too much 'sudden understanding' rather than slow build up. It's like JKR decided that no one wanted character development and showcasing of how in-depth the magic system went, so she went for the "main character relies only on one spell throughout books 2-7" vibe.

I find the pattern of "Hard-Work is unneeded" repeated heavily in these books. Look at Hufflepuff, house of the "duffers".

"Harry is the best at defense in arguably all the years." Is also a Trope that is played over and over again, but it has several holes in it. 1) Only time he was extraordinary at defense is when he had a teacher with personal relations to him and his family. 2) Defense is an Amalgamation of Charms, Transfiguration, Hexes, Curses, Jinxes, and Martial Magic. How is Harry not a Charms Prodigy or Transfiguration Prodigy then? 3) No actual interest in the subject. It seems that Harry likes Duelling more than Defense, but naturally, that would give him a leg up in any battles, and we cannot have a main character rely on hard work; that's preposterous.

I honestly understand why every Millennial has a sort of inate "Chosen One" complex. They all grew up with female writers that believed in natural prodigies, but didn't believe in hard work.

*** i think jk just had problems writing a story about a very normal boy and extraordinary magic, and ended up writing her story around the characters. he couldn't be good at anything other than being a good person or he would stop being average.

***** it's pretty much the only interesting piece of magic he ever does himself. ultimately the whole book was about how to confront bad feelings and so harry being the best has the best physical representation of good feelings. i'm not sure anyone who actually tried to learn that spell ever failed..

****** If no one had ever failed at the charm, it's highly likely that Amelia Bones wouldn't go out of her way to tell him that it was impressive. Casting it at such a young age, is likely the equivalent of making a Horcrux at 16.

A spell that has been taught by the most incapable person alive. Even Hagrid could have taught DA in 2nd year and be a better teacher than Lockhart.
