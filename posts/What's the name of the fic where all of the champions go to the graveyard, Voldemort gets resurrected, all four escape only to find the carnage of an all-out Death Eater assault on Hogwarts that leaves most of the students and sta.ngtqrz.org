:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I found it in my fanfiction-reading youth and was enamored by it, but it disappeared on me at least six years ago.

Here are a few more details:

*The four stay together and take Harry to the Burrow.

*Harry is a fucking wreck obviously.

*Neville is one of the few survivors and he managed to save a group of first years.

*There's an emotional meeting with Molly and Harry.

That's all I can remember, but its been in the back of my head and I'm at my wits end trying to find it. Any help would be appreciated.


** That's so much drama, I totally want to read it

Regardless, I promise this is not and will not be abandoned. It's about 6 chapters give or take from being finished."

**** I nag the author of "On the Way to Greatness" every few years or so (it's almost 7 years into hiatus though author still maintains it's not abandoned). That was my first-ish fic which likewise enamoured me (I estimated that I read 100 million words in 6 months around then, including "When a Veela Cries").

Come to think of it, I guess the pandemic was a wasted opportunity, I should have used that to make a more convincing plea :P
