I'm looking for something that has plot and is not a oneshot of the yule ball, something that has only harry and the twins not some super harem(it can have one or two more but that's it) and it has to have at least over 30k words.

Thanks!

Plotiness could be argued, but it's mostly about tantalising possibilities.

  Harry is struck down by a nasty curse that requires some non-traditional medical care in South India. Hermione, Padma, and Parvati volunteer to assist in his care, and a menage-a-foursome is born. Harry/multi.
