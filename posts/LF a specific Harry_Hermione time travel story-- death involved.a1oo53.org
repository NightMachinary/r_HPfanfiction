In the very first chapter(s) Voldemort has won, which sent Harry and Hermione into hiding. There is no real resistance other than Harry, Hermione, Minerva, Arthur, Flitwick, and maybe Moody? The others all die, and Harry/Hermione are hiding out for years when Hermione is killed by Death Eaters. Harry spends a year drunk and then decides to try to bring her back/travel back in time/die with some spell that involved stones on her grave. He winds up sending them both back in time to the Buckbeak incident in third year while retaining their memories. All of this happens in the first few chapters. The rest of the story is a "Harry knows the truth and fixes stuff this time through" type deal.

I think this fic was kind of old, and it may have even been pulled. If anyone has any leads, I'd appreciate it!


** It's called The End and the Beginning! I'm on mobile so I don't know how to link, but it's on FF.net. I think the author is muggledad

  My stab at the Harry travels through time genre. Significant inspiration from "HP & Nightmares of Futures Past" with a twist. Harry/Hermione
