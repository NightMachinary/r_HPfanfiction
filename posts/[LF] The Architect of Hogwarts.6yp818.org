I was at the Harry Potter Studio Tour near London and saw the statue of "The Architect of Hogwarts".

Never heard of him before but found him later: [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Architect_of_Hogwarts]]

As you can see or already knew there is near to nothing. Which leads to my question: Is there a fic including him? Or any good fics about the founding of Hohwarts?


** Closest I can get is the homework I had my character turn in in History of Magic on /World of Potter/, where I included a note that while the Founders were great at enchanting things, they hadn't a clue how to build something, and had to hire the services of a talented half-blood architect whose name was lost to history...
