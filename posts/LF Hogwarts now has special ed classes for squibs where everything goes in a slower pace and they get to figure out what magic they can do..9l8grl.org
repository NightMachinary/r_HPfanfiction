Maybe with extra classes focussed on muggle subjects for the ones who are struggeling the most.


** You do know that squibs don't have any magic at all, right?

**** According to the wiki: "Kwikspell seems to be effective among [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wizardkind][wizards]] like Madam [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Z._Nettles][Z. Nettles]] and Warlock [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Demetrius_Prod][D.J. Prod]], who have poor magical skills.[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Kwikspell#cite_note-CoS8-0][[1]]] However, [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Squib][squibs]] like [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Argus_Filch][Argus Filch]] and [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Arabella_Figg][Mrs Figg]]find no results as they have no magical power.[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Kwikspell#cite_note-JKRes-2][[3]]]," which further notes " The definition for this course at the [[http://harrypotter.scholastic.com/glossary/][Scholastic /Harry Potter/ Glossary]] incorrectly states that it is a course for Squibs, who have little magical powers. This, however, is incorrect, as the course will work for those who actually have magic, but Squibs actually have no magical powers. "

*** Not how the prompter intended, but they could study things like care of magical creatures and muggle studies. Depending on your interpretation, some potions even might work. You might sell it like the squibs are "occupational track" like we do in the public school system, where they receive an academic, if not practical, education in some subjects and a more robust education in subjects that don't necessarily require magic but do require the knowledge magic exists for careers in those areas.

I'd be interested in reading that =p

*** There could be some lattend magic somewhere in there. Aren't muggleborns rumoured to be decended from squibs?

Maybe there is some magic they could learn. Not enough te be full fledged wizards but something.

**** Nope. The â€˜muggleborns are descended from squibs' theory is entirely fanon. It's probable that some squibs had children that ended up having children which had magical abilities, but the rumor is entirely fanon. Muggleborns are muggleborns.

Squibs are essentially muggles with wizarding heritage. Nothing more.
