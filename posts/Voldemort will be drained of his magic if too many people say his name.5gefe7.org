Harry walked into the Gryffindor common room, clutching a book, looking simultaneously horrified and excited.

"Ron, Hermione, I figured it out," he loudly whispered to his friends, "I figured out why Voldemort doesn't want people saying his name!"

The other two leaned forward, and Harry held out the book that he had in his hands; Ron took it before Hermione and flipped it open to the bookmark.

"Amongst Dark Lord Emeric's most vile deeds was the cursing of his own name...blah blah blah...whenever his name was spoken it would function as a spell, cursing the speaking and binding them to Emeric's will..." Ron looked up, "Yikes, mate, if Voldemort did that, wouldn't he want as many people as possible saying his name?"

"Keep reading!" Harry pressed.

So Ron stuck his nose back into the book, "Blah blah blah...however, this terrible deed ended up being the catalyst to his own downfall, as every time his name was spoken, the curse he placed upon it drew upon his own magic to function; thus, when thousands of people whispered his name every day, the magical flow was too great and Emeric ended up being drained of life by his own invention."

Harry grinned, "That's why! Voldemort cursed his name so that it'd put a curse on whoever said it, but to save on magic, he put a regular Taboo on it (disregarding that I don't know what that is yet) so that only the people who aren't afraid of him and his followers will say it!"

Ron tilted his head and stared ahead in wonder, "But then if everyone said his name a few times, he'd become a squib...?"

"Right!"

--------------

"Wait!" Hermione interrupted, "This is a fascinating concept for a fanfic and all, but haven't you forgotten something?"

Harry and Ron looked at her and shrugged.

"For starters, Hagrid told you Voldemort's name back before your first year, Harry, and you weren't cursed on the spot then. The wards on Hogwarts can explain not being cursed while saying it here, or at your relatives' house, but in Diagon Alley, it's not canon-compatible!"

Ron shrugged again, "Well, maybe it's not a straight up curse, maybe it's more like scrying. You know, 'speak of the devil and he shall appear', 'cept that it lets him listen in on you and decide if he wants to teleport...I mean, Apparate, in for a sneak attack."

Harry continued the shrugging phenomenon, "Sounds good to me. The only problem is taking advantage of it; I don't see how you could get a whole bunch of people together in a field and chant 'Voldemort, Voldemort, Voldemort', not without being a master diplomat. That'd be a ridiculously cracky fic."


** First of all, Sacrificial Protection is not attached to a physical location of 4 Privet Drive, but applies no matter his physical location as long as Harry lives with the Dursleys, including going shopping in the Diagon Alley. It'd be completely useless otherwise.

Second of all,

"Not cracky at all," Hermione countered. "All we would have to do is Confound a BBC anchor into saying 'Voldemort' several times during a live broadcast, and there would be millions of Muggles discussing what a Voldemort is for weeks afterwards."

*** Or, have a streaker run out during a cricket match, screaming 'Voldemort' repeatedly as loud as he can, perhaps having it tattooed on his body for good measure.

Or run for muggle political office under the name of Voldemort.

**** Or they will have to make a band and one of the songs is called Voldemort and it's their top hit.

Flash to the ending of the story: a big concert with some fans, fanatically chanting "VO-LDE-MORT! VO-LDE-MORT! " around the stage, and the dark lord realising why suddenly he feels weak, but it's too late now.

It's not canon-compatibile by the idea of "draining magic" alone, so if you change one thing, what makes you look for roundabout explanation for other things?

D&D 3.5 crossover. Harry's the UMD rogue, Hermione's the wizard, and Ron's the diplomancer bard.

Unfortunately, they have to add Voldemort's caster level to the Diplomacy DC to get them to say Voldemort's name. That's part of the reason that Dumbledore, even with +3 Cha for being Venerable, isn't able to convince most people to say it.
