whups: [Req] Brick in a Sock.

Other than linkffn(Lessons With Hagrid), I don't think I've seen this tool used in any other fics. And yet, I can't help but think that poor little gimp abused Harry would want more than just his Wand for self-defense, especially during the summers when Magic is restricted. Are there any others out there with old-school tricks and techniques for layin' down pain? Or just Stooges-esque humor and thumpin'?


** I think there's linkffn(Almost a Squib), where I remember especially vividly how Harry used a brick in a sock to knock out Umbridge in the Forbidden Forest instead of siccing centaurs on her.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

  But Hagrid, when you said Dumbledore wanted me to have special lessons with you, I thought that meant -- well -- woodcraft, or shooting, or something. Or maybe some sort of weird giant martial arts."

  "'ere, who told you about Crouchin' Titan, Flingin' Wagon?" Hagrid boomed. "...Oo, never mind, I shouldn't ha' said that. Should not ha' said that. Crikey, jus' forget I mentioned it at all."

Oh! My sides! Bah-ha-ha-ha! */*Tears Stream Down Face*/* Too funny, I need to read more of these short fics.
