Hi, I'm looking for some Fanfiction where Sirius Black has a more prominent role, especially as Lord Black. And most importantly, he doesn't disdain the use of black magic but continues to hate his parents (especially his mother) 'cause of their ideology about blood.

I'd prefer without any crossover, but I have no problems with any pairings. Thanks so much

A Marauder's Plan has lots of Sirius. Don't know if there's as much black/dark magic as you'd like (haven't reread it in a while) but it's very enjoyable.

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...
