Looking for recommendations on Harry Potter/Avengers(Marvel) crossovers. Any that are like 'This is gonna be good' would be appreciated. I've read the usual like Wand and Shield and Heroes Assemble but I was wondering if anyone had some other recs?


** this one has constant updates

*** That one is such a fun read. I still go back on occasion to reread it. I think my favorite character has to be Frigga “where my grand babies” Allmother.

***** I like to think of it as a joke but tbh I feel like they're teasing us with the possibility of little ones and I'd very much like to see how they go about raising a child together because I'm honestly a sucker for fics that include people having kids. (Don't mind the rambling, I'm bloody tired right now and I'm always bad at phrasing when that happens.)

  Parallel universe time travel? Natasha Romanoff has done it. But meeting Death himself who gives her a baby who's being hunted by terrorists? That's a new one. Simply put, she might need little Harry as much as he needs her. Natasha Mother Figure. T/M rating.

** linkffn(Child Of the Storm) has Thor as Harry's father. Loads of Avengers interaction and with basically all the Marvel Universe. Has a WIP sequel too called Child of the Storm.

linkffn(A Third Path to the Future) has Harry interacting with most of the Marvel Universe also, mostly with the X-Men though. Has some smut and absolutely massive chapters, IIRC they average 45k each.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.

*** Not to bash, as I'm genuinely curious...did this ever get good? I stuck with it for a bit, mainly because I figured one wouldn't start a fic this weird if you didn't have a really good idea for where to go with it, but I got bogged down the what seemed like endless meeting between various characters in the crossover, handling of logistics involved with making the two universes work together...and what I will charitably call the author attempting to get the hang of writing the MCU characters.

God, that sounds like bashing. I really do just want to know if it got better, because I would like to read more of it if it pays off.

**** I assume you're talking about child of the storm? I really enjoyed the story and I am really enjoying the sequel but to be fair, I don't have high expectations when I read fanfiction. People complain about tropes and poor writing and such but all I want is a fun read and I get that with this series.

  Harry has been through a lot yet there are some perks to being as gifted as he is. So he's not going to just sit back and let the world shit on him. He's going to best the absolute best. First few chapters are hard to read. Get past those and I promise it gets better. Also, I know the beginning sounds very cliche. It's explained later so try to stick with it. M for bad stuff
