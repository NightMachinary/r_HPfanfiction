OK, first off I'm hoping to make a list of all the Harry Potter/Bellatrix stories here, so its easy to find them and read them. I've read quite a few from [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] but it occurs to me that a few might not be uploaded there, and there might be some which don't include pairings in the description and slipped under the radar, so please help me find them all and collate them here. I'll be using the given descriptions where I can find them, a word count, indication of completion and giving a PERSONAL rating for how I perceive the stories in relation to each other. This isn't to downplay anything you might like more, but to give people who have no idea where to start some direction, my direction, since I'm the one making the post. Ugh, that came out sounding worse than I'd hoped.

Anyway, this should one day hopefully be better than just using the filter on FFN, and make it easier to share these stories.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][*Delenda Est*]] *: Complete : 10/10 : 392,000 words :* Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][*Wind Shear*]] *: Complete : 8/10 : 126,000 words :* A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/Stepping-Back][*Stepping Back*]] *: Updating : NaN : 246,000 words :* Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8378840/1/Passageways][*Passageways*]] *: Updating : NaN : 277,000 words :* Hogwarts Castle decides to interfere in the lives of two of its students to change the past and future from a terrible war and giving the pair an opportunity to find something more than just protection within its walls. AU Story, Political, Fed-up Harry, OC Dumbledore.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2208427/1/Earl-of-the-North][*Earl of the North*]] *: Complete : NaN : 187,000 words :* Harry is framed for the mass murder of Muggles after he deals Voldemort a stunning blow. He is sent to Azkaban where he and his cell mate, Bellatrix Black, begin to discover Harry's heritage and his potential power as they plot to escape.

And thats all I've got so far, I'll monitor this thread and add suggestions etc from the comments and my own findings as time passes.

We all know Hallatrix (or Barry I suppose? /s) is the best pairing, and now we can make it more accessible to the uneducated masses ( and ourselves).


** If you don't mind abandoned stories then:

/Only Enemies/ has Harry and Bellatrix stuck in the past/AU hating each other. I remember it being readable, but not really that good. 5.5/10 linkffn(2896398)

/Ouroboros/ never really gets to the actual pairing so to speak, but there is plenty of interaction between the two. This story could have been great if it wasn't abandoned so prematurely. 7.5/10 because it is really well written but is essentially smut at this point. linkffn(6927447)

** Man, this pairing is in bad shape if this is seriously the best there is.

Delenda est has 20 good chapters and 20 bad chapters, ultimately averaging out to a mediocre-to-average fic, one that has a horrendous sequel.

Wind Sheer is atrocious. Let's not beat around the bush just because the author died recently. There story had some potential, but it was pretty much squandered before the first chapter was even over. The only thing the story has going for it that it is complete, and it is Harry/Bellatrix. If all you care about is jamming words into your eyes regardless of content, it works.

Earl of the North is the testbed for Delende Est. When it came out, there was very little else with the pairing. But, let's not try and convince ourselves that it was even good back then.

Steeping Back is just mind-nubingly tedious.

Passageways is terrible, and I don't know how anyone can make it past the first chapter. The list of cliches is quite impressive.

Other than those I can think of Only Enemies which is pretty good, but abandoned, and largely unedited, which affects its readability. Turning of the Sun is interesting, but boring, and the author gets sidetracked with too much random shit.

*** Yeah, Delenda est had so much potential then the whole skip forward in time thing was just bad.

I didn't think Stepping Back was that bad but the last update was fucking terrible the author “killed” harry but he didn't die cuz of some bullshit and then Bellatrix goes insane and starts murdering children of death eaters. I can't see myself going back to the story.

  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.

  Well... Harry is pissed, his relatives tipped his inner balance, so he snapped and turned dark. Yes, this is a very dark!Harry story. This is also going to be HarryBellatrix. So if you don't like it, don't read it. Contains also some graphic violence.

** i can deliver a Fic too linkaff([[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600025759]])

And if someone is still looking into this Thread, i would like to know, if someone might know Fics that have them in some sort of isolated situation, with some teasing moments, similar like the Fic, that i posted, but with Bella yet hostile towards Harry.

Also Fics that have him be travel to an AU and learn a Beautiful Bellatrix (so, before she was robbed of her Beauty in azkaban), who never turned evil. Harry might fall for her appearance.

Another one that have Harry/Bella dance with each other or she perfom a Dance on her own, maybe with some magical effects and he finds her attractive in that moment, against his will.

Political Fics with them having an affair or working (secretly) together would also be fine.
