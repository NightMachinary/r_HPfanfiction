I noticed a lack of Bill centric fics considering that I was curious about his character. He was old enough to remember the First War too, so why not read a fic about him? Took me awhile, but I found at least one decent fic:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10765600/1/The-Past-and-Future-War][The Past and Future War]] by AlexDnD.

It is a time travel fic, which I am aware that it is a bit cliche but why not? How Bill came back in time was more realistic (at least realistic in a magical way) and original too, so I definitely give the author some brownie points for that. The magical duels that author writes has more variety and are more interesting as well. Anyways, the future this Bill came from was where war still raged on and continues to wreck havoc so Bill was set on fixing that.

Warning though, the fic has not updated in awhile but the story is worth the read in my opinion.

*** No problem! I really enjoyed this fic myself. I am mainly surprise that there aren't many Bill Weasley centric fics. Even if there are more decent ones, they are difficult to find.
