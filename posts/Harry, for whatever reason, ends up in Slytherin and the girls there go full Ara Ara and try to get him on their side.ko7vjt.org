******* It's a solid one, it's in my favorites for fluff.

1st season was great and while 2nd wasn't objectively as good, I love it bc Garou is possibly my favorite character in anything ever.

******** I was sad that the studio changed for the second season. The quality that was delivered on first season was top notch.

The fanfic was such a nice reading. Why the better ones never keep going??

Yea, maybe they'll get a better studio for 3

*** "Ara Ara" is an anime meme about older women/girls liking younger men/boys.

It is usually very creepy because the boy tends to be underage and the woman an adult, but I guess you could find some not completely creepy age combinations that could count as "ara ara".

See [[https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ara-ara]] for more information.

*** I was mainly thinking it would be a canon Harry who got his “not slytherin” ignored, and some 3-4 years decide to try and get him on their side.

However, what could be fun is some Indy-Harry BS but instead of letting him angst all the Slutherin girls in his surrounding years do their best to try and date him and cheer him up, a solid semi-crackfic
