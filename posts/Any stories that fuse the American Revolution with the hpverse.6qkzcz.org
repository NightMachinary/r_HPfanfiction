Where Riddle is king George III, dumbledore is Washington, harry and friends are various statesmen/generals? I've been listening to the hamilton soundtrack as I reread Delenda Est and I need some revolutionary wars of wizards vs wizards on open battlefields and political drama.

The idea that the American war of independence was a revolution against the King is an example of a modern myth perpetuated by bad education. In reality, by the late 1700s it was Parliament that was the true power in Britain. The English civil war had established the de facto supremacy of Parliament over the Crown in 1651 and the Glorious Revolution of 1688 (followed by the Bill of Rights 1689) cemented and formalised the situation.

Of course, the monarchy was still in place, so any rebellion was a rebellion against the King, but the King did not have a functional role in the conflict, neither in terms of American motivations nor in how the British handled the conflict. By way of example, it was a shift of the balance of power in Parliament and the resulting fall of Lord North's government which led to the British deciding to end further military operations.

What Taure said.

Also, given that Voldemort was fighting a rebellion against the government of the time, shouldn't he be on the American's side who were doing the same?

** I'm pretty sure JK wrote on pottermore that both sides stayed out of the war.
