** Why always the killing curse? There are dozen ways Hermione could kill Harry in the Great Hall...

She could just reducto his shit out, or slap him to death, of engorgio Crookshanks and ask him to eat Harry...

*** So he would end in a wright like form and have to be resurrected like Voldemort? I mean, I'm not actually sure what would happen if his body is destroyed, we know that his blood inside of Voldemort tethered him to life and JK mention it being like a pseudo Horcrux in an interview but I don't know...

**** If I had to guess, I would say Harry's body can die... but the Horcrux prevails, on the dead body. Maybe it gives the body some sort of intelligent controller... something like that talking mummy in Percy Jackson's attic

Hpffa doesn't have any Daphne and necrophilia stories. They might exist, but that's as far as I'm willing to search for them.

** If anyone but post-graveyard Voldemort hit Harry with the Killing Curse, Harry ain't coming back. That whole limbo scene and the choice to go back only happened because of Voldemort having Lily's/Harry's blood within him (inadvertently tethering Harry to life as long as Voldemort himself lived).

You'd have to do some serious explanation to justify Harry surviving Hermione's Killing Curse, even in fanfiction.
