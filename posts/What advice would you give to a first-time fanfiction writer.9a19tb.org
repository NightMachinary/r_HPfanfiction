I'm not looking for general tips (the importance of grammar and paragraphs). It would be amazing if you have any advice for hp fanfiction specifically. Also looking for things that annoy you the most in a fic. And what do you think is the ideal update time depending on a chapter's word count?


** Update when you're ready, not any sooner. Don't let the readers pressure you into something you don't want to write. It's /your/ story, not theirs.

Also, don't take the especially rude reviews to heart. Otherwise it will kill your desire to write.

** Harry Potter is odd. Its not one book, its a series. As a result there are stories within a greater story. One of the first fics a lot of people try and write is a 'fix-it fic.' I might even recommend your write one but never publish it. Why I'm bringing this up is that you need to understand the consequences of your actions.

As an experiment, if you had Pettigrew arrested at the end of the third year, does it make sense for Harry to still be entered into the Triwizard tournament? To me, and dare I say, most of the community the answer is no. A lot of people's first foray into fanfiction writing is trying to solve what they consider problems with the series but they just go through each and every event but do it 'better' what few realise at the time is that from the first change onwards the later events they change shouldn't be happening. As a result the stories are a disjointed contrived mess.

Whenever an event of note happens, work out the consequence. Don't just rely on what happens next in canon.

Now, there are hundreds of pet peeves threads that you can search through. I don't think Fflai is keeping it up to date any more but there was even a subreddit dedicated to keeping track of them there were so many of the bloody things. If you want to know what annoys people there are a lot of resources out there.

An important thing in writing but especially in Harry Potter is accepting that your idea has almost certainly been done before even if its just not well. There are 755k Harry Potter stories on FF.net. That's a lot. Don't ruin your story by trying to be too out there. Write what you want to write without feeling the need to try and do something new. Originality is a good thing but solid writing is probably better.

Do you know what makes you love Harry Potter? Do you feel you know each character? Feel free to ask people, either in the IRC/Discord or on here about characters. Knowing their strengths, their defining moments might help you understand them. It was over a year ago but I had a thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/622pq7/characters_defining_moments/][here]]. If you appreciate every character you can avoid bashing. Accepting a character's flaws is a good thing. Removing them is bad but so is taking a flaw and destroying the character over it.

If you dislike a character that's fine. Try to be honest to yourself though, do you dislike the character because they were a bad person, because you find something about their character annoying or because you think they're a bad character who adds nothing. For example, I think Snape is a bad person but a good character and I don't like the way the final books had him. I therefore would avoid including him in anything I write because I don't know if I could be fair to him. Hermione irritates me. She is meant to be an obnoxious know-it-all. One of the worst things you can do is get rid of that trait. Its a big part of who she is. Its a flaw that helps define her. Making her a person with good social skills isn't Hermione. If they're a major character understand their flaw, chances are its going to come up.

Remember, at its core a story is about conflict and things going wrong. A lot of stories would be over in a page if sensible things happen. Your job as a writer is to make the conflict as genuine as possible. If a solution is stupidly obvious and you're avoiding it then you've messed up. Keep asking yourself what could go wrong, often if it can go wrong, make it go wrong but don't drag it out. Sometimes the good guys need to win, sometimes the bad guys need to get ahead often in ways that ramp up the stakes. Catching Draco Malfoy feels like a great moment, but Voldemort breaking open Azkaban that night would make that small victory feel a bit more hollow without invalidating it. Things have got worse, the stakes are raised but your had a peak. Your story wasn't all doom and gloom.

Obviously the most important thing is to enjoy it. Don't take FFnet favs/follows to heart either. Very, very few people respect them. So long as you're happy that's what matters, even if you've produced the worst and probably only Harry Potter/Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea crossover featuring Hogwarts' own Giant Squid as the main character.

** If it's going to be more than 10k words, an outline is a must. Not only does it solidify a course of action for you better than your memory will, it makes the whole process smoother when real-life gets in the way and issues are easier to find if done properly.

So for example, my current HP story is going to be rather long (few hundred thousand words, no doubt). So for me, I needed a pretty good outline which did a few things:

Summarized how I wanted particular characters to be characterized, how I wanted them to grow and so on.

Where in the plot I want certain events to happen roughly speaking.

Just these alone really help, no doubt more can be done. But planning things usually makes for a better end result, even when just starting out.

** This is general, but it is fresh in my mind, having just read a fic that did this.. Cliffhangers. Yes. But. Occasionally. Unless you're writing a suspense thriller, I'd suggest only 2/3 or 3/4 chapters should be cliffhangers - AT MOST. Even if you're writing a suspense thriller, you NEEEEEEED to have somewhat regular lulls in the action so that your readers can relax for a moment and put down the story to, say, go to bed. These lulls can even increase the tension in later tense/cliffhanger-y chapters. I'm not just saying this because it's a pet peeve of mine, although as someone who goes to work at 4am, it is a pet peeve for me... I'm saying this because I, along with a group of other amateur writers, was told this exact information by Kate Forsyth (A BRILLIANT FANTASY AUTHOR).

#+begin_quote
  It would be amazing if you have any advice for hp fanfiction specifically.
#+end_quote

Don't write what has already been done to death. "Your" take on marriage contracts/+rape+ marriage laws/Harry's harem has already been done countless times and pretty much all of those attempts were terrible. There are quite a few tropes which are common despite having horrible implications. For example, Marriage Laws are an atrocity neither Hitler nor Stalin dared to enact. And Hermione would rather take a killing curse whilst leading the revolution which aims to overthrow that kind of law than submit to it, even if she is already in a happy relationship.

Try to be creative, or at least use rarely used characters. No one expects you to invent the wheel 2.0 in each fic, but, for example, if you are writing a Yule Ball fic, don't end it on a single kiss and a comment how "perfect" the evening was. That one is so common, I feel like vomiting every time I read that.

Also, remember that you are not writing for kids, so your fics can have harsh language and the occasional mention of sexual acts beyond snogging. I'm not asking for hardcore smut and Harry dropping F-Bombs like his name was Arthur Harris, but

#+begin_quote
  horny teenagers + big empty castle + ten adults to supervise things = sex
#+end_quote

We don't need to read about the explicit details, but please don't pretend that teenagers don't have sex (and the age of consent is 16 in the UK, not that teenagers care about that, but you wouldn't belive how many fics (most with Ginny) have her wait for her 18th birthday because the author thinks that Hogwarts is American.

#+begin_quote
  Also looking for things that annoy you the most in a fic.
#+end_quote

Making Harry overpowered or the love interest too perfect. Unless you are writing with a cracky undertone, having Harry as equal to Voldemort or Dumbledore isn't enjoyable to read. Likewise, the love interest should have some flaws which matter in some way (so "not realising how pretty they are" or "too large tits" doesn't count). If you need inspiration for flaws, just look at your friend circle/family and pick something annoying they do (always late, always stays up late and is a zombie before they take a nap, lazy). And remember, you are writing about people who are descirbed as average looking and still teenagers while at Hogwarts. So Harry won't be 6'6" and ripped (if anything, he'd be short due to ten years of malnutrition), Hermione won't look like Emma Watson, Ginny won't look like some Instagram fitness girl and Lavender isn't a pornstar.

Also, while on the subject of Hermione, she isn't nearly as much of a sticker for the rules like fanon implies. She led Umbridge in the Forbidden Forrest, hoping that either Gwamp or the Centaurs would deal with her (and Centaurs are infamous for rape). Hell, she was fine with brewing Polyjuice at age 13 because Malfoy looked kinda guilty.

She could have Emma's face and body, but with very bushy hairs. Just to be fair, [[https://goo.gl/images/FqJ5RV][Emma's body]] is not really that special either.

That might actually be the case. Harry had very high standards for girl's look. When it comes to imagining Ginny, I like [[http://blvnk-art.tumblr.com/tagged/ginny-weasley][this artist]] best.

** A similar question was asked over in the general FanFiction reddit, asking about the biggest lesson people have learned in writing fanfiction. Since HP is where I cut my teeth, that's where I learned these three lessons:

1. Don't let angry and/or bitter readers chase you away. Half the time, they've never written a word themselves and are just there to harass writers until they give up and become as miserable as they are.
2. Ignore shipping wars. Write what you want to see, even if its unpopular, because guess what? You aren't the only one who wants to see what you're doing, especially in a fandom where one ship dominates the fanfiction section. People WANT variety. Don't be afraid to give it to them.
3. Don't try to please everyone. That's impossible. Its better to cater to a small, but loyal crowd of readers than try to win 'popularity contests' by writing in every suggestion offered in reviews.

** If you're really new to writing I would do a couple of one shots first to get a feel of the thing.

I strongly suggest that for your first multi chapter fic you have it written before you start posting. You will save yourself much stress if you do that, and avoid all the business of writing yourself into a corner or leaving a fic unfinished because you get bored or don't know where to go next. You'll also be able to maintain a brisk, regular posting schedule.

Get a beta. It's hard to find a beta if you haven't already got a body of work to show, but a decent beta is worth their weight in gold.

Try not to be discouraged if you don't get a lot of attention. That's easier said than done I know, but gets easier over time.

If you're serious about the craft of writing, seek out critiques and listen to what they say, even if you don't want to act on them. Also practise writing good critique on others' work. You'll learn more from that than anything else.

Review other writers in your fandom.

Don't try to please everybody. Write the story you want to read and stick to your guns.

** Use [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/writingcenter][this resource]], specifically the Lexicon. It helps a lot.

*Join a discord*, either the [[/r/HPfanfiction]] one or the [[/r/HarryandGinny]] one. Both have authors that are willing to help with whatever you are working on. Feedback is great.

Outline the hell out of things. I've got a 6 page outline for one of my works and I still feel that it isn't good enough. One of my works I've had to scrap a good chunk of it because I didn't plan it out well enough and it made me very angry. *A good outline will save you loads of time and reduce stress in the future.*

​I've also got a specific document with my changes/additions to canon magic to make sure I stay consistent within the rules of magic I have set within my work. I do something similar with characters, having a specific document and mapping the character progression of each of the 3-5 major characters.

​Update time is a personal choice, one that honestly you don't need to worry too much about. I'm more of the mind don't set certain expectations/obligations, just post whenever it is ready and you'll have a lot less stress. As a new writer its better to have freedom with this so you don't post things that aren't polished. Not everyone can be Darth Marrs posting 7k words every Saturday at 10am.

As a matter of fact, it might be worth considering just avoiding interaction with readers altogether until you either develop some hardcore thick skin or you gain the experience to filter the garbage out of the actually useful feedback.

I've seen far too many promising stories crash and burn because the author got too involved with reader interaction and literally burnt themselves out because they couldn't ignore people who kept harping at them about nitpicky shit.

Other than that, however, do not go back and instead write forward, because even if the story could have been better with more editing it's most important that you do actually finish something, any single thing that's not completely insignificant, as doing that means you'll know that you can finish things and this is very helpful.

** I agree with finding a beta/editor. Specific to HP fanfic, if you're not british, then try to find someone who is to look things over. Your writing will feel much more authentic to the material, and much less jarring to readers, if there aren't a bunch of out of place americanisms (or other non british cultural -isms).

On a similar note, remember when the books are set, and try not to reference things that weren't around at the time. Even the books managed to slip up on that, but it can be really egregious in some fics I have read.
