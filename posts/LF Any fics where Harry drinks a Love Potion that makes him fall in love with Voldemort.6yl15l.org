I just had this idea, and I'd really like to read one instead of being forced to write it myself. Crackfic is obviously okay, though a serious take on it would be fascinating.


** And Voldemort finally realised why the power he knows not is love, and he is terrified. This would be hilarious just imagine voldemort standing there on the battlefield saying he has come for potter, and harry is like yes, yes cum for me, and Voldemort runs away with Harry chasing him loudly exclaiming his undying love for while while everyone around just stare dumbfounded at the scene.

*** Or how about Voldemort tries to take advantage of Harry's infatuation, only to be defeated by it somehow in the end? Harry might even come up with the idea himself in a desperate bid to gain an advantage.

**** Yeah, but that's the serious story version of it. I want the cracky version of it, and I blame you for putting it in my head.

P.s. I might write a one-shot humor story of this in the next week. I'll link if I do.

  “Is it wrong,” Harry asked, “that I still love him?”“Humans are strange creatures,” Death replied.The cryptic answer was ignored. “Because I do,” Harry said before he could stop himself. “I do. He's a horrid, horrid man, and love potions are the vilest things ever to be created, but I'm not under its control anymore, am I?”“In death, you are free.”He scoffed. “Free from everything but him, you mean.” In another life, Voldemort won the war, and his ultimate prize was none other than Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived. But all lives come to an end, and now free from his captor, the Master of Death must make a choice: to save a broken soul, or to punish a man who has done more evil than good.

  Love, the most powerful force on earth. Voldemort, the most powerful Dark Lord ever. Vendo Diligo, the most potent love potion that exists. Harry Potter, the unfortunate victim subjected to all three. Emotions are wicked things. Slash. FIN!
