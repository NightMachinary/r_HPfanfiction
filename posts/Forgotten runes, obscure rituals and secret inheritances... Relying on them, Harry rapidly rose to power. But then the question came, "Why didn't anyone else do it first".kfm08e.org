The answer can be anything.

Maybe everyone strong like Voldemort and Dumbledore have done the same and Harry simply doesn't know.

Maybe there is a price to pay and most people would be happier forgoing the power.

Maybe the standard technique for gaining power (eg. human sacrifice) simply beats Harry's obscure techniques in granted power/ ease of use.

Maybe Harry's techniques are unique and inimitable. (eg. Harry can mark Runes on his body because he is the Boy Who Lived. Anyone else attempting to do that dies painfully.)

** The technique is influenced by the positions of many, many stars and uses multiple highly convoluted arithmancy techniques to do correctly. When done correctly, it boosts the user's magic. If there's a mistake, it tears them apart slowly. Most decided it wasn't worth the risk of a mistake.

Harry gets chased into the local library's computer lab one summer in a bout of Harry Hunting. For one reason or another, he gets into coding, then starts studying muggle astronomy. After all, he was locked in a cupboard at nights. He didn't see the stars until age 11.

Harry's collection of magical and non-magical astronomy texts rockets him to the top of the class.

Fifth year astronomy focuses primarily on how stars impact complex magic. When the professor does a lecture on the overly complex and arcane rituals to boost magic, Harry connects it with rocketry, where computer calculations drastically improved the time it took to prepare the missions. That summer, the librarians notice that weird astronomy kid is spending more time than ever calculating constellation movement...

*** Cue 10+ years later, Muggleborns are running roughshod over every magical nation that wasn't keeping up with the times. With computing power, coding instruction, and astronomical data all readily available, rituals go from near-impossible and suicidally dangerous to just technically challenging and mildly dangerous.

That idea actually makes me want to see a fic where computers suddenly make some of the most difficult aspects of magic much easier. The closest I've seen is linkffn(12087691).

Conversely, maybe feeding Runes and Arithmancy into a computer is a Very Bad Idea. One prompt I came up with years ago was to base Arithmancy on the Laundry series by Charles Stross.

**** I really want to combine this with some worldbuilding I've seen where the European magic community forced everyone else into Secrecy. The massive death toll from "Scourers" is actually the results of the subjugation war when Native American mages refused to abandon their culture. The Americas nominally enforce Secrecy policies, but tacitly support institutions like Miskatonic in developing weapons to overthrow the European domination of magical communities.

Harry's innovations are recognized by Miskatonic researchers and they get him out of Britain before the purebloods running the government force him into Azkaban. Harry's new dilemma is where he loves his research and getting support for learning and experimentation, but he's uncomfortable knowing his colleagues are applying it to war magic.

** I'd say: /most people don't care/. They're happy to live their lives in the niche they chose to, as long as their needs (housing, food, partner) are met.

That takes out about 90% of the population if not more, given that unless one violates the Statute of Secrecy by exploiting Muggles, it's perfectly possible to survive on one's own as a hermit using nothing more than a wand - it's not a requirement to have a job. The remaining 10%... 90% of these either have some sort of morals (e.g. like Mundungus Fletcher who's not shy of stealing from comrades but scared as fuck, they don't want to kill, which is a requirement for the most powerful Horcrux ritual) or lack the skill/talent required (easily imaginable with Runes, maths or anything involving broomflight).

Which leaves a total of about 1% that want to achieve extreme levels of power... and here's statistics again: the Wizarding population is shown as extremely small and regularly being culled by wars (Goblin wars, Grindelwald, Voldy 1, Voldy 2). Which means that there are very few in absolute numbers - and of these, it's likely that most fail at some step (e.g. they can't use the Unforgivables because they lack the determination required).

The remaining ones pop up every couple of decades and cause havoc - or silently use their powers without drawing too much attention to themselves, having learned one way or the other that drawing attention always also draws /unwanted/ attention such as stalkers, greedy / desperate people, criminals or law enforcement.

Also: those who currently have generally-unknown powers have a vested interest in keeping them secret - Dumbledore for example removed the Horcrux books from the Hogwarts library, teachers may leave these out of the curriculum (e.g. knowledge about time turners or powerful runes).

** I'd recommend taking a look at linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) - it does an interesting/good way of handling the rituals/rune magic aspect in terms of making Harry very very powerful, yet also come at a clear cost that explains why it's not the standard.

It's an approach I quite like for that sort of ritual/darker magic and the costs associated with it
