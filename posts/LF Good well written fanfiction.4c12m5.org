Like the title states I'm looking for good well written fanfiction. No m preg or yaoi please. I would love any fanfics like The Lie I've lived and A Cadmean Victory.


** I'm keeping a keen eye on a FFN author who goes by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/6577726/The-Winter-Wren][The Winter Wren]]. Nice, neat prose, organic dialogue and interesting divergences. That being said, all of the stories are only a couple of chapters in, but they were only published this month, sooo...

** Anything by Inverarity. His writing is second to none.

** Check out the DLP library, where people submit stories to be rated and only the highest quality rated 4/5 or above make it in.

Of course, this list of recommendations is tailored specifically to the DLP community, which prefers non-slash and Harry-centric stories.
