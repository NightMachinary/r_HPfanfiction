I've seen a couple of stories set in the present day where the Ministry has a website (only accessible to wizards, of course). Well, I'm sorry to say that as is common in near-future sci-fi, that [[http://magic.gov.uk][magic.gov.uk is no longer available]].


** Really? Because I was able to follow the link and it wasn't a "404 not found" or a "domain name available" thing but some interactive map?

*** ...you might just belong in the house of duffers. (jk jk, hufflepuff is awesome)

he says it's not available as in, the domain name is taken by an interactive mapping software/site. So, if the Ministry of Magic wanted a website, the expected domain name is taken and therefore not available.

Or were you just trolling?

What makes you think that they aren't the owners already?

***** Ah. except that, well, I doubt anyone in the ministry is quite muggle-savvy enough to be able to put together something like that. Even muggleborns, leaving the muggle world at 11, won't really have much knowledge of programming/software and likely wouldn't be able to make something like that. Unless...maybe they contracted out to muggles to make a cover site for them. Ones in the know, in the normal UK government. AND you have to have special magiparticles (or something) to access the magical side of the internet.

****** This is decades after Voldemort has been defeated. Harry and Hermione clearly have already revolutionized the Ministry and Muggle relations.
