I'm really tired of the whole “Tom is a brute who crucios first, demands fealty later” trope. Give me some sly Tom who has a way with words and can sweet talk someone in to jumping off a cliff without them even realizing. I want to see the full force of Tom's charming façade. I want to see Tom rely on his cunning way with words over torture and bloodshed.

Slash or het is fine. I don't care as long as it's complete or has consistent updates.

Please no unnecessary bashing/Evil! Dumbledore nonsense. Tom can hate him or whatever, I just can't deal with any more “oh dumbledick was a master manipulator who cared not for anything but his own agenda” like god damn, leave Wizard grandpa alone, thank you very much


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23965102][Cacoethes]] Is a fic I recently finished and found very engaging. Tomarry, Features, Time travel, Slytherin!Harry, Kind of a Horcrux bond between Tom and Harry, Grindelwald as a threat

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26949952][Fine Line]] Harry stumbles over the Diadem!Horcrux while he hides the book of the Half-Blood Prince, which possesses him. So basically he's got Tom Riddle (in his 20s) in his head, who of course follows his own agenda but corrupts Harry alongside the way. Eventual Tom Riddle/Harry Potter *WIP*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13059681][A Dangerous Game]] is a brilliant WIP Tomarry fic, which features a very well written and manipulative Tom Riddle. *Summary:* Tom Riddle opens the Chamber of Secrets in Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts. After a botched attempt to extract the Horcrux in Harry's scar leaves their souls tied together, Tom is forced to kidnap him when he makes his escape. A story of Horcrux hunting, adventure and unwilling attraction.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6996054/30/]]) Dreams and Darkness Collide. Serial Killer Harry, Minister Tom Riddle. Features, mindgames, bad ppl being killed, Kingsley as head of Aurors and an opposing force, Tomarry. Rather open ending (not complete but worth the read anyway)

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13638300/]]) Hilariously entertaining but sadly only 7 chapters (WiP?) Harry and 2 other Aurors end up in an AU in which Riddle is Minister and Harry ends up working as his personal assistant. Tomarry

  AUSLASH! Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned

  "Figures," Harry said with a smile. He was smiling. At Tom Riddle. He was going to get murdered before the year ends, he just knows. alternate universe/Post-Hogwarts. warnings: mature themes, drinking, swearing.

** As someone who's been searching for this for years... no. But then again you have to be charismatic or at least know how a charismatic person behaves to accurately write a charismatic character.
