I know it stands for community, but /why?/


** It's my understanding that they reprogrammed how the communities worked a while back. C2 is the newer version.

**** That is my understanding. I got introduced to the pit shortly after they made the switch, so I couldn't begin to tell you what actually is different just that it is.

** I'm pretty sure it's nothing more than how the word sounds. Community is a long word to write and the latter half of it sounds kind of like two or enough like it not to be confused with something else. It's a fairly distinctive shortening so it's hard to misunderstand what's meant by C2.
