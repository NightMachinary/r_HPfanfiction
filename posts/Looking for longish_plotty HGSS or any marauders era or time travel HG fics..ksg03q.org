Hey! I've read lots of fanfics during quarantine and I love me some Snape fics, especially those involving time travel. I've read mostly fics on ffnet and AO3. I don't really care much about the age difference, and currently my favorite fic is The Poison Garden. Any and all recommendations are welcome! Thank you <3


** The Debt of Time: You've probably read this, but worth mentioning because IMO it's still the gold standard of HG time travel fics. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10672917/chapters/23626929]]

Time Mutable Immutable: Unspeakable Hermione goes back in time to stop an assassination attempt on Snape. HG/SS. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17960324/chapters/42418760]]

Hero of the Story: Hermione is reborn as Peter Pettigrew's sister. HG/JP. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24720655/chapters/59754481]]

Not HGSS but Snape is paired and his character fixed so he isn't a dickhead.

*** Yesss! It's the only way I've seen Snape get paired off with someone that doesn't seem like pedophilia or creepyness.

** I'm going to assume you've read the really popular ones like Pet Project and Chasing the Sun so these are some of my favorites that i don't see mentioned too often

linkffn(11405979) : Quantum Entanglement by CaspianAlexander. It's a time-travel fic set in Marauder's time.

linkffn(13349849) : Catch the Wind by RosyClovesy. One of my all-time favorites. Also time-travel.

Enjoy!

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10945260/1/Soulless-Marriage]]) They time travel together to kill Voldemort before he became Voldemort. (The author just finished this one. It's amazing)

linkAO3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23591347/chapters/56605786]]) This one is still going. Time travel + Marriage Law. Includes marauders era and alternative future! Very messy and intriguing.
