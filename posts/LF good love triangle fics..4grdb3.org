Ones that actually have me guessing what the final pairing will be. So for example, if there's a love triangle between Harry, Hermione and Ron and the author frequently talks about how totes evul MoRon is 4 realsies, while saying Harry and Hermione are perfect for each other because they said so, then I doubt anyone would bet money on Ron coming out on top.

Don't care which characters are involved, although ideally, I'd prefer it to be characters in the Hogwarts era, as opposed to the Marauders era of the next gen of characters. Ideally no blank slate characters involved either.


** linkffn(A Curse of Truth)

Decent enough fic, probably the best self insert in the fandom. It's Harry/Hermione/OC.

It's sort of obvious how it will end, but it's a good read regardless.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

*** I read this on a whim. I have no idea why. I hate SI stories but this is actually a really enjoyable fic. So now I have a strict "All SI stories are awful...except A Curse of Truth" rule that I follow

**** I'm pretty much the same way. As a blanket rule, just about every self insert is bad... except for Curse of Truth.

** linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation). It's not a /romance fic/ per se, but there's a brilliantly written and rather bizarre love triangle between Hermione, Draco, and Neville.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.
