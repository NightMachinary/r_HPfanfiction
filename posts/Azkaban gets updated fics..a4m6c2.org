Are there any fics(main focus, or not) where Azkaban gets updated, and becomes more humane. I can't be the only one who think that Azkaban is inhumane to a large degree. I mean thieves get tbe same treatment as murderers. I'm all for the worst of the worst experiencing hell to a degree, but Azkaban is too cruel.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** I found the Azkaban reform to be a really interesting background element of linkffn(The Aurors) . It's definitely not a huge part of the story, but it ties into one of the story's major themes: Laws and fair justice, and not rage and revenge, are the best ways to bring peace back to the wizarding world and move on after the Second War.

When there's a breach in security in /The Aurors,/ the guards who worked at Azkaban blamed Harry's post-war reforms for it, which I thought was a nice touch. That happens a lot in the real world -- people who worked in a pre-reform system often resent the reforms and resent the extra work that the reforms require, especially when the reforms require the "good guys" to treat the "bad guys" like human beings.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

*** That sounds interesting, but one question, are the original character(s) well written?

**** Definitely yes, she's one of the best. Theia Higglesworth is a really good portrayal of a young, inexperienced Auror who takes a while to earn Harry's respect.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.
