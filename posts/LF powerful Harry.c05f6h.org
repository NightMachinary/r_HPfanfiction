I'm looking for fics where Harry is more powerful than Dumbledore or has more magical control. But not an immensely OP harry please. Also no yaoi or fem!harry. Thanks.


** There are quite a few fics with "powerful Harry," though to be honest most stories where it is out-and-out stated he is more powerful than Dumbledore are ususally ones with a looot of bashing. Some decent examples:

- Linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure): a classic, though its only in the sequel where we see him shine over Dumbledore. Some bashing, but hardly the worst.
- Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived): another classic, though Harry isn't yet that strong, its implied that he has surpassed Dumbledore at the same age.
- Linkffn(The One He Feared): a twist on that idea, but well worth it seeing the magic play out. You'll understand.
- Linkffn(Learning to Breathe): not for everyone, and a pre-DH fic, but Harry is insurmountably stronger than Dumbledore by the age of 16. This is particularly clear in chapter seven with the Nundu battle in Kenya.
- Linkffn(Delenda Est): this one has time/interdimensional travel and some loosely-canon magic, but it is firmly established he is superior to Dumbledore by the end.
- Linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): a personal favorite, and one of the most original time-travel stories I have encountered. Harry comes back to save the future from horror...in only four hours. There are some badass fights here too.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

There is no senseless Dumbledore bashing (it's actually got an active Dumbledore, though Harry has some disagreements with him at the start), and Ginny does a couple of stupid things but they get forgiven. It was written pre-DH, which explains some things (e.g. no Horcruxes).
