** Linkao3(Eleven Up) is a series of interviews over time about Muggleborn students being introduced to the wizarding world, covering their years in Hogwarts. Not precisely what you asked for, but it should be interesting.

  In 1990, prominent Muggleborn research wizard Cromwell Albertson embarked on an ambitious project to interview six Muggle-born students -- before and after their life-changing discovery of their wizarding talent. He continued these interviews over the next nine years, a period of time which spanned both the Chamber of Secrets attacks in 1992 and Voldemort's second rise and subsequent persecution of Muggleborns in 1997. The Pensieve Projection that resulted won a Superbius award for artistic excellence in 2002 and has been required viewing in the Hogwarts Muggle Studies course since 2008.

  She first hears the word “Mudblood” bellowed at top volume out of a red envelope she will later learn is called a Howler.   Five times Lily Evans hated being Muggle-born.

  'It's not just Death Eaters that kill Muds. After the Second World War, the Muggle civil rights movements got started. Black rights, and feminism, and gay rights. We -- wizards -- we never had the sixties, because we just kept replaying the war, over and over again: Grindelwald in the forties, then Voldemort in the seventies, then Voldemort again in the nineties. I just hope this time it's really finished, and we can sort out our own fucking house.'Hermione is back at school after a summer in the Muggle world, and everything is changing. But getting closer to Harry doesn't get her any closer to the war - until she's unexpectedly enrolled in the Order of the Phoenix, and meets Hestia Jones, the founder of Mud Pride.

** I thought it'd be interesting if it was the opposite. We see the racism that muggleborns receive all the time, but what about Purebloods being constantly pressured to "be more civilised," or how about "you can't just do that(some type of tradition that family passes down)." Even though that while the Purebloods know that it's not needed, it's a family tradition similar to rubbing the Buddhas belly. How "why can muggles have Christmas, but we can't have such, and such?" It'd be interesting to read a story where while Voldemort was terrible, the reason why so many flocked to him was, because of all these muggleborns trying to change harmless tradition, and holidays. That muggleborns treat Wizards similar to how some people treat other cultures traditions as stupid, and it just gets worse from there.

Sorry, i'm bad at explaining, but it just sounded so interesting.

*** Well you're not alone. There are various types of Slytherin apologia, and "actually the muggleborn are ignorant rude immigrants who want to change our culture!" is one of the more common. If you're looking, you're likely to find this trope in Harry/Draco stories that take place during school (or Harry/anySlytherin), or in stories where Harry gets sorted into Slytherin. Often it's more in the background, like "oh we're off to celebrate Samhain in the forest, which Dumbledore banned in favor of Halloween here at Hogwarts because he hates tradition!"

One challenge is that Rowling didn't exactly world-build much wizard culture. Mostly people will use pagan holidays and traditions as a base, and then build from there.
