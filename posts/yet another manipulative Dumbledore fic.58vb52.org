Um, sorry, this is my first request on this subreddit, so sorry if I messed up the title. (I would've used a more meaningful one if I wasn't forced to capitalize every word.)

A few years ago, I've read a HP fic which starts with Harry dying at some silly 120+ age, on what is said to be the sixth loop of his life. Then he wakes up again at age eleven, goes to the Hogwarts Express, meets Draco Malfoy, gets distracted and ends up in Slytherin.\\
Then Draco, who had apparently also been looping through his life, explains that Dumbledore had been manipulating everything, and that the sweets on the train were dosed with some potions that would temporarily change the eater's thought patterns and, if they were a first year, make them sorted into Gryffindor. (I particularly recall this part - it was my first introduction to manipulative Dumbledore, but ever since I've never seen anything similar to this particular idea used anywhere else.)\\
Anyway, since Harry did not eat any sweets this time (being distracted by Draco), he did not end up in Gryffindor (a few other canon Gryffindors also didn't end up there, because they also didn't eat any sweets this time over, and I think there was someone from a different house who did eat some and ended up in Gryffindor). Then it turns out that Slytherin has a huge library and that the view from their common room window is very important and something something that makes Harry and Draco's attempts to untangle Dumbledore's plans much easier. I don't actually remember.

Anyway, I've been thinking about this fic lately, and realized I want to re-read it again. But I haven't seen it since the original read-through (um, 2012 or thereabouts), and I didn't recall enough of the plot to search reliably.\\
So I decided to ask this community. Any ideas?\\
Note: I would also be interested if you know of any other cases of a similar plot point; I'm actually surprised why nobody else seemed to have thought of it, but maybe it was just considered too silly.

[EDIT: did I flair it correctly?]\\
[EDIT 2: fixed the flair, otherwise it probably won't be found]

*** Don't remember if it's canon or not, but most fics will say they have a window that shows under the lake.

**** Canon. From Pottermore introduction:

  As you'll see, its windows look out into the depths of the Hogwarts lake. We often see the giant squid swooshing by -- and sometimes more interesting creatures. We like to feel that our hangout has the aura of a mysterious, underwater shipwreck.
