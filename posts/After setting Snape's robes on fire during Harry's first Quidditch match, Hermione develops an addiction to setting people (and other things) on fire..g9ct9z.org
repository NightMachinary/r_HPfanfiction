Who does Ron practice these other spells on? Ginny? That'd give him a chance to see what's good for a laugh, and what just makes a girl angry.

** "And just how did you manage to destroy the entire top half of the Gryffindor Tower on accident?"

Headmaster Dumbledore's question made Hermione blush under the spot covering her cheeks. She reached up and tugged on a piece of her burnt, frazzled hair nervously, her gaze flitting to the side.

"Well, Sir," she began, her voice a bit meek under the cold gaze of the slightly burnt Professor McGonogall," you do know how much I love to... expand my knowledge."

Dumbledore made a motion for her to carry on, his serious visage ruined by the entire lack of a beard he had. All that was left was a few, black whiskery hairs on his chin.

Hermione licked her lips. This was the hard part to explain. But... she really couldn't be blamed, to be honest. Everyone should always strive to learn more skills, and if her particular set of skills tend to include more fire-casting spells than any respectable wizard or witch should have, then all the more knowledgable she was for it.

"I had just gotten access to the Restricted Section of the Library, you see," her words fell out of her mouth in a tumble, but dawning comprehension began to cross the faces of the two professors in the room- and horror on her friends', who were sitting on either side of her for support.

She soldiered on despite the intensity of their stares doubling. "While I know that some of them may turn out to be quite..."

"Dark? Dangerous? Absolutely, unquestionably illegal and idiotic to practice on your own with no supervision?" Professor McGonogall's voice was dripping with acid. Hermione felt like she had been stung, and flinched back.

"... controversial, I found myself reading a book that mentioned this spell- it was another fire one, but not one like Incendio," Hermione said, her voice turning reverant. A wave of excitement rushed over her all of a sudden, her heart pumping rapidly as she recalled her past revelation of a new, beautiful spell. "This one would give you finer control over the fire, you see, if you had enough willpower. It was dangerous due to how overwhelmingly powerful the fire itself was, but..."

Hermione bit her lip, and turned her gaze to burning bird. Her eyes shone, taking in the flaming glory of Fawkes.

/"... I thought I was strong enough to use Fiendfyre."/

** Canon!Hermione once said she's aware of Fiendfyre, including its abilities to destroy Horcrux, but refrain from using it. Keep in mind she already lost Ron for a while due to the locket influence, and acutely aware of the terrible effect on her and Harry by carrying it around. Not even once she suggests the group visit a deserted beach, chuck the locket then apparate away after unleashing Fiendfyre. Even when Harry is seemingly killed and she's doomed to live under the reign of a racist wizard whose very lieutenant recently tortured her, she doesn't resort to unleashing it to the advancing Death Eaters.

Now we have a Fire!Hermione who solved even the tiniest problem with Incendio (albeit with Flame-Freezing Charm for most non-Slytherin). Just a single demonstration should be enough to convince every single baddies in the canon to sit and behave.

** Relatedly, I've been wanting to see a fic in which Hermione has an affinity for electricity, culminating in an occasional use of Force Lightning from Star Wars. There's even canon precedent for it. When Hermione in OotP catches Fred and George experimenting on first-years,

#+begin_quote
  ‘If you don't stop doing it, I'm going to --'

  ‘Put us in detention?' said Fred, in an I'd-like-to-see-you-try-it voice.

  ‘Make us write lines?' said George, smirking.

  Onlookers all over the room were laughing. Hermione drew herself up to her full height; her eyes were narrowed and *her bushy hair seemed to crackle with electricity*.

  ‘No,' she said, her voice quivering with anger, ‘but I will write to your mother.'

She just needs to weaponise it.
