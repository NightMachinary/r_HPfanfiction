Is it just me or did anyone else get pissed at the Duel in the Ministry when the spells from Dumbledore and Voldemort connected. Like Voldemort fired an Avada Kedavra and it's not like Dumbledore had the brother wand...I don't know why but that made me so mad.


** They really nerfed Avada Kedavra in the films.

** Yep. I wanted to see the Flitwick, Minerva, and Snape duel in Deathly Hallows too. Would have been great. A short intense battle with spells and transfigurations. Instead we got stupid monochromatic flames being batted away by Snape, not even a demonstration of spell blocking which would have been way cooler.
