Example(these are not fanfics): Teddy, Hermione, Remus, Sirius, Daphne, Ect....


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11487602/][Resurrexit]], linkffn(11487602), currently in the Book Club, has Harry going nuts over Luna's death.

However, I don't like this story for several reasons:

- Switching between first person present and third person past is extremely confusing.
- Harry's motivation or target of his wrath didn't make sense.
- Some of the plot development didn't make sense.

"The Sum of Their Parts" is infinitely more superior to this story.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): He and Hermione staged a revolution after being betrayed by the establishment again. They systemically executed their enemies and incurred the wrath of foreign pureblood regimes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): After losing Hermione due to a tactical mistake, Harry killed every Death Eater and Voldemort sympathizers. And he killed ALL of them a second time after returning to the past.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan all became psycho killers after the War. When Hermione managed to send their memories and powers back 25 years, they unleashed hell upon their enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]], linkffn(4586362): Not Harry, but James, Sirius, and Remus went on a rampage after losing Lily. One-shot.

****** i think a number of things could have been handled better. its been a few months since i read it so my memories not great. I didn't mind the very ending but it would have been nice if there was a little more insight into how harry's wizarding britain was. I remember my biggest problem were the occasional throw-away line that I could tell were /trying/ to be very emotionally charged and insightful, but instead came across as cliche and made me laugh. but in the end i loved the story and harry's fall into dark magic and the trio's friendship enough that i could easily forgive the shortcomings.

** Linkffn(too young to die) harry's sister dies, he becomes obsessed with finding ways to resurrect her and does a lot of questionable things while at it. There is some Potters!bashing, BUT I actually found it bearable and it had a solid explanation at the end and the plot makes up for it tenfold.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
