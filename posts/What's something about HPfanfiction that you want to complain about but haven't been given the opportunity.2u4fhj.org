** I don't like it when characters act a certain way, but I'm not sure how to explain it exactly. It's kind of this rational but not realistic way of talking that I hate. For example after meeting Hermione and talking to her for 10 seconds harry starts to say something like "Just because you read it in a book it doesn't mean it's true, let me give an example," then he starts talking about famous books that are wrong or something. No, just no, real people don't talk like that .

Also, I strongly dislike it when someone writes a "dark" harry, but all they're doing is writing a glorified self-insert, with all kinds of justifications about why they should pretend to be good or not kill someone or whatever. If they're evil write them as evil!

And I hate the whole concept of mindscapes or metaphorical mindscape battles, especially as a horcrux removal method. It's lazy in my opinion.

**** I think its because its unlikely at the time in England (1980s) that someone would name a child harry as that's normally a shortened form and in the UK, naming kids short forms of names was associated with poorer people for a long time (eg. Jamie for James, Bob for Robert, Lizzie for Elizabeth - people would name the kid the longer name but always refer to them as the shortened form).

Personally, I think its equally unlikely that 21-year old cool James and revolutionary Lily Potter would want to name their child 'Harold' and so people look for alternatives. I also think Hadrian comes because of Ginny's Ginevra reveal - unusual names or unusual proper names seem to be common or accepted in the wizarding world.

Of course, a counter is that one of Harry's grandfathers (probably the muggle) was called Harry or Harold and they named the baby after him.

******* I'd still find it problematic if two married 40 year olds were transported into the bodies of two 12 year olds.

A 12 year old has a different chemical make up than that of a 40 year old and doesn't react the same way so how a 40 year old thinks and feels may not be physically possible in a 12 year old body and brain and certainly wouldn't be acceptable coming from a 12 year old if they were possible.

That's why I've always liked how the adult Harry in the 'Mirror of Maybe' reacts to finding himself back in his teenage body. He magically ages his body (maybe just a glamour, it's been a while since I read it) and goes out into society as an adult because he's got more freedom and worth as an adult.

******** The reason that we consider it wrong for an adult to have sex with a twelve year old is because of the huge disparity in life experience, emotional maturity and the power imbalance, especially if the adult is in a position of authority. These are non-issues for two forty year olds in twelve year old bodies. Sure they'd suddenly have to deal with adolescent hormones again, but they still have decades of experience and maturation behind them. They're not ordinary twelve year olds.

I don't really buy the argument that twelve year old brain chemistry makes them as unable to consent as a regular twelve year old. Given the fact that memories are stored in the brain, it's obvious that they don't have an ordinary brain for their body's age or they wouldn't remember who they were. I think a lot of adults put into that situation would be squicked out at first, but get over it, especially with aforementioned hormones and the alternative being waiting years before they could have sex with their partner again. Of course, if aging themselves up were an option, I imagine some would do that rather than living through puberty again.

It is weird when a fic does this and they're completely unfazed by it, though.

I don't understand why it's happening that way - I mean back when almost every Disney movie had a male lead, those leads weren't made out to be Gary Sues - they had flaws. Big ones, every single one of them. And those flaws were plot centric.

But now that studios are pushing for female leads, it's like Mary Sues are the only way anyone is allowed to portray a girl on screen. God help all the little girls if ever they lay eyes on a potential female role model that has a flaw - their poor little minds are unable to tell the difference between the good and bad characteristics and they might be thus prevented from becoming the strong and independent women that are considered acceptable by modern society.

** I mean to write a separate thread about this but a petpeeve for me is the idea of heirs in fanfiction. Usually it seems to imply that Harry or some other character is the last descendant of Gryffindoor or some other powerful wizard from a thousand years ago. The problem with this is, it is statistically very very unlikely that there be a sole descendant to someone who lived that long ago. More likely they'd have tens of thousands of descendants. And the heir just happens to be Harry. This may not be too bad, but it gets worse when 4-5 Heirs all happen to be major characters. This is statistically impossible(probably, I haven't really bothered to work out the odds). And it happens far too often in fanfiction.

*** I completely agree.

Rowling created a lot of grey space in characters like Ron, Snape, Hermione, and Sirius that really deserves to be explored instead of over-simplified in fanfics.

I mean, if you're going to take the time to write a long fanfic, surely you can take the time to explore how Hermione is both a sensitive girl and someone capable of keeping a women in a jar. Or, how about addressing the fact that Sirius could nearly kill Snape only a few years before risking his life/freedom for friends?

** Do not write elaborate sex scenes with 15 year olds, thank you.

Seriously. There are some sexscenes in fanfics, we all know that and some appreciate it. But there is a line, a border you should not cross in your ff and that is underage sex. You're literally writing childporn. And you, as a reader, don't even get it some time. Its the worst when I'm halfway through a scene when I realize that I just read about 15 year olds doing stuff to each other that even I didn't have the guts to ask my girlfriend about... yet. What the fuck?! I mean, I read about a hardcore SM scene playing out in the Chamber of Secrets which Harry used after his second year to live out his desires. What desires? That guy doesn't even have pubic hair at that time, for fucks sake.

The Firebird trilogy was always so damn close to this but avoided that trap by never actually writing the scene. It makes you hate the dark magical society the author describes without forcing you to read stuff that hits a grey area of childporn.

So do not write about 15 year olds fucking each other. I beg of you all.

*** The problem with that is that 15 year old (and under) /do/ fuck/experiment/make love and that's why there's a market for it. If someone wants to write about that I think that's fine, they have the artist license to do so. However I would like it to have reason in the story (looking at you Stephen king) or bar that be done in a way that is realistic.

*** I totally agree. I think a big part of it is people writing fanfiction tend to write their fantasies and are often 15.

It's also a side effect of the HP world being set in a school.

The firebird trilogy is to me the perfect line. Yeah there's loads of underage sex but it's not made to be sexy, it's made to be disturbing and the author does it fantastically.

** Ron bashing.

If you don't like him as a character, fine, whatever, make Harry not friends with him or decrease his screen time immensely. But 11-year-old Ron was not a jealous, hateful sexist racist who ate every 30 seconds and spewed food out of his mouth every time he talked and couldn't have a civil conversation with anyone on the planet-- and yet was best friends with Harry until about half a page into your story, at which point Harry suddenly realized that he's actually the devil incarnate, worse than any Malfoy gang member, and destined to grow up to be a rapist/death eater/drunkard dying in a ditch of syphilis. If that's the only way you can think of to express that you don't like him (or rather, don't like a strange caricature of movie Ron, who was lacking all the good traits of book Ron), maybe you should hold off writing fan fiction until you figure out how to write a character that's not friends with the hero but also not evil/stupidity incarnate.

** I don't mind bashing but when it gets to the point where you make up stupid names for the characters you hate [Dumbles, Death Munchers, The Great Git of the Dungeons] and only use it instead of the character's name, it's a real turn off. SHOW ME why you hate them, hell I don't even mind OOC at this point but for fucks sake use their name properly. If you must use a stupid name, have one immature character use it, not the whole damn cast.

*** There's this one story I read, "The Real Us", by Seel'vor. Basically Harry and Hermione after the last Battle explaining how the canon story was a front while they ran everything like chessmasters behind the scenes. 3700 favorites. In it, they mockingly describe how they've been using Ron as a patsy to be a cover for them while they did whatever the heck they wanted, memory charming him constantly so he couldn't find out. Starting at the age of 11. It's expressed as if they're perfectly in the right, and all the "good" characters agree. They're basically textbook sociopaths, but the author is trying to portray them as glorious heroes shielding themselves from scrutiny behind these horrible idiots they're manipulating, which is okay because the Weasleys are all evil or something, legilimancy said so.

3700 favorites. I don't understand this fandom sometimes.

A little argumentation or disagreement never hurt anyone. Not having even the slightest difference of opinion just makes a fanfic author seem like they aren't capable of fully realizing the characters or wholly conceptualizing the scenario.

** Damn, there's a lot I agree with. Probably, one of my biggest pet peeves is when Hermione turns out to be descended from some magical line. This completely kills her role in the story. One of the appeals of Hermione was the "American dream" and especially a contrast to the blood purity of the Death Eaters. Without any previous heritage and with hard work, she proved herself better than many of the ancient Pureblood families and traditions in the HP world. Give her a wizarding heritage just kills the point of her in the series.

** For me it's whitewashing the dark characters and making them woobies. Frankly, I loathe Snape is an anti-hero trope where his abuse of power over children are ignored so that he could be an angsty anti-hero. I remembered reading a fic where Lily was sent back in time (after the Mudblood incident) and suddenly she's buddy-buddy with him and I'm just: NO.

I'd kill to have a fic where (still alive!)Lily calls him out on his bullying bullshit.

Also, I dislike manipulative-evil-ambitious Dumbledore cause - really? Dumbledore had a lot of flaws but ambitiously-evil and doesn't care about anyone aren't one of them. He's a freaking hard character to write but it doesn't justify the bashing, especially when it's to prop Harry as a badass or Snape as a suffering saint.

Also, any fic that pits female characters against one another (for the guy especially) and turning them into the saint/whore dichotomy get's a backspace from me.

And the Harry =/= Harold/Hadrian(???) and Hermione is a secret Pureblood, Ron is a complete idiot who makes jokes/constantly jealous/secretly hates Harry.

Also, whenever there's a travel back in time fic/ resurrection fic where Harry has all the knowledge, I find it odd that Harry is suddenly this wise, manipulative person who makes sure he's friends not only with Hermione and Ron but also makes Snape respect him, Draco is neutral ally and I'm just, so sick of it. It makes him sound like those fix it sues who gets everything fixed for him on a plate and it's so dull.

And one more thing, the ExtremelyAbusiveDursleys! I find it incredibly irritating because canon Dursleys are abusive guardians; they starve him, emotionally abuse him and basically demean him at every step. Dudley is already physically bullying Harry. So I'm always confused by this assumption that unless Harry is beaten black and blue by Vernon and Petunia, the canon treatment is not deemed terrible enough? Also, I find that most authors use this as a lazy method to make Harry a dark and cynical character.
