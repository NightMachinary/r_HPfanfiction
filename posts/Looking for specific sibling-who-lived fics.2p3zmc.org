** I'm afraid the only one I know of was already posted by deirox but i like the idea. Perhaps while the sibling is being trained by Dumbledore at school, Harry is being trained by Aberforth after meeting him in Hogsmeade (3rd year plus). If someone would write this, I would definitely read it.

*** Hmm Aberforth, not a bad idea. He seems to get the short end of the stick in most fics if he's even mentioned.

I'd try my hand at writing but... while I have ideas, I can see scenes I would like to happen... stringing everything up into a plot line escapes me.
