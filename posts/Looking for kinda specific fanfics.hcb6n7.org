Hello everyone!!

So I'm new in this fanfic world. I took interest in this when an old friend of mine told me there was a fanfic about the marauders out there with some romance between them. She also told me it was very good written and the story was good.

Since I've been playing that Hogwarts Mystery game now I'm hungry for stories in a HP world.

I'm very overwhelmed with the number of HP fanfics out there and I don't know which one to start with.

Also I don't like specific pairing/romantic fanfics (I'm ok with romantic themes or moments in the story but I don't like it to be the whole story). I also dislike Harry Potter as a character. Yeah I know, who is a potterhead and hates HP at the same time?

With this said, I would like to get some fanfic suggestions based on my taste. I will be now describing what sort of fanfic I'm looking for:

-No pairing/romantic theme as the main plot. I'm ok with romantic themes but I don't want this to be the whole plot.

-No Harry Potter as a character. It can be another time in Hogwarts or even not happen in Hogwarts at all. I'm all in about prequels or no canon fanfics. I really want a good plot without HP in it.

-Appreciated LGBT+ characters. I'm ok if there's no diversity in this way in the story, but it would be nice to have it (when I read the cursed child I'd imagine Scorpius being in love with Albus and struggling to express this to him).

-I don't mind if there's NSFW content in any way (sex, violence...).

This is kinda what I'm looking for. If you took your time on reading this I am thankful to you for considering my post. If you help me find a nice fanfic to enjoy I would be more than thankful and will appreciate you for your time.

Thank you in advance and have a nice day :)

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.
