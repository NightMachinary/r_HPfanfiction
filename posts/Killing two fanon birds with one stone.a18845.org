I had a funny thought.

Right, so, much as people might try and turn Harry into Lord Harold Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryfindor-Peverel-etc, we don't actually have any particularly strong evidence that the Potters were a noble house. They were certainly an old and respected family, almost part of the Sacred 28, but that doesn't really necessitate that they were particularly wealthy or had any titles. One of the big pieces of evidence for the theory that they /were/ nobles is the amount of money in Harry's vault, which seems unusually large for a family that wasn't noble or rich. One theory already proposed is that maybe some or a lot of that money is bounties placed on Voldemort, which Harry received as next of kin, but I had a different idea.

There is occasional fanon about the 'Boy Who Lived' series of books. The idea is that Ginny Weasley and lots of other wizarding children have been reading a long line of fictive stories about Harry Potter's magical adventures defeating dark wizards and monsters, and that's where the wizarding perception of Harry as some fantastic hero is coming from seeing as he was just a baby when everything went down. Often it is presumed that these books are being published without any knowledge on Harry's part and that the publishers are selfishly keeping all of the money.

What if they /are/ actually giving Harry a pretty big cut of the money? What if the piles of galleons in Harry's vault are actually his payment for the use of his name and likeness in the series of books? Heck, if Dumbledore knew that the Potters didn't have much in the way of money left over for Harry, what if he set the whole thing up to ensure that at least in this one little way, things could be easier for the boy? Having lots of money is a kind of freedom people without lots of money can't quite wrap their heads around, and gifting Harry essentially total financial security would be a very nice gesture. Benign-Manipulative!Dumbledore for the win I guess.

Anyone else have any interesting fanon meshing theories?

Snape still tries to best the Potters, and his hatred of Harry is due to the long dead ancestor, rather than James.

******** I think the textbooks just collate multiple spells or potions of a related topic or similar difficulty into one volume. I doubt the potions master who wrote it developed every single potion or even most of them. Many seem to be standard brews that have existed for so long they're in fairy tales (eg the draught of living death).

Being standard, there are no doubt variations many of which Snape discovered. Snape seemed largely interested in making variations that were quicker to make or more potent. There could be more considerations to the standard instructions in the textbook, such as economical considerations. Recall that one of Snape's improvements to a specific potion required more beans than what the book said. Good if you're looking to impress the teacher, not so good if you're in charge of ordering potions supplies for Hogwarts students or for an apothecary trying to turn a profit.

He was no doubt a brilliant young wizard, and the Harry Potter books are in many ways an exploration of how his youthful mistakes ruined and ultimately ended his life far too soon. But sometimes I think people do take it a bit too far when praising his potion skills. Much like when they say Hermione is the "brightest witch of her generation", when really the compliment meant the brightest witch her age at Hogwarts.

********* this...relies on a lot of assumptions. we don't know how many of the potions were developed by the author, or how many were reworked by him for the book. that it was due to economic considerations is a headcanon, and that's only one edit out of many. slughorn praises harry, using snape's book, as brighter than lily or severus- and he specifies lily was one of the brightest students /ever/ taught by him. moreover: i think nitpicking the specificity of the potion edits is besides the point; it's like saying potions or magic in general isn't really that difficult because it's just following recipes, or saying words. jkr's descriptions of what make magic difficult or impressive have to do with her world-building. the existence of the book and The Prince persona at all is /meant/ to convey that snape was a genius at a very young age. even then, i don't see how anything i've said was an exaggeration. snape is a potions genius. you can use that to make him the most brilliant potioneer of the last century, and it would still be coherent within the canon we have of him. lupin said hermione was the cleverest witch of her age he's met, not her generation, and not that he knows /of/, and in response to her figuring out his lycanthropy. her intelligence is usually regarded relative to her academic performance, and we know there are people her age who've achieved better marks than she has, so her being the best of her generation is already false

No doubt he was brilliant, but did he invent anything as impressive as the wolfsbane potion? Canon easily provides a potioneer more impressive than him. Damocles Belby invents the wolfsbane potion sometime between the 1970s and 1990s. Tweaking known formulae is one thing, creating something new that was thought impossible is another.

Maybe it would be accurate to say Snape was the brightest potioneer his age :p

we have no idea how old belby was when he invented that, how long it took, etc. or how belby would measure up to snape at the same age. after hogwarts, snape was a terrorist, then spent all his time as a professor, and then spy. like i said: lily was described as one of the brightest slug ever taught, which includes belby. harry w/ snape's improvements is regarded as /even more/ talented than her and severus. you can easily justify lily being more talented than belby, and that applies even more so for snape

so:

you can't justify hermione being the brightest witch of her generation, because canon directly contradicts it

nothing in canon contradicts snape being able to invent potions or improve upon a hair-care potion, and his status as a potions genius provides a basis for it

another example: dumbledore didn't invent wolfsbane either. but given his status as being regarded as one of, if not the most talented wizard of all time, were you to write a fic. where he did, it would be entirely coherent with what we see of him

It really is tragic that Lily and Snape never got the time to let their talent shine, but canon history being what it is, I don't think it's fair to people who actually invented amazing potions to pin all praise on the mere potential of two bright young people killed before their time.

PHD programmes are full of people who show great promise that go on to never achieve anything of great impact in their careers.

I'm not disagreeing that he's a potions genius. I'm disagreeing with fanon making him the most brilliant potioneer of the century. He never really achieved anything amazing after school. Of course there are plot reasons why he never had the chance, but still.

Dumbledore (and Tom Riddle) had a much more distinguished career at Hogwarts than Snape, defeated a Dark Lord rather than served him, and discovered 12 used for dragon's blood. Comparing the two quite honestly shows Snape as the lesser in more ways than just magic. There's nothing wrong with that, most people in canon came up short compared to Dumbledore, but it still should be said.

Snape was a brilliant potioneer, a peerless occlumens, a competent duellist with a talent for the dark arts and an incredibly brave person willing to do terrible things for a good purpose. But I guess I'm pushing back at fanon super!Snape who's second only to Dumbledore and Voldemort in power and skill. How quickly Voldemort killed him when he decided Snape had to die should have highlighted that.

you're repeatedly failing to understand this. i've never said that snape or lily were, canonically, the most brilliant potioneers of the last century, which was a hyperbole to prove the point anyway. i'm saying nothing contradicts the idea that snape, giving it his focus, could be, /much less/ vastly improve on the work of a hair care potioneer, which is what this whole fuss was about. their reputations with slughorn, and snape's canon genius provides a basis for it. phd programmes are full of people who never make any great impact in their fields, and history is full of child prodigies who do. i don't think anyone denies that snape is less talented than the two most powerful wizards to ever live. the dumbledore point was to illustrate that even though he has no specific distinguishments or achievements in potions, by virtue of his reputation and status as a genius alone, a story in which he does would be coherent within canon.

i never said snape was second only to dumbledore and voldemort. improving a hair care potion or even being the most brilliant potioneer in the last century wouldn't make that the case. snape never tried to duel voldemort, so we can't say how long he would have lasted. and i'd say someone able to evade capture while being hunted by more than one talented wizard, and someone capable of stopping a spell before it's caster can even finish thinking it is more than a 'competent' duellist. he's also a spell inventor, and capable of unsupported flight, something jkr described as only the 'most gifted' can do

That said, while contract management, and business law aren't my specialty, I don't think that's quite how companies work.

Harry had a lot of money in his vault for it just to be "Get the money somehow"

How would Snape steal it? At least here in muggle America, there are a lot contracts involved in the ownership of a company, many of them filed with the government. Also, I'd steer clear of the Impirus curse, as those that are in power have a vested interest in making sure that there's minimal magical coercion that could also be used against them.

As for borrowing money from Lucius, the funny thing about borrowing money, is the person you borrow it from usually wants that money back with interest. Lucius would need a significant vested interest in seeing Sleekeasy going under in order for that to be believable.

What inventions would Snape would have of any real value before the end of school, or even before James's death? The issue I'm having here is that Snape is an unproven no one, with no name of any value. Why would anyone listen to him before he becomes the potions professor?

To fix your idea, as an impotent attempt at revenge upon a dead man, he later buys the company from the new owners, and then kills it, just to make sure the Potters have minimal legacy.

lucius likely has 'fuck you' money. nothing suggests this'd be a 'usual' arrangement. maybe he'd do it in exchange for a favour of snape. maybe snape explained the plan and he also wants to destroy the potter's company, a family of notorious blood traitors, on a whim

it doesn't have to be before the end of school, but regardless. he'd have the inventions he invented for this purpose, because he's a genius. regardless: who says he's unproven, with no name of any value? we don't know the status of the 'prince' side of the family. we don't know what official accomplishments or awards he had while in school, other than being a genius. he has the ear of lucius malfoy, and maybe other purebloods, like avery, who he's stated to be friends with. he also has slughorn, his head of house who speaks fondly of him. it's unconfirmed whether he was in the slug club in canon, but both the movies and the book illustrators claim that he was. slughorn just ignores you when he has no interest in you, e.g. ron, arthur. that's not how he treats snape. if he came to him with a few inventions, slug'll jump at the opportunity to help his career. they'd listen to him because he's a genius and his work is good

I guess technically all magical inheritances could work with designating heirs, but that would still leave the fanon "inheritance tests" and "right of conquest" things. Because let's be honest here for a minute, we aren't talking about Klingons and therefore usurping a bunch of titles won't make you popular at all. And given the small nature of the Potter family, it would be unlikely that he'd be first in line to any extinct title.

** Another idea for this:

The Potters were a noble house but aren't now.

At one point their line was reduced to a single squib. Squibs are not considered noble in magical Britain and thus house potter lost it's nobility since all subsequent potters are direct descendants of a squib. They became a rich merchant family afterward. This also disillusioned their house to pureblood values.

** We don't have what I would call strong evidence that ANY house was actually noble. There are two places where it comes up: "Lord" Voldemort's name and "The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black" written on an old tapestry in Sirius's house.

Voldemort's name is just an anagram and entirely made up. People like to go on about Dark Lords and even, in some fics, Light Lords, but there's no evidence that such a tradition exists. In canon, Voldemort may well be the only evil wizard ever referred to as "The Dark Lord" - in canon people don't call Grindlewald that, and he would certainly qualify if it was, in fact, a 'thing".

On the tapestry, "Noble and Most Ancient" simply seems to be a descriptor. Noble does not mean titled, it's instead the definition meaning "having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals". Nowhere in canon do we get any kind of indicator that /anyone/ is addressed as "Lord" besides Voldemort.

Lordships are just not a thing, except in fanon. Neither are trust vaults or family rings (besides the Gaunt one that was an heirloom because it belonged to Slytherin), in case anyone has forgotten.

We know where the gold in Harry's vault came from. Harry's grandfather, Fleamont Potter, was said to have quadrupled the family's wealth by inventing Sleekeazy's Hair Potion and selling the company at a vast profit when he retired.

Fleamont didn't see that market for some reason (maybe we weren't ready for that kind of hair care product at the time?) and thought that sales would flatline when all of the magical world used the potion.

This could open up a lot of possibilities for people who are fans of hair care products and the like to explore. I might not read it, but it's something I don't think has ever been attempted before.

** I may be wrong, but I don't believe there are actually noble families in HP besides Sirius once sarcastically calling the Blacks the 'most noble and ancient house.' The sacred 28 seems more like the American Social Register---for families that were considered wealthy, respected, etc. and pureblood, but has nothing to do with nobility and more to do with being upper-class with a long family history of being upper-class (and pureblood). I always assumed it was kind of like France, where there isn't nobility but true snobs, like the Blacks, attempt to 'hang' on to their titles.

Is Lucius Malfoy ever referred to as Lord Malfoy in canon, etc....or is this just a fan fic/fandom thing that gets taken as canon?

Anyway, Harry's grandfather apparently made a fortune through Sleekzy, so while he probably does get money from his name being used I suspect the vast amount of money he gets is inherited. That said, his childhood home was destroyed and considering LV burned down a bunch of homes in canon, I wouldn't be surprised if James's childhood home burned down, too. So he's poor real estate wise.
