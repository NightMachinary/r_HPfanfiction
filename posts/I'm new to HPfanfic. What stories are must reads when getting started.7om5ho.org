**** The fic that got me interested in HP fanfics is the fully canon compliant [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), Year 6 from Ginny's POV. It's pretty well written and has a strong canon feel.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/][FloreatCastellum]] is an excellent author focusing on canon compliant fics. Her [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]], linkffn(11419408), fills the missing Year 7 actions at Hogwarts from Ginny's POV.

For AU fics, I highly recommend the DH compliant, postwar fic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167). Here, Harry and his friends declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot.

** This is extremly hard to tell. It is too depended on what you enjoy but taking fics that are regularly recommended here are a good start. I would however take a but caution regarding the age of a fic. Also of course, many people are here so we have many different opinions. I give a few recs of mine or which I belive the sub will give.

linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) is kinda the goto fic for humours ones. Extremly well written and recommended all the time. Very enjoyable if you dont search for deep plot or complex character but rather light fun.

linkffn(Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always) is propably THE timetravle fic. Albeit a few unnessecary troopes are used it is overall a good fic.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) another timetravel, but vastly different from Backward with purpose, this fic is very AU. On of the best written fics in the fandom is wastelands and its (still ongoing) sequel a must read.

linkffn(What You Leave Behind) is a bit a preference of mine, which dosen't mean the subreddit didnt liked it. For me this is the best fic there is in the entire community it is however as good as abdonded (Newcomb claimed otherwise, but well, no update in 2 years).

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is a bit hard for me to write here. Many people here say it starts slow but gets very good later on. I personally say this is the must overrated terrible fic out there but given many people see that different it may be something for you.

linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks) is a neat little mystery that can be read in 1-2 hours and yet gives a very heartwarming feeling.

linkffn(Cauterize) is a very beautiful oneshot about the time after the war.

Thats should give a good start.

** linkffn(4745329) On the Way to Greatness, if you want to read a good story where Harry was sorted into Slytherin. The author tries to write a Harry in Slytherin AU as realistically as possible, so the first few years are very close to canon (though the author kept them short), and the story starts to get really good in/after 4th year. Not that it's bad before then. One of my favourite stories.

linkao3(3390668) C'est La Vie by cywscross. Great "Harry travels to a different universe" story, very well written.

link(2680093) Circular Reasoning. A war-ridden Harry is thrown back in time and basically replaces his old self. Darker than the other two stories, but I enjoyed it a lot, and it's also well written.

linkffn(3557725) Forging the Sword. I stumbled across this story quite often before reading it, but when I did I was glad I finally did. Great characterisation, and an interesting deviation from canon.

** Is the bot dead? anyway, if it doesn't come back just google the names lol

I would recommend linkffn(The Arithmancer) as a sort-of-canon-rehash, it follows canon plot pretty closely for a while but its still good and the spell crafting is fun

linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) is a pretty good animagus!harry and it isn't used just to make Harry super powerful.

If you like D&D and crossovers, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is one of the only D&D crossovers and is really good. It was on hiatus for like 2 years but it very recently got an update, so yay.

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) is pretty much the best LotR crossover

linkffn(A Long Journey Home) is a good time travel story, fem!Harry goes back like 5000 years and has to live through all those years to get back to the present day.

probably linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology, or) is the best (or most popular, at least) Hermione in Slytherin

I personally haven't gotten around to reading it, but linkffn(Like a Red Headed Stepchild) is apparently really good. It's Harry but he has red hair. I'm planning on reading it soon...

Again, I haven't read it (or I started and didn't particularly like it for no particular reason) but linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) and the sequels are highly recommended by a lot of people. Its set in America and doesn't have anyone from HP but it supposedly /feels/ like HP, and from what I could tell in the few chapters I did read it seems pretty good. I might start it again later, I dunno.

linkffn(Stages of Hope) is great.

A ton of people have recommended linkffn(Cauterize) and I agree, its probably one of the best in the fandom. Definitely read.

linkffn(Grow Young With Me) is good. HP/OC muggle, post hogwarts & war.

Some would disagree, but I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is pretty good. Some think its the best thing ever, some think its the worst. You just need to read it to find out.

linkffn(Core Threads) is /the/ OP Harry story. lol

IIRC linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) is really good.

linkffn(The One He Feared) has some /really/ good fight scenes, I think.

linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them) is a fun fic of Hermione time travelling to her 2 year old body and ending the war.

Not very well known but IMO its hilarious, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Uncle of Secrets) You might need more knowledge of HP tropes though, so maybe hold out on reading it till you're more experienced in the HP fandom. IMO a lot of fics are like this, like linkffn(Seventh Horcrux), which I didn't rec because a lot of people already have, and linkffn(Potter Ever After)

linkffn(Blindness) Harry is blind but can see magic. Naturally, this leads to OP!Harry.

Honestly theres so much more than this except I kind of forget to follow or fav stories all the time soooo... ah well. At the top of the sub there should be a box in the middle saying "INTRO TO HP FANFICTION" if you haven't looked at that, do so. Also at the bottom of that intro page theres a more general recommendations page, which has a list of threads, fic lists, fics with certain ships, a ton of other stuff.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

** If you want an old fandom classic to show you what can be done, I'd start with After The End.

After that, go with Northumbrian for a dose of canon compliant fluffy goodness. Great for a straight continuation of DH.

Finally, maybe go for the ultimate time-travel fix-it fic, Backwards With Purpose.

... Or, disregard all that and read the General Recommendations Thread, picking what sounds good to you. There isn't exactly a western canon of HP Fandom to give you without controversy.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
