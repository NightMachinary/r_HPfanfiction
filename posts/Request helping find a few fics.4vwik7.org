I am trying to compile a list of ss/hg fics I've read and enjoyed and there are 4 I can't seem to remember the name of.

The first fic- Snape takes the trio to his house and they hunt horcruxes together, hermione is an animagus. At one point she loses her wand down a cliff. And they defeated a horcrux in godrics hallow. Might have been a time travel fic. I can't remember.

Second fic- Snape is trapped in limbo at the castle after the final battle and Hermione's decleration of love brings him back to life. At one point harry, ron, hermione and I think McGonnagall carry his body back to the castle

Third fic- Hermione is abducted raped and tortured and Snape saves her and helps heal her emotionally and physically

4th fic- Hermione enters grimmuald place and finds snape, they end up working together inside the house to find out a way to defeat Voldemort. They somehow hatch a Phoenix that is dark colored instead of red, it plays a big part.

Edit: spelling and misnumbering


** I'm a bit late to the party and I can't help with the first three, but the 4th fic is [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewuser.php?uid=32689][A Walking Shadow]] by Ariadne.

  Hermione's deceleration of love
#+end_quote

She lowers the magnitude of the change in velocity of love? Declaration is the word your looking for. Though if your phone autocorrects declaration to deceleration, that's pretty baller.
