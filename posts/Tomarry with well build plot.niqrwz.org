:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The scene that I remember the most was of Harry apparating away over and over again not even controlling where he landed, trying to get away from TMR, and he almost dies but Tom finally stopped him in a desert. I believe that was the turning point in their relationship. The Dark Lord was more Tom than Voldemort (if that makes sense).

Now, take this with a grain of salt because I may be mixing up fics: Marvolo made Harry look for some books in a library (probably of Alexandria, the magical part of the library) (including artwork of several scenes!) and after he showed Harry a secret library, he started getting some interest in necromancy. So it could be a Dark!Harry tag, but not necessarily evil.

Not a short fic, and the plot was fantastic! But I honestly don't know if it was 30k or 170k of length. For sure I read it in Ao3, if that helps some.

I would suggest some tags but I read it when I was experimenting new tags. Will add more info when -if- I remember something more.

Please excuse any grammar mistakes :)

** I love that fic! Someone else has already linked it so I'm just pitching in to commend your good taste lol. That apparating scene was especially good, a turning point in their relationship.

*** Uh~ never heard of it, probably because I tend to filter out unfinished works but it's been a while since I read a nice reincarnation Tomarry fic. Thank you for the recommendation!
