Okay, normally I LOVE Hermione (I'm a huge fan of H/HR) but for some reason I really want to read some well thought out or at least semi thought out bashing. I already read the one where Harry is married to Daphne Greengrass and takes over the world.

Anything anti-muggle is totally cool, even if it doesn't have loads of Hermione bashing.


** These one-shots aren't "Hermione bashing" per se, but none paint Hermione in the most flattering light:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/HJG-The-Smartest-Witch-of-Her-Age][HJG: The Smartest Witch of her Year]] by HarnGin. Short but sweet: "Hermione attends a very one-sided, yet eye-opening, job interview. Some non-canon content; not for Hermione fanatics."

Seel'vor's [[http://seelvor.fanficauthors.net/All_Because_of_Hermione_Granger/Angst__Destruction/][All Because of Hermione Granger]] is another. Hermione plays games with Harry's heart. And dooms the world. [[/s][spoiler]]

Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/9/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Negotiations]]: "I've always been intrigued by Hermione's comments to Ron and Harry on the train, that she'd tried lots of spells and they'd all worked for her. What if the Ministry were not so forgiving regarding her illegal use of magic outside of school." Ties into the anti-muggles/muggleborn theme.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6821173/1/Her-Biggest-Mistake][Her Biggest Mistake]] By: Itsme66 A mistake is made, and everything spirals out of control from there. NOT a nice story. Rated for substance abuse and suicide.
