does anyone know what happened to depraved devil on Archive of our own because he was last on in December 2018. And he/she had a few stories that have been left abandoned so ive been rather interested recently.


** I'd hate to be a downer but it's not a unlikely turn of events that theyve given up or even possibly died.

Before we jump to that however check that user name for any activity on other sites or their profile for any other links. It's possible they might have moved on in terms of sites or interests. Maybe in notes they mention a Tumblr or a discord.

Granted people leave and come back all the time to fanfiction but if you can't find them at all using their username on other sites it is a possibility based on how unlikely it is for someone to go about closing accounts on so obscure an interest that they've become orphaned.

**** I mean virus not withstanding we are dealing with random people on the internet over the course of multiple years. I read the prince of the dark kingdom by mizuni-same over the course of a month where it took her like 7 years to write and then poof nothing mid arc. No updates no hits for the username going on three years. It was the longest HP fanfic at the time and her last author's note was about her timetable for the next chapter. It was clearly a labour of love.

Maybe he's spending to much time on cocaine and hookers to list his stories as on hiatus but who knows my dude. Read what you can and hope he's alright is all you can do.
