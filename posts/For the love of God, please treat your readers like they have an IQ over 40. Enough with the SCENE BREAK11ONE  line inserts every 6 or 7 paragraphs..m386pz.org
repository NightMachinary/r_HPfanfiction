You know, when Harry and Hermione are having a discussion late at night in the common room, and the next paragraph says " The next morning... " I think I can figure out it's a change of scene without a giant all caps "SCENE BREAK HERE" disclaimer. One or two tildes, a dash, something subtle inserted if you really want to break it out in the text is fine. But holy hell it's really jarring and pulls me out of the flow every time I have to read one of those and struggle to keep my eyeballs in my head because they're rolling so hard.

It's as bad as those fics with "HARRY POV".... "RON POV".... shit inserted the same way.

Edit: I know about the issues with old fics and removing line breaks, and the tradition of someone's own preferred sequence of special characters to denote a break. My (admittedly hyperbolic) post was more about fics that literally include the words "SCENE BREAK" or "SCENE BREAK HERE" in that sequence. Yes. I can tell it's a scene break there. Because, you know, the context changes.

** FFN is over 20 years old. It used to delete line breaks. Now it supports them. I suspect some of the stories people find predate the change. Others are just following the pattern they've seen in countless other fics, never questioning why.

As humans, we learn by observing other humans, identifying patterns and repeating those patterns. Babies don't learn to speak by memorizing definitions. They watch the people around them very closely and start to pick up language from context and repetition. Over time, they start to develop rules for how language is used. That never really changes. It just becomes more refined over time as you gain experience.

Your brain is constantly building and changing the rules in your head based on your experiences. When you go into a new environment, you're trying to figure out how to behave in that environment. If you read a bunch of fanfiction where the line breaks are random characters, you may implicitly start to think that's just how we do line breaks in fanfiction and never question it again.

*** Yeah that was totally a thing you had to do to have line breaks and it was often the only way to have line breaks when writing fanfic on forums too. It became almost a personal signature or way to show your artistic cleverness by having the most decorative line breaks. And even when they stopped being needed, that desire to be artistic by making your own fancy line breaks kinda stuck around.

Kind of an extension of ASCII art in a way.

"Only one thing to do; get them out of all the areas with collateral damage" he carefully slipped his wand to his hand with a flick of his wrist quickly hidden, but he had no doubts thet saw it. He turned down an Alleyway, his accent shifting as he quietly began telling to run  it wasn't safe. 

  The Egyptian prime Minister looked down over the pyramids on his lunch break. A meeting after noon, an unveiling and another meeting stood in the way of today being a good , however he was certain that today would be good. When he set his teacup down on the saucer and it and the room began to rattle, he started to have doubts.

You are assuming there are 50 million people reading my fic. With my most popular fic being 20k views and many of those being revisits (let's say... half which is hella low, honestly it's more likely to be 3/4ish ) you're looking at MOST 300 visits (again, likely from multiple viewers). Taking into account you ALSO have to consider that while some impared readers no doubt love fan fiction, just as many don't ever want to read it, accessibility aside.

And ULTIMATELY what it comes down to is that if someone wants to read my fic that badly, they'll just sit through the zeros. It doesn't magically make the fic unreadable by text to speech. You just have be more patient about it.

So no, I'm not going to change something I've been doing for 10+ years for a very niche subsets mild annoyance. It would take me weeks to go back an edit my old fics. If they don't want to sit through it, cool. Click off. They'll find a ton of fics that use line breaks. Just not mine.

Years ago, most people used 3 asterisks like this: *** as a line break.

Then ff.net decided to delete those. Asterisks, lines, tildes, anything that isn't part of the alphabet or normal punctuation marks got automatically deleted.

So, people had to get creative. Otherwise, you'd get one scene rolling right into the next without any breaks in-between. Some people, though, got a little /too/ creative.

** Kind of the same is when they rehash the main plot points of hp.

Why. We read the books/watched the movies. We know about hp. That's why we're reading this. Don't tell us he fought a Basilisk. We know.

This is generally ok if it's just a paragraph but in my experiences this is a sign about how the story is going to read.

*** I /hate/ canon rehashes.

I'm not saying you should never reuse canon scenes. There's plenty of reasons to do that. Sometimes authors get extremely specific about their canon divergence point, or they don't want to fuck with an important plot point like the prophecy.

Harry/OC fics are the /worst/ about it. I've read a couple that are literally just an extra person and some dialogue related to them being inserted into canon and they somehow make literally zero changes to any canon scenes. That shit is absurd and I hate it.

*** Canon rehashes are bad, but I have an exceptional hatred of how most fics handle the Sirius Black situation in year 3. Like, every time, it boils down to the characters saying "what if Sirius black... is actually innocent!?" and then miraculously arriving at the right conclusion. Like, anyone who knows canon knows Sirius is innocent, so there's no point showing it unless it's a drastically AU story where someone else is guilty.

It bothers me so much that when it came time for that it one of my fics, I deliberately had the characters draw the wrong conclusion.

Harry looked at the snake then said /§Yes yes, your scales are quite pretty, now stop chasing Hedwig before she eats you in annoyance.§/

--------------

I mean even without the /§§/ I know he's going to be speaking parseltongue in that context, but it also helps me keep in mind that the majority of characters around him won't understand what he's saying, or that he's still talking to the snake later on as the conversation carries on.

/§Stupid fuzzy headed rat keeper.§/ The snake hissed.\\
"What did he say?" Asked Ron.\\
/§Shush§/ "It doesn't exactly translate," replied Harry, blandly.

** The bit with the "POV" only works in First Person fics, written Light Novel style, which very rarely changes the POV anyway, so you'd have it maybe once at the start of a chapter to let you know that it's not Harry's First Person POV this chapter.

In 3rd person narrative, jumping around POVs becomes wonky.

As for Line breaks, a quick "Two Days Later" in bold on its own line is enough for a break, rather than some kind of obnoxious ######## taking up the whole line. If you're having multiple timeskips in a chapter because Harry is training like for the Tournament, then harmless three words for the Timeskips to let you know that time is jumping ahead repeatedly and prose explaining what happened during the timeskips is harmless.

** While this criticism may have some kind of point in there.... others have pointed out the issues with older fics. For the new ones, if it bothers you so much, are you a registered Beta anywhere? Fanfic is FREE after all.... there are not any editors. Authors need Beta readers to work with to improve their skills. If you'd like someone to improve your reading experience, it may be more useful to channel this criticism into ACTUALLY helping a writer? Who again.... writes their stories for FREE! Just an idea.

A.N: I /think/ I get that you aren't being too serious about this? Just trying to poke fun at something silly that mucks up your reading experience? However, I do not abide gate keeping tactics. Fanfic is a free community, that I have always believed should breed togetherness. Mocking writers for mistakes or creative choices does nothing, except discourage a writer from ever posting again.

Have you ever posted something super personal online for the millions of eyes to judge and critique, for free?

If yes, then you come off as a bully know it all author who thinks they are better than everyone else.

If no, you just come off as a choosing beggar.
