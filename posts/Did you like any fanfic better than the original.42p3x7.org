If so, which one and why?

If not better than original, any come close or equal to?


** I prefer fanfiction in general over canon now. There is just so much more to the world in fanfics. But fanfic authors have an advantage in that the world and characters are already built, they just then get to take that landscape and run with it. Forever Knight, Bungle in the Jungle, sword of the hero trilogy, denarian trilogy, summer of change, etc. many of those stories are just as dear to my heart as canon.

** I think I almost like Alexandra Quick better than Harry Potter. Although some adults do try to protect her, she doesn't get a free pass from consequences of her actions. Granted, Alex and Harry have very different roles, but she somehow seems a bit more real for being a brat. Harry Potter is a bit more fairy-tale-ish, AQ a bit more real-world-ish. Or as someone pointed out to me the other day, it's more gray-and-gray morality, than black-and-white. Voldemort is clearly wrong, and must be stopped, end of. AQ has multiple sides to it, and they all have a genuine case.

Plus, Harry had almost a Mary-Sue feel about him. Disobeys orders and takes off on a broom? Becomes youngest Quidditch player. Sneaks around after curfew? Scot free. Sneaks into Hogsmead? Scot free. Steals a car, smashing a valuable tree? Scot free. Fraternising with wanted criminals easily, friends who almost always back him up or agree with him, running away - usually when he does get into trouble, it's because the adults are wrong, not him (dementor at Privet Drive, everything concerning the Dursleys, everything concerning Umbridge, and pretty much all Snape). Alex has also done all of those things, and got into trouble. She cannot meet her father easily or often, because wanted criminal. Her friends often disapprove of what she does, and she has frequent fights with her best friend. Whenever she's in trouble, we know it's because she deserved it. Mostly. Harry Potter gets a free pass through everything, Alex Quick gets things made deliberately harder for her by the adults.

*** I really liked AQ, but I thought she was the one who was a but Mary-Sue-ish, and the author made up for it by making her a brat. I kind of got irritated with how she kept getting in trouble. With everything she'd been through, it got to a point where it almost became nonsensical to punish her. I agree that Harry got away with things a bit too much, but AQ often left me with a bad feeling. You'd think she'd learn her lesson after the first three times she screws up. It was a great story though. Can't wait for the next one.

**** Yeah, I have to say, her compulsion to flaunt rules does get irritating. But I have a sibling on the spectrum, and they had almost the same compulsion despite repeatedly knowing the consequences. I think that's part of what I like about it - it's not necessarily a story where you sympathize with the main character.

I'd like to see her...pilgrimage and see if it helps her grow a bit. I hope the Grannies help her like the JROC did - tough love.

For a man not far off fifty, he does a good job portraying a teenage girl. But I don't think he does the Ozarkers well, so a bit worried about that.

***** I was pretty irritated with her expulsion. Like, of all things she'd done that deserved expulsion, protecting herself for nearly being murdered wasn't on the list. But you just reminded me about her pilgrimage thing. I was really interested when the story went into Chinese-American Wizardry, so it will be cool to see what he has to do with the Ozarkers. Honestly, that's what I love most about the story. How much world building there is, and how it sort of goes into different cultures' wizarding worlds. It JK ever does write more, I'd be very interested in a new series that talks about a wizarding student in some other continent. It would never happen, but would be really cool.

** The fanfiction that comes closest to canon for me is linkffn(Weasley girl) I'm actually wondering why that person is writing fanfiction and not publishing her own books. Although I suppose borrowing someone else's world is a lot easier than creating your own.

Still it's not as good as canon though, not even close.

** I have three stories that at least measure up to the original. The first, as someone has already stated in here, is the Alexandra Quick story. A story completely separate from Harry, it's nice to have a new set of characters set in a completely different country and honestly dealing with much different magic than Harry did. Alexandra as a character is much less endearing but at the same time much tougher and has truly dealt with a lot of awfulness that Harry did not experience at a younger age.

The second is the canon world of Northumbrian. Some of his stories have absolutely captivated me. linkffn(The Mind of Author Weasley) is one of my absolute favorite one-shots. Much of Northumbrian's world I honestly treat as canon.

The third is really the only Harry Potter AU that I have fallen head over heels for, and that is linkffn(Innocent) by MarauderLover7. Basically changes a few elements in Harry's world (the big ones: Sirius Black escapes earlier, 2 years before Harry starts school, and "kidnaps" Harry; and the Malfoys have 2 sons, Hydrus and Draco). Those two changes set off a chain-reaction of differences in Harry. It has 3 stories and the 4th is just in its infancy.

Honestly, the hardest part has been these authors slowing their pace of writing. I find myself checking daily for updates, hoping that one of the three has provided me with new material. I know Alexandra Quick has been years, but I understand Verarity is still working on the next installment. MarauderLover7 is an every-other week author nowadays but that's just enough to keep me happy. Northumbrian is a bit all over the place but has recently been writing again and the newest installments are a joy (I'm just dying for him/her to pick back up on linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh). Probably the best non-one shot Northumbrian work).

**** I know, I saw that his really been pretty slow to get discussion going. I think people are honestly just a little bit nervous about the series actually continuing, and so it's hard to invest in something like that for fear of the disappointment that will occur. Committing to one novel-length fanfiction is difficult, but to commit to an entire series like Inverarity has done is difficult. Life keeps happening, and to undertake something like that, for free, is very difficult.

I honestly think people would attempt to pick it up and finish if she abandons the series. A rash of fanfiction about a fanfiction. I'm sure it's been done before, but that story could spin off in so many different directions, I definitely see that becoming a thing, particularly if the series does not continue.

Inverarity's a guy. Don't worry, I made that mistake at first too; his username is rather ambiguous.

/I've/ already written AQ fanfiction (recursive fanfiction?), so why others don't I have no clue. But Inverarity recently posted on his Livejournal that he took a hiatus from working on AQATWA (book 5) and he's back to writing, albeit very slowly. So I guess we can keep the flame for now!

** From a literary point of view, whether it's about world building or character developments, no fanfictions I've read so far come even close to the originals.

However, I've found a few fanfictions that are more fun and satisfying to read. I generally prefer intelligent and ruthless protagonists in a story. Book trio was intelligent enough in my opinion, but they lacked ruthlessness to deal with their enemies effectively. Even in the final battle, they still mostly fire stunners while death eaters basically threw the kitchen sink at them.

All my favorite fanfics feature ruthless main characters, here are my top 5:

*Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106), is about Harrymort vs Voldemort. Obviously, that guy had no problem dishing out damage on a massive scale.

*Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), has Harry building a kick-ass team with Bellatrix Black, especially in the 2nd half, these two had Voldemort's balls in a vice (if he still had any).

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005), is about politics, strategy, intrigue, and mayhem.

*Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650), has Harry, Ginny, and Ron traveling back in time to fix things up, and they were pulling no punches. The Azkaban execution scene was probably the highlight of the story.

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382), is generally a light-hearted romance with little violence. But when his girls were threatened or harmed, Harry was merciless. Before even reaching an age of 13, he pulled a brutal revenge on Lucius Malfoy for slipping the diary to Ginny; and he ruthless sent Draco to his death after another of his girls was harmed.

  Chaos: when the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future. One gene varies, one neuron fires, one butterfly flaps its wings, and Draco Malfoy's life is completely different. Draco has always found a certain comfort in chaos. Perhaps he shouldn't.

** I find that I can't compare them, even with the obvious similarities. Because even though the world and characters are the same, in name at least, each author brings their own feel to it. Fanfiction, to me, is reactionary and emotional. People finished this amazing series, and many were left with either a desperate desire to experience more of this world, or correct what some believed to be unforgivable errors (excuse the pun).

I don't have any specific stories to bring, but I really enjoy stories where characters that weren't explored in depth in canon are now thrust into center stage. I love seeing the growth people bring to these characters, one of the best parts of Rowling's world but sadly one that for obvious reasons, can't be done with everyone. So in that way, Fanfic as a whole is almost equal to the great Rowling. I know this is a little off the topic of discussion, but I needed to think this through, and this is where my brain led me :)

** The only fanfic that has the readability of canon is [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128050][Bonds of Blood and Magic]] (edit: for me). Sadly, the author has some rl issues and can't seem to update it at all lately :(

Other than that, fanfiction has kind of become its own world, not completely loose from canon but not the same either. The fact that there are so many fanfic stories to read is amazing and a big plus over canon too.

** I like quite a few fics more than canon. Many more. Canon suffers from plot holes and dei ex machina. But what harms canon the most is JKR changing the roles of the novels from children's literature/fairy tale genre to teen literature. She also tried to go kinda towards epic fantasy but...it did not work. At all.

That said, canon has very few technical errors (e.g. grammar, spelling, etc.) and did create a whole world, even if much of it seems to not be covered. Fanfiction is by default at best matching the second good aspect, and I've yet to read a fic that had technical precision on the level of a published novel.

That aside, I'm also not a kid anymore. I was when I read canon, but my tastes have changed and matured (I hope). Fanfiction can fill that genre, whereas canon is forever stuck.

There are few fics which I think are actually semi-objectively better, however.

*The Firebird Trilogy* linkffn(Firebird's Son). This nails realism, has fairly extensive world-building, large scale, and has very good technicals to boot. This is the best HP fanfiction written in my mind, and it sits at the top of my favorites.

*A Black Comedy* Already linked in this topic. It kinda requires you have some knowledge of canon to work to its fullest, but it's wonderful. Enough said by everyone else here, too.

Those might be the only two that I think are better than canon, and A Black Comedy is kinda iffy since it relies on it a bit for backstory.

As for ones I like more and consider at least canon's equal...Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time, Delenda Est, Denarian Trilogy, Reign of Power (technical aspects need a lot of work, but otherwise it's wonderful), An Old and New World, Narcotic Effects, Coping Methods, and Intoxication. I might've missed some...but yeah.

In general, I like these fics better because of a sense of realism that canon just fails to find. They also generally avoid writing pitfalls, and I can ignore the technical errors enough (and they are few enough) for them not to overly bother me.

Not sure if you wanted a ffnbot dump so I'll avoid linking the others in my list.

** Methods of Rationality: Yudkowsky makes the story actually believable while at the same time leaving obviously weird stuff around that are not errors but rather clues for the reader. The story essentially reads like a mystery novel where you are given all the clues and expected to make the connections yourself.

A Black Comedy: This is sort of way out there and thus not really comparable but I definitely do like it more than the original. The writer has an excellent form and grasp of comedy, utilising both pauses, foreshadowing and Chekov's Guns in a very professional and skilful manner. It is hard to come up with anything to improve in this one.

Maybe that's about it.

I think it's the two main reasons why this fic (and his author) is often reviled.
