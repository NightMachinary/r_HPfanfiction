Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

â€‹

You've probably seen this one referenced before, but if you haven't, not only is it the best Harry/Ginny story I've ever read, but it might well be the best fanfic I've ever read, including Debt of Time. And it has 3 sequels!

Might have to check out the one your mentioned! Love Ginny!

*** Definitely one of my favorite fanfics of all time. This is my true head canon of Ginny. The story just gets better and better. I still want someone to write a ff with an element of the Parlor in it. Might be one of my favorite OCs and original elements in fanfic history.

****** Oh cool, great! Changeling also does great things for Ginny's character development. She starts off very vulnerable and grows so much.

** Was going to recommend Seeking Ginny until you said "Make sure all characters are in character." Like hell Ginny's characterization in Seeking Ginny is anything like her characterization in canon after HBP. In that light your requirements seem ambiguous.

With that said, Linkffn(Backward with Purpose Part I: Always and Always by Deadwoodpecker) is pretty fabulous.

*** That's true actually I guess but I don't like Ginny in canon she's too much of a Mary Sue and doesn't deserve Harry. Here she struggled and was heart broken and her character and pain was built up, i loved her. And yeah Ginny still was in character she just loved Harry which made her act different, but still like herself. If you get what I mean, rude at times, funny, and more emotional which just makes her more of a character to me

That's what I thought you were going to say. You might want to edit your self post to say consistent characterization rather than "in character" which is extremely vague.

Early Harry/Ginny fics were so glorious. Also check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/637123/1/The-Phoenix-and-the-Serpent][linkffn(The Phoenix and The Serpent by Sanction)]]

***** Right my bad lol but like if Ginny slaps Harry in a sorry and she's a violent person in the story too it's consistent but it's not close to in character

***** Actually Ginny in seeking Ginny is canon lol she had a temper, she's confident, social and pretty. Just her athletic ability is not there and the same sort of fierceness. And she has a weakness which is her love for Harry. She probably wouldn't the turned out like that in canon but we can never know. She's way more of a balanced character rather than a Mary Sue in that story which makes it just friggin perfect. The reason why early Harry Ginny fics were glorious is because they were written before Ginny's character in the 6th book and left room for a lot of imagination and characterization. After that if you write a love story between her and Harry you have to write her as perfect like she was portrayed

  For years Ginny Weasley has tried to stop her feelings for Harry Potter. She's even uprooted her life. But what happens when it's time to come face to face with him again?

** (Almost) everything ever written by Northumbrian but if I had to pick one it would be linkffn(Centuries by Northumbrian)

I think if you try reading all of them (linked in another comment), they would be more than 40k words.
