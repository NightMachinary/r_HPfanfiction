As it happens, the four founders of Hogwarts were a bunch of randy little buggers, and like with Genghis Khan, every living wizard and witch carries equal parts of the founders DNA, marking every living wizard and witch as a potential heir to the founders.


** I don't think it was expanded on but the story The Goblet's Revenge by duskglow had something like that.

They handed the inheritance test results to the clerk, and after she analyzed them, Harry found that he inherited a few small lines, but nothing huge. He discovered that he was Lord Potter, but that that really didn't mean anything but an inherited wizengamot seat that he couldn't take until he was of age and a few other small benefits. He also discovered that he was distantly related to all four founders, but they told him that nearly everyone in the wizarding world could claim the same.

  Harry snaps at the beginning of the first task, and stops caring about anything, including whether he lives or dies. The Goblet decides to take matters into its own "hands". Toss in a mildly depressed dragon, and things get very interesting very fast. Didn't start out as a crack-fic, kinda turned into one.

**** Thanks man, I'll be sure to give it a read. I was, however, looking for something a little more cracky in nature. Like everyone addressing each other as 'M'lord Gryffindoor' or 'M'lady Slytherin' or some such.

** Usually when I see something like this in a fic, it's specifically Godric who couldn't keep it in his pants and has a gajillion descendants.

*** Which is funny, because he's the one founder who canonically didn't have any.
