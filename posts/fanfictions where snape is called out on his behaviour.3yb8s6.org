anyone know some good fanfictions where people call out snape on his bullying behaviour, bad attitude, being a lousy teacher etc?

it doesn't need to have bashing in it, just have him called out on his behaviour

i always hated him because he reminded me of teachers i had that were mean and a bully


** Most any story where Harry is raised by anyone but the Dursleys or someone gains custody of him. Or any HeavyHandedHarry! Harry will call Snape and anyone else the author doesn't like on not caring/being a douche/not listening etc.

**** Not that I can think of, the best I can think of is linkffn(Heart and Soul). It's Harry/Fleur/Hermoine and Mr. Delacour and Sirius tear into Snape a few times as well as Dumbledore and Dumbledore is good and somewhat competent.

**** Yes: linkffn(The Accidental Bond) by kb0.

The Grangers take custody of Harry and act like responsible parents, including calling Dumbledore to task for problems he allows to fester.

** Robst probably has a story where that happens. It sounds wish-fulfillment-y enough to happen in one of his fics.

Chapter Sixteen of linkffn(What We're Fighting For by James Spookie) has a Harry-Sue who quite easily dispatches Severus. Snape is then called out on his awful behaviour by Dumbledore once he's woken up.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED
