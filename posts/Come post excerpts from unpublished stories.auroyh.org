It's that time of the year again. Come post excerpts from unpublished stories to generate interest and get feedback! Context isn't required, but might help.

Mine is an excerpt from a scene about halfway through my story, which is a sequel of another yet to be published story

•••

It was a pleasant day in New York City's bustling downtown. The sun shone, reflecting off the hundreds of mirror-like windows lining the gigantic buildings filled with people working and living in peace.

A tourist, one of many admiring the urban jungle's canopy, was the first to notice what looked like massive shadows spreading across the windows. It wasn't unusual, save that there wasn't a cloud in the sky. Their frantic pointing drew the attention of everyone around them, and life ground to a halt as tourists and natives alike watched as building after building was coated in darkness.

Then the screaming began.

---

Albus Dumbledore took a steadying breath as he carefully weaved between puddles of blood, wizarding robes transfigured into a serious looking suit. It was a far cry from the eye watering color he preferred but he and his companions were disguised as FBI, according to their American friends. Color wasn't appropriate.

“They're getting more powerful,” Voldemort pointed out, staring over Quirrel's shoulder as the man worked his wand, hidden inside a fake, fancy and electrical looking box.

“First Russia, now this. We can't quarantine every source of reflection in the world. Especially not when they can use buildings now,” the former DADA professor added.

Dumbledore rubbed his face. “I know. I just wish we knew what their endgame was. Or how to find Harry.”

Voldemort shuddered. “If we do find him, I just hope your theory is wrong. If I fail to kill him, no one can.”


** Orla asked, "How did Luna lose her eyesight?"

"I'm not certain the spell or potion she used," said Harry, "but it was self-induced."

The young witch was aghast. "What? Why would she do that? And how is she able to navigate so naturally? How did she defeat those Aurors?"

Harry looked at Seamus. Seamus looked to Dennis. Dennis turned to Dean, who shrugged. With matching distressed expressions, they all replied, "Nargles."

Orla turned to Dean. "What's a Nargle?"

Dean smirked, "Don't ask, don't tell, pumpkin. In particular, don't ask Luna. But they always appear in swarms, so it's 'Nargles'- plural, okay?"

*** That (unintentional?) rhyme was great.\\
I'd guess this takes place in the Hogwarts years, with those four together. Don't know who Orla is, nor why Luna would be fighting Aurors (DoM?). Dean appears to be an authority here; Orla turns to him even though they all answered. Nothing innovative is really implied in the snippet, like its a rote "Luna Does Wacky Stuff, Onlookers Bamboozled."

**** Actually it's a scene set 17 years after the Battle of Hogwarts. The story is kinda an adaptation of the Seven Samurai. Orla is the 16-year-old daughter of canon Ravenclaw Orla Quirke, filling the Katsuhiro role of a young warrior attempting to mimic a handful of grizzled veteran Ronin who are hired to fight off invaders.

** “Tell me again why we're flying north.”

“Did you not listen to a word I said at the Ministry?” Daphne said, looking at Harry in disbelief.

“I did,” Harry said, nodding. “But then we saw those two house-elves snogging and I Obliviated myself.” Harry scratched his stubbled chin. “Think I overdid it.”

Daphne stared at Harry for a long moment. “Fine. Even if you're joking, which I'm not so sure you are, I'm going to explain it again because you're the type of man to need things explained to him twice.”

“Hey.”

“Shush, you.” Daphne grabbed a handle as they hit a particularly bad spot of turbulence. “Norway got wind of some kind of strange magical disturbance happening in Svalbard.”

“That's in the Arctic.”

“Congratulations,” Daphne said, “you know your geography. Now listen. They sent a couple members of their own Ministry up there, and then never heard from them again. After losing two groups, they figured they'd --- er ---”

Harry nodded. “Call in the big guns. The top dogs. The pros.”

“Something like that,” Daphne said absentmindedly, looking out the window. “You were picked, of course. But as they knew you'd bring me along, and since you were... busy, they grabbed me, told me the info, and then I grabbed you. And now we're here.”

“Yeah,” Harry said, “I was kind of talking about why we were going on a plane, not why we were going.” He glanced sideways at her. “You knew that, right?”

Daphne smacked his arm. “If you wished to Apparate from England to Svalbard, you can Apparate back.”

“No need to get abusive about it,” Harry muttered, switching seats to look out the same window Daphne was. “Why didn't we just grab a Portkey?”

“The Norwegian Ministry already tried. The Portkey wouldn't actually work.”

“Are you sure they did it properly? I mean, it is the Norwegian.”

“Don't be silly,” Daphne said, unable to keep the amusement out of her voice.

The visibility outside the plane was getting worse, as was the turbulence. Harry was fairly certain they'd crash any minute now, but he didn't tell Daphne this. He didn't want her to worry.

“We'll probably crash any moment now,” Daphne said idly.

“Yup,” said Harry, pulling out his wand.

Edit: Cut out one of the excerpts, as it was still a rough draft and eh.

--------------

A far green country stretched before Aragorn, its beauty not yet tainted by what was to come. Not yet, but soon, for an army of ten thousand strong marched its way toward Helm's Deep, and the lush grass his horse galloped through would soon be trampled and ruined, as was all touched by the foulness of orcs.

He found himself for once thankful that the bond between a horse and its rider would never reach so deep, for had his own weariness carried over to his horse then they would have never made it to their destination, which was still some distance away. An hour, perhaps, by his reckoning.

Or perhaps more, for as he and his horse reached the peak of yet another hill, he spotted that which he could not leave alone, no matter if it delayed him in his journey. It was a figure on a horse, black as the rider's own cloak. And they made their way slowly to the hill which upon Aragorn and his horse stood.

Aragorn rode down to meet the rider, not willing to waste time.

“Rider before me!” he yelled as his horse neared. “Turn back now and ride swiftly away, for only death awaits you beyond these hills!”

He eased his horse from a gallop to a trot and then to a stop when he reached the rider. And it was to his surprise to find that the rider was not a man as he had expected, but a woman. This was very strange indeed, for what woman rode alone in these parts? What woman rode alone in any parts?

She raised her head to see him, as her hood had hid her eyes from his heightened position on the hill. Green eyes were set upon him, and how very green and lovely they were. How very lovely all of her was.

Black was her hair, as dark as her cloak and horse, and Aragorn wondered briefly if it was wise to approach someone cloaked in all black in these fell times. He was weary, very much so, and depending on her skill he was not so sure if he could properly defend himself from even a woman.

“Did you not hear me, my lady?” he said when she did nothing but observe him as though he were a finely crafted statue.

“I heard,” she said, her voice light and melodious, though Aragorn might've believed there was also power in it, a dark kind of edge, had he not been so exhausted. “I heard you quite well. Death and death only awaits me beyond those hills, you say?”

Aragorn nodded grimly. “Aye. You must ride, ride away or with me to Helm's Deep if you have no place to go. An army of ten thousand orcs marches.”

“Oh, really?” the woman said idly, looking to the hill he had come from, and though he knew her to have heard, her tone suggested that she hadn't paid any attention at all to what he had just said.

A breathy, disbelieving laugh escaped him. “Yes, really. Do you not fear orcs?”

Her gaze returned to him. “Not particularly, no.”

“You jest, surely!”

The woman shrugged. “How long until they reach us?”

Aragorn stared for a moment, unsure of what to think. “Two hours, perhaps three if they rest, though I do not believe they will. It is plenty time for you to ride! They are ten thousand strong, my lady, do not underestimate them!”

“My lady?” the woman said, half-amused and half-absently. “My name is Evelyn Potter. And I do not underestimate. Tell me, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, do these orcs carry magic amongst themselves? Do wizards or witches walk in their midst? And, if I may ask, for I wish not to delve any deeper into your mind than I already have, what is Helm's Deep and why is it you ride there?”

She said this all without giving pause for him to answer. Though, Aragorn was sure he wouldn't have been able to answer anyway. Her questions brought fear down upon him. She had known his name, had freely admitted to looking into his mind, wore all black, and spoke of orcs and magic as though they were meant to be found together.

Had he come upon a user of dark sorcery, sent up ahead as a scout for the army?

Was Saruman amongst them?

And what else had she already learned from his mind?

What of the Ring?

“What Ring?” Evelyn said, blinking up at him.

*** I think Daphne (as presented here) is a good choice to complement (balance out? be a foil to?) Harry here. Honestly a little odd that he knows where Svalbard is, but that might be my (biased) education speaking. The [Apparate] sentence is a bit confusing, and I only got it on the second read (Apparate back to Apparate forward). [actually] breaks up the Portkey sentence unnaturally: something with tenses? The humor in the last few lines was on point; I'd love to read more of it. The danger also seems routine. I love it.

--------------

Not to my taste. I half-skimmed it and it seems horrifying and depressing.

--------------

I'm feeling the fantasy adventure in the prose here. Aragorn's dialogue reads slightly archaic, which is probably standard for LotR, but it's still well-done here. [Death and death] is slightly odd phrasing that I can't really parse as archaic, but it did lead me to expect a "Death is an old friend of mine" line, which gave me a chuckle. The casual disregard of mundane threats actually makes magic seem useful, which is a breath of fresh air compared to what I've recently been reading. I don't see a purpose for a F!Potter in the plot, but I support F!Potter for "because why not?" reasons anyway. I'm seeing your wonderful sense of humor at the end here, too, with the paranoia spiral abruptly interrupted by Evelyn's innocent obliviousness. Also implies she hasn't been in Middle-Earth long. Very interesting, might read, even if I don't read a lot of LotR.

**** Thanks for the feedback!

For the last one, it pretty much is a "Why not?" in regards to it being fem!Harry. I just enjoy writing a female protagonist. And it was just meant to be a one shot, where Evelyn literally obliterates the orc army. The other LOTR fic I'm writing I have HP magic tempered a bit, so I wanted to use HP magic to its full extent.

And I feel like a talented adult wizard would be able to easily deal with a normal army via either fiendfyre or the use of Transfiguration and Animation charms to create large rock soldiers or whatever. Charm them Unbreakable and no mundane army would stand a chance. (This is why she asks if the army will have any magic in it, because I largely subscribe to the idea that only other magic can override magic)

It was pretty much just going to be Aragorn watching in disbelief as thousands of orcs are killed by one woman.

** He watched the last fragments of shattered obsidian fall to the ground around them. His Death Eaters had scattered, half of them crippled and limping from their injuries.

"I learned from the two greatest wizards in the world! If you think this will be easy, you are sorely mistaken!" His enemy's scarless doppelganger shouted, before flicking his wand and sending a wave of rippling air in his direction. His shield was barely in place before the spell struck with the weight of a giant's club. His shield splintered into multicolored light, and he was forced to disapperate to avoid the blast.

"Who!? Who was it that made you so powerful!?" Voldemort conjured a wall of Fiendfyre, but almost as quickly it was met by a wall of mud. The mud encompassed his demonic fire and then took the shape of a basilisk, cracking open to spew a tongue of flame that was no longer under his control.

"I learned finesse and control, and that sometimes you need only remove one key stone to bring down the mightiest wall, from Albus Dumbledore!" Harry raised his hand, gesturing as if the giant golem was a marionette. "And I learned to use what I have and what I know creatively, and that sometimes the best way to bring down a wall is to blow it to hell..." another gesture and the basilisk reared up, ready to strike "from Tom Riddle!" The snake struck.

** *The Subtle Darkness*

"I felt you in my mind," said Voldemort softly. "I saw you in Nagini."

Harry couldn't even breathe, let alone reply. His thoughts turned to the times Harry had seen from Voldemort's eyes... The summer before Voldemort's rebirth, the flashes of emotion, of images, when Voldemort was enraged... When Harry was the snake, lunging at Arthur.

"I am the greatest Legilimens the world has ever seen, and yet you are able to slither your way into my mind with not a hint of training," said Voldemort regarding Harry pensively. "You can speak Parseltongue, yet you are not descended from Slytherin... and our wands..."

Harry's stomach dropped as Voldemort studied the wand Harry carried carefully.

"Your wand, it calls to me, as if it is a long-lost brother, and not an enemy. Quite strange, is it not? Most wands will refuse to cooperate within another's hands unless you overpower the bond, break it. Yet, I have done nothing, and your wand sings."

Harry closed his eyes for a moment, breathing fast.

"It seems on the night I gave you that scar, I also gave you something more... something greater," whispered Voldemort. "I created you, and everything you are."

The blood pounded in Harry's ears, overwhelming any other sounds. His hands shook, his feet tingled. His clear vision disfigured, as if he was looking through the waterfall at Voldemort. He had to get away. He couldn't listen to the next words. He couldn't.

"Have you not realised how similar we are? Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles. The only two known Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts in the last hundred years, and wielding brother wands. We can see in each other's minds, no matter the distance, and feel the emotions of the other. We even look somewhat alike... that is, when I was younger, of course." His voice was like silk, wrapping itself around Harry, worming its way into every corner of his mind.

Harry felt as if he was drowning in the sea of his biggest fears. He was dirty, contaminated, as if his whole life he had been carrying some sort of deadly curse, ready to infect anyone he encountered. He couldn't think, couldn't breathe.

"No," he barely whispered. "You're wrong."

Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes twinkling with pleasure.

"Are you telling me, or merely trying to convince yourself of the sweetened lie Albus has told you?" At Harry's look of despair, his grin widened. "You went to him before, haven't you? Did he tell you that it is your actions that matter more than our similarities? That it is our choices that define us?"

Voldemort chucked.

"Of course, he did. Yet, he told you only a fraction of truth. Would you have been you without me? Every year of your life has revolved around me. From your parents' deaths, the Philosophers Stone, to last night in the Graveyard. Do you not see, Harry? We are entwined... destined to be by each other, to be alike. /I made you."/

Inside Harry's head was a carousel of fears spinning wildly out of control, each one pushing his mind into blackness. He wanted to run; he needed to freeze. The sounds, of water falling, and Voldemort laughing, felt far away, like he was no longer in the body which knelt paralyzed in the wet grass.

He barely noticed Voldemort backing up, his own wand raising, or the waterfall spluttering as it dried. He stared blankly ahead, weakly gasping at anything to prove Voldemort wrong.

"Harry Potter, I offer you a place in my circle," Voldemort announced and Harry realised he could hear the Death Eaters again. They were laughing over his friends' tears. "Do you accept?"

Harry couldn't move, couldn't speak. His mind spun faster, and faster, his thoughts breaking apart before they formed. This couldn't be happening, it couldn't be. One minute... All they needed was a single minute and Dumbledore would arrive...

“Harry! Don't do it!” screamed Ginny, breaking the silence and piercing the panic Harry was in. It was the rough slap that followed, and the shouts that followed, which snapped Harry from his state.

"Ginny!" Ron shouted, "Don't you touch her, you bastard!"

Ron was not the only one shouting. All the Weasleys' were screaming, some at Harry, and the others at the Death Eaters.

"Silence!" hissed Voldemort, his smirk fading.

The Weasleys' fell silent, their mouths agape as they tried to speak.

"Perhaps, it is time to see the suffering that your friends will endure if you do not agree. Afterall, Lord Voldemort punishes those who stand against him.”

** Symbolism

Symbolism was important to magic.

It was magic didn't necessarily follow rules and laws like modern science.

However, symbolism seemed to be a major rule.

Wand woods and cores follow this to a tee. Phoenix feathers are the hardest to tame, elder is associated with powerful magics. To achieve immortality requires sacrifice.

It wasn't commonly known, but a Philosopher's Stone could only be made from the sacrifice of a human life. Soul magics to ensure immortality tended to require a similar price.

Harry had his wand snapped, but had kept the pieces. He needed a replacement.

Ollivander was kind enough to agree to help out.

He still had his Phoenix feather core, and the centaurs bestowed the parts of the unicorns from his first year he avenged. He salvaged parts of the basilisk, and was awarded the parts of the Hungarian horntail from his first task. A thestral tailhair from the beast who carried him to the Department of Mysteries. Veela hair as Fleur and Gabrielle paid back the boy who selflessly rescued them from the lake. Acromantula venom Harry got Hagrid to retrieve from Aragog.

Chimeras were beasts of magic. A hodgepodge of creatures with breath almost as hot as the most ferocious dragon. Immune to the unforgivables due to not truly being sentient, it had resistance to all but the most powerful of spells. A creation of darkest magic and the vilest of luck.

In a direct assault, even Voldemort or Dumbledore would be hard pressed.

But Harry read the classics... he understood a lesson. No one thing can reign supreme. A Chimera might not beat a basilisk in venom or stares, or a dragon with the heat of its fire, or even a unicorn with its speed. But it ranked far up on the scale and had other strengths. A rather strong jack-of-all-trades. Of course Harry wasn't stupid. He wouldn't dare try to create a chimera. But for his wand core... he only wanted the absolute best.

The Purebloods were right, if for the wrong reasons. Magical blood was important. Not the ancestry of course, but rather the power imbued within it. It made for an excellent binding agent, whether for wards or alchemy. And it was not just his blood, but blood of an avenged unicorn, of a ferocious Hungarian Horntail, and of a basilisk in its prime.

Harry drew three transmutation circles with the blood mixture he created.

Harry place the hodge-podge of prime core material at the center of the circle.

A transmutation achieved a golden string.

Harry smiled. It seems the Fates no longer controlled him. He had his own string.

*** I'm liking the "symbolism" basis of magic, and definitely feeling the FMA inspiration. Sentence structure is a bit rough, e.g. [unicorns he avenged in his first year] would flow a lot better. No idea where all these parts are coming from, like why would he be given parts of the Horntail (that was last seen hearty and whole)? Slight aversion from the mention of a life debt, I would honestly prefer an actual friendship. Also, double period [..] there. The bit about Unforgivables is blatantly against my understanding of canon (Moody's demonstration with spiders), and should probably be justified at some point. Homophone with [rein], you probably meant [reign]. Contradictory information: [hotter breath] ... [not beat / dragon / fire]. Very interesting concept with the alchemy (which isn't explored much) and the String of Fate (which implies a more conceptual/divine focus for magic), but it could use an editor.

** *Excerpt 1 context:* Pre-Hogwarts, Harry got abducted/adopted/absorbed by a band of Unseelie fae. When he doesn't show up for the train in first year, Dumbledore and Snape hunt him down and "retrieve" him against his will, intending to re-humanize him. Problem is, Harry doesn't want to be human again, and the Unseelie have, ah, /unique/ customs.

--------------

“The rules have /capital punishments?/” Harry blurted out once Dumbledore finished his litany of prohibitions. “What kind of school is this?”

“Potter, if you kill and eat a classmate, I will cast the Killing Curse myself,” Snape growled. “I won't even be thrown in Azkaban for it. You're not human. Unforgivables are illegal only against humans. Do not test me.”

“But I /eat/ people! What do you expect me to do, starve?”

“I expect you to eat in the Great Hall, from the plates provided you, /without/ supplementing it by thinning the herd of NEWT students!”

“Come on, there's got to be at least /one/ you don't like -- “

“I am perfectly capable of eliminating my own disfavored!”

Dumbledore, hands steepled on his desk, looked rather grim. It was his fault for forcing him to stay here, Harry thought bitterly. If the bastard didn't want to feel sad about how a /redcap/ was angry that he couldn't /eat/, he shouldn't have abducted one in the first place! Bloody stupid wizards.

Or, well. Maybe he was upset that Snape had just insinuated that he did have students he wanted dead and was willing to eliminate them on his own time. That might not look so good in a teacher...

Snape let his anger out in a huff and ran a hand over his face. “I understand there are certain allowances that must be made for you as a redcap. However, the consumption of live human flesh will not be one of them.”

“Allowances?" Dumbledore repeated softly. "Severus, he will never change his behavior if he is encouraged to continue it."

“Can I eat /him?/”

Snape buried his face in his hands and bit back a frustrated scream.

--------------

*Excerpt 2 context:* I kept complaining about there not being any decent Worm crossovers where Harry was a parahuman, so I decided to try my hand at writing one. Not sure about this one; I don't usually write first-person, but it felt odd not writing a Worm fic in it. General idea is that Harry triggers after Voldemort's graveyard resurrection and wants to moonlight as a superhero over the summer...with a Tinker power that is essentially mass-producible cybernetic necromancy. Dudley catches him right after his first Tinker fugue.

--------------

The cover snicked into place, an impossibly satisfying sound, and I was done. Before me sat a smooth white U-shaped collar with two dozen electrodes dangling off it like hair, and the brand-name power drill battery sticking asymmetrically out of one side. There were loops on the end for bolts to go through and secure the whole thing permanently to whatever poor sod it was destined for. It was held together by superpowers, electrical tape, and the liberal application of superglue.

Would it work? Absolutely. For long? Questionable. There would be maintenance involved, clearly. Then again, that was true even of the most professional, big-money-backed tinkertech. It was why the Muggle world hadn't yet upgraded en masse to hovercars, jetpacks, and rayguns, despite Hero's best efforts across the pond. Only I would be able to keep this blasphemy running for any significant length of time in the field.

Maybe that was for the best.

“You tore up our microwave,” Dudley said, somewhere behind me. His tone was halfway between disbelief and grief.

I blinked as it slowly registered to me that I /had/.

The garage workbench was covered with discarded and cannibalized electrical parts. The remains of the microwave housing itself were strewn across the floor, cut apart with the same shears I used to trim the bushes and tree out back. Scraps of gold leaf were halfway embedded into the work surface and the hammer's head. A few old handheld game shells, the telephone, and a spare TV remote were scattered about in the mess, their guts repurposed and incorporated into my cobbled-together computer.

“Er.”

“They're going to be livid.” He didn't sound as excited about that as usual. It was probably because he relied on microwavable dinners at odd times to keep his bloated stomach despite the diet he'd been forced onto. I'd just destroyed his meal ticket.

Funnily enough, that made me feel a little better about the whole situation.

So did just looking at what I'd made, actually. It was ugly but it was mine. And better yet, I could already see ways to improve it -- miniaturize it, boost its processing power, increase its memory to accommodate a more complex AI, refine the electrode heads for greater penetration into the grey matter and greater conductivity, increase the number of leads to provide greater coverage and more fine control, make the cover detachable --

It all required better materials than I had. Better tools, too. More precise patterns, custom-forged metal fittings, maybe premade computer parts to tweak...but I could do it.

Assuming Vernon didn't kill me first.

“Yeah,” I agreed with Dudley, “they probably will.”

“What'd you make?”

“Er -- nothing, really -- “ I snatched the collar up and hid it behind my back. Maybe he'd forget it was there if he didn't see it. “ -- just, you know...messing about.”

The way Dudley squinted his piggish little eyes...it almost made me think he was calculating something. Basic arithmetic, maybe. Perhaps he was trying to count past five. He'd only just managed the days of the week last year, you know.

“You're one of those freaks, aren't you?”

“Did you just now figure that out, Diddykins?”

“Not a wizard,” he said, waving a meaty hand like he was fending off a horsefly. “One of those freaks in spandex. Para-whatsits. The capes. Like Hero.”

Unfortunately, even pre-schoolers knew about parahumans, so it was on the upper range of Dudley's thinking ability to make that connection. /Dammit/. And connecting me to Hero, too? /The/ Tinker? It might be flattering if I weren't sure that he only did it because Hero was the only Tinker's name he could pronounce. But he knew.

Dammit dammit /dammit/.

I didn't say anything. Dudley didn't open his mouth to fill the empty space. He just looked at me, far more thoughtful than I'd ever seen him. It was unnerving.

“You cook dinner most nights,” he said slowly, ponderously, like a lumbering behemoth changing course. I nodded. “You're just lucky mum doesn't pay that much attention when you do. Could probably do the microwaveable bits other ways.”

“I...probably could, yeah,” I agreed, eyeing him warily. Where was he going with this? Oh -- wait, I could see it. He was going to extract a bribe. I /could/ play it that way, yes, but only if the sole witness kept mum.

“I might not tell her about all this,” he went on. “Might even help you clean up.”

“Okay...”

“Could probably hide those holes with construction paper...”

I glanced down at the shredded microwave. The only part of it that remained reasonably intact was the front panel, door included. “Sure, Dudders.”

“Shut it. I'm trying to help you.”

“/Why?/ What do you want from me?”

“Nothing.”

“Uh-/huh/.” Even Dudley understood the sheer volume of doubt I crammed into that word, and he scowled at me.

“I could always just tell them.”

“Nope, no that's fine, we'll keep it quiet -- “

He did end up helping me hide the evidence. I put the collar in my desk drawer with the rest of the blueprints, replaced the remaining valuable materials in my hiding spot under the floorboards, and then we set to work trying to make the microwave look like it hadn't just been stripped of any and all electronic components. My cramming session on hobby electronics actually helped a bit with that -- I managed to rig up a battery and some basic wiring so the buttons still beeped when pressed. With some spare cardboard, white construction paper, and plastic wrap, we then patched the casing up enough to pass for intact when we put the microwave back in its niche.

Dudley didn't tell me what he really wanted from all this, and that kept me up later that night. What game was he playing? He was /Dudley/. He'd chased me, beat me, mocked me, bullied me constantly, literally from our first day of /preschool!/ Did he expect me to believe he had a change of heart now? Bullshit!

But I couldn't see what his angle was. Why delay? Did he think he'd get more if he waited? Did he expect me to fall for it and become reliant on his help to hide things so he could withhold it later and command a higher price? Ridiculous. This was Dudley we were talking about. /Cunning/ was not how I'd describe him. If he were going to be sorted into a house at Hogwarts, it wouldn't be Slytherin, it would be the outhouse.

It occurred to me that he may not have thought things through to the specifics of his bribe.

Yeah. That was probably it. He'd come to me tomorrow and name his price. Unless he forgot.

Problem dealt with, I eventually drifted off to sleep. The nightmares made me wish I hadn't.

*** Divines, that was wonderful. This feels like crack. I'm seeing hints that you did some research into the fae, and I love it when authors do research. I didn't /think/ redcaps were from a court, but the entirety of my knowledge comes from /Dresden/ fanon and a British Literature class.

Oh wow first person feels so odd, and I read it /and/ second person regularly in other fandoms.\\
This premise is so outside my comfort zone I can't critique it. 1990s Worm is virtually unexplored. Muggle Harry Potter is virtually unexplored. Fusions between the two are virtually unexplored. I have no idea how powers and magic mix.

**** Yeah, even just writing first person feels weird to me. It's good for things like unreliable narrators, which Harry in the Worm fic definitely is - he writes Dudley off too quickly, for instance, and the plan is for it to come back to bite him later - but eh. I might try to redo the thing in my usual third-person. And "unexplored" is right - there's like next to no lore there, I had to rummage through Wildbow's word-of-god posts and check citations from the wiki to find any concise information on it, and there's just not a lot for Britain in general. Glaistig Uaine is just getting into her rampage, was what I had determined, plus some bits about the Suits and King's Men. Beyond that I was mostly extrapolating. The Geselleschaft probably was angling for a foothold, the IRA presumably had capes and was using them, the Unwritten Rules were in their infancy, the CUI and Yangban were probably just starting out (and in need of capes, and willing to deal with human traffickers), Behemoth was the only known Endbringer and it had just attacked New York around the time of the Triwizard Tournament's second task(?).

Lots of things I'd need to work out if I wanted to continue it satisfactorily. Doesn't help that I'm an American and know next to nothing about 90s-era Britain, politically or societally...and that's before you add in a decade of parahuman politics on top of that.

As for my redcaps: /definitely/ looked into old-style fae. I'd call them more of an inspiration than a followed pattern in this case, though - some of the many differences being that mine are social, eternally childlike, and part of a court, whereas (to my knowledge) they're traditionally solitary, look like old men, and unaffiliated. Really glad you enjoyed that snippet, though.

Thanks for the reviews in general! I love it when people enjoy my writing.

** /This is the premise for a sequel to my story I've been working on./

--------------

"Rise and shine," Harry said, raising the blinds with a flourish. Daylight poured through the windows, filling the drawing room with dazzling brightness, but Tony continued to slumber on the couch. Harry shook his shoulder, but he merely grunted sleepily and turned his back to him. Losing his patience, Harry took aim with his hand.

"Aguamenti!"

Tony yelped and rolled off the couch, sputtering. His reddened eyes landed on Harry, and for a moment, he looked like a betrayed puppy. Snickering, Harry cast a Drying Charm, more out of concern for his carpeting than Tony's benefit.

"What's the big idea?" Tony demanded, squinching at the sunlight.

Harry swept his arms out. "We're going to Slovakia!"

Tony shook his head. "The only place I'm going to is the bathroom."

"Don't be long. We got about"---he glanced at the clock on the wall---"two hours to prepare. I'll be down on the ground floor."

Tony mumbled something and shuffled his feet out of the room like a zombie. When he walked into the dining room a quarter of an hour later, his hair was damp and his gait was decidedly more human-like. Harry greeted him with a smile that wouldn't leave his lips since that morning, and a plate of English breakfast.

"Dropped by the Leaky," he said at Tony's unasked question.

Grunting, Tony slumped on a chair and tucked in. Somewhere between demolishing the black pudding and wolfing down the fried eggs, he raised his head and frowned at Harry, who was observing him with a mix of amusement and disgust.

"Aren't you gonna eat?"

Harry shook his head. "You ever take an international Portkey?"

"No, why?"

Harry's perpetual grin widened. "You'll find out."

"Lost me there, mate," Tony said, swallowing another mouthful.

Harry sighed impatiently. "Stop being obtuse, it was your idea."

Tony scratched at his nose. "Look, if this is about what I said yesterday..."

"You bet your ass it's about what you said. I stayed awake half the night thinking about it, and you know what I realized?" Harry pointed at him. "That you're absolutely right!"

Tony's eyebrows rose. "I am?"

He nodded emphatically. "There's a whole wide world full of wonders waiting out there, yet here I am more worried about household chores. Well, that's about to change. You and I, we're going on an adventure!"

Tony gave him a long look, then shook his head slowly. "Mate, I'm sorry, but I never thought you'd take my ramblings seriously. You do realize how insane this sounds, right? Besides, I got work tomorrow."

Harry's lips curled in disgust. "Wage-slave."

"NEET," Tony retorted.

"Hey, if I'm a NEET, so is every pureblood who's living off their holdings."

Tony cleaned his plate with a slice of toast. "They're a dying breed. Even Malfoy's taken up a job at the Ministry. Acts like a proper goody two-shoes now, attending seminars and remembering birthdays and all that--can you imagine?"

"Ha! Good on him, I guess." Harry shook his head. "Anyway, while you were drooling on priceless basilisk leather, I dropped by Padma's and got all the gear we might need. You only have to take some extra clothes."

"You're not listening," Tony said, jabbing a fork in his direction. "I'm not going. You're not, either, if you have any sense left."

"Tony, you've lost sight of what's truly important. Accio Daily Prophet!" He opened the paper and slapped it on the table, the blurry photograph in full view. "These harpies are only sighted every few decades, and no one knows where they disappear to. This is your only chance. Either we go now, or you continue working your soulless job---and thirty years down the road, when you're filing yet another TPS report, you're going to remember on this day and go, 'man, if only I had listened to my best mate back then'!"

"TSP, actually, for Typical Spell Proficiency." Tony squirmed at the incredulous look Harry gave him. "They're crucial to regulating correspondence courses like Kwikspell."

Harry snorted. "Just listen to yourself. I know this isn't the kind if life you wanted. I know your heart yearns for more. I know, because you told me yesterday---and those were your true feelings, unclouded by everyday mundanity!"

Tony swallowed, his gaze straying to the moving photograph. "You're not just taking the piss, are you?"

"I would never toy with a bloke's dreams like that," Harry said solemnly. "Are you with me?"

Tony groaned and rubbed his face with his palms. "My parents were so proud when I got accepted into the Ministry, too..." Lowering his hands, he gave Harry a determined look. "Give me half an hour to pack."

** An excerpt from an extremely rough draft

"So which apartment are you in?" he asked

"5A, it doesn't have such a nice balcony like yours though" she said turning and facing towards the balcony

"Yeah I was lucky to get this one" he grinned knowing that it had nothing to do with luck but rather some bribery

"Sure, lucky" she laughed

"You don't seem to believe me" he said and feigned hurt

"I seem to recall you had too much luck in school" she laughed "How much could you have left?" she asked amused

"Fair point, but I also had Hermione to help" he smiled thinking about his best friend now

"She and Ron ever decide to try again?" Padma asked

"No, she decided to study law in the muggle world after Hogwarts. She couldn't stand a lot of the wizarding world; like house-elves" he said and Padma nodded knowing how poorly SPEW had gone

"When last did you see her?" she asked

"It's been almost three years now, we write occasionally. I'm supposed to meet her in a few days when she gets home for her summer holidays. She is a junior lecturer now at the same place she studied" he smiled remembering their last letters

"Okay then, say hi for me when you do see her. I should probably go now, I'll see you around Harry" she smiled

** The circle of hooded figures levitating the family that owned the campground reminded Charlie of lessons learned in books at Hogwarts, the ones Dumbledore insisted on and the purebloods in his year scowled through --- especially the Slytherins.

“Death Eaters,” Bill said as they made their way through the crowd and joined the Ministry wizards surrounding the hooded figures.

As they cast spells to save the Muggles and drive off the Death Eaters, Charlie recalled all the stories Ron, Ginny and the twins had told him in letters over the past three years and realized that what sounded like crazy adventures at a distance from Romania were both more sinister and more immediate.

Then the Dark Mark shone in the sky, and Charlie‘s brain froze, even as he kept casting spells. He'd done the same the first time he'd faced an angry Hungarian Horntail, and swore afterward that no matter what else happened at the dragon reserve, nothing else could be that scary.

He was wrong. Seeing the green glow of that symbol last seen the night Harry's parents were killed and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named disappeared? That was far, far worse.

All of Mum's family, and most of Dad's, had perished in the last war. Charlie was determined that his family would survive whatever was coming this time around. Even the darkest of dark wizards.

But when they got back to the tent, only the twins and Ginny were there.

“Where's Dad?” Charlie asked. “Where are Ron, Harry and Hermione?”

“We got separated in the woods,” Fred said.

“The the Mark appeared and we wanted to make sure Ginny was safe,” George added.

Charlie looked at Bill. “Should we...?”

Bill shook his head. “In that madness, we'd just be dividing our forces even further,” he said. “Dad will find them.”

“Besides, Harry's faced far worse than Death Eaters,” George said. “Ron, too.”

“And Hermione,” Ginny added. “They saved me, they can certainly save themselves.”

Charlie wanted to believe his siblings, but ... Death Eaters and the Dark Mark? He settled for looking outside the tent every few minutes. The sixth time, he breathed a sigh of relief at the sight of his father, Ron and Ron's friends hurrying toward the tent.

The revival of the Tri-Wizard Tournament was starting to seem like the least dangerous thing that would happen this year, and Charlie was suddenly glad that he had the rest of the week at home, and would be back in a few months to see for himself that everybody was all right.

They had to be all right. No matter what danger was coming, his family had to survive this.

** From "Geralt Grindelwald". A timetravel fic.

The sun over Surrey was drenching the suburban scenery in an entirely undeserved bright, cheery light. Just looking at the houses, all exactly the same with only the desperate suggestion of individuality separating them by look, nauseated him. The streets were as dead as if the houses were owned by vampires. One half, mostly the men, were out working while the other half, mostly the women, were busy keeping their houses perfectly ordinary, boring and clean.

As he stomped through the neighbourhood he briefly thought back to his small bottomless bag and the muggle clothes in it. Should he have worn a suit? Spite, and if he was honest with himself, the chance to scare Petunia Dursley out of her wits made him wear a black, modern robe, befitting of a pureblood wizard. The silver seams and buttons made his pale eyes especially vivid and his blond hair look like it was completely white. It was truly an odd sight in a muggle area. He didn't care. Harry looked forward to his aunt seeing him.

Privet Drive 2 and 3 passed him by and Harry got another good look at one of the, if not his singularly most hated place in the world. Despite it looking like every other house; it being even more well cared for, it was the ugliest place in the universe for Harry. The perfectly cut, english lawn, the hedges so geometric as if they were drawn with a ruler and the walls so immaculate as if polished made Harry want to let loose enough to be jailed for muggle-baiting. He thought better of it, but the idea remained in the back of his head in case Petunia was especially nerve-wrecking.

Taking a deep breath Harry knocked on the door and rang the bell, a combination he knew would make his aunt exceedingly annoyed. The first thing he heard was a muffled “Make Harry get it.” from inside.

Harry was almost at the point of charming the door open when the lock clicked and the meek face of his younger self looked up at him.

“Hello, sir?” young Harry began, while giving the older Harry a sceptic once-over.

Harry's own greeting got stuck in his throat. This was too surreal for him to just glance over. His mind was struggling to comprehend the time-displaced mirror image right in front of him.

“Sir? Can I... help you?”

Harry shook his head once to clear it, with just enough success to get his mouth talking. “Yes. Uhm... Harry Potter, I assume?”

“Thats me...?” Harry began when the screeching voice of aunt Petunia interrupted him.

“Who is it, boy? If they sell, tell them we are not buying!”

Young Harry rolled his eyes and asked. “Are you selling something?” in his most mocking voice possible.

The older Harry smirked down at the young boy but shook his head. “I'm not a salesman, I'm a Professor. You have not answered our letters, so the faculty decided to send me to ask personally.”

“Oh...” was all the boy could muster to say while sending a furtive glance over his shoulders.

“Let me guess. Post by owl was not appreciated?”

The boy snorted a laugh. “Not at all, sir.”

“Then I'm sure a more... personal approach is more welcome. May I come in?”

“I don't...” he said while giving the rooms in his back a fearful look.

“Thank you.” Harry said, having lost his patience, and just shoved right past him through the door. Just one step in and Harry was hit with a flood of imagery he could have done without, forever. Yet there he was and the petty bourgeois interior of Privet Drive 4 ripped all those old memories, all those old wounds open again. It was, of course, upheld to the T, not a speck of dirt to be seen, to a large part thanks to the little boy that now stood behind him in a helpless stupor.

Making sure not to even glance at the door to the broom closet under the stairs Harry made his way to the living room and kitchen. Sure enough, the first thing in sight was his cousin, as round as a ball, stuffing his face with crisps in front of the TV, followed shortly by the paling face of Petunia Dursley who held up a pan as if she was not sure if she should use it as a weapon or shield.

“Petunia Dursley, I presume?” Harry asked, doing his best to channel Severus Snape with all his contempt and patronising qualities of voice.

Petunia opened and closed her mouth a few times before she found her wits. “Get out! Get out, he's not... He is going to Stonewall, not this... not this school for...”

Harry stepped closer to her, drawing his wand and waving it around so that Petunia could follow it easily with her scared look. “Mrs. Dursley, I must tell you that there isn't much of a choice. Harry's parents have enrolled him in Hogwarts the day he was born. Why go against it? Believe me, you wouldn't want an untrained wizard in your house. Accidents happen if those abilities are not trained and controlled.”

“Wizard?” he heard young Harry whisper to himself.

Without turning around, his eyes still on Petunia, Harry answered his little counterpart. “Indeed, you are a wizard. I assume that information has been withheld from you? Ever had any... impossible, unbelievable,... supernatural things happen to you?”

“Shut your mouth, boy!” Petunia screeched at her nephew, but the look on young Harry's face was all the answer anyone needed. He had done the impossible, and several times at that.

“Of course you had, otherwise we would not have written to you in the first place.” the old Harry answered for the young one. “So Mrs. Dursley, I must ask you to be reasonable here. Deny me and the next one coming for Harry will be less... civil.”

Harry could almost watch the gears turn in Petunia's head. She eyed him, then her young nephew, and then Harry again. “Normal people introduce themselves.” she pressed out from between her teeth.

“Of course, “ Harry warbled and acted as if he had forgotten about it. “Where are my manners? My name is Professor Geralt Grindelwald, and I do have to say that I would have preferred to never meet, yet here I am and so we do, Mrs. Dursley.” Before Petunia had the chance to say anything, Harry continued. “To move this along, here is how the next days and even years will play out. I will escort Harry to Diagon Alley where he will be able to purchase all the required equipment for his schooling. You will gracefully ignore his absence and sleep well with the thought that he won't blow your house to shreds in a few years because of a bout of anger.” Still not letting Petunia speak, he turned around to his smaller version and asked him. “Want to learn magic, lad?”

“Magic, sir?” Harry looked incredibly conflicted. “But magic doesn't exist, sir.” he almost pleaded.

“Didn't you just say you had these unbelievable, supernatural occurrences?”

“Yes, but...” Young Harry just shrugged, helplessly searching for any reason to not believe in something he was trained to not believe in, clearly seeing how his aunt glared at the man claiming to be a wizard.

** setting the scene: this snippet starts soon after Harry and Ron find the page of the book in Hermione's hand. Hermione is conscious during her petrification, she can't see or feel but she can hear.

 

She heard the door open and close as Madam Pomfrey left for the staff room. An indeterminate time later she heard the door slowly squeak open before a deepish voice whispered “clear".

She heard three sets of footsteps, one light set and two heavy sets, come through the door. The footsteps quickly surrounded her. From the soft set of footsteps came a voice that would've made her blood boil, if the blood in her veins still flowed.

“Goyle lift her by the shoulders, Crabble you get the legs” whispered Draco Malfoy, “You know where we're taking her right?.. Good.”

She heard the grunts of the slytherins and the groan of the boxspring as she was lifted from the bed. The footsteps started up again.

 

After several minutes of footsteps one of the burly slytherins (she didn't know which one) spoke up: “So why are we taking her?”

Hermione wanted to know that herself.

The grating voice of Malfoy replied with one word “leverage.” The large slytherin apparently didn't take the hint when he asked “leverage?”

Draco sighed, “Leverage against Potter. The bookworm is one of his best friends, he'd do anything for her. We'll hide her away so we can demand ransom for whatever we want.”

The start of another question was interrupted by a third voice “Mr. Malfoy would you care to explain what you're doing with Ms. Granger?”

Several things happened rapidly in sequence. First she heard several gasps of surprise from the slytherins, she then felt several loud thumps resonate through her, before she heard a sound like a statue dropping 30 feet. (that was an interesting lesson on the Reparo spell, not that she needed it, she had mastered the spell well enough to repair sensitive optics like her favorite telescope or Harry's glasses before hogwarts. Wow her telescope was clearer after the spell, It must've removed fifty years of scratches from the lens. The telescope was an heirloom from her... from her... Why couldn't she remember whos it was? or what color it was? Wait a minute, wasn't she being kidnapped? why was she thinking of a telescope? She thought on it for a second before she realized why she was mentally rambling, 'Oh i'm in agonizing pain, that's right.')

 

Pain. Why was she in pain? What is pain? is it just a chemical reaction? Is consciousness just a chemical reaction?

Wait, her mind was working despite the fact all her bodily functions were stopped. That plus the fact ghosts exist points to something like a soul existing.

Could you transfer a soul into something else and still have it function? could you split a soul? You can split a brai... STOP, /stop./

She knew if she let herself get lost in philosophical questions right now she'd never stop. She was Hermione Granger, She was in pain, And she needed to know why.

So why was she in pain again? She thought back to what was happening. 'So I was being kidnapped, I heard a voice followed by shocked gasps. what does that tell me? Someone saw them carrying me and they weren't prepared for that. Then what happened? I felt several thumps followed by a stone on stone crash. Speaking of felt, why can't I feel my limbs?'

The realization shot through her like electricity 'The slytherins were startled, dropped me down a flight of stairs, and when I got to the bottom I */shattered./*'

** Added another. Excerpt from a different story.

•••

“So, Harry Potter. Do we have an arrangement?” Harry stared up at the parasite, all that remained of a Dark Lord everyone was too frightened to speak of even now. He was struck with a deep sense of pity, but also respect. This man was so determined to rule he let himself be dependent on another being. He himself wasn't sure if he could genuinely swallow his pride enough to do that. On top of that, even as a parasite, this man radiated power enough to make his legs shake. He was standing before everything he wanted to be. And this being, this /god/, wanted his assistance. He would be the biggest fool in the world not to take this offer.

“Yes.” Harry nodded, lips curling into a smile that once he grew up would match Voldemort's for terror inducing cruelty. “But what will we do about Dumbledore?” Thoughts rushed through his head as he considered various plots and plans that would keep this arrangement from Dumbledore's knowledge.

Voldemort chuckled. “We will do nothing. Not yet. Your mind is open, and any hint of a block will be a red flag for the meddling fool. For now, you will go about your life as if we had never talked. Come summer, I will begin to teach you. Oh, and Potter? Keep thinking of me as a god.”

Quirrel turned, raising his wand. “Obliviate.”
