I understand that some pairings simply would not work in the actual Harry Potter universe. So, when I say believable... I mean as believable as an oddball couple can be haha. Here are two examples of what I'm looking for, though I'm really open to anything new. Feel free to recommend stories with "normal" pairings if it's some truly outside the box, original way of writing them together.

*Hearts Over Dracontias* - linkffn(3166162) - Charlie/Luna - Definitely not a couple I would think to seek out but, it was well worth the read. By the end of the story I was totally loving the idea of the two together. Still am!

*Night-blooming heartsease* - linkao3(1104139) - Snape/Neville - The characterizations were on point for the author's rendition of the war and only strayed far enough from their canon personalities to somehow make it work. The development made sense in the situation they were in. Would I ever read another with this pairing? Doubtful. This one is a lovely exception.

Please no harem, poly, or threesome type romances. Everything else is fair game! Thanks in advance!

*** I've honestly never read a Pansy pairing before, I look forward to it!

Twelve Dark Moons I attempted to try a few months ago but, I believe it was Lord Voldemort's characterization that rubbed me wrongly. No idea why since I wasn't able to pinpoint what exactly felt "off" about him, unfortunately.

Is Star Fall the one where Lavender is also a werewolf?

**** I went through a bit of Pansy fic craze a month or so ago. She can be really interesting as a character if well-written. I don't like it when she's shown in too positive of a light though, because I think her nastiness is what makes her so entertaining.

I agree that Voldemort is OOC in Twelve Dark Moons, so I definitely understand if it isn't for you.

And yes, Stars Fall is the one where Lavender is a werewolf.

Happy reading!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9954607/1/The-Bet][The Bet]] involves Severus Snape/James Potter and is not only well-written but somehow believable...I can't even.

Here are a couple of stories I've written with unconventional pairings:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11151390/1/The-Mysterious-Admirer][The Mysterious Admirer]] Draco/Moaning Myrtle

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11272274/1/The-Problem-With-Dogs][The Problem With Dogs]] Sirius Black/Lucius Malfoy

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11337446/1/The-SlytherClaw-Debacle][The SlytherClaw Debacle]] Gregory Goyle/Cho Chang (also includes Dramione)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11425226/1/Love-Hurts][Love Hurts]] Grawp/Whomping Willow (I was forced to write a story about an interspecies relationship, so I decided to take it as far as I could).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11487868/1/The-Singing-Lanterns][The Singing Lanterns]] Crossover pairing- Luna Lovegood/Ginko from Mushishi

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11507540/1/Lovebottom][Lovebottom]] Not sure if this counts, but there are a bunch of rare pairs in here as well as a couple of popular ones.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11518403/1/A-Knowing-Heart][A Knowing Heart]] Luna/Harry- this one I debated posting, but I honestly haven't seen many good fics depicting this pairing that feels like the actual characters.

Hopefully one or two of these strikes your fancy!

  Teaching is no easy profession. Albus Dumbledore just wants to support his students. Even the bad ones. Even Draco Malfoy. In a world where the dark lord was defeated, Harry's generation grow up without the looming threat of war. Which means they have to be regular teenagers and make their own trouble. Fortunately, Draco is very good at that! Perhaps he just needs someone to be a good influence on him...?

  Snape swooped around the room like a giant bat, adding ingredients to some cauldrons and stirring others. Then he stopped and tapped his wand against the benchtop impatiently. "Well? What is so important that I must risk a vital brew of Animaserum by having you in the room with it?"His tongue was so dry, he didn't know how he would ever get the words out. "Heartsease, Professor." There, that wasn't so hard. He took a deep breath. Dementors were worse, surely.
