** Honestly, Riddle would have been a great teacher. He could have molded a generation of loyal students and never had to go all snake faced. He could then go into politics later on, and pretty much run things. But that's a less fun story.

*** This is fascinating. It starts out as a cracky fic about the insanity that is life at Hogwarts (and the author has a real flair for inventing odd situations that would only happen in the magical world) but the latest chapters have been hinting at either a sinister mystery or Tom having a mental breakdown and it's still not clear which it is.

  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)
