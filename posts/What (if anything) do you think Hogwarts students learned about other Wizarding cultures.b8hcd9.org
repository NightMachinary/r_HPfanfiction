Do you think Hogwarts ever taught about different Wizarding schools, different cultures' ways of using magic, how different Wizarding societies were run?

Hogwarts education (and the wider British Wizarding society) seems /so/ insular, arrogant even, especially if you take into account History of Magic and DADA perpetuating the idea that wizards > other magical races/creatures and Muggle Studies being seen as a 'soft' subject.

â€‹

I'm writing a Marauders' Era fic and have been listening to a 1970s playlist, the song Indian Reservation came up and it got me thinking, would the Marauders have ever heard of Native Americans or Ilvermorny before?


** Magical Geography is an interesting elective for AUs, yes, as has been mentioned before.

Still, while it's not Hogwarts that teaches it (although --- we don't have any explicit word on History of Magic being limited to English History; are we even sure that all the Goblin Rebellions Binns drones on about happened in England?), I would expect wizards to know a lot about foreign Wizarding nations for the simple reason that they have teleportation in their world. I am of the opinion that European and American wizards had contact far before Columbus, by way of Portkey, for example. With magic, /any/ two countries can function as neighboring countries.

  Magical Geography
#+end_quote

One of my favorite past ideas for magical geography was having a land of permanent night. A wizard expanded a field to have as much land mass as texas. Once you consider all the spatial distortion, the whole place still only gets hit by as much sunlight as would impact the original size of the field itself.

And if they can get enough energy to simulate sunlight, then they may as well be literal gods. I'm not joking. That amount of energy is more than enough to literally kill entire civilizations if they want.

** I always find it helpful to reframe these in terms of different real life analogues. Realistically, how much do you actually study the history of other countries and cultures IRL? With less years in school, other subjects, etc. it's not surprising that it's not really a major focus. I don't think it speaks particularly to insularity or arrogance. There are reasonable justifications for Muggle Studies being seen as easy. National and human exceptionalism is a real part of basically every country, and it's easy to see why that would be extended to those who are different and functionally have their own societies/cultures like magical races, even if they can communicate with humans.

A holistic "world history" course is fairly surface level due to time limitations, and most countries whose education systems I have some familiarity with (India, USA, UK, Japan) are definitely fairly light on world history (or non-European history) and very heavy on their own country/culture-specific social studies. And even when you study the history of a culture, it doesn't necessarily teach you much about the modern events that shape it today- I definitely spent a good chunk of time in school studying ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, different time periods of ancient China, but that doesn't really equip you to understand the modern culture of those nations. Outside of a comparative culture class, which was the default history course for freshman at my highschool, but not feasible to fit in for students interested in weighted courses. Since a holistic history course tends to go from beginning, it's pretty common for the stuff at the tail end (i.e. modern history and culture) to end up being rushed or cut.

History of Magic is obvious, the idea that they literally only study goblin rebellions is overblown in canon. Some info might be covered through Care of Magical Creatures and Remus' defense class. IRL, again, one of my most vivid memories of second grade was studying about the fauna of modern Australia as part of our social studies unit.

Fanon magical cultures like in PoS or Magicks of the Arcane can come across pretty well.

Would they have heard of Ilvermorny? In a world where there are only a dozen schools and it's a key part of the world, almost definitely. Native Americans? That's more iffy, but as a comparison, would you consider the Ainu or Aborigines common knowledge? I don't think so, or it'd be on a surface level where it may sound familiar but the characters have no specific recollection of the topic. And depending on your canon/worldbuilding interpretation, the magical world adds an extra layer of abstraction from real history and cultures.

** If Hogwarts taught anything about other schools, then many would have questioned the claim that Hogwarts was one of the better ones. There's just /so much wrong/ with Hogwarts:

- Muggle Studies is a joke.

- Divination is a joke.

- Potions is a /dangerous/ joke. Snape doesn't teach anything about safety, there's no protective equipment, and "instructions are on the board" isn't teaching. It pisses me off every time Dumbledore corrects Harry: "It's /Professor/ Snape, Harry". No, he's not a professor. Professors /teach/.

- Bullying by fellow students /and "professors"/ is obviously condoned.

- No non-magical subjects.

- No introductory classes for muggleborn or muggle-raised.

Had Hermione known about other schools then she would have burned down the entire school despite itbeing made of stone. She's not one to accept second-rate education.

*** I've rewarded a lot of stories yes potions is dangerous and yes snape is a complete ass but strictness can help keep order which leads to less accidents. Also the non magical subjects I'm kinda iffy on that because the muggle and magical world is not only different but also logic works differently. A wizard can legitimately change the world around them for instance. Science? A good bit of muggle science things wizards have understood/known about longer thanks to magic. One final point is that hogwarts is basically a middle to high school period not a college. How much did you learn in high school that truly prepared you for life and try comparing it to hogwarts that way.

*** May I ask what makes you think the other schools don't have their /own/ preposterous flaws? I like to think every school has a 'cursed' position like the Defence Professorship in Hogwarts, or some other, equivalent source of mayhem. (In Durmstrang, that would be the Headperson position, which despite everyone's best efforts always gets filled by Dark Wizards for some reason.) And I don't think "non-magical subjects" and "introductory classes for muggleborn or muggle-raised" exist /anywhere/ in the Wizarding World. Don't knock Hogwarts specifically.

(As for the "no non-magical subjects" thing specifically, Hogwarts advertises itself as a school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, not a general-purpose school. You may bemoan that the Wizarding World does not have general-purpose schools, but you can't blame Hogwarts for doing precisely what it says on the tin, that's like bemoaning that a medical school is rubbish at teaching its students about medieval literature.)

"Professor" can also be thought of as a scholarly title, though. Quite a few books mentioned in canon are signed by "Professor" Someone even though we have no records of those people teaching at Hogwarts (Newt Scamander, for example), so it seems the Wizarding World just grants the title of Professor to experts in their fields regardless of what they /do/ with that expertise; and while a horrible teacher of it, Snape is definitely an /expert/ in Potions, personally.

********* I don't think Economy in the Magical World of Harry Potter should be compared to our economy.\\
As said before, the actual size of Magical Brittain is more like a little town than a true country, so the size of the market is way inferior.

And even without that, they are wizard. Most of they days to days need should be availiable for free or almost nothing.\\
Need to drink? Aguamenti\\
Need to eat? You can play it Jesus style and multiply bread until you have enough. Since Transfiguration can also "modify" food, you can probably use it to make rotten food edible again.\\
Need a house? Just charm an empty plot to make it invisible to muggles, and than build the house with Magic. Even furnishing it is easy, either by reparing furnitures found in a dumpster, transfiguring something into it, or using the 300 years old of your family since Magic destroy the need of replacement.

Honnestly, the need of a wizard depends mainly of his talent, but for a relatively talented one, he only needs money for :\\
- Book : obligatory for Hogwarts student, but once adult, it becomes a secondary needs, and unless you are a big reader like hermione or some Ravenclaw, you can just buy one from time to time.\\
- Potion ingredients : once again, mainly conserves students, and other adult Potioner who either have it as a profession or a hobby, when it's not something vital.\\
- Hobby : like restaurants\\
- Professional level items : such as brooms, cursed item from Knocturn Alley or even Zonko and W W W.

So yeah, an average wizard probably don't have to spend much in his day to day life and their economy don't need to be as big as ours.\\
And don't forget that while the goblins control the economy, revolts and re negociations seem to happen pretty frequently and can be used both as an incentive to not betray the other party, and a mean to modify the condition of the accord to fit the current economy.

** Going by canon, absolutely nothing. You might argue that Binns might mention it, but no one is asleep to remember. There might be books in the library, but again, how many students would read those?

Also, it's not arrogance if you can back it up. And given that no Indians, Natives, French or Zulu rule the magical UK, their way seems to be working. Other than Dementors and maybe dragons, most magical species are not really a threat since they are not using magic but simply attack with physical force or primitive weapons. I give all Centaurs in the forest less than five minutes against a competent magical opponent. You could probably kill the entire population of mere people with a few blasting curses.

Same goes for Muggles. Unless you go for nuclear options (MAD), they are not a threat.

They're not a threat even with MAD unless Wizarding governments are utterly incompetent. Wizards would know about nuclear weapons after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After that, it's a simple matter to have some Aurors permanently infiltrate the chain of command in these matters to ensure that no nuclear weapons are ever launched.

That's only if they continue to follow the Wand Ban in dire circumstances. Most of the Centaurs /might/ out of pride, but the Goblins definitely wouldn't, and I'd bet neither would the Erklings, Hags and Vampires. We know too little about Veelas and their place in society to be certain, but I wouldn't put it past them. (Also, Dementors on the warpath /and/ holding wands would be nigh-unstoppable, but I'll grant you one could mount an argument that /they/ couldn't use wands if they /wanted/ to.)

So anything from a summoned rod of tungsten to pretty much any weapon with a calibre above .50 would do the trick. Same reason I do not consider Nundu's dangerous. Even basic NBC gear would counter their most effective attack and from there on, see above as to how to deal with them.

Citation very much needed. Basilisk Hide is by most accounts magically resistant, and thus I think it would take magic to pierce it no matter what. By my reckoning, you could launch a Basilisk into the sun and the hide would come out perfectly intact. (The flesh inside would probably have been fried to ash, mind you. But you get my point.)

The Wand Ban would be pretty pointless if all of these /couldn't/ use wands. I'll grant you that /perhaps/ the Centaurs cannot use wands no matter what, as they are never shown to practice magic, even wandless; but Elves (and, by extension, Erklings and Yumboes, one assumes, as they are close cousins of Elves) could definitely use wands if it wasn't horribly illegal for them to do so.
