Ok so basically any smart harry potter fics? I prefer if there was no harems, but if it's well written i'll take slash or some pairings. So the smart harry potter here is like the one who takes iniative but also shows like intelligence. Like poison pen or spellmaker or azoth. Anything that's well written and have a harry potter that possess intelligence please. Bonus points if harry potter was found dumbing his intelligence down at first. Thank you !!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19162495/chapters/45546637]] Harry Potter gets smart and takes control - The Goblet " Harry's name comes out of the goblet and he's had enough, he's sick of pretending to be stupid, he's sick of constantly fighting against the whole world. It's time to step up and take control of his life." This is a really good one, its currently 58 chapters (if that isn't too long for you) and the author currently updates weekly!
