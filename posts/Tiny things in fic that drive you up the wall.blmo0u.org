I've been reading founder fics recently and it drives me nuts when they have pumpkin juice back then. Pumpkins are a New World plant, and then I think they should at least expand on how they acquired it if the wizards of that time even knew of the Americas, and then I want to write my own fic on how wizarding society might've changed if there was communication happening there, and just ARGHHHH.

***** The only issue I see with that is if you allow that much bleed over from "muggle" life you need to include much more outside context that basically no one ever does (Presumably part of this because the majority of fanfic writers are not from the U.K. or Ireland and are thus /unaware/ of the context)

For example, I've seen no fic that recognizes that Seamus Finnegan (and plenty of other unnamed students) grew up in Ireland in the 80s and 90s and the sorts of parallels they would see between the muggle and magical world once Voldemort was publicly active.^{oksoIjustwanttoseeacoalitionofstudentsrebellingwhilebeltingoutComeOutYeBlackandTans,sosueme.}

And this was just with them living somewhere on the north coast, not in the streets of Belfast or anything. Anyway, since then, things Seamus says as he gets older sometimes have undercurrents, at least while I'm writing him.

I lived in England with the Troubles being something we had to take account of, first because of semi-regular bomb scares, second because we had kids from Belfast in our school who had moved to get away from it, and thirdly because it was taught about in History lessons.

Honestly, I can see this, because Sirius at least would totally be down for encouraging wacky hijinks.

He would also likely have a mental breakdown half way through, if anything reminds him most of the people he loves are dead, and this isn't James he's doing said hijinks with.

****** Or calling everything a "prank." Remus and Sirius aren't the teenage pranksters they once were- Sirius is a broken man who lost everything and was imprisoned by soul sucking demons for over a decade, while Remus also lost everything and spent his entire adulthood working odd jobs in poverty to get by while managing horrific monthly transformations and discrimination.

That's the kind of thing that would destroy lesser men. I've always seen Remus as overly serious and older than his years, while Sirius tries to be a bit witty to hide the fact that he's a deeply traumatized man, but doesn't really succeed.

The Mauraders died with James. The practical joking, funny pranksters could only survive together. Apart, they became jaded, broken people.

- Languages and accent, especially on time travel/dimension travel/crossover fanfiction. Your MC is somehow lost on Valyria/Middle Earth/9th century but somehow everyone is using perfect 21st century English? Yeah, totally possible. On the other hand, your MC is claiming to be a son of a pureblood family from Australia that only arrived in Britain yesterday, and yet nobody comment how he doesn't have an Australian accent but using a perfect British accent.\\
  A small paragraph to explain this is not hard, people.
- Magic suppression cuff. If this exist in canon, Sirius will never be able to escape Azkaban.
- A spell or ritual to 'bound' magic. Similar to magic suppression cuff, if this exist they will be used on high-ranking criminals.
- Getting Hogwarts letter on your birthday. I honestly have no idea where this trope comes from, even the movie shows Harry getting his letter before his birthday. Maybe because Hagrid deliver the letter on Harry's birthday?

It doesn't have to be the same thing. Police uses cuffs for temporary restraining suspects or during the court hearing, etc., but you don't keep people in manacles all the time. It could be they are uncomfortable or even painful to use, and in the high security prison (remember, nobody fled Azkaban before Sirius) they are considered unnecessary.

For example, imagine sticking Bilbo Baggins or someone like that in modern times, having him try to communicate with gestures, figuring out what gestures mean, figuring out something like that there's a particle indicating definite article, figuring out conjugation.

I had a concept for a /Worm///Star Wars/ crossover like this, where I had the MC from /Worm/ ending up thrown into the desert on Tatooine after the solidification of Imperial control of the region but 5-7 years before the events of the first Star Wars film, it turning out that there was some use to her superpower, with her eventually joining in to work in civilian planning for the imperial war machine before failing at politics and falling out of favour, but I got put off once I started rereading /Worm/ and started thinking about her attitudes and moral character.

Don't higher literacy rates reduce change in language?

By forcing Wizards to free elves and pay them, the most probably consequences would be that most family decide that they don't really need an elf. Forcing hundreds of depressed elves on the street with a majority of them likely dying. And as generous as Dumbledore is, I doubt Hogwarts coffer would be deep enough to pay for all this elves.\\
Yet, rather than explaining to Hermione that while her heart is in the same place, she first has to have a plan in place for the elves before freeing them (and that, as a student, she can't free them herself), most fic just say "They will die without Wizard Magic, every true wizard would know this (and yet it's not written in books), you just tried a genocide you stupid Mudblood)"

There is a middle ground, and SPEW recognizes this:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúOur short-term aims,‚Äù said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn't heard a word, ‚Äúare to secure house-elves fair wages and working conditions. Our long-term aims include changing the law about non-wand use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because they're shockingly underrepresented.‚Äù
#+end_quote

So, even the "long term goals" don't include freeing all house-elfs. (You can argue the thing with the knitted clothes, but she hasn't even the power to free them, so who cares?)

It's more about the fact, that of the three named house-elfs in canon, all three are abused by their owners:

- Dobby is made to punish himself by the Malfoys in gruesome ways
- Winky is thrown out after one mistakes. She was forced to watch a match despite her huge fear of heights
- Kreacher is mistreated by Sirius, and essentially imprisoned (forbidden to leave the house)

#+begin_quote
  Yet, rather than explaining to Hermione that while her heart is in the same place, she first has to have a plan in place for the elves before freeing them
#+end_quote

She has, and it involves actually asking house-elves what they want and expect.

#+begin_quote
  By forcing Wizards to free elves and pay them, the most probably consequences would be that most family decide that they don't really need an elf.
#+end_quote

I mean, they don't even want much money, they'd probably negotiate themselves down quite a lot. And if you throw someone out just because you can't 100% exploit them anymore, you're a horrible human being. I do think there is a middle ground. Maybe Hermione wasn't ready to find it at 14, but honestly: Who is?

Harry, Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus became closer friends because they were roommates. Harry probably would've been friends with Ernie MacMillan the same way he was with Seamus if they'd shared a room. Obviously proximity doesn't necessitate romance, but it sets a good stage for it.

I can't answer that, since I didn't downvote... if anything I'm agreeing with you that these cases are annoying. Me replying to you doesn't mean I downvoted.

Also, for the record, the wiki article includes both cases of different roots and a word later acquiring different meanings:

#+begin_quote
  Other contronyms are a form of polysemy, but where a single word acquires different and ultimately opposite definitions. For example, sanction---"permit" or "penalize"; bolt (originally from crossbows)---"leave quickly" or "fix/immobilize"; fast---"moving rapidly" or "unmoving".

And this quote is exactly what I'm talking about, a word effectively being two words (or more) with different meanings due to different linguistic roots. In some of these cases you also have a situation where the meaning is different depending on the usage (sanction as a verb versus as a noun) which I would say to anyone who knows anything about it will make it clear from context which meaning is being used.

But, of course, in a world where native speakers confuse ‚Äúwhere‚Äù and ‚Äúwear‚Äù, I'm probably expecting far too much ...

******* There are actually a few examples where the American meaning is the opposite of the British one: "quite" means "slightly" in British English, but "very" in the US

"Citation" can be a commendation or it can be a notice of an infraction (US)

"to table" something can mean to propose or discuss something but in the US it can mean to put it aside for later

"Wicked" can imply something evil or something cool (not sure if that's a UK vs US thing or more of a generational thing)

The thing is that language changes all the time and occasionally you'll have stuff that comes up where it's the same word in two different dialects has an opposite meaning to each other.

Let me make sure I understand your position here:

You acknowledge that language changes but you believe that those changes /should not/ be dictated by informal usage that break with previous conventions of word usage in a manner that is not "beneficial" to the language.

And you are quite (UK or US meaning?) annoyed that the responses are not addressing the idea that it /should not/ be this way because the responses are pointing out ways that it /is/ this way?

I'm not trying to be critical or anything, I'm just trying to understand why you're annoyed, because if that's the case, there's likely some miscommunication or misinterpretation between each other and I'd rather have such misunderstandings smoothed out. :)

I think it was because I, and possibly others who replied to you, took your statement as you thinking that the phenomena of having homophones of opposite meaning was odd. I just wanted to contribute and point out more interesting examples where auto antonyms exist. :)

If your concern is that "slang should not automatically be taken as more than slang when doing so just causes confusion in the language itself," nowhere in your message that I was originally replying to did you indicate that.

‚Äã

Now to respond to the idea that

"slang should not automatically be taken as more than slang when doing so just causes confusion in the language itself,"

which you're saying is your original point,

The simplest response I can put forth is "A prescriptivist approach will not work here. Just because a language /should/ act a certain way doesn't mean it /will/."

The longer response is below.

Is the use of either UK or US "nonplussed" really slang?

Further more, at what point would you consider "slang" to become more formal?

Because if you're concern is people taking slang seriously, when people are exposed to enough slang for a long enough time, its highly likely that some of what is slang at one point in time can be considered formal or standard in the future.

The English language, unlike say French or Spanish, does not have a governing body, thus what can be considered standard or non-standard is much more fluid (though it is still quite fluid in both Spanish and French since the governing bodies have limited enforcement powers).

Now to address the idea that certain changes in language are coming about in ways that are not "beneficial" and from usage that is "nonsensical and confusing."

Remember that these two forms of "nonplussed" as well as the other auto antonyms I pointed out are coming from two countries separated by the Atlantic. Most of the population in both countries would not have had a chance to meet or discuss with each other, thus not having any chance at misunderstanding each other, because they never came across any auto antonym. So for either party, coming up with whatever word they did was likely not "nonsensical and confusing" to them, nor did it cause any confusion in their particular dialect of English, though the same can't be said for when the two dialects had to interact, which again was likely rare in the vast majority of speakers of both dialects.

I believe that I have addressed the core of your initial argument, and hopefully you see no further reason to be quite (UK) annoyed. If however that is not the case, please let me know where I went wrong so I can rectify any misunderstandings. :)

"He embraced her," or, if you're hung up on circles, "He folded her into the circle of his arms." "She encircled his wrist with her hand" can be rewritten: "She grabbed his wrist" or "She closed her fingers around his wrist." Encircled is more appropriate for art or something still. For instance: "In front of Harry was a broad, round door. In the middle was an old man's face encircled by a great snake."

Which, come to think of it, happens an awful lot in the Old Testament, which featured many suspiciously old people. And then he came around and told them to quit it with the animal and human sacrifices. Hmmm.

There are other options, though. Philosopher's Stone (also turns water to wine and multiplies food, unlike Flamel's lead to gold trick). Draught of Living Death (with a loyal follower to administer the antidote at the right time. This is a fake, not real resurrection, though). "Master of Death can't die" excuse, except Son of God is probably even higher ranked. His enemy (anti-Christ) used his blood to create a body and it anchors him to life. The particular re-embodiment ritual that Voldemort used is probably a bit behind him, though communion is already two thirds of it. Flesh of a servant, easy, bread or crackers. Blood of an enemy, easy, wine or grape juice (or ask Brutus, he could get some real blood from Caesar). Bone of the father, unknowingly given... How do you get that, from a discorporeal and omniscient being?

So, I guess what we're getting at is that in the setting of Harry Potter, given the canonical range of magic available, there is a plausible argument to be made that Jesus was a wizard. It's not ironclad or guaranteed, but it's an interesting thought experiment for sure!

Approximately 60% of the UK identifies as Christian (per the census) while simultaneously only 37% believe that god exists. Liberal Christianity is very much the norm in the UK and I imagine in many other parts of Europe. Certainly the 23% of the population who are apparently agnostic Christians count as "a lot" of people.

Hell, 16% of Church of England /priests/ are agnostic as to the existence of God, which is pretty much the most extreme form of liberal Christianity.

****** On first blush, it seems like a bit of an absurd idea, even if there are many similar examples in real life. linkffn(Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles) was a fairly over-the-top parody along that line.

Parodies aside, sure, a wizard can be Christian. Or a Christian can be a wizard. Don't get me wrong, whether it's contradictory or hypocritical or whatever, I'm certain it could and would happen. People of faith coming into the wizarding culture, or purebloods converting. I'm not arguing about instances of it, though, but the overall cast of their culture.

There's little evidence of the Wizarding World holding any particular beliefs (other than the inclusion of Christmas, which appears to be primarily celebrated in modern secular traditions rather than any particular religious aspects). Further, their society has very few things in common with mainstream British society post-Statute. They share a language, they share a land (but mostly stick to their own secret parts of it), they share a government (ostensibly, though they function more as foreign nations). Cultural exchange is limited to Muggleborns and halfbloods.

To me, this implies that purebloods, who were raised within the Wizarding culture, are fairly unlikely to be Christian. But, I suppose that doesn't conversely mean they're anti-Christian enough to specifically avoid using related swears.

Somewhen in the mid-1500s, the Church of England was established to buck the Pope's rule, and gradually became fairly Protestant in its ways. A hundred fifty years later, the Glorious Revolution occurred and then the Bill of Rights was signed, upholding rights of Protestants and driving out Roman Catholicism. This was the same year that the Statute of Secrecy was signed. Wizards, who are longer-lived, likely saw these religious and political upheavals from both ends. I don't imagine, as they decided to go to all the effort of hiding from the Muggles and staying hid, that they were feeling particularly charitable towards the volatile faith that calls for their persecution.

Or maybe they did keep the faith, and the limited scope of canon just never touched on it. Dumbledore's funeral and Bill and Fleur's wedding didn't seem particularly religious, but those characters weren't exactly typical examples of Wizarding culture, either.

On a related note, I wonder if many fics have explicitly linked the two events? The wizards were Catholics or supporters of James going underground, or they took advantage of the turmoil to get William and Mary to sign off on it and disappear, or some other linked motivation?

******** That didn't sound right, so I looked it up. Both were signed in 1689, but it took three years for the Statute to be implemented. I figured maybe the year just stuck in her head from school, but apparently she explicitly did align the events. The HP Wiki references the WOMBAT exams in saying that the wizards tried asking William and Mary for protection of wizards to be enshrined in law (presumably, in the Bill of Rights itself) as well, and wrote the Statute of Secrecy when that failed. Go figure.

Still, it would be interesting if someone explored alternative reasons for this. The wizards hold true to Roman Catholicism and King James, and go underground like Secret Catholics in Japan. Or they're sick of the monarchs and, rather than intervening, took their magic and went home, and then hid and locked the home for good measure, thus achieving self-determination and independence from the British Empire almost a century before America. Or perhaps James has a secret wizarding child and his descendants rule Magical Britain while leaving Muggle Britain to the reformers, making the magical government a direct monarchy instead of an odd hereditary bureaucracy.

It could have some interesting effects on the government and social structure of Magical Britain by the time Harry is around, at least.

"Before wizards went underground, when we were still being hunted by muggles, young wizards and witches sometimes tried to suppress their magic to avoid persecution. So instead of learning to harness or to control their powers, they developed what was called an Obscurus."\\

This is a cannon reason given for the statute, and clearly indicates that persecution was a reason for them hiding, additionally the fact Ariana was able to fall victim to such attacks show that halfbloods, if not purebloods were also caught and suffered persecution.

****** Yes, it's being pointed out to me a lot ._.

It feels weird. She built purebloods up as this isolated, independent group who feel utterly superior to Muggles and want to go crush them instead of hiding from them, but then they use slang rooted in one of the things that forced them to hide away.

It's almost like Roma people using the word "gypped". It may be a common word, but it has some rather negative historical connotations in relation to them, and you'd think they'd perhaps try to deliberately avoid using such language. Then again, these are common exclamations that generally aren't taken as deliberate and explicit religious references, and have been in use since before the Statute, so perhaps they just don't think of it as that big a deal. Or Rowling didn't think about it. A lot of the structure and history of the wizarding world was developed between Azkaban and Goblet, as she had to create a Ministry and introduce magicals from around the world, too, which is why the Magical Reversal Squad got a name change between the two books.

**** For the second point, I would disagree. There's plenty of swears and slang and phrases from countries I've never even been too that I use. Sometimes it's because it expresses a sentiment American English can't, or it rolls off the tongue well, or because it's just fun to say. I can totally believe someone who's being constantly immersed in another culture to start picking that kinda stuff up after just a month. I would absolutely believe it happening after a year and a half.

If anything, the only reason it might break immersion for me is because when I was twelve I wasn't throwing around sexual body part based swears (go suck a dick for example), so I'd be a bit weirded out by another 12 year old doing it. But different cultures and all that.

*** Wizards canonically knew about Christianity from long before the Statute of Secrecy came into effect. Pureblood religious practice may differ in some ways from modern Muggle practice, but there's no reason they shouldn't have it.

‚Äã

Case in point, the Fat Friar. He must have been a medieval wizard (he's mentioned as using magic to treat the plague) which means he lived long before the two societies split up. He's also a wizard who felt strongly enough about faith that he took lifelong religious vows.

**** I think the "wizards have irrefutable proof of the existence of souls" revelation is typically overshadowed by "and we know this because they have a creature that /eats/ souls!"

A few things tend to get bunched together: Dementors/Horcruxes as proof of souls, the Kings Cross afterlife scene, the Master of Death, and Dumbledore referring to death (once, to an eleven year old who was worried he just killed a guy and also caused two more to choose death) as the next great adventure. Most authors seem to treat this as "souls exist, there is an afterlife of some form, and death possibly exists as a personified entity. And then they stay far away from any religious implications, sticking only to those canonical bits. Religion is a touchy subject.

*** I always assumed that a whole bunch of wizards were Christians and that it was probably a higher proportion than British people of purely British extraction in Britain. I have a not quite headcanon that some of the more vulgar purebloods started fiddling with neopaganism in the 1950's, but that's it's not actually traditional and imagined Lucius as wanting to join but not being allowed to by his wife.

Remember, many have Roman names like Lucius. They probably see Saxons and Normans as something a little bit unaristocratic.

** Actually, pumpkin juice in Founder's era Hogwarts is, although unlikely, perfectly possible, it just wouldn't be pumpkin. The word pumpkin comes from an older English word, pumpion, which comes from an older French word, pompon, which would have been in use around that time, and referred to cucumbers and melons (despite the fact that they also had the word melon). Depending on how much interaction wizards had with the Normans during the conquest (still a number of years after Hogwarts was founded, but it's still easily possible for the Founders to still be in business by then), it's possible they could have started picking up the language early and called their "of course its traditional!" melon juice jus de pompon.

But it's not very likely.
