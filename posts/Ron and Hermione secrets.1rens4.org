Chapter 1 A Visitor in the Night

"Now I want you to eat that soup, Mr. Weasley," said Madam Pomfrey in her motherly, but strict tone, "That poison may not have killed you, but you were..."

"Very lucky," Ron Weasley said, finishing the sentence, "I know, Madam Pomfrey. This is like the third time you told me since I been in here."

"Well, you are very lucky, Mr. Weasley," Madam Pomfrey said, "I don't know what would have happened if Mr. Potter hadn't thought of that bezoar. Now eat that soup!"

"I will," Ron said.

Ron didn't like the soup, but at least if he promised to eat it, it would keep Madam Pomfrey from annoying him. Ron watched Madam Pomfrey as she walked away from his bed and walked into her office, mumbling something about Argus Filch and his security look-outs. Ron looked down at his soup. He didn't like it, but it was keeping him alive. He tasted the soup and turned up his nose. He put the bowl of soup on the table beside his bed and looked at the infirmary. Besides Madam Pomfrey, he was the only person in the Wing. The only other company was the paintings of former Hogwarts Healers.

Ron sighed and thought about his friends. Harry Potter and Hermione Granger had visited him earlier that day, and Harry had told him that he was expecting another meeting with Professor Dumbledore. But Hermione had hinted that she would visit him again that night. Ron hoped this was true. Visits from Hermione had kept his mind off of Lavender Brown, whom he was now regretting of ever asking out on a date. Of course he never really had an official date with Lavender. It was more snogging. And that was getting boring. Lavender never wanted to talk to Ron whenever they were together. Ron knew this was a bad thing, and it was apparent because of that horrible gift Lavender had given him for Christmas. Ron glanced quickly at the necklace with My Sweetheart engraved on it, which was on the bedside table. Ron never liked to wear it, but did so anyway when Lavender came to visit him.

Suddenly, a knock on the Hospital Wing door made Ron jerk his head away from the necklace. Madam Pomfrey came marching out of her office.

"Who could that be?" she said, looking at the door, then to Ron, "Were you expecting someone tonight, Mr. Weasley?"

"I guess so," Ron said.

"I bet anything its Miss Brown," Madam Pomfrey said, "Girl's been coming in here every chance she gets. And why haven't you eaten your soup!"

"Oh," Ron said, grabbing the bowl, "Sorry."

Madam Pomfrey muttered something and turned to the door. She opened it and said, "Oh, Miss Granger, how may I help you?"

Ron nearly dumped his bowl of soup when he heard this. He titled his head and looked at the door, but couldn't see anyone other then Madam Pomfrey. Then, he heard a very familiar voice.

"I was hoping to visit Ron," the voice said.

"Well," Madam Pomfrey said, "I guess you can for a little while."

Madam Pomfrey opened the door farther. Hermione walked into the room. Ron smiled as she walked over to him.

"I don't want you in here too late, Miss Granger," Madam Pomfrey said.

"I won't be, Madam Pomfrey," Hermione said.

Madam Pomfrey muttered something and walked back into her office. Hermione turned to Ron.

"I was wondering if you were going to come tonight," Ron said.

"Oh you were, were you?" Hermione said, "I was surprised Lavender wasn't in here. I thought you were expecting her."

"Actually, I am glad she isn't here," Ron said.

"Look, if you want to break up with her," Hermione said, "Just do it."

"I wish I could," said Ron, "But it is hard. If I told her the truth, she would probably curse me. Believe me, I don't want that to happen. It is horrible to stay in here."

"Believe me, I know," Hermione said, "So what is the truth that you don't want to reveal to Lavender?"

"I... never wanted to go out with her at all," Ron said.

"Well, that was obvious," Hermione said, smirking, "Why did you then?"

"To... make you jealous," Ron said.

"Why would you want to make me jealous?" Hermione asked.

"I was kind of angry with you," Ron said.

"Angry at me?" Hermione asked, "Why? What did I do to make you angry?"

"Something Ginny told me," Ron said, "She... told me that you kissed Viktor Krum that night at the Yule Ball in our fourth year."

"Is that what this is all about?" Hermione asked.

"So it is true?" Ron said.

"Actually... he kissed me," Hermione said.

Ron sighed and looked down at his soup.

"It wasn't that good of a kiss, Ron," Hermione said, "It was... kind of sloppy."

Ron looked up at Hermione and smirked.

"But you still went out with him, didn't you?" Ron asked.

"They weren't really dates," Hermione said, "We spent time in the library. Viktor told me about his home in Bulgaria. He wanted to me to go there, but I didn't go."

"Why not?" Ron asked.

"Well, around the time that he wanted me to go, Harry had gotten attacked by those dementors," said Hermione, "And then I went to Grimmauld Place."

"Oh," Ron said, "Would you have gone?"

"I don't know," Hermione said, "I never been... but, why are you asking me this?"

"Because I have been regretting some of the things I did around you these past couple of years," Ron said, "Believe it or not, I did know you were a girl. You were just a different girl then who I was used to. I mean, girls don't usually hang around with boys as much as you did with me and Harry. To me, it was like you were just one of the guys, you know."

"Oh, thanks, Ron," Hermione said in a sarcastic tone.

"We are best friends, Hermione," said Ron, "And... in fourth year I didn't want to mess that up. Yes, I was thinking of asking you to the Yule Ball, but I was terrified that you would say no. I was more terrified of that then of Harry getting killed in one of those tasks. And when Viktor Krum beat me to the punch, I... well, you know what happened."

Ron looked back down at his soup, which was getting colder by the second.

"Ron?" Hermione asked.

"Yeah," Ron said.

"I would have gone with you to the Yule Ball," Hermione said.

"Really?" Ron said, smirking.

"When you didn't ask me," Hermione said, "I didn't think that you would want to ask me. And then of course I didn't want to go to the Yule Ball alone, so when Viktor asked me... then I said I would go. Each time Viktor wrote to me and asked if I wanted to spend time with him, I refused. I had something else in mind. Then, when I took it into my own hands, it didn't work."

"Took what into your own hands?" Ron asked.

"Don't you remember me asking you to Slughorn's party? Hermione asked.

"That was an invite?" Ron replied, "And... I screwed it up, didn't I?"

"Yeah, you did," Hermione said.

"I would have gone with you, Hermione," Ron said.

"Really?" Hermione asked.

"Yeah," Ron said, "I... love you."

"Don't let Lavender hear you say that," Hermione smirked.

"I am serious, Hermione," Ron said.

"Really?" Hermione asked again.

"Yes," Ron said, "I don't want to be with Lavender. I want to be with you. For the longest time, I have wanted that. You are the one who haunts my dreams, not Lavender."

"I want that too, Ron," Hermione said.

"How do you think Harry would take this?" Ron asked.

"I don't know," Hermione said, "We are his best friends."

"You don't think he would hit me or something, do you?" Ron asked.

"What?" Hermione asked, laughing.

"You don't think Harry would see this as a "betrayal of trust" or anything like that," Ron said, "I mean, he kind of sees you as a sister. You and him are really close."

"Not as close as you and I," Hermione said.

Ron smirked.

"Well, if you are afraid of Harry finding out," Hermione said, "Then maybe it isn't a good idea..."

"No!" Ron said, "I don't want to lose you. I already have too many times."

"You never lost me," Hermione said.

Ron scoffed.

"Fine," Hermione said, "Then we won't tell Harry. He already has too much on his mind."

Ron heard a noise coming from Madam Pomfrey's office. This made Hermione turn to look too.

"Maybe we should use Muffliato," Ron said.

"You know how I feel about that spell, Ron," Hermione said.

"Can't you just get over that?" Ron asked, "For me?"

"I will think about it," Hermione said, beginning to yawn.

"I think you need to go to bed," Ron said smirking.

"I can't...I got homework to do," Hermione said.

"Can't you just leave it alone for one night?" Ron asked.

"I won't be able to sleep if I don't do it," Hermione said, "Nothing will take my mind off of that."

Ron smirked and leaned over to Hermione and kissed her. He backed away and said "Will that do?"

Hermione kept silent for a moment.

"Oh, I am sorry," Ron said, "I shouldn't have done that."

"No... that was nice," Hermione said, "But that doesn't get my homework done. So I should get going."

"You will always be that bookworm I know and love," Ron said, smirking.

Hermione smirked and stood up. "And you will always be my king." She kissed Ron on the lips and walked away from his bed, waving at him as she left the Hospital Wing.

"Is she gone?" Madam Pomfrey said, walking out of her office, "Good. And why haven't you eaten your soup, Mr. Weasley! Eat it! I don't care if it is cold!"

Madam Pomfrey sighed and walked back into her office. Ron looked at his soup and sighed at it. He couldn't help smiling though. The one thing he had been wanting to do for ages was finally done. He had asked Hermione out, and she accepted. He even kissed her! Now, the only problem was getting the courage to break up with Lavender.
