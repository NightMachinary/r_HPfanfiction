So, I came across this fic on FFn that was based on another fic, which I googled.

One passage did catch my attention, and it got me thinking:

#+begin_quote
  Marietta's not an idiot, so when the two leave, she immediately sets about removing the evidence of illegal activity from the tell-all. Look, she wants to tell everyone about Voldemort. She's not going to get these idiots in trouble because they do dumb shit in order to find out about Tommy's plans. 

  "Man, they get up to a lot, don't they?" Terrance says rhetorically, sifting through his many sheets of paper, all covered on both sides with neatly printed, small-ish text.

  "Shame wizards don't trust typewriters," Marietta says, shaking her hand. Holding a quill and writing feverishly for most of the day is not an activity she recommends. "Or we could just type out the magazine."

  "I mean, it's more of a newspaper, isn't it?" Terry muses. "You know, you could have just used a dicta-quill."

  "Too much like Skeeter," Marietta dismisses. "I'll transcribe later. Point being, /what the fuck."/

  "I know, right?" Terry looks at his table, completely covered in stacks of paper. "I mean..." He puts the papers he's holding down, and stares. "This is going to take a while."

  "How are they still alive?" Marietta demands of no-one, flicking through her own notes. "I mean - /how?/ First-year alone they could've died like twenty times."

  "Granger's lucky the Polyjuice didn't kill her," Terry agrees. "She only looked a bit like a cat - I've heard horror stories of innards being changed up..."

  "I mean, just look at this!" Marietta shoves a roll of parchment in his face. "Their odds in the battle of the DOM were slim to none! six teenagers against the might of way, way more experienced death eaters! Ron had to fight, like, four of them! Or something! Hermione got hit with a nasty fucking curse! What the fuck!"

  "I know!" Terry stands, starts pacing. "No wonder they started up the DA - though, I am a bit surprised it was Granger's idea-"

  "I'm miffed she's the one who had such a good idea," Marietta agrees standing. "But that's just personal - the more important thing is how little they actually taught us, like fuck! the four years previous and they didn't - I mean, look, what they did teach was great, but there's so much more they could have taught us, like, I didn't know about dark marks! I didn't know they were a thing! If they'd have taken us to the chamber at least once I think we'd have all had an easier time of actually believing them, frankly - or, hell, this is the room of requirement! Just - require something that proves /something./ We were all running fucking blind! That's the point of this, right? That's our point. People need to know, or they're just scared and confused and they make all the wrong fucking /choices./ They could've told us some of this, just /some/ of it. I'd have - I'd have been less fucking /scared./"

  "I don't know," Terry says, "I don't know how they managed all that. I mean - I was - I've always been a little impressed with them, you know, from the rumours, but - fuck, they were /kids,/ Marietta, Mari, Harry killed a man in self-defence when he was /eleven,/ fuck, /no wonder he's messed up,/ Jesus -"

  "God," Marietta says, flopping down onto the couch that had replaced her desk chair. "Fuck."

  "Yeah." Terry agrees, calming down. "Fuck."

Are there any fics where the rest of the school find out about Harry, Ron, and Hermione's (plus the other members of the "Ministry Six", if applicable) adventures and react in the same sort of way? Horror, disbelief, sympathy, et cetera? Bonus if they're confused why said subjects are nonchalant or confused as to why people are freaking out over these revelations.

Oh, story from the quote is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/48883259#workskin][Golden Bullets]]

I know of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12302907/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum][Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum]], which has elements of this, IIRC?


** this sounds really interesting and I haven't encountered it before, I hope somebody posts something :)
