*** Neville will always be my poster boy for this.

Third year his boggart is the high school chemistry teacher basically, the thing he fears most. Quick recap on Neville at this point:\\
* His uncle repetitively abused him, such as a drowning attempt and thrown out of the second floor window.\\
* A giant murder snake last year, petrifying a group of people, cats, and undead.\\
* Sirius Black, a first cousin of the woman who tortured his parents to insanity, is escaped and roaming around.\\
* Dementors (Fear of fear itself? BS, fear of soul sucking, nearly unstoppable monsters whom bring up your worst memories ever)

I'm sure you can make an argument for flying or falling, as he did the window thing and broomstick thing too.

** *Voldemort is a terrible villain* and should have been permanently defeated at the end of PS. There is no reason why the series should have been a broad, overarching quest to rid the magical world of Tom Riddle and his horcruxes. A few edits at the end of the first book, and TMR is suddenly just an evil man who killed Harry's parents. Full stop. JKR's worldbuilding is extraordinary, if not consistent. Why not send Harry on new adventures every year that are wildly disparate? Why not new locales or novelette's describing his hijinks over the summer holidays?

While the golden patronus plot device of many fanfics is rather silly, dementors are a woefully /unexplored/ area of the magical world. Honestly, what's more terrifying: an old man who's afraid of the grave (who can't seem to kill infants or teenagers) or a race of unkillable beings that remove souls and only fleeting weakness is a spell that very few witches and wizards can master?

*The prophecy is a useless plot device* that shouldn't have been used. It serves as a tool to achieve two goals: it gives Voldemort a reason to go after the Potters and it provides a reason for Dumbledore to shelter Snape at Hogwarts. JKR could have come up with several other reasons as to why TMR targeted the Potters and having Snape as the lingering evil in the background heightens tension throughout the series.

In these negative topics, I think it's important to say something nice to alleviate any tension that may have accrued. I think one of my /favorite/ things about the series is the surety with which young Harry Potter evaluates competing values systems and discards them. We learn early on that the selfish materialism of the Dursleys or the ignorant bigotry of the Malfoys doesn't interest him. I really love those insights into his character, especially after the hellish upbringing he suffered.

It's not a matter of what's more terrifying, it's a matter of what's more captivating. Dementors, while scary, are incredibly limited as villains because they do not have goals, complex social structure, or even anything like individuals. They're essentially a force of nature like a hurricane or earthquake. There's very little you can do with that. Human evil is so much more interesting that the dangers of the natural world.

Your point is well taken. *I* didn't find Voldemort at all interesting, which is entirely subjective.

I think you're nitpicking my comment about Dementors. If the entire series had been seven books leading up to a final confrontation with the Dementors, I /still/ would have been disappointed. I think the series would have worked much better as a loosely connected group of stories about the adventures Harry has in the wider magical world. Sure, for some of them he's in Hogwarts. Why not a summer vacation visiting Charlie Weasley on the dragon preserve? Or a holiday adventure in Egypt breaking curses with Bill? But that's okay! It's what fanfiction was made for and some of the best stories I've ever read don't have anything to do with an overarching impending battle between two orphans.

#+begin_quote
  *Becky Sharp* is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-heroine][anti-heroine]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Makepeace_Thackeray][William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s satirical novel /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(novel)][Vanity Fair]]/ (1847--48). A cynical social climber who uses her charms to fascinate and seduce upper-class men, Sharp is contrasted with the clinging, dependent heroine Amelia Sedley. She befriends Amelia at an expensive girls school where she is given a place because her father teaches there, and uses her as a stepping stone to gain social position. Sharp functions as a /picara/ --- a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picaresque][picaresque]] heroine --- or by being a social outsider who is able to expose the manners of the upper gentry to ridicule. Her name ("sharp" having connotations of a "sharper" or con-man) and function suggest that Thackeray intended her to be unsympathetic, and yet she became one of his most popular creations.

Dumbledore said in OotP that Harry was in danger and the bond of blood was the only magic he knew of that would keep him completely safe. Harry then indeed survives, and continues to be safe when in Petunia's proximity after Voldemort's return, even when Voldemort discovers via Snape exactly where Harry lives.

All evidence points towards the bond of blood being effective. Your incredulity doesn't do much to convince me otherwise.

He was abandoned by both his parents, every single human being in that orphanage treated him like trash and devil-spawn. Then he's introduced to the Wizarding world, and Dumbledore is suspicious of him from the word go. He doesn't give him five minutes before making judgements of Tom and his character. I mean, the poor kid is eleven and has had 0 affection in life.

Then, he gets sorted into Slytherin, with their wealth, arrogance, training, and value of blood and family, and yet he's a penniless orphan with an unknown surname who doesn't know anything about his heritage - obviously very important in Slytherin - and hasn't had the advantage of classy tutors and immersion in magic since birth. It seems clear that he would be ostracised and mocked, by the Slytherins for his circumstances and by the rest of the school for being a slytherin. When he becomes powerful and charismatic and knows his family heritage, those same people who were ostracising him are now sucking up to him. That would just strengthen his opinion that everyone is below him, even these stuck up classy puebloods who think they're on top of the world, they were so arrogant and now they're bowing at his feet.

His whole life has reinforced the idea that he doesn't belong anywhere, that he doesn't belong to /humanity/. /Every single person/ abandoned him, hated him, or used him for their own gains. It's not any wonder at all that he would feel absolutely 0 connection to humanity or other humans. They always placed themselves as /different/ from him, so why should he ever view them as anything /but/ different from him? What one single experience in his life would give him any respect or kindness for any part of humanity? I don't think he felt like a human at all, I don't think he felt any kinship or empathy for them.

If I were Tom Riddle, I would be done by my second night in the Slytherin dorms. Everyone in the muggle world hates me, everyone in the wizarding world hates me, I don't belong anywhere. Tom Riddle, instead of running away and hiding in seclusion for people who he'll never belong with, or just magically exploding and obliterating anybody in the area from the species of those beings who were constantly oppressing and mocking and hating and fearing and looking down on him, Tom Riddle actually had the emotional strength, patience and skill to take control of and manipulate his hateful self-righteous oppressors into first admiring and respecting, then serving, then fearing him. Instead of trying to take them out himself, he manipulated them into taking each other out. He controlled his hated enemies (which basically encompasses all of humanity - muggle and wizard, dark and light) through divide and conquer. If he were fated to forever stand alone, then he would stand alone at the *top*.

Personally, I think he gets major props for not just apparating from place to place letting loose a fiendfyre before moving on, and razing the earth to the ground.

As for the Death Eaters and the Order, they were both manipulated. Neither of them ever think that Voldemort does not give the slightest fuck what happens to them and which side wins, as long as they all die in the end. Which side was correct, it's probably a slight mix of both. Which side was /more/ correct depends on the world-building of the FanFiction author whose work you're reading, or headcanon, because JKR's story is provided from a very biased, insufficiently explained worldview. A kid is thrust into a war and accepts his place in it without doing any history or ideology research, and that's what we as readers get.

Personally in my headcanon I like reading about the Dark side, because I like the evil ones and because the Light side winning is too close to the real world, and I don't really feel like reading about things similar to the world I live in. The dark authors usually bring in a lot of history, paganism, traditionalism, etc, that allows a lot of world-building, knowledge of folk tales, and other stuff. Light sided fics, on the other hand, often bring muggles and muggle things, and honestly the muggle world is boring. I live here, I don't need to read about it.

But anyway, non-headcanon, completely from canon, I think we can see that Voldy really doesn't care about his forces at all. I guess the psychological analysis of his motives in wanting both sides to blow each other to hell doesn't count as fanon? But the basis used to make that analysis is I think canon.

If he had been on the level of Grindelwald, everything about the books, including the morals, would have been completely different. He's a crappy villain who doesn't learn from his mistakes, and I think that says a lot about the society that let him gain so much power. "Epic" evil is pretty boring to me, honestly.

If he had won, voldemort's step 2 would have been the systematic extermination... Of the purebloods, leaving him as the ultimate immortal emperor of wizarding Britain.

Dobby's grave gets desecrated by traditionalist house elves on a regular basis.

The trio secretly rules magical Britain with an iron fist.

The reason muggleborn are hated stems from the fact that, historically, they're usually the ones trying to conquer the wizarding world and have only recently stopped treating the purebloods like they would local ethnicities from the colonies. Grindelwald's largest recruitment pool was composed of muggleborn that'd joined Hitler's militias in the twenties and thirties. Ss-zaubertruppe eins was responsible for exterminating purebloods in much the same manner their smuggle colleagues dealt with their assigned minorities.

Sirius would have sucked as a parent figure.

Voldemort is dead, but Tom Riddle's still alive. The reason why voldemort was kinda crazy was because he had been a horcrux that went out of control. His death scene was tom going 'you've outlived your usefulness. I deeply regret everything that happened.'

**** Basically, Tom made his horcruxes and vamoosed to greener pastures after Dumbledore turned him down for the DADA post. His greatest ambition at the time, after all, was to teach DADA and there were other schools where he didn't have as much of a history with the headmaster out there. Sure, it was probably not ideal, but given that he was functionally immortal, he could afford to build up his career and knowledge/contacts base before having to go back.

But Riddle was a bit of a mad scientist. He'd successfully made a horcrux that was capable of interacting with its environment to an insane degree, but since his book most of the other horcruxes were made as emergency measures should Dumbledore somehow suss out that he'd made them.

So he went back to the drawing board. The horcruxes didn't render him insane, as he was still capable and powerful enough to essentially sit across his old rival and not try and kill him then & there. That, and given that a soul is a universe unto itself (see TheMadMadReviewer's take on the subject if you want an idea of what I'm talking about), he decided to test a theory-namely, that a horcrux could acts as more than just an anchor to its maker. That, given the right circumstances, it could evolve and grow on its own. In short, that a horcrux could actually evolve more as a person and, theoretically, become someone completely new.

So Tom build a body for the horcrux, made the brains and used a random idiot that happened to be handy to split his soul again.

He did this a couple of times to get the technique down and wound up with a modified horcrux ritual which, far from acting as a simple anchor tied to him, had tied the split soul to the body instead.

Since he didn't really need that whole Dark Lord thing anymore, given that he had time to conquer whatever he wanted now that he was immortal, Tom shunted a bunch of useless junk into the body's brain that would motivate it to not just sit around and mooch off its maker.

Said useless junk happened to be all his old plans and reasons for conquering Wizarding Britain. Oh, and the fake Occlumency projections Tom had worked on that really didn't do anything for him anymore, the one that he had made to convince legilimencers that he was a Dark Lord and could trace his lineage back to Slytherin himself.

Note that Tom dropped that particular obsession when it became clear to him that cackling evilly and killing people was part of a Dark Lord's job description, but tellingly wasn't part of a Dark Emperor Of All He Surveys' job description. Plus, the various books he'd read on the subject told him that doing so when trying to get taken seriously was a Bad Idea.

Also, he really needed to work on a better alias than Voldemort.

So he successfully makes a new him thanks to the horcrux ritual and, as a kind of 'now go forth and stop monologueing at me' present, gifts Tom jr jr with his old horcruxes since his newer versions were all better in his opinion and helped out during DADA classes.

Tom jr jr disappears shortly thereafter.

A couple of decades later, Riddle is thoroughly embarrassed when he opens the Daily Prophet and realises that the Dark Lord that has hilariously failed at conquering as dumb a country as Wizarding Britain is, in fact, Tom jr jr or, as he likes to call himself for some reason, Voldemort.

He resolves to forget to mention this when he's appoiinted Headmaster of Hogwarts. He's already put his name down for it, so the post should be his in about a century or so.

You're absolutely correct to point out that Draco is just a kid. Unfortunately, that doesn't do enough to excuse his more egregious actions as none of those things happened in a vacuum. He had ample opportunities to change. His father very nearly killed Harry at the end of CoS. That wasn't a good enough reason to change right then and there?

The severe alterations made to several characters are baffling. In children's fiction, it's okay for a character to be "all good" or "completely evil." JKR's decision to change genres make these alterations inevitable, though. It's a unique idea to have the books grow up along with the characters (and presumably the readers as well). This change also makes it extremely jarring for us to see Draco's constant petty efforts to bait Harry suddenly give way to a Super Secret mission from Voldemort. I've always seen Draco as Hannah Arendt's "banality of evil": people committing atrocities aren't often sociopaths, just ordinary people inflamed by common ignorance and jealousy.

No ten year old is going to display the admirable instincts that Harry does; it's part of what makes him the protagonist.

For Draco, it's a lot less complicated: he's been raised a certain way, and while he's been unduly influenced by /other/ bad actors, that in no way excuses his own behavior.

But most of all, after a half-dozen years of that, he'd really need to expect it, and just nut up. Ron chooses to hang around with those people. No gun is held to his head. When he goes off with them in the last book, he keeps his parents from getting into trouble by a simple ruse. He tells everyone he's sick at home.

Do Death Eaters break down the door? No. The Dark Lord dismisses Ron to such an extent that "sick at home" was enough to get his entire family off the hook with the Dark Lord's Evil Government. Even Voldemort recognises Ron isn't anywhere close to a threat. He's just an average teenager. And the average teenager is a selfish, ignorant, lazy git. And so is Ron.

  “...lucky that Ginny's on holiday. If she'd been at Hogwarts they could have taken her before we reached her. Now we know she's safe too.” [Bill] looked around and saw Harry standing there. “I've been getting them all out of the Burrow,” he explained. “Moved them to Muriel's. The Death Eaters know Ron's with you now, they're bound to target the family --don't apologize,” he added at the sight of Harry's expression. “It was always a matter of time, Dad's been saying so for months. We're the biggest blood traitor family there is.”

  “How are they protected?” asked Harry. “Fidelius Charm. Dad's Secret-Keeper. And we've done it on this cottage too; I'm Secret-Keeper here. None of us can go to work, but that's hardly the most important thing now. Once Ollivander and Griphook are well enough, we'll move them to Muriel's too."

Some interesting notes I'd forgotten about the Fidelius in there. I might have to struggle through that one again before the next fic I write.

******** First Year: He was right. Hermione was a stuck up bitch and what he said was mean and rude but at the end of the day she humiliated him and he reacted like an 11 year old. At the end of the year he sacrificed himself, frankly risking death, in order that Harry and Hermione can go on.

Second Year: He goes to fight Slytherins monster because his friend and sister were hurt.

Third Year: Hermione was a bitch and went behind their backs about the broom, didn't even think to mention that she went to speak to McGonnegal. She was also wrong about it being cursed as much as she was right about it being from Sirius. She also was heartless about Scabbers (idgaf that he was Wormtail, she was still heartless). End of the year Ron stands up to what he believes is a mass murderer "if you want to kill Harry you'll have to kill me too".

Fourth Year: Imagine you're Ron. You spend weeks dreaming that maybe you'll be picked for the tournament, yeah you're underage but maybe just /maybe/ you'll get to shine for once publicly and do something none of your brothers got to do. But nah it's your famous bff. He reacts like a normal teenager. You know what though? End of the year there's not one doubt in his mind about Harry saying that Voldemorts back despite much less evidence.

Fifth Year: They were right not to write to him, one wrong word could have been a disaster for the Order. Harry was being a child, they were at war. He spends the entire year supporting Harry being a little bitch and then goes to fight Death Eaters at the ministry because his friend had a dream.

Sixth Year: He dates a girl because he thinks Hermione doens't like him. I don't get the big deal here? End of the year faces Death Eaters, /again/.

Seventh Year: So Harry has no family and Hermione hides hers in Australia with no one noticing cause their muggles, grand. Ron on the other hand by the time he leaves for the hunt has one earless brother and another mauled by a werewolf. He doesn't have to go, Hermione and Harry can't go back to Hogwarts cause mudblood and chosen one. Ron can. Ginny does, Neville does, Luna does. Ron goes on the hunt anyway, putting himself and his family at risk. He's also human and worries about them, then they get a Horcrux, great. By this point his sister has been in a Death Eater ran school for 3 months and 2 of his brothers are being hunted for taking a stand and his whole family is under surveillance, especially worrying as they are involved in a long term lie about him being sick. If they are caught they will be tortured into insanity and killed. He still goes because he knows it is the right thing to do. He also goes without a clear idea of what is going to happen but he goes because he knows his friend has a plan, except he has no fucking clue. Then the Horcrux plays on all of this and he snaps and in a moment of weakness, after hearing his sister was punished at the school she is trapped in ran by Death Eaters and no one but him even pauses to think about it, Harry tells him to go and he does. He immediately regrets it and tried to go back but Harry and Hermione have already left, it's not his fault they didn't wait and he couldn't find them. He eventually comes back, saves Harry's life and destroys a Horcrux, overcoming his insecurities and completing the growth of the most compelling character arcs in the books. He then goes on to help destroy 2/3 remaining horcruxes, fights in the Battle of Hogwarts and is one of only three people to directly stare down Voldemort and defy him ("He beat you") and continues to fight for what is right, even knowing Harry is dead and being one of only two people who knew the prophecy he actually thought the fight was futile at that point but he kept going because /it was the right thing to do/.

But yeah he's a bit insensitive at times so I guess he's a terrible person.

  First Year: He was right.
#+end_quote

It's true that Hermione had an awful lot of growing up to do and learning how to best apply the knowledge she sought, but I wouldn't go so far as to say Ron was right.

Do you remember the Interview of Doom 1.0? Emerson and JKR giddily called a segment of the fandom "delusional lunatics." What hurt was the fact that they called us names because they disagreed with us. That's the same thing Ron did. I know it's unreasonable to expect an 11-year-old to be perfectly eloquent and suggest to Hermione that she find a better, more personable way to help her fellow students, but Harry immediately understood that what Ron did was wrong. Why didn't Ron express remorse? Because he lacks character.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The name-calling isn't helping your case. If Hermione had gone immediately to McGonagall without first suggesting to Harry that he turn it in, I'd be more inclined to agree with you. But that /didn't happen./ Unfortunately Ron was there and his materialism influenced Harry into taking an unreasonable stance against a valid point that Hermione would later raise about the possibility of the broom's origin. When it came time to make up with Hermione, who suggested it? Sure wasn't Ron.

#+begin_quote
  She also was heartless about Scabbers
#+end_quote

Hagrid provides our best overview of this: Crookshanks was doing what cats do (catching mice and rats). It's hilarious that you bring this up as JKR clearly intended Crookshanks' presence to be one of her "anvil-sized hints." The similarities between Ron and Crookshanks are right there in black and white: Hermione (inexplicably) loves a ginger thing that seems to be useless until the final act when it shows its "worth." For Crookshanks this is exposing Scabbers as Peter Pettigrew. For Ron, this is "saving" Harry from the locket. By the end of the book, even Ron has come around to Hermione's way of thinking as he gives Pig over to Crookshanks for a sniff and asks, "What do you think? Definitely an owl?" Thus demonstrating that he was in the wrong, and Hermione in the right.

  Fourth Year:
#+end_quote

Your entire premise in this paragraph is an appeal to empathy. Unfortunately, this isn't very wise as you spent the first and third year trashing Hermione. You're only using empathy when it suits your narrative.

Ron knew that people had died in previous tournaments. He still chose to be extremely nasty to Harry despite being very supportive in CoS. I would /much/ rather have read that Ron was supportive of Harry in yet another attempt on his life. Unfortunately, that isn't what happened. It's almost as baffling as Hermione choosing to attempt to explain away Ron's behavior as jealousy. Despite the cruelties he's shown her, she still sticks up for him? CoS gave us a powerful insight as to how Hermione views those who are cruel to others. For Ron to receive special treatment is inconsistent character development on JKR's part.

I've already responded to this in another one of [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2q6znp/selfless_ron_fics/cn6h407][your posts.]] To be fair to your description of Harry in OOtP, though, I strongly agree with you. Harry was being unreasonable, but we can /only/ say that given our complete knowledge of the situation. From Harry's POV, his friends are being mysterious and secretive when neither of them were present for TMRs rebirth in the graveyard. That does not mean that -by default- Ron and Hermione were right to keep information from him. Dumbledore was wrong to ask it, Ron and whoever was impersonating Hermione were wrong to follow the order, and Harry was wrong to focus the blame on his friends instead of Dumbles. There's an awful lot of blame to go around and that scene is by far my least favorite in canon.

Although in book 2 her crush was on the Boy-Who-Lived. She developed a friendship with Harry throughout books 4-6, which allowed her to develop genuine feelings for Harry Potter as opposed to the Boy-Who-Lived.

At this point she is certainly not a "starstruck fangirl".

GoF really ruined Ron's character for me, as I guess it did for a lot of other people, so I'll give you that maybe that's not exactly an unpopular opinion.

Lily was dead and James spawn was still there to "mock" him.

The memory Harry saw of the Marauders "bullying" Snape which made him doubt if James and Sirius were good people was either false (we know in canon false memories exist) or he deliberately only showed the Marauders' /retaliation/ for something evil he did.\\

*Dementors*, written by JKR after her battles with depression and (it is rumored) failed suicide attempt *represent* both /depression/ and the result of being lost to, and giving in to, depression -- /death/. Their kiss kills the person whose soul is removed, leaving nothing but a mindless husk.

I've never seen an argument over this issue before, so can I just ask for clarification: are you arguing that the dementor's kiss causes just spiritual death (that, without the soul, you're not you and therefore you are dead) or complete medical death of the body?

**** Both. Sort of.

The body is said to continue breathing but is left mindless, with no memory or personality. Nothing else is known about that from canon, for obvious reasons. Even Neville's parents' situation was sort of dark for the genre, so it is clear why this wasn't explored.

Characters in the story react like this is death, and once Kissed people are never seen or talked about again. There is no ward in St. Mungos for these people nor a place in Azkaban full of mindless bodies. So "pulling the plug" on victims of the Kiss is logical and supported passively by canon. That would mean the body died due to the Dementor's Kiss.

Which doesn't much matter, as the mind is gone. In a very straight-forward sense, this would mean the Dementors killed the person's mind and body, even without the soul issue and even with a body left physically alive immediately after the Kiss.

As for the rest, the soul said to be removed. After that, it isn't said to be able to return, nor does it stick around like a ghost does. Logically, that means either it is destroyed or it passes on to the afterlife -- which several canon characters believe exists and with which Harry apparently has a direct experience. This loss of soul is the death of the person on the physical plane, in all major religions and philosophies, which means (among other things) that a person being given the Kiss has been killed.

--------------

Thus, Dementors kill people, mind and body, supporting their thematic representation of death from symbolic depression. A maximally dark reading (one not supported by canon) would have this death by depression (suicide) destroying the soul, meaning the victim doesn't get an afterlife. Daaark.

I don't think this makes much sense, but at least it logically and thematically holds together. The Kiss /at least/ sends someone on to the next great adventure. People don't act like the Dementor's Kiss removes this possibility, so I don't think it fits strict canon. But it is still death in all senses.

Fudge therefore also summarily executed Barty Crouch Jr., as well as attempted to execute Sirius Black.

These two claims are where the argument originates: whether Dementors kill people and whether what Fudge did was summary execution.

#+end_quote

We don't know anything about what the soul actually is in HP. We know, at the very least, that parts of it can be removed without any change to the person's character or abilities (horcruxes).

We know that a victim of the Dementor's kiss is conscious, but completely apathetic. Traditionally, the soul is distinct from the body but also the mind. The soul is your free will, the timeless essence of your being not conditional on any particular memories or experiences. Your soul is immutable, whereas your mind changes.

As such, I would argue that such a Kiss victim still possesses their /mind/, as well as their body. It's only the soul that's gone, that essence of free will. A Dementor's victim has lost the ability to make choices, they've lost their desire to live, but they haven't lost their subjective point of view. They're like an animal: they have a perspective, they can feel things and think things, but they don't have free will or any kind of spiritual presence. A Dementor's Kiss victim is like a human version of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan%27s_ass][Buridan's Ass]]. Without free will, they have no reason to do anything.

The very fact that a Dementor's Kiss is spoken of as worse than death implies there is a material difference between the two. It implies that experience continues after soul extraction, and that experience is horrifying.

Regardless, whether or not a Dementor's Kiss kills you is essentially a semantic debate. No one is arguing that being Kissed is a better situation than dying. Further, I think it commonly accepted that a Dementor's Kiss has a different mechanism than death in and of itself. Death in its purest essence is what the Killing Curse does, because the Killing Curse does not act through any mechanism, but rather simply makes you dead. No one in the books speaks of a Kiss as death, because death traditionally is understood to mean the cessation of existence (in the mortal plane) of all parts of a person: body, mind and soul.

Even if you reject the above description of the mind remaining sans soul, the body at least remains, and so the strict requirements of "death" have not been met. It's /as bad as/ death, it's /functionally the same as/ death, but it is not substantially the same as death. Two things that have the same result are not necessarily the same if they occur by different means. Indeed, something occurring by different means is proof positive that they are not identical.

  "No see, it's like we keep telling you Hermione: dementors don't kill you. He's fine to take the field."

  "Err, now-"

  "If you hadn't nailed him to his broom he would be pushing up the daisies. He's run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This. Is an ex-wizard."

  Students fled the quidditch field as Ron stood there, mouth hanging open. McGonagall rushed up with a shocked look on her face. "Miss Granger, I never!"

** I hate Hermione. End of.

I didn't always used to but now the moment she crops up in anything I read I just start skim reading until it's over. My favourite fanfics tend to be the ones where the troll kills her or she's barely involved or she's bashed mercilessly. Every single aspect of her character annoys me.

**** She wasn't kicked out. She ran away to marry. I'm not saying she should have stayed or believed what they did. I'm just saying she had this secret love affair going on with a muggle born and then ran away to marry him. She grew up in pureblood society, I imagine she knew what kind of scandal that would bring. So her sisters probably had no clue and woke up one morning to find out there older sister ran away and married some muggleborn. I imagine they had to bare some heat from that: At school with whispers, from their parents now probably keeping an extra eye on them etc... I just couldn't imagine how abandoned I would feel as her sister. Not saying she's a bad person, just a bad sister.

Imagine if her actions had made it so neither of her sisters could be in that society anymore. I'm sure it was questioned whether they were raised right etc. Especially because Sirius was also going against pure-blooded beliefs. She was right to feel those beliefs wrong, it's just she could have been sacrificing her sisters to that society.

I know this is a very unpopular opinion and honestly I don't expect one person to agree with me. It's just how I see it/ feel... But it was asked for unpopular opinions and that's mine...

****** No-no. I am not saying her actions in marrying was wrong; I'm not even saying she's a bad person. In fact she's a very strong woman doing what she did. BUT I am saying she is just a bad sister in my opinion. When I think of what she did I totally agree she should marry the man she loved, but I don't think she was a good sister in doing this.

She knew when she first started seeing Tonks' father that dating him would lead to her family never seeing her again, but she continued. She continued knowing that if she fell for him and married him she could never see her sisters again. Then as she continued she didn't tell them and finally she just ran away and married him. She could have said something. Maybe stand up and tell her parents so they could kick her out and not lose face in the world they lived in. If she had done that then it's not like she abandoned Narcissa and Bellatrix without saying goodbye. But I feel the way she went about it, running off in the middle of the night without a word, is a horrible thing for a sister to do. Like they didn't matter as much as this guy.

When I think about my younger siblings I think about how that would hurt them so much. I think about how publicly being disowned would have been better, because then it's not me leaving them. It's parents ostracizing me. It leaves this door open, in my opinion. But she just left. If I had an older sister and she just did that I would feel like she didn't care at all about me.

Like I said... I know this is very unpopular... You wanted unpopular ;)

**** I am in no way saying that what she did was wrong. I don't think her family is right and you are correct it is racism. I did not say she was a horrible person, I just feel she's a bad sister. If she kept secrets from them, snuck off and got married, leaving them to find out the next day without so much as a goodbye, I think that warrants the title of a bad sister. I'm not saying she shouldn't have married him, she totally should have she loved him. I'm just saying she should have told her family what she was doing, so she could have said a proper goodbye (even if it fell on deaf ears) and so they could publicly disown her. That way her sisters would not have to bare any of the consequences of her actions. Because I'm sure that their family suffered consequences. Is it right that she should have to think of this, because they chose to live in such a nasty racist society? No. But as their sister she should have wanted to protect them from her choices.

Granted this is all assumption on my part, I don't know what happened other than the books said she married Tonks then her picture was burned off the Black tapestry and she was disowned. I just assumed if she told them she would have been disowned first... But yeah... that's my unpopular opinion... I just imagine how hurt my little sister would have been to one day have me in her life and the next out of no where be gone with no goodbye.

By taking a personal situation and pushing it into the narrative, the source of those feelings likely isn't being acknowledged in a very healthy way. Whether or not this is happening is, of course, none of my business.
