Sirius wanted to show James that he should get his act together before someone else swoops in. Lily only agreed to spite James. Sirius intended it to be a one-time event. Honestly.

However, neither expected that they would get along splendidly and have fun. Or that they would agree on a second date before the first one was over.

**** This "gaining acceptance" and "putting their happiness above his crush" might sound great on paper, but it really doesn't translate well into actual human relationships and interactions. And at an age like 16 or 17? No chance.

Two friends of mine, and I daresay they were best friends at the time, happened to like the same girl in high school. She started going out with one of them, and the other guy...well, he was a mess for a month or so. Something in their friendship broke. She was friendly with both guys before going out with guy 2 - her friendship with guy 1 crumbled as well.

Neither of the two guys bothered keeping in touch after graduating from school.

James might not decide to have yelling matches with Sirius in the great hall like an edgelord, but the brotherly camaraderie that's often spoken about James and Sirius' friendship? Yeah, you can say goodbye to that.

< Did one of them get thrown out of their house and move in with the other one?

This would just increase the feelings of hurt, disappointment and betrayal, not lessen it.

#+end_quote

Not sure where you come from, how your peers behaved, but I've never heard of a "mature" teenager. Teenagers, by definition, are immature. Heck, several adults I know are immature. Maturity is a lifelong process.

Besides, when it's a question of feelings, humans generally tend to behave like humans, not like robots. Also, if you're so curious, you can try it out yourself - hit on women your friends have had their eye on for a while, date them, see where that leaves you. Please do not blame me if you find yourself short a few friends afterwards though.

PS: When I meant their friendship fell apart, I didn't mean they stopped talking to each other instantly. They still talked to each other, but the ease with which they spoke was gone, and there was a slight hesitation in all their interactions afterwards.

My knowledge/experience does have a lot of random gaps where stuff I just haven't ever encountered lies, for instance I also didn't know what Werther's were until a couple of years ago (I'm 23 and live in England where they're well known). I do know some other general stuff about pornography and sex and whatnot, but I've never encountered the term pegging before and thus never knew it. Well, never encountered it that I remember, anyway. It's quite possible I've seen it before and just forgot it as useless information.

** The thing is Sirius hurt James feelings in the beginning, not because he had deeper feelings for Lily, but to take the piss out of James and that hurts and breaks trust and even if James is happy for them, it still hurts and it would be healthy for him to get a bit away from them.

So, in the end, I think Sirius would just lose everything because the friendship and brotherhood is the closest and most important relationship for him and if he doesn't break up with Lily in an attempt to get James back (and I can't see James be happy with him for hurting Lily) or stay with her, I think he would start to resent her later on about his lost friendship with James
