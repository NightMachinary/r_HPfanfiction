I'm ~chapter 30 and I'm thinking of dropping the fic. The writing's passable, but not great, and what I had once thought was a fantastic premise appears to be slowly squandered. Harry spends his time studying for school and socializing as a schoolboy when he has practically godlike powers and can affect serious change in the world. This premise was so awesome that I forced myself past 5 mundane chapters of regular school activities. Instead of Harry fully taking advantage/exploring his abilities, however, he uses them for school and occasionally adds new widgets/gimicks to his repertoire.

I feel like the author could have done so much MORE with the premise. Voldemort is barely mentioned at all, and there's no sense of urgency for anything nor any conflict at all. Problems only arise when Harry faces Snape, who has been turned into a one-dimensional, almost cartoonish villain.

All in all, I really, REALLY want the story to succeed, but it appears to be turning to shit fast. Does it ever get any better?


** Well... I consider it to be wholly awesome, but precisely for the reasons you mention. It is totally devoid of conflict and angst, which of course I wouldn't wish every fic to be that way, but for this particular one it has an absolutely exhilarating effect for me. Reading /Core Threads/ and all its light-hearted fun just makes me so damn /happy/ every time. It's kind of like /Like a Red-Headed Stepchild/ in that respect.

Now, to be honest, Harry /does/ use his powers more later on (he most notably creates a country all of his own), but the /tone/ never change. I think it's for the best. Perhaps /Core Threads/ just isn't your type of story.

**** Now to be fair my post wasn't nearly as funny as yours. /All hail vampire ducks!/ (And Evil Overlady Hedwig! She'll take over the world and eat bacon! /Hoo!/)

** No! Blasphemy! What have you got against vampire ducks. How can a story with vampire ducks possibly go bad.

To be honest, while it never loses it's tone, it does become more serious. Harry does things to help out magicals that need it, and with so many stories of dark!angsty!OP, but doesn't get anything done Harry stories out there, I like the whole OP, but still a kid Harry. There are so few, and I think this should stay as it is.

Thanks,

Warryn.

** I can't remember what happened before or after ch30, but (spoilers) [[/spoiler][it does branch off (heh) into some dimensional travel (incidentally into one of the more cliche manipulative Dumbledore worlds), and Harry has to deal with a few near-death (heheh) experiences involving his magic exploding]], but I think you'll never get much "true" conflict as long as you're dealing with what's essentially a god. But that's most of the fun of it!
