While we never get to see Regulus Black's death, being drowned by Not-Quite-Zombies is definitely a very horror-movie way to go.

Charity Burbage might also count, having to go through a torture session for Voldemort's amusement before being unceremoniously Killing-Cursed.

**** Wasn't specified, but generally snakes only /bite and leave/ if they're venomous or as a reaction to a threat IIRC, otherwise they'd go for constriction. So, real-world-logic dictates venom would be the more likely suspect.

EDIT: I forgot about Book 5, in which Arthur gets bitten. Nagini's venom is an anti-coagulant - it makes it so the bleeding /won't stop/. The official cause of death would be blood-loss, but the venom would have facilitated that.

***** It really depends on what type of snake Nagini is, and what type on venom she has. If her venom is neurotoxic - such as that of cobras, mambas and death adders - then the pain would be negligible. If her venom were hemorrhagic - like that of most vipers - then Snape would have be in excruciating pain while he died.

The 'good' thing about dying from a snake bite is that your brain shuts off so quickly that you wouldn't really have the time to think too hard about your imminent death

The bite itself is similar to an injection, so pretty harmless there.

Someone having their throat torn out is messy and rather horrifying for anyone watching, unless you're a psychopath I suppose. On his part...well a knife to the throat is how I usually plan to go when I'm in that sort of mood so I can't honestly say that the idea horrifies me.

******** I'm inclined towards thinking he couldn't, that if he could've won a duel against him he would've at least attempted to defend himself since he still hadn't spoken to Harry, but perhaps Dumbledore cautioned against him dueling Voldemort because of the horcruxes. They both seem quite capable duelists, and while Voldemort has the advantage of age and sheer magical power, he's also mad. Still I tend towards thinking he couldn't win against Voldemort.

It varies with an arterial wound but it's usually rather dramatic, and with the length of time it took him to die it would have been on the messier side. With a clean enough cut the blood flows sluggishly and the person dies within seconds, from the sound of it his would've involved arterial spurting, think basically any neck wound you've seen on film. They aren't generally that messy in reality but if the wound isn't deep enough or a clean enough cut they very much are. Not sure how to describe it really.

**** I'm not saying it was not brutal in any way, I just think that most murders that are not purly committed by the AK are more brutal. Snape gets bitten by a Snake, suffers 2-3 minutes and dies. No Crucio or other forms of torture, not severed body parts or slowly bleeding out. In addition Snape was at peace at the moment of his death, because he found comfort in Harrys eyes. From a pure brutality standpoint the 12 Muggles Peter blew up were more brutal IMO.
