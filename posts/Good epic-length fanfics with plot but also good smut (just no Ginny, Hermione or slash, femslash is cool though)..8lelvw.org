Besides "For Love of Magic", I found that its quite hard to find some good stories with a good smut in it too. Doesn't have to be a lighthearted tone, I don't mind angst (as long as it isn't teenage stupid angst) nor drama/comfort. Points for Daphne, Tonks, Gabrielle or a good OC. Don't mind Harem, but I'd rather not. Poly with 3 is cool.

*** I stopped reading somewhere close to the first task. I'm not a huge fan of the "IDK what love is" trope, its interesting the first time, then its just boring and tacky. Thanks for the suggestion though.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.
