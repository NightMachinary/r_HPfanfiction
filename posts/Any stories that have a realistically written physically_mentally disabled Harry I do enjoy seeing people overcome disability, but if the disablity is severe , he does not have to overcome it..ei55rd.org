The disablity can be anything, blindness, insanity, autism, etc.

By overcome I mean this. Accepting it and managing to find ways to continue having a happy and good life even with the handicap.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4113087/1/][A Different Fate]] shows Harry with an unspecified developmental disorder (akin to downs syndrome and it's like) caused by the failed killing curse. No magical cure, sudden fix-it, or easy acceptance, just him and his family growing up and learning to live with it. As someone with a sister similiarly affected, I found it incredibly realistic.
