Harry defeated Voldemort because of sheer luck and the destruction of his horcruxes not by suddenly gaining the same level of power as him.

If Harry gains a power then Draco or Voldemort or whomever don't also need to gain that power to 'make it fair'. If Harry becomes a Jedi through sorcery and builds a lightsaber then Draco doesn't need to find his workshop and do the same and become a Sith! If Harry is a demigod then an evil god shouldn't start making deals with the Dark Lord to put him on level footing.

Honestly i'm just annoyed at finding a fic that has a sort-of unique Harry only for the author to decide that the best way to counter this is to take what makes that Harry special and pass it around to everybody. Like Super Saiyans in Dragon Ball Z it goes from "Once every thousand years... he is the Legendary Super Saiyan" to "Super Saiyan Bargain Sale!"

*** Well, it's just a principle. It's equally valid to increase the challenge rating in other ways. Maybe the Balrog used better tactics and was able to block the Fellowship's retreat. Maybe having a lightsaber affected timing, and Tom Bombadil didn't happen to be passing by at the right time to rescue them from Old Man Willow - or maybe Frodo tried to use the lightsaber to rescue someone, and took off a limb. Maybe the Ringwraiths weren't driven off from Weathertop so easily - or maybe, seeing the lightsaber from a distance, they used ranged weapons, sticking Morgul arrows in each of the hobbits plus Aragorn from a distance and then retreating to wait for the results. Maybe the hobbits, feeling more confident with a lightsaber in hand, didn't feel the need to trust or work with Aragorn. There are many options. You just have to do /something/ to keep things challenging.

**** It's a shitty saying. First, adding what's effectively another magic sword won't give Frodo a significant advantage, so the saying fails to support its own message by choosing an example that doesn't work. Second, if the good guys only won against overwhelming odds thanks to luck and enemy idiot balls, making the enemy even more powerful isn't going to help a story. You can make the enemy less stupid and the good guys less dependent on luck, or you can, radical, I know, write a different story that's not canon 2.0 - now with a lightsaber, but otherwise the same.

****** I intended to reply to you, since my main point is that if the good guys only won through luck and author fiat, there's no need to do something to keep things challenging.

People really need to stop thinking canon is the baseline challenge - often, the challenges from canon can be toned down. Many stories, such as Harry Potter, would be improved if things weren't so lopsided that you need SoD breaking luck for the good guys to win.

** If you want to have the plot have some sort of tension to it, you can't power up one side without powering up the other side.

For instance, in your example, if Harry becomes a demi-god - there will be 0 tension to a fight between him and voldemort. Maybe that fits the type of fic you want to write or read, in which case that's fine - but in most cases, people seem to like having voldemort as the final challenge. And for that, crushing over it with ease is kinda boring/anti-climactic.

Hard disagree. In many popular works (not making a statement about quality, just popularity) the hero is severely under-powered. Take for example:

- Harry Potter
- Huger Games
- Eragon
- Lord of the Rings
- ...

You can make the protagonists much stronger, and still have them facing challenges, albeit different ones. If the fight in the ministry in OOtP becomes a duel with death-eaters instead of trying to run away from them, it doesn't make defeating Voldemort any easier.

If Harry becomes smarter, he can use that /instead/ of the power of love to defeat Voldemort.

Heck, in Eragon the protagonist becomes stronger multiple times, and he still wins in a way that's not related to strength.

**** I'd argue Eragon at least partially falls victim to this trope though. Galbatorix and his underlings get a lot of power-ups each time Eragon and/or his allies get one. Although, as you say, Eragon eventually manages a workaround that makes the relative power levels irrelevant.

**** Well, if you took the hero from each of those and powered them up - the challenges they face in those works would not be nearly as impactful, they'd need to be increased.

It seems that you agree with this - because, for instance, your example of a fight with the death eaters in the OOtP /is/ an increased challenge to the potentially better Harry - hopefully of adequate difficulty to make it seem reasonable.

Of course, if the focus isn't meant to be on that as the central conflict (eg, if it's meant to be a backdrop for a romance or something) that's less important. But if the central story arc is going to be defeating Dumbledore, a smarter/stronger Harry (both of which /are/ boosts in strength) would need to have some measure of increased challenges to keep it interesting - that can be through making Voldemort smarter, increasing the death eater threat, or so on. But running a Smart!Harry through the exact same stages of canon and with the same difficulty level would result in it being too easy, I'd say.

I think that would be the problem, repeating canon is almost never a great idea. A smarter Harry would of course run through different challenges, that (if the author is good) also fit to him - without making the opponents stronger.

For example, how would a smart Harry try to break into Gringotts? He could go a different path that's less insane, but still impressive and dangerous. Heck, if the final duel is a magic duel, you wouldn't need to change anything - just do less talking.

Exactly, canon Harry only won because of the 4 most powerful literary weapons: Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiat, Plot Armors, and the “lucky hero” trope.

If Voldemort hadn't been dumbed into oblivion by JKR, their encounter in the Forbidden Forest would have played out very differently:

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort strip searched Harry and performed a thorough Veritaserum and Legilimency interrogation on him.

  Voldemort: Hahaha, that's interesting! Dumbledore was indeed cunning, but you daft moron just blew his carefully crafted trap for me. Harry, do you believe I would just cast a killing curse at you? Do you believe I was really that incompetent as not to perform a full interrogation of you? But now, you have completely lost. Nothing will stop Lord Voldemort anymore!

  Voldemort: Rookwood!

  Rookwood: My lord?

  Voldemort: Dose this idiot with Draught of Living Death and lock him behind the strongest ward in your Department!

  Rookwood: Yes, my lord!

  Voldemort: My most faithful, the final victory is upon us. We shall now take the castle and crush their last pitiful resistance. You must kill Ronald Weasley and that mudblood whore Granger at all cost!

***** While people can debate until the cows come home about whether or not the horcruxes "extra life" gambit was a Dues Ex Machina, I think it's important not to confuse plot armour and lucky hero tropes with arrogant villian tropes.

Voldemort is magically gifted, politically charming, and extremely cunning. There's a reason he notionally gets 1/4 of magical society to support him, and scares the rest into being complacent. However, his defining feature, which is on display through the whole series, is his arrogance, and need for things to go just the right way.

There's a reason quirrellmort didn't just stab harry in the chest with a big knife during the first defence lesson, when harry didn't know how to use a wand. There's a reason he didn't have Ginny poison Harry's tea, or lure him into a room with the basilisk looking straight at him. The same goes for the duel in the graveyard, Voldemort should've just kept him tied up after he was resurrected and stabbed him in the eye.

If you replace voldemort with someone else, say, give lucius malfoy supreme control of the war, they most likely would have won. There would've been a mysterious mains gas explosion in privet drive which killed everyone and that would be that. Lucius almost did win when he, through the minister, changed Harry's trial time almost making dumbledore unable to represent him.

The reason Voldemort doesn't just William Wallace harry in the forest is because he is an arrogant villian obsessed with stories. I don't think its author fiat, or plot armour, to write a character like then when there is plenty of backstory about why Voldemort is an egomaniac. For gods sake, he went alone to kill the child prophesied to destroy him. A villian like malfoy would've surrounded the place with an entire regiment before burning the house down.

*** Nah, I don't think so. It's important to make sure your story has tension, but A) powering up Harry can close the gap but not eliminate it and B) a stronger Harry can still struggle.

First off, Voldemort is really effing strong. Like, "duel multiple wizards simultaneously" strong. There is a healthy middle ground between that and "talented high school dropout". Harry can exist anywhere within that middle ground and will still struggle to defeat Voldemort.

Secondly, there's a lot of possible conflicts besides a simple "can Harry beat Voldemort in a 1-on-1 fight". Can Harry protect his friends? Can Harry find all of the Horcruxes? Can Harry prevent the inevitable societal collapse that two decade-long wars would cause in a isolated society? Alright, that last one was tongue-in-cheek, but you don't need to make the tension of the story "whose magical schlong is bigger". Have Voldemort be about as stronger, but a much better strategist who uses guerrilla tactics -- now it's a question of whether Harry can learn to combat that. Have Voldemort be /weaker/, but working through (semi) legal channels -- how does Harry deal with it?

Yes, at some point, Harry can become too strong and remove all the tension. But there's a /lot/ of wriggle room there.

**** I think you don't understand what I was saying - for instance, all of the other conflicts you include as possible ways to challenge a stronger Harry /are/ powering up the other side - eg, the societal collapse bit is a challenge that's not in canon. Voldemort being smarter/more competent /is/ making him stronger. Including a more powerful institution/government opposing Harry or being made to bend to Voldemort is powering it up.

The point is that you can't power up Harry and make him face the exact same challenges as in canon while not changing anything about them and expect it to be full of tension to the reader.

** I understand your specific gripe with "everybody gets superpowers," but I do think that powering up a protagonist needs /some/ kind of additional challenge to keep the story interesting.

In Harry's case, in the hands of a skilful author, this might be as simple as "Harry no longer wins through plot armour and has to rely on his own skills." There's an element of this in Nightmares of Futures Past, for example, when Harry and four friends take on the Basilisk without any help from Fawkes or the Sorting Hat. That kind of story can be really interesting if done right. But giving Harry additional skills plus keeping the plot armor - that tends to make things boring.

It's like the hero's journey.

After a while, the more experienced authors will take these rules and subvert them.

I get a bit upset too when I see the enemy taking up a similar powerset ( harry travels back in time, voldemort took his blood and can now travel too ) but this is not something that should be condemned.
