** There's a fic about Harry and Luna being pedos and grooming a firstie. No clue what it's called and I refuse to google it. I'm on enough lists as it is.

There's a bunch of Harry/Lily and Harry/His kids/relatives on some of the smut fanfic sites.

There's also linkffn(One big Weasley Family) where Harry cuckolds the Male Weasley and they all love it.

** The Rebel and the Chosen by chelseyb was a HP/NT that sort of tackled the difference issue, but otherwise it was a feelgood romance canon rehash

** There's a smut fic of Harry/James on adultfanfiction.net that was cute/smutty, if you don't mind the incest. I don't remember what it was called but that website makes it easy to search by pairings, and I think there are only a few on there.

** linkao3(charity, thou art a lie) and its sequels.

It is a female!Harry/voldemort. While tomarry is one of the most popular pairings there is, in this fic we are shown a much more realistic side of it. So, a too-young-innocent-girl/sadistic-obsessive-man-who-killed-her-parents. Brilliant work, really.
