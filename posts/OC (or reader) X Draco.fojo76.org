Looking for recommendations for a fic where the main pairing is OC (or reader) and Draco. I know there's loads out there but some aren't great and I'm looking for some that are actually okay. Preferably long but not picky. I really enjoyed The Mudblood (on Quotev and Wattpad by Kirsten). Thanks!


** Ok I have a couple to reccomend but this one is by far my favorite draco / oc fic for so many reasons. It's recently completed, really long, and well written.

However it is a sequel. The first book is James potter/OFC and my favorite fic of that type.

You don't need to read it in order to read the draco/ofc but it does help to an extent. (And it is an AMAZING and long fic)

Then the draco /ofc is based on the ofc being the daughter of the ofc from the first book.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy these :)

** Argh my comment didn't work so I apologize if this one posts twice.

My all time favorite draco/ofc series is sadly, unresolved. However I have re read it more than any other fanfiction and I'm usually picky about WIPs. They are well worth the read cuz they are so well written with a really good subplot, AND they are slow burn / there is some frustration cuz stupid teenagers are stubborn.
