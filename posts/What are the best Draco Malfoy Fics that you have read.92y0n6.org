** I really like The Code by Aduro - linkffn(2750775)

Kind of a silly premise, but all the same an enjoyable series.

** I liked the oath breaker series by Goblin Cat KC. I like their take on dark magic and pure blood society, magic's price and magic theory. Also Draco is still cowardly and an asshole but the story shows it in a way that's it's relatable why he is that way.

** First and foremost if we are talking Post Hogwarts Draco should either be in Azkaban or receive the Dementor's Kiss. If we are going to ignore that itsy bitsy detail.... Well then I've got a few fics for you.

linkffn(6432055) is the best of the bunch. Post Hogwarts.

Secondly the characterization of Draco in the Sacrifices Arc is very very well done. The first in the 2.6m word epic is linkffn(Saving Connor by Lightning on the Wave). The author is able to redeem/prevent Draco from falling into the Dark before year 4. The little dance that occurs with Lucius is also well done. Draco is not the MC but he is very prominent.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

**** Should I need to read something else before reading "Saving Connor"?

***** No sir. Saving Connor is the first in the series, just read them on through. After "Comes out of Darkness Morn" (Year 3) you should read the accompanying one-shot, Maze of Light however. I did not on my first read through and I regrettted it. These were written before DH so it does show its age but also had some truly unique ideas.

The Read Order is as follows:

/Saving Connor/

/No Mouth But Some Serpent's/

/Comes Out of Darkness Morn/

/Maze of Light/

/Freedom And Not Peace/

/Wind That Shakes The Seas and Stars/

/A Song In Time of Revolution/

/I Am Also Thy Brother/

This series doesn't show up around here too often (I'm basically the only one who recs it), but it truly is well done. I hope you enjoy the journey, you will not regret it.

****** Hey i have to object ! I also have recommended it a lot !

It has really fantastic world building though and manages to portray the close frienship between Harry and Draco quite nicely.
