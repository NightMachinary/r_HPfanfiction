This fic might not be for everyone, but I remember it being very British. Or at least, I had to look up a lot of slang words.

** I sincerely hope I'm writing in British English (Something is horribly wrong if I'm not). I also try to create quite a strong sense of place.

** I recommend users Snark64 and Bad Mum on FFN. They're both really good British writers with a wide range of fic genres.

** I'm from Dublin, so I think I write in British English. I just started a fic, although it envolves an OC who is from Ireland and uses Hiberno-English expressions. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12329179/1/The-Stirring]]
