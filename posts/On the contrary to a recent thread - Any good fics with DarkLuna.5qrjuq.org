I just saw a thread asking for Dark!Harry fics without Dark Luna.

On the flip side - any good fics out there with Dark!Luna and Dark!Luna paired with Harry?


** Not with Harry, but there's linkffn(Twelve Dark Moons by Sophiax) where Luna really gets under Voldemort's skin.

linkffn(HP and the Rejected Path by zArkham) would qualify, though both Harry and Luna are pushed to their darker instincts by the crapsack world around them.

Speaking of crapsack worlds... linkffn(HP and Merlin's Reaper by Clell65619) has a superHarry landing in an alt timeline where Luna is a seriously bad-arse revolutionary trying to topple the pureblood rule of a successful Tom Riddle. It's actually Harry/Susan (I think), though Luna gives Harry a roll in the hay just for that fleeting feeling of humanity that they were both wanting.

There was a psycho!Harry fic whose name escapes me, where he and Luna start off their joyful murder spree by doing in the Dursleys. I looked for PsychoHarry and Dark Luna but couldn't find the thing; good luck.

  As a captive of Lord Voldemort, Luna Lovegood never thought she would live beyond the first 24 hours. Saved at first by her quick wit, Luna learns the depth of human evil...and becomes the Dark Lord's greatest weakness. Eventually LVLL.

  Horrible, horrible DLP-inspired crackfic. Easily my worst work ever. Features Evil!Harry/Cannibal!Luna/Confused!Laurasia. Don't know who Laurasia is? Neither does anyone else. You will regret reading this as much as I regret writing it.
