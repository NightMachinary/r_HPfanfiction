I love it when Harry gets famous for all the things he did after coming to Hogwarts, like the Basilisk. I remember linkffn(A Dramatic Reading) being good, fics like that.


** linkffn(The Accidnetal Animagus) Harry gains fame in year two from displaying wandless magic and then killing the thousand-year old Basilisk.

And a bit similar to A Dramatic Reading: linkffn(Pensieve Films)

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.
