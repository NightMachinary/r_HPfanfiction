Looking for any really long Fred and George fanfics. Preferably ones that have romance in them. They could take place during school or after.


** Tightly Knit by KMbell92 centers on an OC, Fred, and George. Its really good, nearly 200 chapters long, and has a sequel and 2 companion series (that center on different characters). It's on wattpad.
