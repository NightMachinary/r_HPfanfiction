** Could it possible be /Bucket List/ by Sela McGrane? It features a Hermione that was sorted into Slytherin house, and a "bucket list" is generally a list of things that someone wants to do before they kick the bucket(die). I don't know if a literal bucket list is part of the plot though. I also haven't actually linked it here because I haven't read it, and I'm not sure if it's against the rules, as it's rated Mature /and/ apparently features Hermione falling in love with McGonagall. It also first published in 2018, and last updated February of last year.

*** I don't think so. I'm pretty sure that Hermione was cursed to die on her 26th birthday after going on a trip to break a curse somewhere. Thanks though! I appreciate the help.

**** On FFN, but given how inactive the staff is there, it could be against the rules and just not noticed by the staff.
