:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all, been rereading some stories lately and I can't seem to find a bookmark to a story and really want to reread it /can't remember the name to google it/ *its driving me crazy, please help!*\\
Its a Harry/Hermione story, decently long.\\
Very connected to hogwarts: heir/bonded?\\
Ginny is adopted by them to protect her. Molly's mind had a lock in her psychy with the name Ginny Potter. Ginny is Dumbles' daughter, by Molly, though rape. \\
Believe it also includes Mom and Dad Granger becoming magical? /might be mixing that up with a different fic though/ might also be the same story where Ginny is "sold" by the male Weasleys for the LeStrange Mannor but was actually adopted by Harry and Hermione

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

** I can't think of it right now but there was a story where Harry was in Hogwarts and was stripping the magic (from I think Voldemort) and was not keeping all of it. The excess magic was being thrown at the wall and the grangers were getting hit with it and that caused them to become magicals.

There is also a story that had the elves try to get help (or get Harry "future wives" from the grangers and lovegoods where the grangers were unconscious since the elves/others were there the aurors etc believed the grangers were magicals who were hidden and took them to St. Mungo's where they were only able to "restore" them to squibs.

I'll take some time to see if I can find those stories.
