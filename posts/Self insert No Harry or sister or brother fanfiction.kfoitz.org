Looking for self insert OC fanfiction that doesn't involve him being Harry sister brother overtaking Harry overtaking draco becoming Ron or hermione Pretty much what I want is a self insert or an OC and him exploring the visiting world not too much of a quartz pretty much there is this fanfic called the riddle coin something like that


** I mostly know fics with OCs more than of SIs. They still explore the world but it's not exactly what you asked for, hope you can still enjoy them. I also added my own fic, it fits pretty well with what you asked for, I hope you don't mind!

  "Now I have three heads: one for speech, one for sex, and one for second guessing." - Analicia Sotelo. 'South Texas Persephone'.Her door clicks open and nearly clips her in the face. It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)

** A new SI fic my friend and I are writing. One SI is Draco's older sister, the other SI is a Muggleborn. Still in the Hogwarts phase, so no exploring the world yet.

** linkffn(13041698) This has a SI as a Hufflepuff OC. The SI doesn't interact much with the canon plot and there's lot of emphasis on the whimsical feel of the books.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** Not quite SI, though I did base the main character's interests off mine. It's about an OC who finds herself in the middle of the Harry Potter universe after a near death experience with her dog. It will be updated frequently.

  What would you do if you were suddenly transported into a storybook world, one where you have all the answers? This is the decision Lorelei Smith has to make when she goes from certain death to being unceremoniously dumped in the world of Harry Potter. Try as she might, this new world doesn't feel quite real to her, and the temptation to play with fate is overwhelming. If this is a dream, then that makes her God, doesn't it? Despite her uncertain grasp on reality, real lives hang in the balance. One woman and her dog have the power to turn the world on its head... for good or for ill.
