I have read a lot of fics in which Sirius and Remus tell Harry how they raided the Hufflepuff girls room for their panties and Tonks or someone being, " That was you???"

Right now I'm reading a Marauders era fic in which the same raid happened.

Where the hell did it come from?

Is it canon? Or is it something just assumed Sirius must have done like fuck a lot of girls?


** It's a common prank done by guys in fiction. People just use it to show the prankster side of the Marauders.
