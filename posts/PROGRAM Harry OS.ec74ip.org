Hi there, I posted this because I would like to get a little more feedback than the usual FF reviews.

This fic was conceived as a "struggle between the man and the machine within" in which Harry struggles between the usefulness of having a machine like though process and the need to interact with other at a human level

I plan to make more than a one-shot out of it, but I only have the very rough, bare outline of what I want the story to be like, so any opinions, ideas, critiques and what not are welcome, but more than anything I would like to know what would you like to see in such a story

PS: I know that the timing of the present doesn't make sense becuase Harry wouldn't be going to school a 31 of July... I can only ask you to suspend your disbelief since I couldn't think of any other excuse for Harry to get, and actually treasure the book, when I get to continue the story I'll make up something better

** I think if you're looking to write a story like this, it might be enjoyable for you to read other works that discuss what it means to be human. /Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?/ is always a good one, as is /Ghost in the Shell/. Where is the line that separates man from machine? Can a machine be human and could a human become a machine? How would other people treat a machine that thinks it's human and how would that machine think and feel as a result?

*** Not for a while, I don't think I have the writing skill yet, I hope to write more of my other HP fic ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12908146/1/The-Sorcerer-Saga]] ) in 2020, as you may see the setting is a little more generic, I'm not really aiming to innovate with that one, just to see how well I can implement old cliches

** That is a curious story. There are a lot of ways for the reader to take it in.

- For some, it looks like a possible way for Harry to isolate his feelings which bring nothing but pain, and also to limit the personal impact from others' emotions which also only give pain. He would seem 'cold' to others, but whether he goes good/neutral/bad is up to how you write it.

- He could also get into things like Gamer crossover or other game-mechanics-verse stuff.

- Hmm, back in the 80's (I think) there were some published books with programers going to a fantasy world and using programming techniques to manage magic, often excelling at it in ways beyond the expectation or understanding (a thousand small spells rather than one big spell, from a simple input command) and so hard to match or defend against.

How did you intend the reader to take it? Was he just escaping from emotions with a sort of self-Imperius? Was his whole personality overridden, and the old Harry is just gone?

*** This would be more along the way of the first one, the idea is that Harry would always make machine-like decisions and that it would look pretty cool at the beginning when everything he does gives the best possible result, then he starts having to make sacrifices for the sake of "efficiency" and "results" and suddenly his actions seem inhumane and disturbing, as he struggles to interact with others and having to deal with the emotional fallout of his decisions, he starts to reject the "program" and starts acting more humane... Only to start failing at pretty much everything he does.

​

That's pretty much the outline of the fic as I've conceived it so far. It'll take quite a while before I make more out of it so... yeah.

​

Oh, and while I love Gamer fics, I don't intend to insert gamer elements here, I plan to make a gamer fic down the line though... Hopefully 2020 has enough time

**** Seems like it could be interesting.

Probably too loaded with triggers for me right now but that is not a bad thing - the more it affects the readers the better, generally.
