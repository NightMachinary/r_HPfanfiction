I've read bashing fics, dark!harry fics, independent!harry fics.. and a common theme I notice in these fics, is that, when Golden Trio break up, Ron and Hermione somehow still end up as a couple.

I was wondering if that would be the case all the time, especially say, in fics where Harry breaks up with Golden Trio in au!GOF or pre-GOF..

I personally have nothing against Ron and Hermione as a couple, I'm just wondering why they end up as a couple in every possible Universe.

I always felt like Harry was one common denominator for the friendship between Ron and Hermione.. In HBP and in PoZ, Harry plays the intermediator when these two fight.

I disagree. I would say that Ron is the glue of the trio. He spends more time with Harry or Hermione separately than the other two spend with each other.

Probably because it's easy and doesn't require a ton of background/foundation. Canon has done most of the heavy lifting.

Yup. Going purely by canon, if Ron isn't there Harry and Hermione aren't friends. When Ron and Hermione are at odds and Harry sits with her they're pretty quiet. Whereas he has lengthy conversations with Ron and, tbh, he's on Ron's side of things a lot.

This is something that irks the fuck out of me upon rereading canon. What was even the logic behind writing their friendship this way? I often think this was due in large part to Rowling trying so hard to show that Harry and Hermione aren't compatible romantically. But strip away the "look you idiots they're not into each other" meta-logic and it just becomes an exceedingly shittily-written friendship. And it becomes even worse when you consider that Hermione is supposed to be Harry's /closest friend/ after Ron, and they don't even /enjoy spending time/ with each other. Like, what the fuck, Jo.

Edit: Words are hard

Here's my hot take: the Trio's friendship began in PS, the most childishly/junior audience written book in the series, and in that context, Ron and Harry becoming friends with the annoying "know it all" Hermione didn't require development or nuance for us to believe "Yes, okay, they're friends now".

Just look at how it was written:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Why? How? Did they bond over the trauma or something? Did they apologize to each other for poor treatment before the troll incident? Who knows! It all happens offscreen, if it happened at all, because the plot moves on to something else.

And in the following books, the friendship has become the status quo so we're not meant to question how these people are friends in the first place, when PoA brings out the worst part of the Ron-Hermione friendship. But the main point is that their friendship was never organic, based on common interests, shared values and lifestyle, etc. It was based on a specific situation where kids were thrust into danger and forced to trust in each other's abilities. In an AU with no troll in the bathroom, Hermione and Ron would never have gotten along with each other or become friends.

Yes, you're certainly right about that, but that fails to explain why Ron and Hermione's friendship seems to improve exponentially while Harry and Hermione's doesn't. Sure, JK builds up Ron and Hermione's friendship in that bullshit, handwave-y way she's occasionally fond of ("Oh yes they're actually quite good friends. You never see it because for some reason they're always at each other's throats when Harry's around, but I /swear/ they're actually quite tender and lovely with each other when Harry has the presence of mind to fuck off" - J.K. Rowling, probably) but we're still expected to believe that Ron and Hermione genuinely enjoy spending time together on their own.

Conversely, Rowling goes out of her way over and over again to show how much Harry and Hermione don't enjoy spending time with each other and the only reason I can think of for her doing that is because she didn't want people to ship them. I don't think I have to explain why this is an asinine way to write a friendship. Who gives a shit if ten people on the internet want them to do anal or whatever? People will ship what they ship: whether it be Harry/Hermione or Harry/Giant Squid, it isn't something you can control as a writer. Just give us a half-decent friendship. It's legitimately /unbelievable/ that saying Harry and Hermione aren't very good friends is actually a somewhat uncontroversial statement with canon backing.

***** Ya honestly like If you think about it the reason Ron leaving in book 7 and the fight he has with Harry in book 4 stands out so much is because Harry misses him so much and is so affected by his absence.

In comparison he has alot of fights with Hermione, more often after Ron has a fight with her and then Harry either sides with him or says something else that also pisses Hermione off and is barely phased

***** Yes, I also believe the almost forced Canonic, Romantic relationship between Ron and Hermione, simply by making other pairings with Hermione ineffective, has made Dramione and Harmony, popular (Fans showing these two have far more compatibility than Ron)

******* True, I meant that Fanfiction writers exploit the fact that Ron and Hermione don't make a great couple, (there's a long debate about it right? with Pottermore and JKR talking about the potential of Harry and Hermione as a couple) hence use that as a reason for pairing Hermione with others.

*** Do you read Dark!Indy!Harry canon divergence fics?

In those fics, it's common for Harry to go his own way, while Ron and Hermione beg him to come back and listen to Dumbles, because Dumbledore knows best. A usual setup is for Harry and Dudley to get Dementor'd in the summer before Y5, and when Harry gets to Grimmauld, he doesn't forgive Ron and Hermione for ignoring all his letters.

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.

***** I've read this fic! This fic is the first fic I've read that has a potential falling out between Ron and Hermione.. while most other fics tend to pair them up. Some authors like Lomonaeren also consistently write a better Ron characterization and redeems him, while doing a light bashing of Hermione (which was refreshing as I was tired of Weasley Bashing)

It's meh writing, I agree, I didn't finish reading it.

********** Which is perfectly fine. To be honest, I don't enjoy romance in fics. If a fic does something original, I'll read it through. It's the reason I've read all of Robst's fics, despite not liking Hermione as a character or helpful goblins.

Glad to help though. I prefer fics where the trio are still friends, but not as close. But them breaking apart completely is a 50/50 thing for me. On one hand outcasts do band together. On the other hand, they do have little in common.
