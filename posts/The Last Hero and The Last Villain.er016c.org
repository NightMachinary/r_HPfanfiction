So, there's a book by Terry Pratchett called The Last Hero, where a team of ancient Conan-types get together for a final quest, because they're all geriatric and in need of adult diapers. Basically, imagine Lord of the Rings if the fellowship were all escapees from a nursing home for retired heroes.

One of the characters is called Harry Dread, an evil (budget-)Overlord who follows the Code. Think the sensible Evil Overlord List and reverse every entry. He's essentially a bad movie villain because he sees it as honourable and traditional to do things like leave the Hero in a slowly-activating trap to die rather than just shooting him in the head.

I'd like to see a fic where Harry and Draco (or some other HP villain) have been fighting one another the traditional way for a hundred years until the upstart newbies come along and play dirty, then the two old enemies have to bond together to take them on. Essentially traditional hero-villain tropes vs a sensible villain who does things broadly along the lines of the Evil Overlord List.

Either that or just a fic that generally captures that 'traditional villainy' kind of tone/dynamic.
