What an odd mix of authors. Robst and Columbrina have niche appeal (if you can call HHr 'niche'). WhiteSquirrel and jbern are popular, but far from the best the fandom has to offer. And I had to google LeadVonE -- he's only written DPSW, which isn't /that/ popular, surely? I only know it bc [[/u/samsungfutanari69]] promotes it in every second request thread :p

*** Robst and columbrina and jbern are some of the most reviewed authors there. I'm guessing they got whitesquirrel from my favourites list, and I've mentioned in my story that I've read Leadvone's story before, so maybe they got him from there. Honestly, I can make no claim to understand the minds of these scammers. All I want is to be rid of them somehow without closing my PMs entirely.
