Across the time was a fanfiction I loved very much i read it In 2018 or 19 I think I wanted to read it again but I couldn't find it any where any one know why it was deleted will it be re posted again any time soon and if you don't mind recommended any harry/fluer or harry/daphane fanfic


** It was deleted because reviewers were being dicks to them, apparently. There's a possibility of it being reposted when Izwan has reworked the whole thing, but that'll probably take a while.

I have an epub with 55 chapters here.

**** You're welcome.

And it definitely was. But, it wasn't the first story to be deleted due to dickish reviewers and it certainly won't be the last. Unfortunate curse of internet fandom.

***** When browsing through the comments I couldn't find any such reviews though. Maybe they came later on? Or maybe it was just a writer's block? At the end of the day it doesn't matter since it's the author's right to remove their own story. There should be no shame in not wanting to continue a story or having a prolonged writer's block. I mean, does anyone even take the "lost my hard drive" excuse seriously?

It was a good story though, despite its grammatical flaws.

****** /shrugs/

No idea, then. That's what they cited in the last AN update though. Maybe they were curating reviews and just deleted the dickish ones. You're right though, it doesn't really matter either way - author's prerogative to do whatever they wish with their story. :)

And I do take it seriously, personally - I've had those kind of apocalyptically bad technical issues before. Though the worst of the last big one of those I had was losing my uni essays. I don't think I've ever had to rewrite so fast in my life. :)

******* Jesus. That sucks. Closest comparison I had was accidentally closing my 60 chrome tabs with all sources for my paper.

******** Yep. Wasn't a fun time, though managing to get it all redone by the deadline was such a satisfying ego boost. :)

And oooof. Even the thought of that hurts me in my soul. I at least still had my bookmarked resources once I'd re-synced my profile to the repaired computer. I can't imagine how hard it'd've been to refind them or rewrite without any of them at all.

** I didn't leave a review, but if I remember correctly, it had an interesting premise. It was an utter shambles, grammar wise, though.
