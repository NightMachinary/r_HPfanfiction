** You said you have looked at Lorien829's stories, but my favorite angsty "hurt Hermione" fic has to be "Shadow Walker." (Partially posted on ff.net, but the full version was published years ago on Portkey, now on the archive [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8127][here]].) I'm normally not so into AU, but having read "Shadow Walks" (which is main universe), the scenes dealing with the broken AU Hermione in that fic were some of the most heartbreaking I've read. And then Lorien829 created an entire fic about that AU Hermione (i.e., "Shadow Walker"). "Bridges" is definitely worthwhile too.

Besides that, you might look at: [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7460][Love Lost. Love Found]] by HarrysMistress. Ron and Ginny die in an accident in the first chapter (so not much of a spoiler), but their memories are profoundly respected. Starts out as a long hurt/comfort for both H/Hr after their families are destroyed. Angst gradually lessens as the story goes forward.

And then there are the angsty fics of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1136781/B-B-Ruth][B.B. Ruth]]. I have mixed feelings about these personally, but a lot of people seem to like them, particularly "Cardinal Curses" and "Purple Potion." Perhaps the angstiest of all is "The Keeper" (or at least the plot contrivance that drives that whole story comes about through an incredibly angsty development). In all of these stories, Hermione gets some serious emotional hurt, but she's also always portrayed as less self-assertive than I generally think of her character.

Finally, an old fic I came upon somewhat recently is [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/3845][Better Late than Never]] by cheering charm. This was written before HBP, but takes place 20 years later and seems like a post-epilogue fic (even though it was written years before the DH epilogue). Not that angsty, but Hermione is definitely dealing with the aftermath of emotional trauma. Technically not complete, but the last published chapter kind of bookends things and leaves the plot in a reasonably satisfactory concluding place.

**** To be clear about the Hermione characterization thing: in the B.B. Ruth stories, she's always a bit of a mish-mash. She's always a very strong woman, but seems to sometimes bend too quickly (particularly in emotional decisions that ultimately produce angst) when convenient for the plot. It's been a while since I've read these, but "Cardinal Curses" seemed the best of the lot as I recall, where she has some decidedly badass elements even as she's dealing with something really difficult emotionally.
