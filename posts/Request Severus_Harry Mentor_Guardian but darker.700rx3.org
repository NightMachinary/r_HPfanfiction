Looking for any stories where Severus is Harry's mentor or ends up taking care of him, but he is very resentful and it takes a super long time for him to come around to Harry, more so then it would in most stories. Any rating is fine.


** Well, I know AWESOME fanfic and I would have translated it if I had time.

Problem is [[http://fanfics.me/read.php?id=42964][it's russian]]. But try reading it with Google Translator.

*** Thank you for the recommendation! I'm reading it right now and it's very good! Also a nice way to improve my neglected russian reading skills, haha. Do you happen to have any other russian fic recommendations? I would love to explore more stories like this.

**** You've just opened Pandora's Box. Btw, this series I recommended has 3 fics. The last one was finished this summer so I'm looking forward to seeing the next one.

- [[http://fanfics.me/fic41375][Being Severus Snape]]. Awesomeawesomeawesome. All books from Snape's point of view. Author said it would be AU in the end. It's now a bit after the 2nd task of GoF. It updates from time to time.

#+begin_quote
  The events of the saga of the adventures of Harry Potter through the eyes of the most tragic and contradictory character - Severus T. Snape (...) A great deal of emphasis will be placed on Severus' true attitude toward Harry. Significant impact on the author had "The Big Game of Albus Dumbledore".
#+end_quote

- [[http://fanfics.me/fic1474][Team]]. Powerful!Harry. I often reread it. Some can call it overpowered, MC or anything else but I like it. Great emotions, great plot and plot twists. Includes sevvitus.

#+begin_quote
  After the resurrection, Voldemort's plans endlessly go to hell, and the mysterious Team is to blame for this, the existence of which no one suspects, including Dumbledore. But Snape was very lucky if you consider "luck" the next life debt because of Potter.
#+end_quote

- [[http://fanfics.me/fic475][One day it will cripple under us...]] (I'm not sure if it's correct translation. "It" means "the world"). Azkaban!Harry. Powerful!Harry. Slytherin!Harry. Timetravel. Harry has spent ten years in the Azkaban and is sent to the past by mystical forces. The fic has a small sequel and a big sequel. The latter's Harry is sent to the parallel world... I couldn't bring myself to read it, actually. It's enough to read the main fic imho.

- [[http://fanfics.me/fic43659][Fall for two]]. Full rewrite of books. Slytherin!Harry. The series has 5 fics now. It still updates. To be honest I haven't read it but I've heard it's very good. Try it.

#+begin_quote
  A few years before his arrival at Hogwarts, Harry Potter is getting to know the neighbor's boy, by chance, who turned out to be a magician. The story of two friends who vowed never to betray or toss each other. The canon is completely redone under changed circumstances, beginning with the first year at Hogwarts. - summary for series

  Two rejected children, two fates, two mutilated souls, two dreams of a fairy tale and one prophecy for two. - summary for the first fic

I'll dig more though my favourites a bit later. Good luck with reading it and I would enjoy your comments. :)

***** Ohh, nice! Thank you, I will be sure to check those out! Although it may take me a while since I should probably finish the one you linked first. I have to say that Snape is definitely quite a bastard in this fic, holy crap is he cold. Using crucio on a 10 year old? That's crazy.

****** It's going to be better... near the end of the 3rd fic :D (though that part in the 3rd year was so messed up that I had to read it twice to understand something).

** I would suggest In Blood Only linkffn(In Blood Only). It is Severitus but with a very slow progress in Harrys and Snapes relationship. Written before HBP.

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]

** One very angsty story where he ends up being his bio dad is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1807847/1/Prometheus-Bound][Prometheus Bound]]. I thought the story was only okay so your mileage may vary. Another story that I remember was angsty was [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=908&textsize=0&chapter=1][Antiquity's Corollary]] where he is also his bio dad.

I know you said guardian but I mostly read Dad!Snape so maybe you can have these on backup or something. :)

  AU after OoTP, a few HBP details. An obsessed, grieving Harry has decided on a dangerous way to defeat Voldemort. Snape is paying closer attention than before, but his contempt for Harry blinds him. Eventual Snape as Harry's guardian story. COMPLETE
