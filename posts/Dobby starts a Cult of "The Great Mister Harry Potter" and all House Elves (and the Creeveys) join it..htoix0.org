Dobby is amazed that the Great Mister Harry Potter was not only able to stop his bad former Master's Master, but also free him AND stop his Bad Former Master from an evil plot, AND kill a Basilisk, which all Wizarding Creatures that aren't Nundu or Dragons are afraid of. Dobby decides to spread the word of the Great Mister Harry Potter, and it becomes a full-on cult, when all the House Elves, the Creeveys, and possibly Luna join.


** If this is all humor I'd love to see Severus Snape initiated. Like he sarcastically tells one of the Creevey's that “oh yes, the sun shines from Mr. Potter's bum, doesn't it?” And they actually take him seriously. They don't accept any of his refusals to join the cult and enlist a few house elves to ensure Snape is on time to meetings. The biggest compliment they get is “I'd rather be suffering a Crucio from the Dark Lord right now” which they accept happily because if /they're/ worse than Voldemort than surely Harry Potter is going to defeat him with absolutely no trouble!

** My attempt at this is a Harry Potter crossover with the Legion Of Superheroes.

After Harry disappeared into the future, Dobby went a little nuts and wrote a book:

*/[1:1] in the beginning there was the work,/*

*/[1:2] the wizards were slovenly and without discipline./* */Their houses were disheveled and filth covered the floors and walls of the magical homes./*

*/[1:3] the elves came to work, to cook the meals, to clean the houses, to repair all the things that wizards broke in their haste and brutality./*

*/[1:4] But the elves were not appreciated by the wizards, and yes, they were punished for mistakes real and imagined./*

*/[1:5] Then Mr. Harry Potter, Sir said unto Dobby, "Sit down and let us speak"; and Mr. Harry Potter, Sir saw the Elves as equals./*

*/[1:6] And Dobby saw Mr. Harry Potter, Sir to be a great and powerful wizard, who stood against the bad masters in defense of elves and wizards alike./*

*/[1:7] So Mr. Harry Potter, Sir freed Dobby from his bad master and called Dobby his friend./* */No wizard had called an elf friend before./* */This was a new thing that Mr. Harry Potter, Sir had done./*

*/[1:8] And so, Dobby was a free elf, but he bound himself to Mr. Harry Potter, Sir, in secret so that he might serve a great wizard who was also his friend./*

*/[1:9] And Mr. Harry Potter, Sir said, "Dobby, do not punish yourself. If you learn that you are wrong, learn from the wrongness to understand that which is right. Let that which is right guide you through life and I think I'm going to make a sandwich, would you like one?" And it was so./*

*/[1:10] Mr. Harry Potter, Sir called the Hoggywarts Castle home, the Wizards silly, and the Elves, friends, and the Acromantula scary buggers. And Mr. Harry Potter, Sir saw that it was good./*

*/[1:11] After the great battle where Mr. Harry Potter, Sir destroyed the evil Lich Lord, Mr. Harry Potter, Sir said, "Dobby, I have to go away for a while./* */Take care of yourself, Dobby, and if you can, watch out for the Weasleys, the Castle, and She Who Knits, for despite her fiendish plan, she means well./* */When I get back we'll see what we can do to make life better for all the Elves." And it was so./*

#+begin_quote
  In the 31st Century, Mordru has won. The United Planets is in collapse, EarthGov destroyed, and the Legion decimated and scattered. The Surviving Legionaries decide their only feasible way of fighting back would be to recruit a legendary Magic User. After much debate, they settle on Harry Potter... who turns out to be a bit different than his legend would suggest.

When they notice him and start to chase him, he runs out of the Room in panic. The story ends with Sirius saying, "Now, /that's/ how to prank somebody with this room" or words to that effect.

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?
