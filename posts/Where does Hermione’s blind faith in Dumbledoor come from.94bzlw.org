I'm currently reading [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/7/][Renegade Cause]] and this author's Hermione has complete blind faith in Dumbledoor (at least up until chapter 7 where I am). It's to the point that it's starting to drive me nuts. Hermione is muggle born. She wasn't raised with parents who would bow at the alter of Dumbledoor. Why does she? I know she had a bit of a thing for authority figures, but this fic is set after the tri wiz where a lot of them have let them down. Wouldn't she have developed a bit of skepticism towards them by that time?


** I love Renegade Cause and am glad you are reading it; it is well worth it. The authors characterization of Hermione isn't great by any means, although he doesn't bash he does overemphasize that "flaw" of her.

Although I will note this, Hermione's sorting into Gryffindor is heavily influenced by her respect of Dumbledore. Just the fact that Dumbledore was in Gryffindor made her want to be sorted there, which speaks volumes about how she perceives him.

Aside: After you complete it, you should read the accompanying one shot /Speak Softy, Love/ it gives incredible depth to Antonin Dolohov.

** In DH, Hermione voiced great faith in Dumbledore several times.

** I bet it is a combination of:

- her parents making her strive for excellence (pushing but also supporting her)

- her looking for a role model

- her intelligence (no: She's not a genius, but she is pretty smart)

- her natural inclination to follow authority figures (call back to her parents!), augmented by the fact that (unlike Harry) she was never truly treated badly by figures in positions of authority (more than likely her teachers protected her from mocking and bullying that the intelligent get in primary school!)

- bullying (Hermione is more like a mini-adult than a true child/teenager! Hell, she behaves like Harry and Ron's mum (or older sister) from time to time! She bosses them around, doesn't let them keep secrets (as if it is her right to know everything - something many parents also do!), makes them learn, makes sure they eat etc. etc.)

- Dumbledore embodying a lot of the things she strives for: He's an excellent wizard, he's politically powerful (he can change things!), he's a great academic etc.

** Fanon. Hermione's supposed worship of Dumbledore, as well as her supposedly worshipping authority or believing everything she reads comes from fanon.
