So I've read a lot of Mentor!Snape fanfics but it seems like a lot of them move too quickly to the point where Snape and Harry care for each other. Recently I read O Mine Enemy as well as Crime and Punishment and I absolutely love the gradual move from hatred and the mutual understanding that begins to open up between the two characters. Was wondering if anyone else knew fics along the same vein. I usually like fics with an older Harry because there is a lot more bad blood between the two to work past.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: by older I mean 5th-7th year but not post war

**** Please do! Be warned though, this is a lengthy trilogy clocking in at over 1 mil words. But its character development, worldbuilding and power scaling is a treat. Probably one of the stories with the most believable growth of power (unique as well). Second and third book delve into auror training and I love the system it sets up for it. Dating instead of having a OTP is a nice change (and well done too)

**** Maybe I've just become hypersensitive from all the godawful bashing fics I've read, but I dropped it after the first paragraph mentions how he cant trust Ron after the GoF thing. I've never once seen a good fic that has bashing in it. If someone who has read it can tell me that theres literally no bashing whatsoever, I'll continue but the literal first paragraph sets off red flags for me.

***** I wouldn't continue then if I were you. I picked it up again to see why I didn't remember anything other than the beginning and pretty much the moment Harry and Snape come to an understanding the fic seems to be more about bashing most of the characters. It also seems to think that sarcasm is an exclusively Slytherin trait that cannot be utilized by anyone else. A shame because I really liked the start

** Reboot linkffn(9552519)

â€‹

It's a Reptilla28 challenge time travel fic of directly after the war Harry/Hermione/Snape going back. Snape goes back further, so he has the whole "get along with the marauders" thing to deal with. And then when Harry/Hermione "wake up", they have past memories of Snape and memories of snape from the current timeline before they "woke up". It was pretty conflicting for a chapter. And I'm pretty sure it's brought up every once in a while.

When Snape first held toddler Hermione, the way it described the scene made it look like a cross between first time holding a child, deer in the headlights, and 'oh god, occlumency sheilds hide the sneer!'.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Pre Cursed Child & Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
