Hi!

I'm looking for some good recs for Hermione/Snape fics. I'm wanting a Hermione post-Hogwarts. What are your favorites?

Please, no Pet Project.

Thanks!

** I've always enjoyed linkffn(Sin & Vice) by mak5258. linkffn(For Hogwarts: A Regency Gamble) is one I've reread several times, and linkao3(Of Myth and Magic by Wonkington) has some great thriller elements.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

  After the war, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is in a financial bind. Special Ministry worker Hermione Granger is on site with a team of helpers, full of fundraising ideas, and it seems that Headmaster Snape objects to her very presence there

  She knew it wasn't good for her, standing here like this, waiting for something that wasn't there to appear. Something spectacular to happen between misnumbered houses. Something to prove that magic was real. Eventual SS/HG. AU with purpose.

  "Bored by unchallenging classes? Sick of sitting around, doing nothing grand? Eager to learn forgotten magics and gain power beyond your wildest dreams? Join the Young Adventurer's Club now!" A mysterious poster for a new club catches Severus' eye. Little does he know... What the club has planned will challenge everything he knows and change the course of his entire life.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1633060/coffeeonthepatio][coffeeonthepatio]] has a number of good stories. From the Corner (and extra one shots), Acquittal, and Be Little are three of my favorites from her. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8455295/1/An-Unwritten-Future][An Unwritten Future]] by Aurette is another that I enjoyed quite a bit. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5490903/1/The-Princess-of-Gryffindor][The Princess of Gryffindor]] is another by Aurette that was a good read - and Victorious Voldy something I tend to avoid like the plague. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7454117/1/Just-to-Be][Just to Be]] is another great story, and one that I've not seen done before. I was very impressed with both the writing and the story line. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11333405/1/Useful-No-More][Useful No More]] by Kallanit is a longer one-shot... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8788107/1/Another-Dream][Another Dream]] by Dragoon811 is one of my favorites.

Happy reading and I have more if you want them...
