:END:
So from what i remember, he found his magic (I think it was referenced as green), and started using it to manipulate his clothing and stuff to get better clothes, however whenever he used the magic to manipulate it, it "purifies" it to its natural state without dyes, so he goes thrift shopping with Petunia, buying random "Rejects" of stuff, for materials, and he strips stuff to their raw materials, to fix stuff around the house.

Later in the Story, he works with the Goblins, to create a diamond or some precious stones with more sides than the goblins thought possible, because he had something like mage sight.
