I have just written a fanfic on the day when Remus was bitten by Greyback...I know you lot could find such types of fanfics anywhere but just an attempt (P.S this is my first time on Reddit and this is also my first fanfic...) Hope you guys have fun...:) {I'm 13 pardon mistakes}

A little boy, no more than four, lied on a pale white mattress in the dead of night, his eyes half-closed, thinking about the stories his father told him about the magical creatures found in Norway and parts Sweden that fascinated him. He pondered deeply about the fact that there were both trolls and elves found in those regions...all of a sudden, he was tied by his ankles and wrist around a rough dry bark of a tree with no light except for a ray of moonlight glimmering through the branches, hitting his eyes directly... from the corner of his eyes, he could see two white and cold eyes gazing at him hungrily...Out of his wits, he tried to untie himself but in vain..the creature had caught hold of him and was dragging him through the woods...he yelled for help as the cold wind made every nerve in him shiver...the next thing he knew, he was lying on his mother's lap covered in blankets, still trembling. His father stood beside him..."Nightmare?" He could not speak but responded with a quick "uh..huh..". "Listen kiddo, no one's gonna harm you as long as we're here" regaining his strength he said "yeah..." "Now go to sleep and no more nightmares right?" "Right!"

Lyall comes home after a long day of work to find his little four year old amusing himself with the Bertie Botts every flavoured beans bought by Hope. "Hey dad!" "Hi Rem". Lyall sits on the comfy sofa. "/Accio daily prophet!/" Hope comes and takes Remus in her laps."Looking concerned huh! What's the matter?" "Nothing much dear, just got laughed at for my logic about Greyback." Hope sighs "Oh you never mind them"....just then Remus pops in out of nowhere "Who's Greyback?" Lyall lifts him off his feet and makes him giggle by tickling him"Greyback is a big monster who will take all your B.B.E.F.beans away from you if you don't head straight to bed right now."

The Full Moon- Lyall sits on a chair along the balcony, gazing at the moon recalling the incidents at the hearing of Greyback. He suppressed the horrible images of children as the victims of Greyback...suddenly he hears low growling and deep breathing behind the curtains..he grabs his wand and walks straight towards the door...his heart pounding and hands sweating with each step. His heart stops and the guts drop inside him as he sees Fenrir Greyback and his mates fully transformed lurking in front of Remus' room waiting to attack as soon as Hope gets out of the room. Without a second thought, he sent three powerful stunning spells zooming across the yard hitting Greyback right in the chest and the others fled on seeing their leader cringed onto the wall. Out of his anger and terror, he marches right across the yard sending a body binding hex towards Greyback...he gets paralyzed...Hope, breathing heavily comes out of the house with Remus. Both of them get terrified to see the dark figure of Greyback in the corner. Lyall, out of his breath, flings himself over Hope and Remus. He whispers to Remus "No one /can/ harm you as long as we're here!"
