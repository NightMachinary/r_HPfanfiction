Are there any good fanfics about the Dueling Club starting back up, with proper management? Preferably something that focuses on higher years, with more creative use of magic and fun, drawn-out duels.


** Not sure about dueling club, but the most creative and descriptive combat i've read was in 'the lie i've lived.' Always looking for stories that have combat written like that. Specifically the use of shortened words and vernacular makes the world much more realistic.
