I've heard lots of opinions about this series but I'm pretty reluctant to start reading it. What are your thoughts on it for those who have read it?


** People might disagree with my advice here, but it has a great first chapter that gives you a sense of the author's writing style. My advice is that if you finish Chapter One and don't like it, Alexandra Quick isn't for you. If you like it, then keep reading.

*** That goes true for a lot of books. I'll often read the first few pages of a book in a bookstore if the blurb on the back catches me. If I don't want to keep reading, back on the shelf it goes.

** I personally really enjoyed it when I read it--- hands down, it's the best American WW I've ever seen, and it's an original and refreshing story with a great cast of OC's. That being said, Alexandra herself is... polarizing.

** I'm more loyal to AQ America than anything JKR has said about the â€˜canon' America
