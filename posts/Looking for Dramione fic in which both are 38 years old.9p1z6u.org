Someone linked me that fic a while ago on reddit and I can't find it anymore. Massive fic, like 200k words. Hosted on HP.net. Had been first posted in like 2005 and still had received an update in 2017 (I hope there is another now). Both Draco and Hermione are around 40, married and with children. Hermione is unhappy in her marriage to Ron. In the beginning she meets Draco and they become coworkers.


** Got anymore details? There are quite a few fics that are like this

*** Oh, I wasn't aware. Thanks for asking. It was the only one I ever came across like this and I thought it being updated over a decade was definitely a stand-out feature. Anyway... Ron has a Quidditch player career. Hermione discovers he cheated on her with a much younger teammate and has a daughter on the side. All their children knew about it but Hermione was oblivious. Ginny is in a relationship with a Slytherin girl (I think Pansy?) and Hermione and Draco are the only ones that accept that relationship.
