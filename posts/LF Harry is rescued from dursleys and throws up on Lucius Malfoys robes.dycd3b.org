For some reason Lucius or Snape I cant remember shows up the dursleys house just in time for Harry to vomit all over the front of robes or shoes. That's all I can remember and I didn't bookmark it.


** I believe you're thinking of "Hit the Ground Running" by Tozette (Harry vomits on Lucius's boots). It's been taken offline, but I have it downloaded, so PM me if you'd like a copy.
