Did they just leave him there or did they bury him somewhere?


** I'd say Harry haggled for it to be buried with some amount of respect. Probably on Hogwarts grounds since apperently he was one of the bravest headmasters Hogwarts ever had?

I can't imagine Harry just left it there since he literally watched Snape die and named his kid after him. I'd say he made some memorial...

**** Eh..at Harry's insistence, I'm sure they would have allowed it. Can't say no to the Saviour of the wizarding world after all. Harry says Hogwarts is the only home Snape has ever known, so it would make the most sense for him to be buried there.

***** Yeah lets bury the biggest Bully of students Hogwarts has ever known on Hogwarts ground is something canon Harry would do. Snape doesnt deserved to be buried their.

The only thing they got right about cursed child is Harry being a shit father, the moment he names his kid after Snape and Dumbledore it was guaranteed. I can definitely see Albus Sevurus wanting to kill his father.

****** Not really interested in another Snape morality debate. Just answering OP's question on where he was likely to be buried.

******* That is exactly what I said if you read. Snape being buried on Hogwarts is what canon Harry would do even when he doesn't deserve to be buried their.

** I think Snape would've wanted to be cremated and had his ashes spread. He just doesn't strike me as a person who would've wanted a memorial/gravestone, and I also don't think too many people besides Harry would've wanted to build either of those things for him, anyways.

** The fact that we don't know is actually used a lot in postwar fics with alive!Snape, basically explaining that nobody saw his body after the Trio, because he apparently decided to disappear and heal in solitude.

Personally, my headcanon is that Harry went back and badgered everyone into giving him a proper burial, and everyone just went along with it because he is Harry Potter, and nobody would dare to disagree with him on a major point like this after the war. Keep in mind, this is the person who decided it was a great idea to name a son after him. Personally while I can see why Harry does a 180 on his opinion on Snape, I think he went way too far in the other direction.

I have no headcanon on where he was buried, but I've seen 3 common locations. The park where he met Lily (fair enough, I can actually see this happen), Hogwarts grounds (implausible IMO) or Godric's Hollow next to Lily (why? They didn't part on great terms...).

** I find it unlikely any of the bodies would've just "been left there". Be it proper burial, mass cremation, mass tombs, sticking the bodies in random and unmarked spots...Something would be done. Snape would probably warrant a proper, if perhaps modest, ceremony just as any other of the "good guys".
