** !linkffn(Warning Signs Read Desolation)

This one diverges from canon at the end of PS, and features a very well-written Mentor!Voldemort/student!Harry relationship. It's abandoned, but still worth a read in my opinion

  Trying to protect the Philosopher's Stone, Harry is kidnapped by Voldemort, who uses Legilimency on him and learns that he is a Horcrux. After that, Harry is forced to learn how to survive the violent and surreal reality of Voldemort's everyday life, and try his best to make it back to Hogwarts in one piece. Simultaneously, a war looms on the horizon. Grey!Harry Sane!Voldemort
