** I like settings like these, where usually the main character is the One Who Doesn't Have Any Magic. (But Secretly Does!) Like in My Hero Academia. Or Irregular at Magic High School.

Seriously, though, in a HP sense here's how I would build it - everyone has magic, but most people have very little. Like, enough to light a light bulb usually but that's it. Do little household charms. Some people have more, and the very rare are Hogwarts-student-level. So there would be tiered power stages. And measuring magical power would be a big deal, regularly done, government keeps records. Trying to falsify would get you jail time. And going to Hogwarts or other national equivalents would be huge, huge deals. Like guaranteed high-level employment for the rest of your life, etc. More than Ivy League/Oxford/Cambridge equivalents.

Purebloods would seek to keep their bloodlines pure by only having children with other 'wizards'; so it wouldn't matter who the parents were, just the proven power levels. It would be funny if pureblood children are not guaranteed to be high level, or power doesn't breed true though.

I could see Hermione in this setting becoming very arrogant since she's seen as a genius. I would actually like to write Ron being this laid-back, chess-loving bro - like, his power would be above 80% of the world population as are his SIX SIBLINGS, all Hogwarts students, so the Weasleys aren't poor (because the government subsidizes high-powered children) so he has no inferiority complex and also no drive to be super competitive since he knows what he wants and is already guaranteed it. (A spot on the Chudley Cannons, because most Quidditch players aren't Hogwarts-level anymore).

And of course Harry would be a very rare highest-power-tier individual. The Dursleys would be lowest-tier, and so jealous, but Harry would have been removed from their care as soon as he was tested and the government started getting very interested in his well-being. Or, the blood-wards still exist and are an issue, but the Dursleys are kept around as living batteries for the wards and barely interact with Harry, who is raised by very carefully picked individuals.

*** Typical shounen.

Neat! I would definitely read but there should be an overarching story with Voldemort being the one pulling the strings for the government.

And the reason the world has magic is because Dumbledore Vs Grindelwald was so powerful it enjoyed magical shockwaves changing each persons DNA or something.

So this one would be between Harry and Ron where they start out as friends and at the end they have opposing goals but fight for the same cause and the final battle is personal between them Naruto and Saskue style.

  Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom, the Boys-Who-Lived. Harry grew up abused and hated until age 7. Neville grew up happy and loved. Watch as the reincarnations of the first lords of magic become the last ones. WARNING: child abuse, neglect, and endangerment. Harry x Harem Neville x Harem! Eventual god-like Harry and Neville. This is my first fic. Criticism welcome, but no flames!

**** Definitely. Or being the shadowy Great Danger who everyone in the government is afraid of, but it turns out Tom Riddle, the Minister of Magic, is actually Lord Voldemort or something.

But if the world has only had magic be universal since WW2, that would be something! The cultural upheaval would still be immense.

****** I had the sudden thought that if in fact power does not breed true, it would mean the world is very different. It would be hard to keep up dynasties and family fortunes if every generation, the roster of the most powerful shifts abruptly. If you're an Archmage or whatever and rule the world, but your kids have very little magical power, and you KNOW that it's unlikely your kids inherit your power, and that someone else is going to rise up and be as powerful as you are, it'd be very cutthroat I think.

*** A cool idea. You could also make it more dystopian. Have a large class divide between the powerful and the nots. Corruptions within the higher ranks. People like Harry are allow to basically get away with all sorts of stuff due to their advantage

Kind of like the Bartimaeus Series

You could even make it darker. Those with strong magic are forced to fight wars or work within the government. Force marriage to encourage more powerful children. Unfair laws to discourage those with weak magic from having children or marrying powerful Wizards

It would also be interesting to see the same setting but with a more canon view of the magic system. Basically magical strength is based on your knowledge and intelligence

Imagine if getting a PhD in magic means you're on a list because you're basically a walking weapon of mass destruction

Imagine governments spearheading magical research to outdo other governments. Searching of prodigies to train them and have them be loyal to the government

Magical knowledge being hoarded and carefully monitored, etc

Maybe the conspiracy being that electric is just the ministries way of suppressing certain groups magical capabilities or something.

It's no longer possible for it to be canon after the appearance of Obscurus, but I found it interesting all the same.

** It might depend on how magic works. Is it like chakra in Naruto, where it's produced inside the user, and has a finite supply? Or is it like the Force in Star Wars, where it's everywhere and a few can sense it, sort of like infrared radiation, which is omnipresent but we humans are blind to it?

I can see this working in either case. If the former, then you might need a sufficient surplus to use it, or a specific means to project it outward, like a radio without a transmitter. If the latter, then maybe only a a few can sense magic and thus have the potential to tap into it.

No, but seriously, Earth 'magic' and the worship of Gaia or the Earth Mother was the most prevalent belief system at one time and women were holders of 'hearth and home'.
