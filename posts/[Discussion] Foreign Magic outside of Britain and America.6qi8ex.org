I always have to wonder if there are spells and such outside of the ones used in the canon of HP. Latin only became widely used after the rise of the Roman Empire, and even then Greek was still used as writing of choice for many civilizations under Rome.

It stands to reason that older cultures, and those insulated from outside influence, would have had different spells, and as it has been stated on Pottermore, likely some that used no focus, such as a wand, to be performed. I assume some cultures might have alternatives to Wanda, though the wand became the defacto focus of choice in the last few centuries as magic needed to be concealed from the public more and more. Carrying around a staff or some bizarre fetish would be quite odd to muggles.

So which countries do you think might still practice non-Latin inspired spells? I assume Asian countries would likely do so, as they extend historically back to before western civilization 'standardized' magic, and they may even have their own spells.

I propose the idea that following branch offs of languages to determine the historic style of spellwork as well as spell list might be a good place to start. What day you all?


** Asian countries, central and southern Africa, and the Americas. The influence of Greece and Rome was nearly nonexistent in those places, so I'd hazard to guess that spells originating from there in pre-modern times were likely cast in the native languages.

*** Exactly, the pronunciation of a spell shouldn't matter at all.

A Chinese would NEVER shout "Wingadium Leviosa" - can you imagine how silly that sounds for them?

**** I can see China having a great influence on Korea and Japan on how their spells are cast, since China influenced those countries a lot, and maybe they all cast spells in Literary Chinese (as close as an equivalent of Latin in Anglosphere countries as I can get).

***** Yes, and NEVER underestimate magical India, Arabia, Persia... for their magical equivalents might be far stronger than their muggle counterparts.

***** I'd say they'd all likely be different. Each of the East Asian culture have a strong sense of identity, and would have prided themselves on keeping with their own language and developed spells. There may be some crossover with Buddhist taught spellwork, but genetic spells would probably be distinct to the countries and cultures.

**** What matters is what the spell /does/.

You and [[/u/PaintbrushGiant]] make a good point - they'd still probably be casting in their native language.

*** I'd be surprised if they didn't still practice in their native language, even if they were a colony. Anti-colonial sentement was probably as common in the magic world as it was in the muggle world. Id assume colonial or former colonial states would practice both Latin spells as well as their own, while others might stick strictly to their own due to no outside influence or a very strong sense of identity.

** If you define a spell by its effect, rather than its incantation, I think the problem of foreign magic solves itself quite neatly. The incantation becomes like a kind of label for a spell. Just as saying a person's name will bring to mind all sorts of associations that you have in your subconscious about that person, so too an incantation can act as a kind of connection to all the subconscious understanding you have of a spell's nature.

There's no reason why a given spell would be limited to a single such label. Indeed, we see within canon wizards making variations to incatnations in order to adjust the effect of the spell. So foreign magic would be the same magic - the same spells - just using different incantations to call forth those effects.

*** There was an anime I watched recently that talked about the ideas behind incantations, worded spells, etc, and how they were just there as a way to focus the mind. They talked about how altering the way you say the spell, pauses, what not, changes the way it works. You could have a shortened multi-word spell, inflection changed, and it could effect how the spell works. Basically you are limited to your imagination as to how you wanna play with spells, because in the end it just changes how you visualize the spell taking effect.

**** I much prefer an objective approach to magic, as opposed to a subjective "it's all in your mind" approach. The intent/imagination/visualisation approach rather undermines the idea of study as being essential to magic.

Hogwarts has a huge library in which multiple books can be written on a single spell (Harry once read three books on the Stunning Charm alone), reading and understanding those books enables you to cast the spell better/easier (see: Hermione's entire Hogwarts career), and the best wizards are noted specifically for their academic abilities. It seems clear to me that understanding what you're doing is the primary (but far from only) element in being able to cast spells well and being able to use more advanced magic.

Indeed, the whole idea of a school of magic in a world where all you need is imagination/intent/will is kinda pointless.

So this is what I mean when I said that you define the spell by its effects: the spell is defined according to its nature as described by magical theory, which is objectively ascertained and universal across cultures. The incantation, however, can vary depending on linguistic variety.

***** Now there is a problem with that. Take for example curses be supposedly ineffective when a person has no heart or malice behind it. Ref. to Bellatrix vs Harry, his crucio was a dud because he didn't have the malice or intention; he was a person who would not be able to bring himself to do something like that. Just because there are books on stunning charms doesn't mean that it's one charm. They may cover varying grades and degrees of stunning. From the basic knock out, to partial paralysis, merely causing someone to flinch, etc.

****** Well, that's two separate points:

1. Without a doubt certain spells have emotional requirements, or some other mental performance required at the time of casting, but this does not really impact the general point. It's just an additional element on top of all the other stuff.

2. Spell variation is a canon fact. The shield charm is the prime example: it can be used to block either magic or physical things, it can be cast with a greater variety of strengths, it can block or reflect, it can be used to cover different areas in different shapes. But I don't see how this makes it less the Shield Charm. Indeed, as Harry's expertise in the Charm grows, so too does his ability to do different and better things with it. If anything variation backs up the view that understanding of the spell underpins your casting of it.

** I'd imagine that all cultures would have at least a small selection of non-Latin spells in common use. I wouldn't be surprised if household spells in old germanic languages were passed down through families or something.

On a wider scale, I'd imagine every other continent would practice a combination of non-Latin and Latin spells in "modern" times.

** Voiced spells are basically an element of casting that assists the mind in focusing the ability within a person to manipulate magic. The words are used as a recall for what it does, which assists in picturing what one wants, and the wand assists in targeting the spell. It has been stated that spellwork can be done without both, though for non voiced it requires mental focus, and for non wand an impressive amount of willpower in addition to the mental focus.
