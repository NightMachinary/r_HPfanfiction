I have recently started reading some Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings crossover. So far I've read "The power he knows not", "Harry Potter and elves most fabulous", "The shadow of Angmar" by Steelbadger and "The archmage of Arda" by Archmage.Potter.

If anyone knows any other good ones i would greatly appreciate any links.

Edit: Added the name of the authors.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10884162/1/Incendio][Incendio]] plays with the idea of Harry being the long-lost son of Smaug. Harry does turn into a dragon, but that's not the end of the story.

  An old evil is arising, the world is in decline, darkness threatens to encompass all. And left in the center is Lily, a source of magic unlike any before seen in Middle-earth. And Sauron knows it. Fem!Harry.

** Well, you've read all my stuff it seems, so I'm going to drop a bit of a random one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate be Changed by Araciel]].

It's a bit random because it's barely a crossover. It calls itself a crossover, but it's a 'Harry reincarnated as a girl Hobbit who can barely even remember her former life' crossover. However, the characterisation is just done with so much love and attention that I found myself unable to not love it.

  PART 2: She slayed the dragon, reclaimed the Mountain, birthed a forest, and won a war. But that was just the beginning. The past has a funny way of coming back to haunt you. Horcruxes and Dark Lords and quests to destroy them both, this time though, she's not alone. She has a Fellowship at her side.

  One person can make a difference: sometimes large, sometimes small. This is the story of a young witch who died under mysterious circumstances and woke up in a completely different world - a world she would change just by existing. Follow the journey of Hermione Granger as she walks the path to becoming Hermione Thranduiliel, the Elvenqueen.
