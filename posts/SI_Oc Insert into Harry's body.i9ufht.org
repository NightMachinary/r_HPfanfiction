  I remember last night vividly, going to sleep after another day of chores with not enough food. The only problem is I also remember going to sleep in a soft king sized bed, in a universe where the body I'm in is completely fictional. SI/OC-insert into Harry Potter 1 year before the start of canon. Not a gamer fic.

** There was one story I read, I can't remember the name of it, the main character wakes up in Harry's body. Ron was also a teacher in his past life.
