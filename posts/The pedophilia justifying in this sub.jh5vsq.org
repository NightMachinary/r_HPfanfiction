** First, pedophilia is an attraction to *prepubescent* children. Barring some rare medical conditions 16 year olds are very much pubescent. Misusing a dog whistle word like that to prevent criticism of your arguments makes it very easy to dismiss you.

#+begin_quote
  Most people will come up with the age gap talking point. Anyone below the age of 16 is a child. And anyone below the age of 18 is minor. Sexual relationships that occur between minors and adults are wrong and illegal. Th√¨s sub seriously needs to stop with the justification for pedophilic tendencies.

Strong pronouncements, but complete rubbish. 16 is the age of consent in the UK and a very large chunk of the planet. Based on the lower age of majority and all the stuff you can suddenly do during 5th year paralleling 16 in the real world, it's presumably 15 in Wizarding UK. So completely legal relationships at that point. Whether it's wrong or abusive depends on the people involved.

Hell 15 year old Hary and Tonks would actually qualify as a close in age exception for my state. I saw more than a few 6+ relationships as a high school student, and really don't get the outrage so many control freaks get.

** At the very least it is a very unhealthy coping mechanism. As someone who has been in that exact situation (being a child assaulted by an adult) I would never read that. It does trigger me. When I a young child, I had some very messed up thoughts, so maybe if I were able to read fan fiction that is how I could have coped, but it wasn't healthy. I am just not sure why someone would want to read about scenarios that they have experienced in order to feel that someone else has been through it and is doing this from a healthy place.

Edit// While I agree with you, there really isn't much we can do about it.

** I agree adult and kid pairings are wrong, but I also disagree with the no under 18 and adult. Sorry, but with fics, I tend to take canon and real world myself in regards to laws or established tropes, and in the UK you're legal for sex with anyone older than you, regardless if their age, at 16. So ivengot no issue with 6th year Harry hooking up with Tonks, it's legal. I do agree that Tonks and 4th year Harry or something like Tonks and 13 year old Voldemort or Vito Potter as one fic did, deserves to burn. Realism is also why I dislike fics where everyone is gay, even if the story is well written. It's something like 1 in 66 people are gay, so why would everyone in Hogwarts be gay? That sort of stuff rips me from the suspension of disbelief,
