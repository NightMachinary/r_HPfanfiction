** Harry froze. Slowly he asked the child "Who are you dressed up as?"

Unable to sense Harry's discomfort, the child bounced on his toes as he shouted, "Harry Potter!" Gleefully, "You're dressed up as him too aren't you?" The child continued, apparently glad that someone else had dressed up the same.

/How in the name of Merlin have the muggles found out about me?/ Harry thought, tiredly

"Well... I- yes- that - that's good. I'll get you some sweets shall I?" He walked back inside and looked around for a muggle safe sweet. Chocolate frogs, fizzing whizzbees, but no cadbury's chocolate. Thinking quickly, Harry took a chocolate frogs and tries to disable the charms, he then opens the box. The frog was still. Walking back to the front of the house, he gave the chocolate frog to him, and, deciding that playing along was the best option, said to the child "I even got chocolate frogs." Hoping dearly that wherever the child heard of him, he thought it was merely fiction and that chocolate frogs were part of the story.

"Thank you!" Said the child, clearly knowing what a chocolate frog was. He opened the box and was about to pit the frog in his mouth when something moved.

Harry had forgotten about the chocolate frog cards.

This was written in the space of 10 minutes, it might not be all that great.

Edit: little did he know that he and Ginny would have many similar exchanges that night with other children.

Ron is lame!' ‘Hey, that's my best friend you're talking about. Without him I wouldn't be here,' Harry said sternly. The kid grinned up at him. ‘He's also my dad.'
