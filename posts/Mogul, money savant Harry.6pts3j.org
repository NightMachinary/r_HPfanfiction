I'd like to see a Harry that takes over the wizarding world via investments, businesses, etc - through Gringotts, of course. Preferably, Harry wouldn't just be handed all of this (i.e through an inheritance test that crowns him Lord Slytherin, Peverell, Ravenclaw, etc, while he owns like 45% of every business in Diagon Alley) although if the story has him continually expanding his empire, I suppose it would fit the criteria.


** linkao3(Business by esama) and linkffn(Call me Moriarty) do fit this but they have a Moriaety-esque Harry determined on taking advantage of the backward magical society.

  Jasmine Potter came out of her abusive childhood somewhat changed, showing a few sociopathic tendencies. When she lays eyes upon the wizarding world she sees oppurtunity, and decides to take up the mantle of her favourite villain. The balance of power shifts as the chessboard is shaken up by a new player. But what of her foil, Miss Granger? AU,OOC, F/F, Fem!HarryxHermione pairing

  Where there is a Moriarty, there must also be a Holmes. Now let's see if she is up to the task.AN: Based on 'Business' by esama. Reading that first is required to understand the story.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
