Just an idea I have. MI18 isn't actually used, and it's like MI13 from Marvel Comics.


** seems like another muggle wank idea

*** Dunno. I like the idea of the Muggles actually watching the wizards, but doing nothing. Like, "we know you have a secret castle and a cult waging war, but we won't do anything, it's your fault".

** Definitely smells like Muggle-wank in here. I know because this thread smells like oil and metal with a hint of... gunpowder?

*** Yeah, the thing about muggle-wank stories is that they seem to forget that the magicals center of government/center of commerce is in the freaking center of London. All it would take would be a last-ditch fiendfire and all if a sudden your muggle-wank power trip becomes a very bad day for everyone involved. Assuming you get that far.
