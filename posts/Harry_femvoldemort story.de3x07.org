A story that takes place in a world where everything happens the same except Voldemort is female, and starts around the resurrection ritual/potion in the goblet of fire. Fleshes out the relationship between them, and has a good story and relationship progression.

**** well then there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13299443/1/Departure-from-the-Diary][this one]], but it's like 70k words in and nothing happened so the author is taking their time building it.

edit: i just realised this doesn't fit your request so nvm. it starts at the end of CoS instead.

****** It is quite good either way, the snowball fight in the most recent chapter was charming, I love seeing her slowly express more emotions and be happy.

******* I'm doing my best to make Tamelyn into a normal (if very troubled) person, as opposed to the murdering psychopath that canon Tom is. She's not a good person, but she has her redeeming points.

** Leyrann's !linkffn(The Advantages of Being Sane) is probably the only other one that hasn't been linked on this thread. It has its highs and lows, but he's currently working on a rewrite of it that will fix many of the issues he has with the original.

  When Harry and Cedric grab the Cup, they are transported to a graveyard, where Harry witnesses the resurrection of Lady Voldemort... who isn't quite what he'd expected. For one, she isn't trying to kill him. For another, she doesn't seem to like the Death Eaters either. Harry/fem!Voldemort.

** Linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre) is one of the best stories around. The sequel linkffn(Cleansing the Sins of the Past) is in progress.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
