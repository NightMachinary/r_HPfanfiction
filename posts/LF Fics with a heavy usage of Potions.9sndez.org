I have recently had an interest in Potions used in Fanfiction but it seems they tend to be very underused in all the fics I've read unless its for Healing. I'd like if you could point me at some fictions where it is more widely used.


** The Shadow of Angmar

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar]]

It's a crossover with LOTR. It uses potions and explores their theory as Harry tries to recreate his magic in a new universe.

** you might be interested in Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste on AO3! it's a for-want-of-a-nail fic where harry has an interest in potions before arriving at Hogwarts and basically decides he's going to become a potions master. it's funny and long and has a lot of delightful characterisation ! linkao3(10588629)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9821300/chapters/22052543][Swung by Seraphim]] has a lot of that. Premise is that Lockhart successfully obliviated Ron and Harry, but while Ron only lost a few months, Harry lost everything after his parents were murdered. Subsequently, Snape ends up becoming a (somewhat reluctant) mentor to Harry.

** Do you care about which ship? If you don't mind Harry/Ginny you may try:

Linkffn(1399984)

The ship is barely there to be honest but some people are picky about it.

Snape is heavily involved in the fic and potions are pretty essential.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966/chapters/2100285][Azoth]] on ao3 is really good if you don't mind slash, it goes a lot into Potions theory and other spellwork.
