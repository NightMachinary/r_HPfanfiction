Crossover: Harry Potter and Percy Jackson and the Olympians

Plot: Not only has Voldemort risen, but Gellert Grindelwald has also escaped Nurmengrad. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the four main players in the upcoming war, Harry, Albus, Voldemort, and Grindelwald, are all Demigods. And so their relatively small magical war becomes part of something much larger: A war against Titans.

Compulsory:

- Light/Grey Harry.

- Harry must be stronger than in canon.

- Het pairings or Gen.

- While the tweaking of the timeline is up to you, the magical and godly wars must occur simultaneously.

- All four must be demigods of the Greco-Roman Pantheon (Greek/Roman Gods).

- Harry's Godly parent must break the Ancient Laws to interact with Harry.

- Voldemort must not return in the graveyard. His return must be either through the events of the first and second books/movies or completely original.

- Harry must have learned about his heritage before Voldemort's return.

- Harry/Albus must join the Gods.

- Voldemort/Grindelwald must join the Titans.

- Grindelwald must escape before Voldemort joins the Titans.

- There must be at least one other demigod from Harry's friends (canon or otherwise) at Hogwarts.

- The war must take place mainly in America and Percy must play a major role.

- If you decide to keep Horcruxes, the one in Harry's scar must be destroyed.

Allowed:

- fem!Harry.

- OP Harry.

- Master of Death Harry.

- Immortal Harry.

- No Horcruxes.

- Lily/James being his Godly parent in human form.

- Sirius and Remus abandoning Harry.

- Harry's friends abandoning him.

- A new prophecy.

Forbidden:

- Slash pairings.

- Harems or Harry/Multi.

- Dark Harry.

- Harry being weak.

- Harry's Godly parent being anything other than Greek/Roman.

- Harry/ Dumbledore joining the Titans.

- Voldemort/Grindelwald joining the Gods.

If there is anything I have not mentioned that comes to mind, consider it 'Allowed'.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter squatter) has some of these, and none of the forbidden stuff. It's pretty good so far.
