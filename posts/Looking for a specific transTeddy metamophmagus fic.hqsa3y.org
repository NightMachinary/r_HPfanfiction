:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic maybe a year or so ago (just after a previous JKR controversy) about Teddy lupin experiencing body dysmorphia and using metamorphmagus abilities to have a female body. I remember that teddy had to do research on female internal organs because metamorphosing just the external organs but not internal was causing horrible pain. it was almost certainly on ao3 and if I recall correctly the author was also trans although I could be remembering commenters, not the author notes. I wanted to revisit this fic as I really enjoyed it, does anyone know which it could be?
