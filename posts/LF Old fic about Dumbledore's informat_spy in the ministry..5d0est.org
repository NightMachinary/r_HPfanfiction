I read this fanfic years ago on mugglenet or live journal, but this author had an OC that informed Dumblefore on Ministry stuff. Character only had a code name and Ministry workers only used pronouns when speaking to the character. I remember that the OC is the one that informs Dumbledore about the court time change and a long time informant going back to 1st Wizarding War and post Voldemort era. Also pointed out new Order members to Dumbledore.


** I hate the idea of using an OC when Percy Weasley is right there to do this job...

*** I like Percy also, but he can't be everywhere. Also has many questions as to his reliability following the Triwizard tournament.(not recognizing Crouch was imperioused)

Better to have multiple sources and this guy predates Percy's arrival at the Ministry.
