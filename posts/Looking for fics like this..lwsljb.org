I've already read linkffn(Forest of Mystery) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë).

I'm just interested in the survival aspect. Preferably not romance centric.

I should mention that I read Forest of Mystery years ago and loved it. However it no longer matches my tastes. If I were to read it now, I would hate it. So maybe not fics like that one.

I know people often recommend Forest of Mystery with linkffn(Harry Potter and The Mystic Knights) but my relationship with this fic is the same as Forest of Mystery. Loved it years ago but would hate it now.

I've also read linkffn(Spells in Silence) and love it.

So please Harry, Fem!Harry, Ron, Hermione, Luna, Filch, Goyle, Edgecomb etc

I don't care who the main character is as long as there's plot and minimal romance.

  When Harry misses the Hogwarts Express as a First Year, he decides he would rather take his chances following the train tracks on a hike to Hogwarts than risk missing out on learning magic forever. Will The Boy-Who-Lived be able to survive the magical countryside with only his school supplies and wand to keep him safe?

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
