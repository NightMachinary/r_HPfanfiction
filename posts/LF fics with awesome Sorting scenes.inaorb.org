Do you know any fics where a Sorting scene has you laughing and rolling around on the floor? Or where it's otherwise awesome? Link it below! (One extreme example: Boredom is Deadly [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4298700/chapters/9741831]] ) )


** This is an awesome story (unfinished but nobody's perfect) with a great sorting scene: Who Is Harry Potter? by BeepKeeper. linkffn(13218646)

Warning: The first two chapters are a rather dark backstory, in which Lily, James, and Sirius are not nice people at all. Dumbledore also gets bashed.

If you want to jump to the sorting, it's chapter 15. (Yes, in a story where 11-year-old Harry goes to Gringotts at the start of chapter 3, we are all the way at chapter 15 before we're ready to be sorted. It's /that/ kind of story.)

  When Harry arrives at Gringotts, Hagrid produces the key but there's nothing else proving that the child is Harry Potter. What if there is a dark story behind the origin of the Boy-Who-Lived. Bashing Potters, Sirius and Dumbles. Good Goblins and Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. HEA in the end.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.
