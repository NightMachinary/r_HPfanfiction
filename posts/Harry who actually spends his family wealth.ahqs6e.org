******* Absolutely! Although they are slash but it's not that explicit mostly.

[[https://hp-ficsearch.livejournal.com/555668.html][Unlocking Harry Potter series]] This is 3 stories and a prequel, Harry is pretty troubled at the start (warning for attempted suicide) but it's one of my favourite powerful Harry stories. Ends up Harry/Charlie but the slash is mostly not explicit & not a major part of the story.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8184311/chapters/18751001][Secrets by Vorabiza]] Set straight after HBP finishes could realistically be a complete replacement for book 7, Harry/Draco again the slash isn't that explicit.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2032067/1/Abandon][Abandon by Batsutousai]] This is a weird one, it's Harry/Tom and not to everyone's tastes but it's pretty fun (warning for Harry having been raped in the past & dealing with that).
