Looking for fics where Harry wrecks house like no tomorrow. I am looking for fics where he straight up destroys anything and everything in his way.

So many asking for slow build fics and similar recently. I want something to get away from that all right now. Length, het or slash, and everything else doesn't matter, just want OP Harry. Thanks!

Edit: Cannot spell engage it seems lol.


** Dunno if I'd call it an OP Harry, at least to start, but it totally ends up that way, its complete, and has a sequel. Very Crack, but despite not being much of a crack reader, I loved it.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** Linkffn(10136172) Core threads by theaceoffire It's abandoned at this point like many stories with OP main characters. I wouldn't call it a crack fic but it's close(by my definition at least). If you like humor I'd recommend giving it a try if you haven't already. By the end he's more or less a God.
