idk if headcanon is the right word since I'm not asking for personal details of the characters but rather things like, how does the wizard government actually work? or what actually makes magic dark V. light? how does one go about becoming an animagus? etc. I think one of the funnest parts about writing Fanfic is getting to further explore the world and fill in the holes. so how do you fill in the holes?

Edit: Ok Apparently Fanon is the term i'm looking for not headcanon.


** /Looks at all these things and internally debates posting own fanon/

- I guess I could say that the Ministry of Magic has more departments than are stated in canon. Like there's probably a department for the Treasury. Because the Ministry has to have got a way of checking and regulating its own finances... Even if people within it are corrupt as heck.

- Another one is one I've said on here before, I think. That the Ministry has people in high ranked positions throughout the British mundane populace who are able to inform them if a wizard casts magic in front of muggles or if magical creatures are attacking muggles etc.

- The Queen is the one who (can't remember the word because of how late it is) officially asks the candidate for Minister of Magic to his/her job and is fully aware of the Magical world as it is a part of her realm.

- The Queen is still both head of state and head of government in the Magical World, the British PM is only her representative in the Ministry. (The reason for this is that the Wizarding World separated and hid itself from the Muggle one /before/ the English Civil War, before the PM became the official head of government. In the Magical world; none of that happened. So they're /still/ subservient to those laws.) He can be removed on her say if there's a significant cause for it.

- The Department of Mysteries works on top secret projects like time travel, prophecies and experimental and purely theoretical magic. At least that's part of their job. They are also a safeguard for the Queen as a means to remove a Prime Minister should he overstep his bounds and try to challenge her authority. It's why they're so secretive and looked upon with suspicion by the rest of the Ministry.

- There are other magical schools in the Uk and rest of Europe. But Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang are the three most prestigious because of the numbers of famous graduates.

- Slytherin house is based on tradition and wealth, it's effectively Eton or the Pudding Club for Hogwarts. That being said, there's still plenty of ambitious and cunning witches and wizards who would be sorted there, regardless of lineage or purity. If they are though, then word would never get out about their parentage and whilst they might be mocked in house. It would never reach outside of it.

- Salazar Slytherin hated Muggles because of the Witch hunts going on at the time. He disliked Muggleborns because he believed that they would rat out everyone who attended Hogwarts (regardless of blood families) to their families, who would then try to have them all killed in a mass genocide.

- The origin of blood purity is that the original muggleborns in the Founders time, combined with the pure and halfbloods had family members executed by fearful xenophobic and magic fearing muggles. Their anger and fear was passed on to their children. Who passed it on to their children. On and on and down the centuries it went until we get the 20th century descendants of those original people. They spout about how their blood is superior and how muggleborns are a danger to their society and the like. But the original message of their ancestors has become diluted throughout the years. All the fear of Muggles and the witch hunts became an idea of blood supremacy.

- There is ultimately no difference between light and dark. They're both labels used by the Ministry and others to try and create villains out of people. Or magic becomes "dark" when it is associated with dark wizards. Dark wizards meaning people who use their magic for their own ends and give no regard for other people.

- Magical America is not as progressive as Magical Britain. Not by a long shot.

- The idea of magicals in general and why they are able to use magic comes from the idea that when Mankind first emerged in the same forms as we are today (albeit less advanced) as Homo Erectus. When Homo Erectus started to replace Homo Neanderthalensis, some of them started to evolve in a way that was different to the majority. That evolution, though unnoticeable on the outside was the development of the ability to perform magic. So magicals and muggles are effectively 2 branches of the same kind. Both are the same species but not exactly the same.

- There is no such thing as Muggleborns. "Muggleborns" are descendents of Squibs. Squibs who were disowned by pureblood families. There are only purebloods and "halfbloods". But only a minority of the population are aware of this so the vague terms of Muggleborn, halfblood and pureblood are used.

I should probably stop here seeing as it's now 2.30am here and whilst I'm tired I could probably keep going for another 30 mins with this list. Haha

*** I love your headcanon about Salazar Slytherin. That's what I've always believed. My extension of that headcanon is that his older brother was killed by a Muggle anti-witchcraft mob, so that his reaction is a very personal one. He didn't want Muggleborns in the school because he felt it would put everyone else at risk. When the other three vetoed that, he did insist that they not be put into his House, because he knew he wouldn't treat them fairly because of what happened to his family. I love to headcanon Slytherin as a good person twisted by grief and sorrow, then defamed by history.

** - Rita Skeeter is a descendant of Beedle the Bard. Their family has always had the propensity for snooping and an affinity for beetle Animagus forms. In his day, Beedle was a nuisance like Rita and the Peverell brothers were very upset that he popularized their work.

- Sally-Anne Perks never returned to Hogwarts after her first year. She was a talkative girl and told her Muggle parents all about her time at Hogwarts, including the troll in the dungeon and the death of Professor Quirrell. They were shocked and wanted to pull her from school, but she couldn't imagine not becoming a witch. They ended up moving to America where they could be close to her mother's family and Sally-Anne could attend the Salem Witches Institute.

- An alternative explanation for Aberforth and goats: Dumbledore's Animagus form was a goat. Aberforth found it immensely hilarious and the charms (keeping the horns "curly and clean") were cast at his brother in goat form or human. Dumbledore was so harried that he brought the charges up against his own brother.

- Kissed bodies are harvested and the ingredients are used in potions. These potions are extremely rare, hard to brew, and very Dark. Their usage is strictly Healing oriented and have saved many lives over the years.

Ron did the cooking in his and Hermione's household. He got into cooking first, dabbled in smoking and BBQ ("The things they do with meat and fire, Harry!"), and took a while to get decent at baking.

He didn't venture into pastries until one fateful day when he grabbed one from the corner shop. At the time, he was in the doghouse with his mum and craving a fix. It was so terrible he thought he could do better. He tried later that night and Hermione laughed her ass off at the results. He was too stubborn to quit and eventually got pretty good at it.

When WWW's edible lines boomed, Rita wrote an article snidely referring to Ron as the Prophet of Pastry. That year, Harry and Ginny got Ron custom Cannon robes with "Pastry Prophet" across the back for Christmas.

** First: I am convinced that the muggle world knows a lot more about wizards than wizards are willing to admit.

Second: I also conclude that the Ministry is indeed just that, a Ministry. Its part of the government, even though highly independent, and its authority transforms with its Muggle head organisation. Its neither stuck in the medieval times, nor is it the British Empire's Ministry of Magic. Its the British Ministry.

Third: Despite it never being mentioned, I am convinced that there are more than just the three big schools in Europe. There are just not enough students in one year to uphold a society, let alone a society at war. Either that or Apprenticeship is a valid joice of education.

Yes this has to be true. You can't trust anything concerning numbers in cannon. JK doesn't have a clue what a galleon is worth, and she doesn't know how many magicals are in the UK, she doesn't know how many students are at Hogwarts, and she doesn't know how many schools of magic there are.

Because the Ottoman Empire was always a Muggle country, and in fact I'd argue the whole concept of States is a Muggle one. Wizards have always been a tiny embedded minority hidden within the Muggle majority, and it's not surprising they find it convenient to organize their Ministries according to the Muggle countries they live within. After all, they speak the same language, and would have to have Aurors and Obliviators familiar with the local jurisdiction's Muggle laws and traditions to do their part in enforcing the International Statute of Secrecy. In my opinion it's simply a matter of logistical convenience, not an indication that the Magical government is /part/ of the Muggle one.

I don't think there are any examples in the books of a Ministry from a "new" Muggle country. For example, would the former Yugoslavian states have split their Ministries or would they still share one? Or perhaps they never unified to being with. What about Moldova - would it have its own Ministry or be under the Romanian one? That'd certainly provide a hint to what JKR's interpretation was.

At this point it's vague enough that a fanfic author can probably justify almost anything if it'll make their story better. Which is great, because there are all sorts of interesting scenarios that can be explored.

*** i really like #2 but i also like to think that though it does transform it is always a few decades behind muggle society. for example in my mind the wizengamot is unelected and functions like something halfway between the house of lords and the Jewish concept of "the sanhedrin" (i thusly give it 72 members), i also like to imagine in my own fanon that part of the reason people are so paranoid about dumbledore is that during the era of the first war he and the order of the pheonix were far more revolutionary, pushing for an elected government (which would likely push out much of the old pure blood families from power) along with fighting the death eaters which they just saw as an inevitable result of the inequality of the system. by harry's time he has resigned that this change wont happen in his lifetime, but that he still must do whatever is possible to stop the system from sliding any more backwards.

** Headcanon is generally used to describe ideas which you consider to be canonical, even though they're not directly in canon. Headcanon is normally justifiable as being implied by various vague/incomplete canonical facts.

An example of headcanon would be that Grindelwald had some connection to WWII. It's implied by the timing of the final duel, but there's nothing in canon that outright says it.

Ideas that you've just made up yourself would be fanon.

JKR admits it in an interview. Shouldn't it be considered canon, at least if you consider interviews canon?

  I'm going to tell you as much as I told someone earlier who asked me. You know Owen who won the [UK television] competition to interview me? He asked about Grindelwald [pronounced "Grindelvald" HMM...]. He said, “Is it coincidence that he died in 1945,” and I said no. It amuses me to make allusions to things that were happening in the Muggle world, so my feeling would be that while there's a global Muggle war going on, there's also a global wizarding war going on.

** Here are mine, a few of which I've also put forth more-depth in [[/r/fantheories]].

- Salazar Slytherin was a Spanish Moor, meaning that he was likely dark-skinned, and Muslim. The name "Salazar" also means "old hall" in Basque.

- Godric Gryffindor was French, as "griffin d'or" means "griffin of gold" in French.

- Rowena Ravenclaw was Welsh, as "rowena" means "fair [lance], slender, white-haired".

- Helga Hufflepuff was of Norse or Viking descent, as her name comes from Old Norse /heilagr/, or "holy", "blessed".

- Albus Dumbledore was a possible descendant of Antioch Peverell.

** Here's a big one: the sorting hat doesn't work as advertised.

If you look at the 4 houses of Hogwarts and what they supposedly stand for (bravery, loyalty, knowledge and ambition) you notice three things wrong with them:

- These 4 traits are neither all-encompassing nor clearly defined. There are lots of people who show signs of 2 or more of these traits and some who fit in neither category.

- All four houses have about an equal number of students in them. Despite Slytherin not allowing muggleborns.

- There are people/families who obviously don't belong in the house they were sorted into. Percy Weasley for example is the poster boy for blind ambition but went to Gryffindor instead because "he is a Weasley and all Weasleys go to Gryffindor."

So what do I conclude from this? The sorting hat's main purpose is to make sure that all four houses are equally big and is very willing to compromise on the supposed traits of students to make that happen. It became extra painful with Slytherin since they have a reputation problem after the war.

People like Percy and Harry absolutely refuse to go there, so with his back against the wall and no other choice the hat lets people like Crabbe and Goyle enter. Sure, they represent none of the traits Slytherin stand for but at least they wanted in so beggars can't be choosers.

If the hat actually worked as advertised then:

- Some houses would be a lot bigger than others. We are talking two or three times as many students.
- There is no way that all 7 Weasleys would end up in one house. Siblings aren't that alike (and indeed, they are not).
- There would genuinely be people who fit nowhere.

*** I think you might need to go back and reread the Sorting Hat's songs, because it doesn't advertise that it sorts by character traits. The Hat explicitly states that it sorts as the Founders would have sorted. It's a kind of "Founders simulator".

Now, it goes on to state the Founders' general preferences, but these are general only. Each student is sorted on the basis of how the Founders would have sorted that individual specifically. It's not some kind of deterministic algorithm, it's a simulation of how four people would have come to a joint decision.

That's not true, that last bit there. Slytherin never barred muggleborns entry into the house. That's fanon. In fact it's stated in the seventh book by Snatchers that there "aren't a lot of Mudbloods in Slytherin." Which implies that there are in fact some in there. Or historically that there have been.
