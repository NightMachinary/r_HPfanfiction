I have read (in my opinion) a lot of HP fanfictions from canon verse (different pairings and different AUs) to Crossovers. Now I want to read (if there are any) fanfics (doesn't matter if it's crossover) where Harry is born or transported to a medieval time or ancient Rome where he is either involved in politics or within the army.


** There is a dead fic on ff.net with a crossover with the man from earth. Basically harry is ancient egypt. It had some nice potential, but its dead.

It's fem!Harry and kind of episodic. Jasmine(Harry) gets sent to ancient Egypt, basically the beginnings of human civilization and magic and becomes immortal.

We only get to see the results of her journey in the beginning, how she changed from the girl she used to be as the story switches between present time and episodes of Jasmine's past.

The first part in the past is about Morgana and Merlin at about 500 BC in Britain. Which means it's the end of the Roman Empire.

The second flashback is starting in ancient egypt but then quickly switches to Indus Valley at about 2700BC.

It hasn't updated in awhile but it's a very good story and does a nice job of combining myth and history and Jasmine's character is very well done. It's more about the drawbacks of being immortal in the beginning than anything else but there's a fair bit of history and legend to make it more than just an angsty 'everyone around me is dying' kind of thing.

That said, i liked the present story line more than the flashbacks, especially her interaction with Flamel and the one Dumbledore story.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
