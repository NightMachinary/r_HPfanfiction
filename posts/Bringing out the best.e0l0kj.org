I want THE anti bashing fic. Where all the good sides of the people are brought out. Molly beeing a loving mother and concerned for harry, mcgonagall the fair teacher, snape redemption seeker, dummbledore the wise mentor, voldemort the political activist, Vernon the hard working single income provider.

Nobody is all bad. We have had enough bashing. We need some love and seeing the other side.

**** I've seen fics where Tom Riddle hasn't done the terrible things that he does in canon - in essence, he doesn't do the heinous deeds he does in canon to become Voldemort... fics where there are interventions that prevent the terrible outcome that form the entire premise of the Harry Potter series. Is that what you're looking for?

*** There are good ways to write Voldemort while maintaining his evilness.

I would classify fics where Voldemort is an idiot, easy-to-overcome over-monologuing villain as "bashing."

One where Voldemort is a political activist doesn't have to mean he's not evil, just that he goes about his evilness is an intelligent way.

**** I just have a hard time wrapping my head around the concept of Voldemort as a political activist... his desire to rid the world of muggles and muggleborns (hello - genocide) is a minor goal compared to his desire to prevent his eventual death. And in reality, the way he is written originally, he is so completely narcissistic that he isn't working toward making a better world for a select group of people (ie political activism) - he'd as soon off his own people as anyone else. He's really just in it for himself. He shows more affection for Nagini than for any human being.

I understand wanting to avoid fics that include bashing... it is as brutal as it sounds. The act of bashing robs the characters of their complexity. It is as dehumanizing as Mary Sues and Gary Stus.

** the pureblood pretense? it's a crossover w/the Alanna The Lioness series from tamora pierce, and it doesn't have vernon (because lily and james are still alive) and i mean the premise of it changes a lot of things but voldemort in this isn't a murderous egomaniac, he's a politician? figured you might like that [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]

another might be “Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin” voldemort is a murderous egomaniac in this one, but for a pretty interesting reason imo it takes a lot of tropes and twists them to be more interesting and/or more logical (like vernon sucks, but there's a reason for it! amazing) although i guess you asked for the anti-bashing fic, and this one has a little bit of james-bashing? it's not over the top or anything, but still slightly there [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15828654/chapters/36853599]]

** Are you only looking for a fic where everyone is portrayed as the best version of themselves, or are you also interested in fics where an oft-bashed character is treated sympathetically? If it's the former I've got nothing; indeed, I'm not sure something like that even exists - how would you sustain any kind of plot or conflict? But if it's the latter, I have a few suggestions (all oneshots):

** If I remember it correctly, (it's been a /while/ since I read it) in whydoyouneedtoknow's dangerverse series, all the characters are treated as 3 dimensional beings, both good and bad. Their motivations also feel very in line with canon, and those that are different have good reason to be. It doesn't try to redeem or turn all the bad guys into good guys, but none of them are portrayed as "death death kill kill I only have one emotion," and for the ones it does redeem it makes sense in context.

There is also a number of 'spin off' stories written by the same author, that are in effect alternate universes of her original alternate universe, that all link back or give clues to the final outcome of her original universe. I know at least one of those has an interesting take on Riddle, where he was never a death eater, and is more or less a "good guy", but the main character (Draco from 6th/7th year) is from Canon and knows him as Voldemort.

The first installment or so are a bit rocky because it was the authors first time writing a full fic, but each one is better than the last. (Plus, they contain a veritable /wealth/ of oc's that are more fleshed out than your average main character oc, and have their own individual running storylines.)

** Voldemort is an academic in this series I'm currently reading. He's completely evil, but he's not really a racist genocidal maniac; that kind of thing doesn't concern him. Different circumstances have led to different character developments, as you might expect, but the series is very much anti-bashing.
