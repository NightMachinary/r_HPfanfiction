I'm talking about fics where there's an OC reborn like in linkffn(Chris Pettigrew and the No-Refund Policy) oc as Peter Pettigrew or linkffn(fudging original) reincarnated!OC_Percy. I really enjoyed these two, and I'm looking for more.


** Not /precisely/ reincarnated, but de-aged: linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff).

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15315219/chapters/35532657][Granger Chronicles]]: Not so much reincarnated as woke up as a young Hermione Granger in this one. Still ongoing with slowed updates.\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19275442/chapters/45841984][Harry Potter and the Reluctant Rebirth]]: Complete going over SI!Harry's first year and also has a completed sequel that goes over his second.\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17550650/chapters/41357990][New World, New Start]]: SI!Harry. As a warning, it is incomplete and hasn't been updated since September of 2019 and M/M among the tags. Nothing explicit from what I last remember.\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9143581/chapters/20774215][Hold Me Tight and Don't Let Go]]: SI!Dudley. Interesting for the character chosen alone. Unfortunately, it has not seen an update since May of 2018. With 55,727 words there's a decent amount of reading till you reach the end.\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6235966?view_full_work=true][Ph√©lypeaux]]: SI!Peter Pettigrew. Very short, very dead. Less than 5,000 words.
