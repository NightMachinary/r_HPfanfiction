** Linkffn(Something like your family)

Harry starts a support group for muggleborns and muggle raised like himself.

Things get out of hand. A lot.

** I think Wish Carefully by Ten Toes has a bit (But only a bit) of that. It is a oneshot in which harry makes a contract voldemort and the death eaters into letting all the light supporters and muggleborns to leave britain and go to other countries if he lets all the dark supporters have magical england if they leave the muggles alone on penalty of losing magic. It is quite amusing to see just HOW devastating the effects were.

Also, it is not one of those stories that say death eaters are misunderstood. In this story, you are meant to feel happy that this is the death eaters fate.

â€‹

Anyways, i think the idea of an underground muggleborn railroad sounds interesting.

** Ooh ooh I have one!

linkffn(6523209)

You'll like this if you enjoy slightly cracky fics, a small throw away bit of meta, really good worldbuilding, Muggles/Squibs not being complete tools or enemies, strong Harry/Hermione FRIENDSHIP, good trio dynamics all around, underground Muggleborn culture, Death eaters defecting, and having a Harry that can think for himself.

Fair warning, it paints Snape and the other DEs in a slightly sympathetic light, real-world plugins (Eminem and Harry Potter books), and somewhat unrealistic character interactions. There's also a bit of Muggle(born/raised) focus.

Overall, I liked it. Just over 60k words and 19 chapters. Unfortunately, it's abandoned (last update was in 2014) but it's a refreshing change of pace.
