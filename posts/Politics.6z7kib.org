  I for one would love to see a fic where a libertarian Harry Potter fights against Big Ministry tyranny, and inadvertently becomes a dark lord due to the establishment making peaceful and meaningful change impossible.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871), has a super!Harry. His fight with Voldemort wasn't that interesting, so the story focuses more on his research, magical theories, and political and social issues.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), is surprisingly politics heavy. Both Harry and Bellatrix did lots of maneuverings, and the elder Blacks were portrayed sympathetically.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), doesn't end with Voldemort's defeat, but goes exhaustively into their power consolidation phase.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146), has that 'Lord Potter' stuff, but does it better than other fics apart from 11 years old doing politics. Growing up at the Grangers, Harry had gathered a fairly large support base very early on, and he would use his fame to push through agenda he and his friends supported. Magical Britain wasn't ignorant of Muggle world in this story, as the rant by Death Eater Nott against Muggle environmental destruction showed. Fudge negotiated the site of TWT with John Major who closed off the entire area for 'military exercise'.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** My fic, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) meets the first part of your request. It's still in its infancy, but is working up to more developed politics.

*** Interesting story so far. The little differences between the canon characterizations make for a nice read. I don't really like Hermione though as her bossyness seems to have been raised to 11. Using different POV's is an interesting tactic and can help break up the monotony of going through the stations of canon that we have all read countless times, though at this point it leaves each character somewhat shallow. I am sure that will be remedied as we get further into the story.

Only one real question and it comes from the last chapter, what is RATs? I assume it is some kind of test as you said Bill was studying for it but when would someone take it and what does it entail?

**** In my universe, the RAT (Ridiculous Arduous Test) is the Wizarding equivalent of a muggle bachelor's degree. It requires in-depth studying of a particular subject and is typically the base requirement for professors.

Also, I'm glad you're enjoying the fic so far! Hermione will tone down (eventually) but for now she's busy being an obnoxious eleven year old.
