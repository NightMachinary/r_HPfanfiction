Not looking for something cliche where his girlfriend/wife can teach him exactly what Harry needs to know, and no slash please. I've read a few but I'm always looking for more!

  What if Harry had waited ten more minutes and said goodbye to the waitress in HP/HBP? Prequel, "What We Had," is now up on my page!

***** Hey [[/u/GenderNeutralBot]]

I want to let you know that you are being very obnoxious and everyone is annoyed by your presence.

^{I am a bot. Downvotes won't remove this comment. If you want more information on gender-neutral language, just know that nobody associates the "corrected" language with sexism.}
