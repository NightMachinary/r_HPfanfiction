Neville somehow steps into the MCU (or we could have both worlds could be merged from the start) grabs the attention of SHIELD but since he doesn't want anything to do with them, he politely tells them to bugger off and builds a giant greenhouse filled with unique plants somewhere he thinks is out of the way of society.

However, being both magical and a child of prophecy (even though he wasn't chosen) he inadvertently attracts the attention of heroes and villains alike. So we have an exasperated Neville defeating villains and patching up heroes every other week.

I've read MCU crossovers with Harry, a great one with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9606506][Sirius going there after the veil]], but I can't help thinking a fic with Neville (a quiet, unassuming hero) would be an even more interesting read.

** If you're going to cross Neville with superheros DC would do better because of one thing,

Poison Ivy.

Shipping Neville and Poison Ivy, I can't decide if that would be awesome or a train wreck.
