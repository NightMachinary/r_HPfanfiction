I'm a huge fan of The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black and I can hardly find anything about these 3, it's sad. I'd be happy with anything, whether its focused on all sisters or just one, pre or post canon. Lucius/Narcissa or Andromeda/Ted are most welcome!


** I really, really love A Keen Observer, by DeepDownSlytherin. It's a first-person prequel, from Andromeda's POV, set during the Black Sisters' school years. It isn't quite canon-compliant in that it alters the sisters' ages slightly to put them at Hogwarts with the Marauders (with Andy in the same year as MWPP), and Ted is in Ravenclaw (it was written in 2005 so I think before JK revealed he was a Hufflepuff). However I would encourage you to read it despite this because it definitely feels canon-compliant and it's for sure the best Black Sisters fic I know of.
