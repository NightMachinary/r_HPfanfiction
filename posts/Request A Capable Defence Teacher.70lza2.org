Looking for stories where there is a Defence teacher that is actually good at teaching and explains things well. Of course that would probably tend to mean an oc or maybe a minor character.

But if it is an OC please don't have the oc be a perfect Mary/Gary Sue/Stue I don't want that.

Any Era is fine.

Maybe the Defence Teacher actually showing Neville that using another wand is bad for him. (Doesn't have to have that though).

Would rather it be completed, but if not then a bunch of chapters is fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash.
