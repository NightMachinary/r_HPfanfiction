Fics where Voldemort leaves Harry Potter to his own devices because he's, possibly aware the boy is just a kid who (maybe) doesnt want any part in the war?

Or fics where adults actually do their job and protect children like they're supposed to? I would prefer a fic length of over 5k words (complete). I don't mind most ships but I don't want any Ginny/Harry and Harry/Draco. I'll suffer with Harry/Draco if I gotta but I'm not into Harry dating a little Lily.

I don't mind bashing. So long as it's readable, you can rec anything.

No crossovers with shows/books/movies where you need to know both shows intimately to understand the references and such too.

Thank you

A common misconception, because there's ZERO evidence in the Books showing Ginny looking like Lily. Not a single person who knows both Ginny and Lily ever mentions any similarities between them.

Red haired people are very common in Britain. In fact, up to 10% of the British population, or 6 million people, could have red hairs.

*** Most definitely you're right. The movie, however, has put me off of her regardless of her personality in the book. The bestfriends sister cliche is also one I dont much like, and I LOVE cliches. It's just a tad too cliche for me tbh. I also just see Ginny as Harry's little sister as well as the adopted son to the Weasleys. I like her, I just don't like the ship. Everyone has their own tastes.

(I also just don't mean to think Ginny is the look-alike to Lily, but I don't really want to read a James/Lily fic renamed. Sure, she may not look like Lily but Harry apparently looks a lot like James and I just don't want him to 'follow in his fathers footsteps' per se.)

I used to read Harry/Ginny just for the plot when I was younger, I suppose. But I've only recently gotten back into straight ships so I'm easing myself back into it. I dont ship Harry with many women, if I'll be honest. I like the Harry/Hermione ship and Harry/Luna. I don't like the Harry/Daphne ship. Mostly because, from what I remember, she's always depicted as pretty edgy. Ice princess and all that.

All in all, the ships I don't care for the most are Harry/Ginny, Harry/Daphne, and Harry/Draco. It's just my personal preference.

** Petrification proliferation is (probably) the best known "capable adults" fic.

***** Oh, that was a reference to how in that story, whenever one of the Trio revealed something, a Ministry official shouted in alarm.

** In the Last Mage series (Harry is Kal-El), Voldie becomes saner each time he re-appears as his method of return allows his soul to patch itself up with the shredded remains of whoever was taken over by him (such as Lockhart via Diadem). As such, he becomes more cunning and willing to think things through, even teaming up with Grindlewald in the third story.

** I would once again point to linkffn(Harry Crow) - Voldemort manages to feel like a more dire threat despite things being stacked against him much more than in canon, while the adults on Team Good are all actually doing their f**king jobs (unlike canon).
