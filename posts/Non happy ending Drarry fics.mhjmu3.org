Got a weird craving for any Drarry fics that dont end in a happy ending. Doesnt have to be "they hate eachother again" kinda ending, just they dont end up together and live happily ever after.

Only other specific is that it is a finished fic, otherwise I'll read pretty much anything aslong as its Drarry.

Though bonus points if it involves soulmates somehow, some kinda time travel, or an epilogue. Im just a sucker for those three.

Thank youuuuuu!!


** Okay, but these both involve major character death.
