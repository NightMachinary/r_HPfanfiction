** linkffn(12125300) not really what you are looking for, but the closest thing I could think of. Its Harry is uncomfortable around girls and Daphne is always trying to be very close to him.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

****** Each of the women (Aenor, Daphne, and Tracey) brings value to their relationship with Hadrian. Even though the author states in book 1 that there won't be a collective, I find it hard to imagine how the main relationship can develop into anything but a collective with all the separate relationship development between Hadrian and each woman.

If the author wanted a satisfactory single pairing, then they should have made the difference in between romantic and platonic interests explicit early on. Now though, I will not be satisfied with anything but a multiship relationship for this story.

Are you speaking in HP's fanfiction or in general?

If it's the former then yeah, I didn't find any good Harem (3 girls or more) fic. But if it's in general you should really read something else except fanfictions. Try some light novels for example.

** - /Black Luminary/: pairing (tentative): Hadrian x [Aenor, Daphne, Tracey]

  - The aloof pureblood scion is certainly one of Hadrian's masks, but with respect to women, he is socially stunted rather than playing hard to get.

- /The Mind Arts/: pairing: Hadrian x Daphne (with the possibility of the inclusion of the lovely Delacour sisters)

  - Slightly sociopathic and more interested in expanding his knowledge and abilities in the arcane magical arts such as mind magic, blood magic, and sacrificial magic. Daphne has it bad for him.

I want to see a Harry who, unlike the one in the books, is largely indifferent to girls and romance but then things start to change once he meets her.

So canon Harry? I mean, your average 15-year-old celebrity would probably use his fame to have three shags between breakfast and potions, or at least go onto more than one date in four years of being a teenager in a huge, barely supervised castle.
