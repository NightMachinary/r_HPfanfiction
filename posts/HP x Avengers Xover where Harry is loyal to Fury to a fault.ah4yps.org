I really love Harry Potter Xovers, especially in super hero verses such as Avengers or Hero Academia.

I'm a bit tired of independent 'F the world, I do what I want' Harry. I like it, I'm just looking for something different. I think it'd be pretty interesting to see a scenario in which Fury somehow earns the undying loyalty of a powerful Harry, who dedicates his powers to Fury's goals.


** [[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307781/1/Heroes-Assemble](Heroes]] Assemble!) is a fantastic fic that is updated weekly and going strong at 92 chapters covering Harry's rise as the Avenger Mage. As well as going through the events of pretty much all the Marvel movies but adding Harry as Mage as an extra player making the story somewhat fresh.

Currently the Civil War events are kicking off!

Harry is loyal to Fury in this story.

*** I've tried this story before but was put off by the Aurors, I think. A few other minor things that kept bugging me, too.

Thanks for the rec, though, I may try it again.
