Hello!

Do you know of any fanfiction where Hermione and Tom have known each other since they were kids?

Preferably long (And I don't care if they are not the most popular, I have found some very good and little known fics)

I already read Stepbrother by cherry cup, also Fostering a Nightmare by NinjaFairy86 and School days by Meowmers, and finally one in Spanish, it's called Una sola epoca, Hogwarts by Namine1993. I loved everything I just mentioned so I wondered if there are any others like it.

â€‹

Thank you!


** "Birds of a Feather" linkao3(15996890) is pretty good.

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy in an orphanage who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms between them---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend".But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle.1930's-40's Childhood Friends AU.
