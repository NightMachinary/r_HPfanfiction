I've been reading fanfiction since 2003 and it's only been recently that I've noticed how popular Harry Potter/ other book/movie/tv show crossovers are. I'm curious: Why do you like reading crossover fics? What was the one that cemented your love of this genre? Why do you enjoy that particular crossover?


** You can only read Harry is a Teen age wizard BUT WAIT THERES MORE! but so many times without becoming bored. It also doesn't help that 20-30's Harry stories often focus on things like romantic drama, romantic comedy or grim dark stuff that often feels super over blown to get you to realize Harry is 20. I can read that or

Harry is off somewhere else, crawling through the forest of Endor or he is standing in Chicago with another wizard name Harry play PI, Maybe Harry is in Japan defending the princess of the Universe from her many aggressive Suitors. Maybe Harry isn't exactly what we thought he was, maybe he is a Kryptonian, or he is a Full bringer, maybe he is a Anodite. He meets new people, people who like him were chosen from birth to be a protector due to prophecy, maybe he meets people who leaped into the life style to just do good. He may even find someone else to fall in love with, whether it's Supergirl or Rangiku or Akeno or maybe a group of women.

I like Crossover because they get The story away from Hogwarts (on occasion because some people don't even do that) and we get to see more of the world that a Drafty Castle, a small room in Surrey, a weird house in the the English County side, a scary house in London and a small street in the middle of London. I'm not reading about Draco Malfoy and Harry having a childish Duel. I'm reading Harry being a Interplanetary Bounty Hunter, or a Superhero or Pilot or just a Rich guy who got into some stuff, or maybe he is just a Student still but that isn't all he is maybe he is a Gladiator trying to rise up the ranks to become a high ranking devil, or maybe he is also a defender of life against Hollows, maybe he is a Disciple Martial artist who is fight against a gang.

**** Well the thing is most crossovers stall, like most fanfiction but with the added caveat that since it's a smaller community even less stories are ended. I don't want to give you old unfinished work and leave you with blue balls and a hatred of crossovers.

Linkffn(Heroes Assemble!) is a current updated Harry Potter/Avengers Story. I'm not a huge fan of it due to the time spent observing the Stations of Canon, but has recently picked up with the move beyond Winter Soldier.

Linkffn(Harry Potter's most excellent adventure) a fun if messy Harry Potter/Star Gate crossover that requires a mild knowledge of SG. (Not a lot just knowing who the main players are really) I actually really like it.

Linkffn(A Wizards Life With Monster Girls) a recently updated Harry/Monster Musume story, that mixes the standard Harem Manga tropes with a more western story telling angle. Some lemons if your into that.

Linkffn(A Third Path to the Future) probably one of the best written Marvel Potter crossovers. Biggest knock is the length, some chapters are literally 150k each. Harem, Lemons again if you are interested. Does a wonderful job of blending The MCU, Mutants and Harry's Place in it all.

Linkffn(Magi Ranger) yep Harry Potter in Might Morphin Power Rangers as a 7th Ranger the Magic Ranger. Well written fun ride through the first season of MMPR and will continue further.

Linkffn(Chrysochlorous) HP Crossover Fanfiction ain't nothing without Twilight Crossovers. Here is one I enjoy, Harry/Rosalie. So just on pairing it's Ultra rare due to not being Slash. Super Angsty but par for the course in Twi fiction.

And basically anything by plums if you can enjoy non finished stories. The man is a great story weaver if someone who doesn't finish them up

**** linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) for sure if you like LotR. It's just really great.

linkffn(The Wasteland by The Carnivorous Muffin) is a sidefic from Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus where Lily finds the One Ring. So crossover between LatAoBS and LotR, not quite HP but still good.

I second Heroes Assemble, its good.

linkffn(To Ride Upon Svadilfari) is a pretty good crossover with Avengers and Thor, but it focuses on the Norse mythology part a lot more than the MCU did. (Ok, I haven't actually watched Ragnarok yet, and that seems fairly mythology focused, but still) Disclaimer, I read this a long time ago when I was fairly new to fanfiction so I really don't know how well it holds up to someone more experienced xD.

linkffn(Wand and Shield), Avengers crossover. I never actually finished it because it kind of gets boring (imo) near the end, but it is really good in the beginning.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

**** Not really, no. It depends on whatever else I'm into at the moment.

Right now I'm reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11975368/1/The-Stormreaver][The Stormreaver]] (HP/Warcraft) linkffn(11975368) where [[/spoiler][Harry gets kidnapped as a baby by a Demon from Warcraft's Burning Legion, and raised by a warlock (basically a demonic mage)]]

I also read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens]] (HP/Warhammer 40K) linkffn(8400788) where [[/spoiler][In the summer of his 3rd year, Harry gets transported to Warhammer's 40th millenium, and then he comes back as a 300 year old Space Marine.]] It's much less serious than Stormreaver.

Basically I like the "Character from universe X gets into universe Y and shenanigans happen" trope.

Also, for a non-HP X-over that I can (not) recommend; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3886999/1/Shinji-and-Warhammer40k][Shinji and Warhammer40k]] (Evangelion/Warhammer 40K) linkffn(3886999). Any summary I may write won't make it justice, just... read it, if you feel so inclined.

** I like the idea of crossovers but I very rarely find good pieces dealing with what I want to see.

For example, I like the idea of a HP/Flash crossover with Draco Malfoy being Julian Albert (same actor). I also like the White Collar/Chuck crossover with Bryce Larkin being Neil Caffrey. And Terminator the Sarah Connor Chronicles/Bäckström series, with John Connor being Gregory Valentine. Now, I never watched past season 2 of Flash but I get what the series is about, I read up on Julian and I like the idea of the universes colliding. And like with the other other two crossovers, these would be secret pasts the characters would try to hide in various ways. I've found a few fics on some of these ideas but nothing I personally find spectacular, I'm afraid.

I might try out the HP/Avengers crossover because the idea does sound promising but I have no idea of what characters I'd like to follow the most. Maybe that's better, to be more open minded.

** I used to absolutely love the kind of stories where a person or several persons from another book/movie/show are hired or sent on a mission to Hogwarts, usually ending up as students, sometimes as teachers. Nowadays I still like those stories, but most of them fall into the trap of bad writing, follow the HP canon a little too closely, or get terribly annoying with how the author tries to "up the ante" by bringing in more and more villains from the non-HP series and that spirals out of control with way too many characters to keep track of.

My favorites these days are where someone from the HP universe is reincarnated into another universe, preferably someone other than Harry. The best ones I've found have Hermione reincarnated as Sakura Haruno from the Naruto universe.

** It's an exercise in imagination. How do you take what you know of this series, and merge it with another? How do you frame the story and mix the colors. How do you decide to alter things?

Most importantly, do you keep consistency within character reactions, or does everyone start to react the same, sound the same, and think the same?

I find that it's incredibly rare for a writer to manage to separate different character's thought processes, speech, emotions, and the like from each other. I've seen a few short fictions where a writer manages to write a person's expressional thoughts and the framing of words consistently and decidedly different from others. Those are usually top quality fics, and it's a shame I don't see more.

I often read cross overs when I feel tired of Harry Potter. Something to inject a bit of life into things. Some fandom cross-overs are the same story again and again too but since only the very worst cross overs stick to the stations of canon in either universe it should be somewhat fresh.

** My all time favourite crossover is linkffn(The Havoc Side of the Force). Its not very in character, almost to the point that its an OC in the Star Wars universe with references to the Harry Potter world. The thing that sets it apart is that is is damn good fun. So much of popular fanfiction is whiny angst and frankly horrifying romance, wound through the thousandth canon retread with nothing new or exciting added, that it just cheers me up immensely to read about a man and his mad killer robot larking around the galaxy, causing chaos and stealing everything that isn't nailed down, with magic being used in creative and entertaining ways. There are so precious few stories that I have ever found, and I think I am up to about 15 different fandoms to varying degrees of intensity, that I just enjoy reading. So I think I enjoy reading crossovers simply because the good ones are just a wonderful fresh take on fandoms I do genuinely enjoy, while there are stories I love contained within single universes, my very favourites are almost all crossovers. Here are a few others I have enjoyed, not all are crossovers with Harry Potter but why not.

linkffn(Dragons by Annonimous4862), sadly unfinished and likely abandoned, but 160k words of Skyrim and Eragon crossover and its good fun.

linkao3(There May Be Some Collateral Damage by metisket), requires a little bit of the anime Bleach to fully follow, but its finished and one of my all time favourites, really funny from start to finish.

linkffn(Itachi, Is That A Baby? by SpoonandJohn) is still updating regularly, a reasonably mild crossover with Naruto though not absolutely necessary to enjoy the story. Really weird and largely impossible to predict where it is going but very funny.

linkffn(The Difference One Man Can Make by joen1801) is a little different, more serious and worldbuildy Harry in Westeros, not the best but interesting, though nearly a year since an update has left me worried.

** Because they're different. There are bad ones of course, but most understand that introducing one or more completely new characters will have a significant impact on the plot. I also find that it helps give a different perspective, you can only do so much with an established cast, so new characters change up the dynamics. For example, if you're reading a crossover wherein some of the new characters are adults, this helps see the war with Voldemort from an adult perspective, different from Harry's narration of events. Or, if the characters you introduce are more Slytherin in mind-set, this might change the way of thinking of certain characters and the dynamics of the war.

However, really, the main interest lies in seeing your favourite characters interacting with each other. It gives you a chance to see the characters from someone else's view.
