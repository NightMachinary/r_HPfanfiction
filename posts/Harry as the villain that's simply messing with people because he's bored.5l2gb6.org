Like, Godlike!Harry that's just fucking with everyone because he has nothing else to do. Could be an interesting read, if done right.


** linkffn(Boredom is Deadly by preciousann) is a fic where a MoD!Harry and Tom Riddle's put back together soul recreate Harry's first year of Hogwarts (with some changes because they were drunk while doing so) in order to fuck with everyone because they (specifically Harry) were bored as can be.

  For Harry, the 'next great adventure' isn't really all that great. After two-thousand years of dealing with the whining souls of the dead, he decides to spice things up a bit...by returning to his first year at Hogwarts. Crackfic! MOD!Harry Darkish!Harry GaryStu!Harry with a twist. NO Bashing!

** Hmm...The closest thing that comes to mind is 'Starkness' by Runaway Deviant.

It's not Harry Potter at all, it's Avengers; Tony Stark's a villain because he can. It sort of fits your criteria except for not being about Harry Potter at all.

  Post-Thor, canon-divergence. Loki doesn't survive his fall from the Bifrost and winds up reincarnated on Midgard as a mortal magician named Lucy with no memory of her previous life. Her decision-making skills have not been much improved by the transformation._____“Do I even want to know why you think I'm your missing brother?”“The similarities are startling,” Thor managed. She looked pointedly down at her chest, then back at him, her lips pursing. He knew the look in her eyes, the set of her mouth, the tension in her jaw. Oh, how he knew that sharp, angry, hard face. He could practically hear Loki hissing “You idiot” in his ear.“You deny it, then?” Hogun asked.“Seriously?” Lucy's left eye twitched slightly. “I have at no point in the last thirty years seen or experienced anything that would lead me to think I'm a dude, an alien, a god, or any combination thereof. So yeah, I'm going to have to go with denying it.”_____Irregular updates. Thanks for reading!

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
