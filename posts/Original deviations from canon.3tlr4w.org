I just read a story where Voldemort was 'killed' by Hermione selling his soul (from a Horcrux) to a demon in exchange for never allowing the soul back on this realm of existence, which was a rather new way of killing him for me.

It made me think, what are the most original, funny/weird deviations from canon everyone has encountered?

It doesn't have to be a good idea or good writing. Just the most original/outrageous/innovative (depending on your perspective) concepts you've encountered while reading HP fanfiction.


** In most fics Hermione is the somewhat shy girl whobis inexperienced in friendship and a bit awkward. In one timetravel-fic though she keeps her bossy behaviour, and becomes more a dominatrix-character (not actually, she just had this vibe, and she definitely had no problems telling her partner exactly what she wanted). The fic was pretty harmless (nothing 18+ or anything), and this characterization just fit so perfectly.

The greatest changes however all take place in the very famous German Harry Potter fanvideos by coldmirror (those are famous like crazy, ask any German who ever used youtube, good chance he saw those). Those vids are a bit politically incorrect and have a very crack-vibe to it, but I'll just list a few changes:

- Harry's Parents actually did die while drunk driving, and Harry often has flashbacks to the scene where you see the green light from the AK flashing out of the window of their house, just that this time the scene is on repeat and with loud techno music, showing us how fucking hammered the parents must've been.
- Voldemort didn't like Harry for absolutely no reason, and decided to throw a rock at him, giving him his 'famous' scar.
- the philosphers stone is just a normal stone, which harry wants so he can throw it back at voldemort
- Dumbledore puts Harry down on the steps of the dursleys and then rings the bell like 20 times and the quickly runs away, giggling like a schoolgirl.
- Gilderoy Lockhart is a pornstar, who now has to teach math (which is why noone likes him).
- Draco calls Hermione stupid, which she finds so incredibly offensive, that they even have to visit Hagridnto calm her down
- Ron's wand never broke, he simply saw too much McGyver and tried to improve it using ducttape and stuff
- The golden trio enters this phase where they think opposing adults makes you cool, so they start using really shitty insults towards McGonnegall, until she finally acknowledges them and gives them street-cred by deducting half a point fornimproper behaviour.
- Harry Potter never actually does any magic
- Wood isn't the quidditch captain, instead he's the owner of the infomercial station “Wood's super duper shop“ where he sells quidditch supplies and other things that noone really needs
- Harry solves the translation-problems between him and the snake simply by opening the DVD-menu and activating subtitles
- rita skeeter is not only a journalist, but also works for an insurance company, which is why all her interviews so quickly derail towards the certain death of harry potter: she wants to sell him life insurance
- Cedric Diggory is literally “the guy who dies at the end“, and his father actually warns Harry not to befriend him too much, to prevent disapointment later on
- Tom Riddle influenced Dumbledore to try to get closer to his students by becoming a rapper

And my personal favourite:

- neville receives a stupid ball of plastic from a cereal box as birthday-gift from his grandma

**** They tried dubbing it once I think (“harry potter and a stone“), but a large part of the appeal was that coldmirror had a hermione and harry impression that was (in hermione's case) simply spot on or (in harrys case) rven better than the original voice used for the german dub.

The other thing is that she used a lot of puns and joked that really don't translate that well (e.g dumbledore being a rapper: she wrote and sang four or five full albums in the persona of “fresh dumbledore“, which all can be found on youtube seperately from the parody)

*** Somewhat similarly, I read an explanation of how Harry defeated Voldemort as a baby that was essentially: Voldemort accidentally made a magically binding vow to Snape when he said that he wouldn't kill Lily. When Lily offered her life for Harry's the vow recognized that, so when Voldemort tried to kill Harry, magic said no and extracted its price.

** Hermione killing Voldemort just feels thematically off to me. Not because of the Prophecy or anything, but Harry's whole life has been shaped by the looming threat of Voldemort and him being the one who stopped him before, y'know? Some random bint coming in and just wishing he goes away and it actually working are just strange IMO.

Anyway! Read a fic recently where Sirius did kill those muggles. I recall another fic where Sirius was Voldemort's right hand man, if unknowningly. Those were interesting twists, because Sirius is usually placed in such high regard that deviations from that are really interesting and place his character in a different light than 'best uncle ever' to 'suicidal dude who is extremely nostalgic for the good old days'.

This is why I hated Molly killing Bellatrix so much. Neville's life has been shaped so much because of her (+others) torture of his parents. And then Molly just rages and kills her, which I get, but I feel like that should've gone to Neville.

*** I like that idea of twisting SB's role, I remember one fic that gave the Lestranges such a good motivation for going after the Longbottoms that I felt they deserved what happened for them... that was strange.

As to someone other than Harry killing Voldemort: I like the idea of someone actually defeating him with a reasonable plan/proper skills. Free will may be an illusion, but it's not one I want to give up. Definitely not to someone like Trelawney.

** There was a meandering story on Ficwad that included a piece lasting a few chapters about Charlie Weasley rediscovering a water nymph's sacred pool in the Forbidden Forest. He was granted a vision of how the nymph had negotiated with the Founders to establish this as a protected area near their intended castle. I think it may have even been a primary reason for the location being chosen. Somehow this ends up being a catalyst for his finally abandoning his Quidditch ambitions for creature handling.

It was great stuff- moody, meaningful and sexy without being tawdry (though I may not be the best judge of that). I'll see if I can find it when I'm not at work.

** I read a fic a while back where the trio -thanks to a flash of brilliance from Ron- figured out that Harry was a horcrux after defeating and capturing the snatchers. Hermione theorizes that a soul shard can be pushed out of an object by other souls moving into it. So she knocks Harry out then she and Ron murder the snatchers and force their soul shards into Harry's body pushing out Voldemort's soul shard.

Unfortunately the author then teleported Harry to Gotham so that he could have a series of extended (300K words) threesomes with Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy before teleporting back and killing Voldemort. God what a waste of a good setup. I really wish someone would take that premise and make something out of it no matter what it ends up being, It's such a cool little idea.

**** That's the one. I wouldn't put the story on the level of Aurette's stories though.

***** Yeah, Aurette's definitely on another level. I wish Loten would publish another story. Post Tenebras, Lux is probably my favorite SS/HG

** linkffn(the grass is greener by kb0) this might not be right, but I think it's this story where Harry kills Snape and deals with voldemort by dosing them with draught of living death during HBP and leaving them in the cave with the necklace horcrux. Snape is killed because of his unbreakble vow, voldemort isn't dead and Harry puts all the horcrux's in there so they're safe.
