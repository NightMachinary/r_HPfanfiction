Lily Evans. You know what I mean...


** I recall a fic where Lily was pretty deep into obscure and dark magic but I can't find it. The scene I recall was that she was at an illegal magic item swap meet(in disguise) that got raided by aurors. The one that collared her was Sirius and she convinced him to let her escape. Anyone remember this? Definitely on fanfiction.net

Edit: I thought of this one because she seduced Sirius at one point and maybe others

** While the story focuses on Harry, there are lots of flashback and views of Lily Evans being involved in a polyamorous relationship (and also was ridiculously powerful and smart), in To Reach Without by inwardtranscience

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

** I second this...I'd love a Lily who's not just James's housewife but has ambitions of her own and also is kind of a bitch (I mean James kind of grew up a little, but he still was kind of an asshole (at least towards Snape...not that I like Snape, but Snape is that way because of two things: His parents (his father mostly) being assholes (his mom could have left his dad, but she didn't) and the marauders als being assholes and both groups bullying/torturing him!))

*** Yeah there seems to be a gap between the Lily who was in the Slug Club and doing really well and the Lily often presented in stories and even canon. She was a smart and motivated girl who was respected by her professors and peers for her brains...I can't really buy her having no dreams beyond "become wife and have kids". That whole adult generation has the theme of wasted potential. Snape was brilliant and ended up a miserable slave to two masters. James started to grow up and improve as a person and leader and ended up dead. Sirius broke away from tradition, but couldn't get far enough from his family's shadow and rotted in jail for a crime he didn't commit. Lupin was outcast from society for a curse he couldn't control. Peter let fear rule him and ruined a whole bunch of lives. The best most of them got was "martyr to the cause" - they never really got to live.
