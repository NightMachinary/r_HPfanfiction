I'll be honest. I'm terribly bored but my current stories are all up in the air --- I didn't plan them well and I get anxious thinking about it. I'll fix them eventually, though, just not right now.

I really need some mental and creative engagement right about now.

Discord is preferable for contact; I have no problem making a server or something for better organization (I'm a sucker for it).

The stories I tend to learn towards are AU, with some OOCness (if I can help it, they're in character/have the same vibe). I like experimenting, though, so most, if not all, of my stuff, are kind of out there. I'm okay with all genres, ratings, and pairings.

Sorry if this isn't allowed in this sub! Please tell me if it's not.

***** I have ideas if you want me to message them to you. A lot of them are long form, though. And, yes, I do have AO3 but I'm not terribly active. I'm just now getting back into writing. Everything on there right now are already old/outdated and aren't how I write anymore.
