It's a Remus/Harry/Draco story from 2007. I accidentally missed it when I saved all of my favourite fics back in the day and now I can't find it anywhere. If you know it's posted somewhere, or if you kept a copy that you're able to send me, I'd truly appreciate it.


** I sort of have a link for it. Her stories have been pulled from all of the archives, except for a handful of co-authored stories posted under separate pseudonyms (only AO3 to my knowledge makes it easy to list co-authors).

Thus, Magdelena's stories are only on her InsaneJournal. Her IJ is, of course, friends-locked. Here's where it gets strange: I am mutual friends with her, but I still get the "you don't have permission to access this page" notice when I try to click on any of the story links.

That said, the story you want is (allegedly) at [[http://magdelena1969.insanejournal.com/199255.html]]

Good luck.

*** Funnily enough, it's also archived on her livejournal and I am also mutual friends with her and it still gives me the 'you can't access this' message...

I think my only hope will be if someone saved it back then for offline reading and is willing to forward it to me.

**** I did save a bunch of her stories, but not that one. Thus I have a bunch of IJ links that, apparently, aren't really valid. Not sure if it would do any good to send her a message and ask why I, as a mutual friend, still can't view friends-locked entries. I know I don't hang out on IJ anymore, so I don't assume anybody else does either.

*** Thank you though, I really appreciate you trying.
