So I'm about halfway through the most recent chapter of my own fic, and a caustic brew of anxiety and determination is bubbling in the pit of my stomach. Some ostensibly far-out and ridiculous ish is about to happen, but I've been planning it ever since I started writing the story.

Readers might not (some definitely won't) see it that way, but I'm prepared... Sort of.

In any case, it'd be great to read anyone else's experiences with unpopular plot twists/climaxes that they've written. Did you expect the reception that it got? Did reviewers' reactions - if they were especially negative - persuade you to change the course of the plot in any way?


** My OC in Aurors is not naturally brave. She's had to learn on the job. She's a young girl who hasn't seen much violence. So when she sees her first dead body (horrifically mutilated with the heart missing), she loses it a bit and panics. I regard this as a common reaction to gruesome scenes, and made it clear in the scene that although she was frightened, she gathers herself together enough to move forward and spot a rather important clue. I also had other characters (Harry) acknowledge it as a flaw, but have it pointed out to them (by Hermione) that everyone is sheltered compared to him.

Not good enough for the reviewers. They wanted her to kick ass from the start.

I even had someone send me a long and detailed message about how she's a nurse and if one of her students acted like that she'd fire them on the spot.

My OC is flawed, but I knew she'd develop and gradually learn, and now she seems relatively popular. I did try and assure reviewers of this, but I know I lost a few who gave up there and then. I found that I didn't really care enough to change anything I had planned, but I did feel a little hurt. I think having a smart, observant, brave, brilliant at fighting character is fine, but a little flat. I wanted Theia to be book smart and observant, but a little lacking in common sense and life experience. I know she's not for everyone - just like people in real life, you're not going to get on with everyone, but I will admit to being disappointed that that one plot point (minor in the grand scheme of things) was enough to make people give up entirely.

*** For what it's worth, Theia is pretty much the best-written Auror rookie I've ever read, and it's precisely because of how inexperienced yet keen she is. It's the scenes where she chokes or messes up or somehow embarrasses Harry that make the story, IMO.

And Gwenog.

As for that nurse... */shudders/ I think she's part of the reason why I have such a deep-seated fear of hospitals.

*** I haven't read this story, but the last I checked having an OC that kicks ass from the very beginning and has no flaws is almost guaranteed to be a recipe for a disaster. With that in mind, I wouldn't really care about the reviewers who are raising a ruckus about this at all; because really, they aren't worth your disappointment.

Also, the one who commented about being a nurse is flat-out stupid, mostly due to not actually thinking about the difference in circumstances before going holier-than-thou.

** I killed Draco at the end of 400k+ words, with absolutely no warning, right after Harry defeated Voldemort /and/ avoided getting dragged to hell. Given that it's a H/D fic where Harry's love was what gave him the mental strength to overpower Voldemort's possession of him, the reaction was about what you'd expect.

Of course, by that point, there was no changing how things were going and I wouldn't have anyway. I occasionally change a minor point here or there based on reviews, but nothing major because I always have my fics written in full by the time I start posting. If I let reviewer opinions change major plot points, it would lead to re-writing a whole lot of stuff and I'm not willing to do that once I've started posting.

I'd recommend my other fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11767424/1/Butterfly-Wings][Butterfly Wings]], which is a little shorter (still over 300k) but still tragic and better written both in terms of style and story. FPS mostly piles abuse on the characters just for the hell of it (too much so according to several reviewers) while BW is tragic in a more heartbreaking way.

** Not so much a plot point as a style. I don't feel every question I raise as a writer needs to be answered in the text. Peronally I enjoy books that leave me with questions and a sense of wonder. I also loath exposition and try to avoid it where possible.

As an example, my Harry is searching for a new wand in the RoR where the Diadem is. He finds a chest of test wands made by an ancestor of Ollivander. Harry tries the wand, it works and so far doesn't bother to find out what it's made out of.

It is in part a reaction to the tropes where Harry gets a super cool basilisk venom and Voldemort hair fluid core wand made from the gold plated root of Yggdrasil.... I like the idea of my readers wondering what Harry's wand might be, especially when it starts acting oddly.

While there's an interesting conversation to be had on whether Harry was taking control of his life or if he had simply kept playing the game Snape laid out for him, there were plenty of reviewers who thought he should have said, "fuck it," and left.

It was not a vantage point I had ever really considered. Of course, there is a virulent strain of readers who are into independent Harry leaving the shadows of his elders and taking up independence with goblins, but I don't think HBS was ever that kind of story. It was still pretty interesting to see all the reviewers who thought Harry was weak for deciding to stay. Manipulated? Yes. Weak? I didn't expect to see that response.

That's rather interesting, because I read the ending of chapter 45 as a "fuck it" moment. He was pretty set on leaving and said "fuck it, I ain't pussying out."

*** Seeing as your rendition of Hogwarts is pretty gritty from the get-go, I'd say that weak it's totally the wrong word to use there.

Even if it was a decision coming from the place of a broken spirit, Harry in HBS can and has been stone-cold and ruthless towards those who he regards as allies... that's hardly weak.

If/when I decide to post something, I would take constructive criticism seriously, but I wouldn't re-write an entire plot point just because some people don't like it. And as a reader, I can say that I've never stopped reading a story because of a plot twist that I didn't like.

** I killed Snape at the end of a Snape/Harry fic. Needless to say, if you're writing ship fic, it's not a popular move to kill off one half of your pairing. Your natural audience will be horrified and not inclined to forgive you, and readers who once trusted you will be hesitant to take a chance on your work after that.

I actually chose that ending because it fit the theme and I couldn't write the story I wanted to write due to word count limitations (this was for a fest). The full-length fic with the original ending is five times as long, and while Snape is still alive at the end, it calls into question whether his survival - and what it means for Harry - is really a better fate.

Death fic is always a hard sell, though. Most readers consider it too much of a downer.

****** Whoa, you recognize my name? That's unexpected. And extremely flattering, especially coming from this part of HP fandom. :)

The Lost World may or may not be satisfying because it does pull the rug out from under reader expectations. It's based more on a fairytale/folklore sense of logic and fate - the darker tradition, where breaking your promise has consequences - than on standard HP tropes, which means the whole fic is a bit strange. The predominant magic is borrowed from older tales like Tam Lin and isn't as whimsical as the usual Potter style.

Aw, it's nice to be missed! I mostly lurk and dabble in fandom these days, although I never stop hoping that I'll find the wherewithal to write again. Or rather, finish all the things I started. Life has been rough for the past few years, and I haven't had the time or energy - the easy pleasure in dreaming up stories and playing with words - that I need in order to write well. Or at all, actually. I'm trying to write a smut fic right now because I assumed it would be self-indulgent and simple enough, and that finishing it might break my writer's block. Gah. Wrong. Nothing involving words is ever easy. Even PWPs require concentration.

I haven't looked at the long version of Lost World for a while, but I really should revise it and get it out there. It's got scenes and moments I really like, and the ending is ... interesting. I'd be curious to hear whether it works for people.

There are so many people I miss, people who made my HP experience a giddy thing full of wonderful stories and heated discussion. And yes, agreed, I too have a very decided preference when it comes to the Snape/Harry dynamic. I want them to work for it and I want the hostility between them to be an issue. I don't want their relationship to be mellow and comfortable. They're both damaged, albeit in different ways, and their shared history is a minefield. That dynamic used to be more common. I enjoy happy endings as much as the next person, but I prefer having my heart ripped out on the way to being healed.

** For my fic at the moment, the biggest tantrums I have received - and I definitely view them as tantrums in this because, as they're childish and ridiculous - were from an "unexpected" scene where Harry kisses Blaise some way into the fic.

For some reason, this scene was COMPLETELY unexpected, despite the fact that for the last two years at Hogwarts, Harry had regularly displayed attraction to both boys and girls, and it had even been outright discussed by him and Hermione.

For the fic, I'm going to be portraying more realistic teenage relationships - basically Harry and other teenagers are regularly getting into Oh-So-Serious and not so serious relationships and then breaking apart, because that's what teenagers do.

I'm aware that by the end of the series, when Harry is not in a relationship with anyone, there'll be irritation from the readers who are currently demanding that Harry, Luna and Blaise all get married together.

Because that's TOTALLY realistic.

Ships aside, I think other things will upset some readers - I'm killing off some favourite characters of both my own and the readers, and there's not going to be an out-and-out happy ending. I think there'll always be readers who get angry at that sort of thing.

But for the most part, I think ANY plot point will be well-received by the majority of your readers if it's executed well - focus on how you're writing and how it affects your plot. The more sensitive readers who throw tantrums and leave will only leave ONE review - the readers who keep going will leave you more, you know?

Their fight /really/ pissed of my readers. Still, I'm happy I wrote it. It is the whole plot to show their growth, which means showing where they started.

Seriously though I had one particular reader get very passionate that Harry deserved to go to Azcaban, and at the least never be an auror. I did my best to explain and in the end we had a very calm discussion but he felt the story was ruined.

** I have so many to choose from...

I'd guess the most discontent was created when Holly discovered she'd been mutated by the ordeal of fighting against the basilisk and then being cured by phoenix tears. The reveal was intentionally gruesome, but I found a particular division between male and female readership on this point: many guy readers said 'I'm outta here!' while for the most part the girls were 'Gee, thanks for reminding me of how it felt during my first period, jerk.' But then they'd keep reading.

How I felt: this was where I wanted to go. Every other story had magical influences giving the MC superpowers with no downside at all. I wanted to explore dark magic where the side effects really put into question whether the benefit was worth it.

Eventually the whole story turned into an allegory for a girl's (metaphoric) lifecycle, but that was the start of it and I was willing to lose readership to go where others feared to tread. Otherwise what was the point- make yet another ho-hum empowerment fantasy?

** It wasn't a huge reaction, because I don't have a huge amount of readers on any of my fics, but in my first finished and posted HP fic, I had a few readers who got annoyed enough to start an argument in the comments. I assume they left, because they never commented again.

The story was a post-Hogwarts AU Lucius/Hermione, Draco/Ginny wangsty romance piece. The readers in question were angry because, for literally three lines, Lucius and Ginny interacted. Ginny was flippant, Lucius was fragile, and Hermione was inwardly horrified at her behaviour. The readers weren't happy because they felt Ginny was justified in being flippant, and in fact could be a total bitch to him without being out of line, considering what he had done to her. This was addressed later in the fic, but they didn't know that. I didn't really expect anyone to react to it simply because it was a /very/ brief moment.

I totally understand where they were coming from - but I wouldn't change it. It would have derailed the fic to address Ginny and Lucius's past history at that time, and I still think they all acted within the confines of their characters as I understand them. I'm sorry people got upset (and started attacking each other over it, leading me to delete all of the comments), but I can't write a story if I'm spending all my time worrying that people might get upset. Things in real life aren't always PC and fair, so they're not always going to be in stories, either, or else the stories won't be realistic.

All anyone can do is try to make the best choices they can for the story and then stick by it. If people get upset - it's a risk you take no matter what you write. The greatest disservice we can do to our stories is not be confident in them and stand by them. Sure, everyone has room for improvement and should be open to constructive criticism, but there's also a time to stick to your guns, readers being angry about the events of the story for no other reason than their opinion is one of those times.

This highlights what I think is a bit of a problem in fanfic readers--a lot of them seem to expect problems to get solved /asap/. This is pure theory, but in reading books there's the expectation that a problem will be solved by the end of the story so you're content to read it all and see where the problem's solution comes, but with fanfic where you're getting chapter-by-chapter updates (unless you read it later) there seems to be an expectation of problems being solved not long, or even immediately, after they're presented.

I wonder if they forget that there's a whole story to be told and it can't all be done in one chapter. Or if they want the details of a story without the effort of reading--I just remembered a reviewer I had who sent me PMs asking if certain things would happen, or how the relationships between certain conflicting characters would evolve, and all the questions were things that would be answered /in the story/ once I got that far.

Readers need to remember that stories are meant to create questions and present issues, but you can't expect an author to answer and resolve them immediately. At least wait until the story is finished before complaining about an author failing to deliver in some way.

I'll play the devil's advocate for a bit there and say that, in their defence, way too many fanfic authors never actually get to solving those problems if they don't do it as soon as they happen and have the story progressing as the problem automatically got solved by fuck-if-we-know-what because it's inconvenient for them to actually try resolving it in-story (for whatever reason). With that, the expectations change, and though the /good/ authors tend not to do stuff as stupid as that, the amount of bad authors is far greater than the amount of good authors and many people do read even rubbish before they actually get to reading the better stuff and start rejecting the bad.

In other words, it's bad that it happens and it should not be happening and the authors should not pander to that particular ... viewpoint of some of their readers, but the fact that people want that is not /wholly/ unjustified.

Although, of course, some readers simply are that immature and aren't capable of following the plot whatsoever. That happens too, and those ones have no excuse.
