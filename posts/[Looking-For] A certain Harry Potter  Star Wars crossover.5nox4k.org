A harry potter/star wars fanfic in which harry potter has an elaborate spy system where he has set up many pubs and gambling rings that many criminals visit. They gamble anything from credits to ships. Along with this, harry has the place bugged with listening charms so he will be able to gather Intel. I am unable to find this fanfic again. Thanks for any help redditors!!!!

  They had no use for his skills as a shadow assassin, but maybe the next word would. He was a weapon, a blade to be used against the dark, nothing more and nothing less. Super powered, and skilled Harry Potter in the Star Wars universe. T for language and violence. beta'ed by Mad about the Boro
