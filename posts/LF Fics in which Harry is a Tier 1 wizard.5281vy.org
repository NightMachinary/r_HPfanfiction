Hey guys, I know that this request is often made, so please excuse the repetitiveness. Anyway, after finally reading "Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived", I got interested on how Harry was shaping to be a wizard compared with the likes of Grindelwald or Dumbledore (and I really liked how Harry unknowingly quotes Tom Riddle about Dark Magic in front of his brother). What I'm looking for are similar fics, in which Harry (through hard work and study; him being the second coming of Merlin, doing amazing magic without any effort is boring) has outstanding results.

Possibly no harem fics, thanks.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Linkffn(The house of Potter rebuilt) is literally what you're looking for. Disregard the name because it doesn't have anything to do with nobility and stuff related to it.

Linkffn(School Spirit by StoryEnvy;The Lightsaber by Tellemicus Sundance) the former is another on the way to OP Potter. Too bad it seems like it is abandoned. It has been quite a while since the author updated. The latter is complete and it took SW concepts and applied it to the HP universe. OP Potter isn't infalliable and he caused huge mistakes during the story.

  Harry Potter wasn't surprised to learn he was a wizard. He'd been dreaming of wizards and magic for years. He was just surprised at what sort of wizard he was. Prologue is identical to "Death and Dreams". Dresden Files crossover.

  A childhood love, combined with magical experimentation, and a determination to see his project brought to life. This was all it took to change the world...forever. (A/N: Based on numerous reviews, 'suspension of belief' is evidently required to enjoy this story)
