Ever since the whole Black!Hermione fan art explosion, and recent developments in the casting of [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35149864][Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]], Hermione's appearance (and to a certain point, her background) has been a contentious topic among a few of us. Feelings have been caught, uproars have been roared, and childhoods have reportedly been ruined.

But is it really that deep?

Yesterday (or today, depending on where you live) a poster made a request for Black!Hermione fics. The vast majority of posters did not even bother to do so - instead, they chose to debate whether it was even plausible/necessary, or just used the thread to air their frustrations about the casting/SJWs or whatever (thankfully, the latter were very few and far between).

Don't get me wrong; there are requests that I don't personally gel with, and I absolutely loathe bashing requests, but when I see them I avoid them. No downvotes, and no "this is bad and you should feel bad".

To make myself clear, while we are just one part of the larger HP community, this is the fanfic subreddit. This is where readers and authors alike have the agency to be creative and share their own interpretations and re-interpretations of characters. Slash? Sure. Gender-swap? Why not! So skin colour really shouldn't be that outrageous of a thing in fics, especially when Muggle-isms like racial discrimination against other humans - regardless of their magical status - is wisely avoided.

Anyway... that's just, like, my opinion, man. So: thoughts?


** I don't think there's anything wrong with Black!Hermione at all. Being white isn't necessary to her character because race doesn't really matter in the wizarding world, so being white, or black, or Asian doesn't affect her one bit. The only thing I find somewhat annoying is Rowling claiming that Hermione has always been race-less instead of just owning it and saying that this particular adaptation of HP features a black Hermione because Noma Dumezweni is a great actress, instead of trying to claim Hermione is this ethnic everywoman in the original series. That strikes me as a cynical marketing move.

As for the world of fanfiction, I don't think Black Hermione should be a big deal, since this is a world where Hermione can fall in love with Bellatrix and Harry can be impregnated by Draco. When we really stop and analyse the ideas of having one of the most morally upstanding people in the series be sexually attracted to a magic super-Nazi and male pregnancy, Hermione being black suddenly doesn't seem all that strange.

Edited for spelling.

This really puts it into perspective. I have a high opinion of JKR, so I hope that it really isn't /just/ a marketing ploy (but then again, there's a play and a movie and who-knows-what-else coming out). Either way, it's helped to show that the idea is no less absurd than, say, slash. Definitely less-so than MPreg.

Yeah, I have no issues with the casting- I'm sure she'll do a great job and make a great Hermione! But I think it's strange and a little deceitful how JKR is acting coy and pretending she didn't write/imagine Hermione as white. Hermione is described in a manner consistent with her being white in the books (white faced in fear instead of going paler, tan from the summer instead of darker from the sun), illustrated by JKR as white, the book artwork is white, the movie actress is white, the nonwhite characters are explicitly stated to be so... Just say something honest along the lines of, "I'd written and imagined her as white. But I absolutely love this casting and I think it's a great interpretation of the character."

I'm not sure that is what's happening. I understood her tweets as a statement of support for the casting choice and as a statement that it's alright with her for fans to imagine Hermione however they want to. Maybe she did imagine Hermione as white, but I think she also appreciates that her fans may not have read Hermione as white themselves.

#+end_quote

You're right: one advantage this subreddit has over [[/r/HarryPotter]] is that the posters here are less constrained by canon. JKR can say/tweet/post whatever she wishes and it won't change my view of Hermione from my own personal headcanon: a clever, if abrasive first generation witch who displays an amazing capacity for empathy and outstanding loyalty in the face of hopeless odds. I don't need anything else to be true about her. Skin pigmentation and racial identity are the least important qualities for an author to emphasize in an effort to get me to empathize with a character.

In my fanfiction universe, I've filled in quite a few biographical details of several characters with qualities that I hope are unique and that readers enjoy. If someone likes what I've done, I hope they let me know. If not (and their criticisms are respectfully phrased), I'm happy to listen to someone else's viewpoint.

*Anyone else is free to do the same.* I believe the plastic nature of fanfiction to be sacrosanct and I'm disgusted whenever someone uses canon as a bludgeon to enforce their worldview on others. In the current fiasco - which will be all but forgotten by everyone except a few ideologues in a month - /both sides/ are guilty of trying to use a children's book series to advance their agenda. I want to emphasise that again: /both sides/ are guilty of attempting to marry the Harry Potter series to their own political ideal.

I was introduced to my first Harry Potter book while working a seasonal job in a toy store. I'd read (and often poorly act out) portions of the newly printed Goblet of Fire to other people's kids while their parents shopped the nearby shelves. It's heartbreaking to think that a series that I saw bring so much /joy/ to children of such wildly different backgrounds is being used by /both sides/ to make political hay. I hope the 'outraged' ideologues who are making such a fuss both for /and/ against the current issue soon grow bored and leave us in peace.

*** Totally agree with you on this - especially the part about both sides using the book to their own ends.

The first book I read was the /Prisoner of Azkaban/ - I was nine. My friends and I had wildly different interpretations of the characters and the world itself - even back then. The series means so much to all of us in many different ways, and fan-works often show how varied our imaginings are. No one should be shamed for that.

** Its true that the skin color was never really specified (with one little exception that doesn't proof anything). But with the casting of Emma Watson, you did something to the character and people ought to recognize that. Not the books, but the movies gave the character of Hermione Granger an ethnic identity. Thats the Character designer in me talking. The character designer that is confident in his opinion that a character is more than the lines in the first case of his appearance. A character is a process that doesn't stop with the ending of the source material. MAking her black all of a sudden does inevitably end in shock for a lot of people who had a clear image in their heads.

In all honesty, I don't know that actress and I have close to no interest in the Cursed Child, but my (cynical) brain screams "MARKETIIIIING". Because, lets be honest, how many outlets would have written about Harry Potter and the Cursed Child? Close to none that normaly don't report about plays. Now that we have that "outrage", a lot more newspapers, blogs and personal feeds write about this. And coming from that industry I /know/ that marketers are ruthless enough to use ethnicity and problems like racism, xenophobia and bigotry in general as powerful tools to boost their range (as long as they can position themselves and their product on the good side of things).

So, taking a character that was probably white in the heads of the majority of readers in the west (since whites are the majority and hence, given how ethnic identity works, Hermione was probably a white girl for them), and making her black /after/ declaring her as white in the movies, stinks to the high heavens like, what I like to call, outrage-marketing.

When it comes to my personal feelings, I can only say that "black" Hermione probably won't register as the Hermione of the books in my head. Since 1998 (release date german translation), Hermione Granger was as pale as a snowflake in my head. Thats 17 years of a fixed image in my brain. While I don't really care one way or the other, when you say "Hermione Granger" there will be a face somewhere between Emma Watson and my teenage crush coming into my head (so, probably CulturalBavarianPersian!Hermione, since my first crush came from an iranian family with four generations of living in Austria... anyway).

The biggest annoyance with this whole thing is the celebration of the second coming of Christine de Pizan going on at tumblr. But then again, most third wave feminists/professional victims/slayers of cisscum, probably don't know who that is.

*** re: Its true that the skin color was never really specified (with one little exception that doesn't proof anything).

I apologize to the blackhermione thread OP, I was only responding to a question in there about quotes- but it probably pulled attention away from the request. But given we're nerds here I'll repost some additional quotes I put in a comment in the fantasy thread. By numbers there are 3 white faces (that I found), 1 pale, many pink- but the ones quoted are shades of pink/comparisons that seem unlikely on darker skin.

"white skin was never specified"

"Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree." PoA Ch. 21

‘But -- but where? How?' said Hermione, whose face was white. OotP Ch. 22

"Hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff. She had been exceptionally quiet all day. Having hurtled, white-faced, up to Harry outside the hospital wing" HBP Ch. 19

"Ron's left side and his face stood out, greyish white,.... " "......Hermione, who was also rather pale; she no longer looked like Mafalda," DH Ch. 14

"Neville was pink and trembling... ...said Snape coldly, and Hermione went as pink as Neville." PoA Ch. 7

"Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room, pink-faced" PoA Ch. 8

"Hermione said this very quickly, and blushed so deeply that she was the same colour as Parvati's robes." ("robes of shocking pink") GoF Ch. 23

Can white and pink be used for effect rather than literal- of course. Those were as well, but they do hint (IMO strongly) towards skin- not once that I found were pink, white, pale etc. used except in Caucasian characters (done LOADS of times).

So the thing that gets me is the quote which is just dishonest.

Fanfics or a play- great go for it. But if they made an animated movie or tv show and they decided to say Hannah Abbot is only described as pink faced and blonde pigtailed- never white skinned and draw her black/middle eastern/indian/asian/polynesian then I will call that stupid. Similarly if Hermione was drawn as black or said never to been white and open for interpretation then that needlessly clashes with the majority of peoples perceptions. Again in a cartoon or fanfic if they did a back story and somehow made Hermiones race and upbringing relative then that might work- but then I don't care about the muggle world. Unless she is turned into the main character which generally I'm not big on (and the films already boosted her to greater prominence.)

After seeing [[http://www.theguardian.co.uk/books/shortcuts/2015/dec/21/hermione-granger-black-noma-dumezwani-harry-potter-cursed-child][several articles]] which claimed that Hermione's race was never settled in canon, I just assumed it to be true. I should have been more skeptical.

Thank you to [[/u/rbc999]] for finding these examples as I did not remember that Hermione's race was so /blatant/ throughout the series. The Black!Hermione posters are guilty of wishful thinking and of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3xqqi3/jk_rowling_says_black_hermione_is_canonsuck_it/][weaponizing their feelings]] in an effort to make others endorse their viewpoint.

It is still my firm belief that the instigators of this current kerfuffle will soon grow bored and find another fandom that they feel needs fixing through artificial diversification.

***** ...I just found out about this last night, because one of my BFFs was all, "I told you so! Hermione is black!" I have pictured Hermione as many different women, and I only ever thought about her being black when one of my friends pointed out that her race isn't really overtly stated, quite a few years ago when having a discussion about white washing in popular culture. And all of these examples of her having a white face from fear, or a red face from embarrassment/other emotions...that doesn't really negate black!Hermione, as much as the fact that since JK specified "Indian" and "Black" for other characters, why not for Hermione? If she really wanted the characters to be colorless, they would have been colorless, but they're not, and this whole issue seems like a big deal when really, who the fuck cares? I mean...it's a fucking play. I really don't give a shit. Has anyone here read any of her stuff that WASN'T HP? I mean, even book 7 sucked IMO, and that adult book she wrote was a steaming pile of crap. I'm not going to go see the play even if they managed to cast Hermione with a fucking Chiss actress.

**** Is it dishonest or is it just a Flint? JKR is kinda known for not remembering some concrete facts from her own books, she's not an obsessive fantasy author like some who obsess over every little detail and date. She's an idea person, and I think she genuinely welcomes the idea that fans interpret her world and characters in all sorts of ways. She's really nice about fanfiction, for instance.

So I think it's genuinely possible that she forgot she did describe Hermione's skin occasionally throughout the books. She's not huge on description for her characters anyways, I'm still not sure we know what color Ron's eyes are, for instance.

I don't see it as selling out. She's just trying to say she's cool with whatever interpretations people come up with on stuff that doesn't matter to her greatly, and Hermione's skin color is one of those things.

** Fan fiction is a huge multiverse sandbox. If someone wants to write a story with a non-canon premise, and make it wildly AU, that's their prerogative.

Want to reimagine Hogwarts as a group of Bedouin tribesmen handing down the secrets of pre-Islamic beliefs? Be my guest!

Want to reimagine the golden trio as a group of Haitian refugees living in Mexico? Go right ahead!

Rewriting the HP universe as one in which opposite sex relations are purely for procreation, and same sex relations are for love and pleasure? Let me hand you your keyboard.

I'm not sure I'd be interested in reading a story founded upon any of these ideas, but I'm thankful that there are people willing to think outside the box with a story premise, /even if it's one that I'm not personally interested in./

1. This sub is smaller meaning you can often have more productive discussions because posts aren't drowned out by sheer volume.

2. The perspective fanfic writers/readers have on canon is different to the general fan, and often far more in-depth (because fanfic fans tend to have much greater knowledge of the universe than casual fans).

*** Valid, without a doubt. The issue arises where said discussions end up derailing a fic request. We can debate canon until the Hippogriffs come home - it's something that we all enjoy doing to various extents - but those debates have a time and a place.

When someone asks, "I'd like to read XYZ. Is there anything like it?" and the general response is, "Why the heck would you want to read XYZ? People need to get XYZ out of their heads... stop politicising my shit, goddammit!" it's defeating the purpose of the thread - and the flair tag, to boot.

As I stated in the OP, there are fics that won't always suit the tastes of every reader. And yet, we know when to steer clear of those threads. A slash/mpreg/Fem!Harry request might (almost definitely will) be downvoted by some, but the OPs' requests are rarely flat-out ignored.

And finally when a OP's request goes ignored for 24 hours (least amount of time you can expect mostly have seen the post) then it might just be because no-one else knows anything similar.

** Well, I was the one that posted that request, thinking that maybe I'd net an original take on something nobody even considered to change around. Hell, I've seen Male!Hermione fics before, even wrote a short or two using that exact thing as a premise, but reading a fanfic where a major character (not just Hermione) had a different skin color from the actor playing them in the movies? Nope.

When you think about it, that play on perspectives alone changes some things, especially when character backgrounds come into play. For example, if Hermione's black, was she the target of racism before ever hearing about Hogwarts?

Does she come from a cultural background that, while distinctly English, still exhibits traditional values that either revered magic (shamans) or considered wizards and witches the same way Daleks consider everything non-Dalek?

How does she cope with going from a society still struggling with its behavior during its Empire days to one that completely dismisses the achievements and atrocities committed by their muggle brethren when conquering a full half or more of the goddamn planet? One that completely dismisses what her ancestors had to put up with when fighting for or against the Empire-probably even within living memory through grandparents fighting in the Wars (hey, nineties remember ? Still quite a number of WW1 vets kicking around then and the WW2 vets had mostly just hit their seventies and early eighties-which is not even counting the fifties, which were by all accounts Interesting Times to be a part of The Empire).

I really didn't expect /nobody/ to have actually tackled this.

Three quarter of a million fics and none of the ones that did this were memorable enough to warrant a mention. I don't know whether to salivate at the juicy opportunity or facepalm in despair.

Because, despite the controversy inherent to such a thing (and I fully expect to be trampled if I actually do attempt it, since I very much don't believe I could tackle it with the attention it deserves... yet), the sheer amount of ways you can tie this in with British History, Hermione's perspective on what is going on with the Wizarding World & how she deals with it and, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, how she could discover that her family's history with regards to magic goes much, /much/ farther back than the founding of Hogwarts, makes the potential here awesome beyond measure...

As long as you give it the attention it deserves. Otherwise, may you somehow manage to bury it lest you get severely burned for coming across as a racist/apologist asshole.

TL;DR: Request this, nobody did it. Am kinda surprised, but not. Now trying to desperately absorb enough history to do the concept justice and not get myself exiled from the internet for getting it wrong.

**** Well, if it doesn't bother people and inspire others, then it isn't fiction in general or fanfiction in particular.

Fanfiction writers don't get payment or attention outside of very specific circles, often the same ones they were in back when they were simple lurkers slowly getting the bug.

So what's the motivation?

For me, it's elaboration and perspective.

Even a series such as Harry Potter, which chronicles a full seven year journey of a wizard from childhood to adulthood with an astounding amount of depth, only has so much space it can devote to what the actual effects going on behind the scenes really are. Plot holes and inconsistencies do exist and the actual groundwork for the series (namely, the first wizarding war) barely rates a mention at the best of times despite the sheer amount of influence it exerts on the story as a whole.

So what do you do when you're not just sandboxing the whole thing? You're adding that depth, throwing the detail into focus, giving the world chugging along in the background the attention it deserves.

The Wizarding world is, despite its best efforts, interconnected with the muggle one on a fundamental level. The pounds received by Gringotts have to go somewhere. The steady (if small) influx of muggleborn have to have an effect on wizarding society at some stage if radio or steam engines are anything to go by. Fanfiction writers illustrate this through their interpretation of things, though admittedly to varying degrees of success.

Now if the wizarding world is interconnected with the muggle one despite the (official) obliviousness of the muggle world (which, given the mere existence of intelligence agencies specialising in tracking organisations that live & breathe secrecy, how closely children are monitored by public institutions on a daily basis in European countries, the sheer value even a half-trained wizard would have in shaping a battlefield and the rather large number of muggleborn shown to be discriminated against as a matter of course from age eleven onwards, is something that I don't believe for a second), how does that reflect on the history of Britain, a nation that can trace its roots right back to the Roman Empire?

Littlewhitecat does a magnificent job of illustrating this through his interpretation of what Potter Manor may well look like-and how the National Trust is likely to react to getting wind of a pureblood house's ancestral manor. This is a microcosmic view of how the wizarding and muggle world are likely to interact with one another given the barriers of near-complete ignorance and accusations of madness that are likely to ensue.

Most of the arguments stem from the fact that racial discrimination on the basis of skin tone isn't a thing in the HP 'verse. This is a truism. True, it isn't shown in canon at all. True, it doesn't seem to have any discernible impact on the children that attend Hogwarts at all. But once again, background comes into play.

It is quite difficult to quantify the effect one's background has on how people interact with society.

Indeed, one of the more famous principles of modern European society is the utter and complete eradication of such effects. The ideal is that neither color nor creed nor beliefs would impact the prospects any one person has with regards to their future in the western world. All are equal and equally responsible for their actions. It is something that I hold dear to my heart.

But that also makes anything that tries to tackle just how different people from different backgrounds relate and interact with society something you just don't address lightly.

In short, perspectives that are different due to a person having a background, whatever said background may be, that influences how they perceive things?

Very very tricky. Get it wrong and you're screwed. Hell, get it right and you could end up being just as screwed depending on who and/or what you're writing about.

What's happening here is a perfect example of this. Tackling gender, behaviour etc are fine because they are distinctly fantastic. Character up and switches gender, gets turned into an animal, somehow taps into magical radiation that makes them the magical version of Superman? Sure, that's fine. Get raised by capitalist wolves in the Kalahari? Hell, why not?

Have the Weasleys turn out to be jewish? Um...

Hermione's black all of a sudden? Not comfy.

Harry's actually been suffering from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder since the age of 14 and nobody in St Mungo's knows how to deal with this? Oh fuck.

Have a muggleborn suicide-bomb the Ministry of Magic? Your inbox is going to implode with the sheer number of people wanting to express how much they hate you for that.

See, these are delicate things to tackle when you're simply reporting factual issues. A lot of fantasy writers only really venture into such waters when it is very clear that the world they're writing about is in no way connected to this one. And even then there are issues that arise because of this.

So when you broach such a sensitive topic in a fanfic about a novel/movie series that is very specifically set in a modern Western country, you better know what the hell you are talking about.

The sheer amount of ways in which broaching real-life hotbutton issues in an HP fanfic can go wrong are absolutely astounding-and that's not even getting into the number of people who are going to be pissed at someone having the sheer audacity to try and tackle it that way.

The mere idea set off a discussion that had a mod intervene because it was getting out of hand. Imagine what a fic that actually tried to depict such things would do. It would definitely be far more controversial than the fanart, not that that hadn't exactly gone over unnoticed there either.

It bothers people because these are real life issues. Real life issues /every/ person has an opinion about, ranging from 'don't give a shit' to 'come the revolution, you're the first against the wall, comrade'. As a result, the number of people that have actually had to confront the ideas and experiences that are likely to be brought forward in a fanfic of all places is going to absolutely goddamn skyrocket. And none of them will match up with anyone else's.

What you're seeing here is simply what happens when someone introduces a sensitive topic to an area seemingly purpose-built for dreaming and escapism. It's controversial enough to be a flamewar in the making and open to vast amounts of 'oh no you didn't!' moments.

But if it bothers people, good. Fanfiction's all about elaboration and perspective. Every time you read a good fic that does nothing but describe character interaction or how worlds collide in crossovers, you develop said perspective just a little bit more.

And this is a very /interesting/ perspective to take, which makes my fanfic writing senses tingle.

Does it bother people? Good. Is it going to be hard? Alright. Can the amount of potential depth it actually adds to the HP 'verse make up for the sheer difficulty of doing the concept justice?

Oh hell the fuck yes. The sheer amount of background and depth of character it potentially adds to a main character /without having to alter a single word of canon/ is fucking amazing. The way it could shed a light on a hitherto unconsidered part of British history (like, say, who the first black british citizens actually were, what they did in the UK before and after the Empire and how rocky their relationship with the average Brit/Scot/Welshman/Irishman tends to be-bear in mind that this is University-level History of the United Kingdom type of stuff that you're going to thoroughly research before /shoving it into a fanfic/) and how that resonates in the Wizarding World is pretty crazy.

I'm a big fan of this type of thing. An HP fanfic that tackles British History and how it affects the wizarding world at the turn of the millenium would probably be even better, but hey, this is pretty great too.

And can I have a link to your fic(s) please? They sound like fun. Or did you give them to me already? If that's the case, I'll check them out tomorrow. It's 1:30 in the morning here and I'm coming down from a writing high. Peace out and thanks for your input-not to mention the reiteration, complex and rambling though the response may be.

***** I think you're overstating the extent to which it bothers people, and also falsely diagnosing /why/ it bothers people.

I dislike black Hermione for the same reason I dislike wizards using guns - it brings the Muggle into the magical. The whole point of blood prejudice is that it's a magical equivalent for racial discrimination - an allegory. It's just clumsy storytelling to have an allegory coexisting with the thing it is supposed to represent. But aside from all that, it also just dilutes that which interests me about Harry Potter - the magical world. If I wanted to read about the Muggle world and Muggle issues, I'd read literary fiction.

I also think you're importing a rather American perspective on race into Britain. As I've said elsewhere, if you really wanted to cram a "discrimination" theme down the reader's throat by piling up prejudices, the most thematically powerful change would be making Hermione a Pakistani Muslim, not a black girl.

****** While I respect your opinion for not liking the concept (though I still disagree for reasons but that's besides the point), it hardly speaks for everyone. Some readers simply don't want to imagine Hermione as a non-white person.

That's their prerogative, of course, but the readers who would enjoy such a story don't need to be slammed for it. Doing so is the same as winding up slash-lovers. In the same way that slash isn't objectively bad writing, neither is this.

I understand that we aren't talking about slash fics alongside a debate about a play with a script exploring explicit Snarry, but the earlier fanart business produced a smaller, though similar backlash.

**** Well, it is a picture perfect rendition of a secondary alteration. One that doesn't necessarily alter or impact the plot itself at all, but can affect the perspective the character has on a situation in a big way.

The whole reason I said awesome beyond measure is because while the potential for more than slight alterations beyond the potently absurd are... well... absurd, the little details it changes and that you can add to her character do shed a very different light on stations in canon.

Another typical Hermione example of this would be the Grangers living & working in Oxford. Doesn't really change anything on the surface, right?

Wrong.

See, 'Grangers living in Oxford' implies 'Hermione going to school in Oxford', which again changes a great deal of assumptions you can make about her character.

Her peers and rivals at school before Hogwarts would have often been extremely intelligent & diligent in their own right. They were also fiercely driven by either parents or the desire for approval to spend as much time as possible studying up on subjects.

These are children of parents who knew how to design, build & operate a space station from scratch but had trouble relating to anyone outside of their IQ range for very long. Hermione talks like a thesaurus because, to her, /that is how normal children talk/ and she just assumes the wizards to be... well, crazy really.

Academically, they all have/had something to prove and were willing to go to great lengths to do so at a very young age.

For her, the house system is nothing new except that she'd experienced it not on a Gryff/Raven/Slyth/Huff level, but on an /individual/ one. Everyone was on a quest to show up everybody else through the medium of schoolwork. Cooperation was stifled whilst competition thrived. Bullying and intimidation were, again, common amongst the desperate ones that fell behind, which leads her to pity Malfoy at first.

It's also how she's one of the few that actually finds what she's looking for in the library. Tomes written hundreds of years ago in a localised variant of Latin were things she used to puzzle over when trying to read up on her history books' source material.

It also handily explains why she's confident as hell going in but ready to quit after a month. Centuries-old institution, excellent reputation, Architecture to match-to her, she probably thought she was stepping into a magical version of her home town's University. It's only when she meets the people and the teachers disappoint her that she realizes that she'd just gone from Countdown to crazytown.

Her sticking to it after that, making friends and everything-up to and including the whole 'near death experience' thing-is what distances her from her muggle origins. Truth be told, if she'd gone to MIT, ANU or any other University other than Oxford, then the transition would have been much the same as she comes into contact with people that haven't spent their entire lives dedicated to the goal of A-grading in a class stuffed with geniuses out for something to prove.

By the time she graduates Hogwarts, her early days serve her well battling for position in the Ministry, since even little Timmy the Perpetual Disappointment To His Ultra-well-known Scientist Father could run rings around the average pureblood bureaucrat.

Now how do things change if she's raised in eighties SoHo?

That's fixing one unknown variable into place. There are dozens of these, if not hundreds, whose implied side-effects are just as wide-ranging for the character's behaviour, approach and perspective to events taking place within a fic.

You're not making her OP or changing anything substantial about her. You're adding history, explanations for behaviour, history where nobody else has and probably never will. The implications small changes can have when considering a character can be staggering, which is why this came off as such a big thing from my perspective. It's not, unless you drill down to that level of detail and build up from there.

*** I think you're trying to solve what the biggest problem with this kinda story is. I doubt many writers are very knowledgeable about what a black!hermione would have to go through or the black history she would have known/learned, and without it becoming a crack!fic that's kinda important knowledge. Even with most of a million fics out there, the supply of capable writers is minute, and I think the demand is also significanly less. Not that I wouldn't be interested in reading this, but I can't say that I'd thought to look for it before.

** White!Zabini is still a thing, despite knowing he's black in canon since HBP (2005). People will write what they like regardless so the whole discussion is moot I think.

I have no intention of seeing the play anyway. Canon declined after POA and died with Sirius for me. While I'm okay with fics using aspects from the last two books to some extent, I generally ignore fics that really emphasize being compliant with those, and there's still plenty being written that suits my tastes.

I think the entire play is a bad idea. With the actors all looking so different people will get upset regardless of what they do. The new movie is a far better tactic, it's set in a completely different time period so there's no issue with not having the same actors since the characters won't even be the same.

** I don't mind stories where things are changed, after all that's the main point of fanfiction. But personally, I don't like it when something is changed 'just because.' If you're going to change race, gender, etc. I think you should either have a reason, or make it matter somehow, and that you should communicate it to the reader. If you don't have a reason, and it doesn't actually matter in the story, then why did you make that change? And if as a reader, I can't see that, then it just feels odd.
