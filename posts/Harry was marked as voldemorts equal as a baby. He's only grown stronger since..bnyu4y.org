** "Robe me, Wormtail."

"Yes my Lord."

"Now explain, in detail, why you shouldn't die for not using Harry Potter's blood in the ritual?"

"I'm terribly sorry, my Lord, but he is too powerful and strong for me. Besides, it was much easier asking Dumbledore for the blood. All I did was dress up like a Muggle and knocked on the Hogwarts gate. The fool believed my story of needing blood donation. He /willingly/ gave me all the blood."

"You mean to tell me," Voldemort's voice was devoid of all emotion, "that the blood you used was /willingly given/?"

"Yes, exactly my Lord."

Voldemort used all of his occlumency in an effort to not kill the slimy rat on the spot.

"And why is Harry too powerful for you? He is a fourteen bloody years old."

Wormtail shuddered.

"Oh no my Lord... He is too powerful... I only helped you in the ritual because I knew that you would be no threat to him. He may even spare your life, if you ask nicely my Lord."

Green coloured sparks started flying from his wand.

"You are telling me," Voldemort whispered, "that that mere child is more powerful than me?"

"Oh no my Lord," just when Voldemort was thinking that maybe he should spare the rat's life, he continued with, "I am saying that he is way, /way/ more powerful than you. You are nothing but a puppet compared to him."

"Why? Why do you think so?"

"I... He... Dragons... Vampires... Cthulhu... You..." He was having a stroke.

Voldemort didn't trust any of his other Death Eaters yet, so Wormtail would have to be spared for now.

Voldemort waved his wand to see what happened to the worthless worm. He found that a very deadly poison was boiling all the neurons in his body.

He levitated the twitching form of the rat to his face. "Why?"

"He promised me that I wouldn't suffer any more if I resurrected you. He is ending my misery. Tell him that I am grateful."

Voldemort burned his body, before transfiguring the ashes back into wood and burning it /again/.

Harry Potter? More powerful than /him/?

He would show that upstart what real power was.

--------------

"In a recent news, we have confirmed that the body which was slowly decaying in the acid barrel does in fact belong to one Tom Riddle Junior, who has been missing since he was eleven. Police reports are---"

Harry flicked off the TV.

"What are you doing love?" One of his many Harem girls called from the other room.

"Just making sure that the job was done correctly, Daphne."

"So is he dead?"

"You aren't surprised?"

"Why would she be? She has known you since you were 10." Answered the ever logical voice of Hermione.

"I love my life."

All the same, what was Riddle thinking marking /a baby/ as his equal? At least on the night of that first Halloween, Riddle could have been equal to a baby.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

** Every fic written between OotP and HBP. Back when everyone thought it was only common sense that this would be the case. The thinking was, "well, the power he knows not... must be some awesome magical ability" instead of some bull shit McGuffin like that Deathly Hallows.

It's sad that this is even a prompt. Like it's some crazy harebrained idea that Harry, the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord, would be an extraordinary, powerful wizard that could defeat Voldemort 1 on 1.

  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.
