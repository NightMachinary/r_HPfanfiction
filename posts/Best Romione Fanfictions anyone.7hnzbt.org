  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** To Know You Is To Love You is really good.

Ron and Hermione, shortly before they get married and uncertain about whether or not their relationship is strong enough to last, undergo a very unique kind of relationship councelling, where they essentially experience each others' lives from each others' point of view.

Which means that the bulk of the story is essentially a retelling of the HP novels from Ron and Hermione's POV -- so in addition to the familiar plot you get a lot of scenes where you see what Ron and Hermione were up to when Harry wasn't around. Plus, the adult Ron and Hermione are experiencing the story along with the reader, and so you get to see their reactions and revelations as they re-experience their lives from each others' POV.

  Calm, rational discussions have never been their strong point. When a pre-wedding fight shows them that they need to get it together, Hermione suggests couples counseling with an innovative new method. Ron reluctantly agrees, and now the two of them are going to learn about each other in a way never before possible.

** Here are two I found by an author called little_bird (now little0bird) on fiction alley back in 2012 that have remained my favourite since i read them. They are set in the same universe at different points in their lives and are both complete and cannon compliant with the 19 years later.

Treehouses and daises

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3978045/1/Tree-Houses-and-Daisies]]

"Ron and Hermione in the weeks after they return to the Burrow"

Burning down the house

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3999345/1/Burning-Down-the-House]]

"Some things come easily for some people. Then, there's Ron and Hermione"

Another one that is quite good is Australia (from a different author) where Ron travels with Hermione to find her parents in Australia after the war and how he deals with his brothers death.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7562379/1/Australia]]

"Ron grieves the loss of his brother and tries to figure out life after the war while trying to navigate his new relationship with Hermione"
