** Might need to modify this to the Weasleys vs. Blacks. Then you can have enough people and can do something like Arthur/Molly/Percy/Ron/Ginny vs. Narcissa/Andromeda/Bellatrix/Draco/Sirius with Harry and Hermione as hosts.

Awkwardness ensues.

*** Sirius is always, obviously wrong, just to spite his family.

*** Or could go the Bob's Burgers route and have the Malfoys bring along Crabbe,Goyle,Pansy,Millicent,Blaise and Daphne on the basis of them being " the children we never had "

**** Then the Weasleys bring on Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna. Perhaps even Fleur and Penelope. Malfoys get mad and bring in the big gun, namely Voldemort so Weasleys have no choice but to refer back to dear old grandpa Albums.

Holy shit! This whole time, the whole war was the fault of Weasley/Malfoy families! Molly Weasley, the most powerful, yet relatively unknown Dark Lady in history. Ah, many a brave men soiled their pants upon hearing her banshee like screams.

Yep, screw canon! This is my new headcanon.
