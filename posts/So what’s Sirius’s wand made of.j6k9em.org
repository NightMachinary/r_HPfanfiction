So I've been looking around both the books and online and I can't find anywhere it mentions the specifics of his wand. So does anyone have the canon answer and if there isn't one anyone like to make an educated guess as to what it is?


** For the wand core, I think unicorn hair or Phoenix feather would be a good choice. It depends the route you're going down in your fanfiction. Unicorn hair is more closely associated with light magic users, but Phoenix feather varies depending on the intent of the user. So if you want to point out more how different he is from his family, unicorn hair would fit better. If you want a more subtle approach showing how he's a wild card in terms of his allegiances compared to his family, I would go with Phoenix feather.

As for wood type: There's one literally called Dogwood---for casters who are exciting and fun. A very quirky and mischievous wood.

If you want to go more subtle, here are some less blatant options:

Aspen is associated with revolutionaries. Suited for martial and duelist magic.

Ebony wands are usually associated with people who hold fast to their beliefs. Can be found on both sides of the battlefield.

** I've always thought that his wand might mirror Bellatrix's, that he's sort of the sane and good version of her. With that in mind his core would be the same as hers, dragon heart string, and instead of walnut his is made of black walnut:

"Less common than the standard walnut wand, that of black walnut seeks a master of good instincts and powerful insight. Black walnut is a very handsome wood, but not the easiest to master. It has one pronounced quirk, which is that it is abnormally attuned to inner conflict, and loses power dramatically if its possessor practises any form of self-deception. If the witch or wizard is unable or unwilling to be honest with themselves or others, the wand often fails to perform adequately and must be matched with a new owner if it is to regain its former prowess. Paired with a sincere, self-aware owner, however, it becomes one of the most loyal and impressive wands of all, with a particular flair in all kinds of charmwork."

Having said that, an ebony wand might fit him even better, and it would make sense for him to have a black wand:

"This jet-black wand wood has an impressive appearance and reputation, being highly suited to all manner of combative magic, and to Transfiguration. Ebony is happiest in the hand of those with the courage to be themselves. Frequently non-conformist, highly individual or comfortable with the status of outsider, ebony wand owners have been found both among the ranks of the Order of the Phoenix and among the Death Eaters. In my experience the ebony wand's perfect match is one who will hold fast to his or her beliefs, no matter what the external pressure, and will not be swayed lightly from their purpose."

The other one that desribes him quite well is aspen, and supposedly it is white in appearance, which also would be fitting in a contrarian way:

"Wand-quality aspen wood is white and fine-grained, and highly prized by all wand-makers for its stylish resemblance to ivory and its usually outstanding charmwork. The proper owner of the aspen wand is often an accomplished duellist, or destined to be so, for the aspen wand is one of those particularly suited to martial magic. An infamous and secretive eighteenth-century duelling club, which called itself The Silver Spears, was reputed to admit only those who owned aspen wands. In my experience, aspen wand owners are generally strong-minded and determined, more likely than most to be attracted by quests and new orders; this is a wand for revolutionaries."

I don't think there's much chance of him having a dogwood wand, because he very clearly performs non-verbal magic in the books and this is the description for dogwood:

"Dogwood is one of my own personal favourites, and I have found that matching a dogwood wand with its ideal owner is always entertaining. Dogwood wands are quirky and mischievous; they have playful natures and insist upon partners who can provide them with scope for excitement and fun. It would be quite wrong, however, to deduce from this that dogwood wands are not capable of serious magic when called upon to do so; they have been known to perform outstanding spells under difficult conditions, and when paired with a suitably clever and ingenious witch or wizard, can produce dazzling enchantments. An interesting foible of many dogwood wands is that they refuse to perform non-verbal spells and they are often rather noisy."

I think dogwood is more likely to be in the hands of the Weasley twins. I do think Sirius's core is most likely to be dragon or maybe phoenix, because he's said to be very talented and powerful magically speaking.

*** It would make sense for at lease one of the Maruaders to have a dogwood wand considering thay when paired with someone clever, they can produce dazzling enchantments. If you take enchantments to mean magic on items, then the map and the mirrors both fit
