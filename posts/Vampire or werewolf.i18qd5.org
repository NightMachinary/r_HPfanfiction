The story I'm trying to write is constantly being rewritten, due to the fact that I can't decide whether I want Harry to be a vampire or werewolf.

Please comment which one, and give me reasons why.


** Werewolf. Vampires are in my opinion [[https://archiveofourown.org/comments/263293069][a mistake]], or rather just a joke, which JKR never thought through.

**** That was the point of the comment of mine. [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-dorothy-sayers.html][I don't think you can]], either they are not vampires or it is not HP universe, in either case I am not interested.

** Vampire!

Primary reason: I like vampires more.

Secondary reason: I actively dislike the idea of werewolves as protagonists because I find the condition boring.

Tertiary reasons: vampires gives you more creative license and worldbuilding opportunities because they're not touched on in canon at all, which is not the case with canon werewolves. Besides, canon werewolves look pretty gross looking.

But it's whatever you want to do - they both have good things and bad things about them. I'm a sucker for a decently portrayed vampire, though.

** The problem with canon lycanthropy is that its a degenerative disease & a dark curse. A Werewolf!Harry would die young (well for wizards at least, so he may only make it to 80bor something).

As a vampire, well, he's already dead isn't he?

*** Oh boy. linkao3(1857084) and the subsequent stories with her.

There is also couple of stories about weremione after being bitten by Lupin during the finale of PoA (most of them trash, unfortunately, I would love to read a good one).

Then there was one Sirius-is-exonerated story, where Lupin hesitantly (I think with Tonks as his wife) take over leadership of a pack somewhere on the continent. Not sure, what was the story, but it was pretty good.

  February 2000 Newly Qualified (in record time) Auror Harry Potter remains obsessed with “The List.” The ten people still wanted for their part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Their capture is essential. It will bring closure to the events of the past few years. Harry has set himself a target. He wants to see “The Last Death Eater” and the other nine captured before the second anniversary of the battle. His attempts to meet his target will bring heartbreak, danger, pain, and a lifechanging injury for one former DA member.

** If you care about canon compliance(and I do), then a Werewolf would be the much better choice, since they unlike Vampires are allowed to own wands, since they count as humans while vampires are only Beings like Goblins or Giants. Though you have to remember that in Harry Potter being a werewolf is very much a curse that doesn't offer you any real benefits.

Also I just think overall a non-slash Werewolf Harry would be interesting.

** Unless you're changing the rules of HP werewolves, I think they're hard to work in stories. You have the monthly poison/cage/murder session, discrimination, secrecy, and overall debilitating health conditions. It's the sort of thing that moves to the forefront of the story. If you're bouncing between that and vampire there's a decent chance that it wouldn't work well in the finished story.

Vampire gives you a lot more openings since I think the only actual canon info about them is they drink blood and aren't allowed wands. Not even sure it's specified they're even nocturnal. But it might be hard to fit them into Hogwarts if that is what you're going for.

Personally I'd go with some flavor of Dhampir or living vamp. You get a few weird appetites, behaviors, and appearances. Probably get a lot of crap from the MoM and still face some bigotry. But you can hang out in daytime, use a wand, and maybe get some cool abilities out of it. Unless you're the sort with extra fragile bones.
