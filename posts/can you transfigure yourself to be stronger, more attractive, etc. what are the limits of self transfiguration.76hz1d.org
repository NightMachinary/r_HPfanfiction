And yes, you can, but it's very hard.

  I'd say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really haven't got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall ... *unless you're supposed to put the spell on yourself? Maybe to give yourself extra powers? But they're not simple spells*, I mean, we haven't done any of those in class, I only know about them because I've been doing O.W.L. practice papers ...'

  But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. *They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration*; working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be changing the colour of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar moustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again

  Grindelwald's Transfiguration surpasses that of most wizards, so he used a spell, not a potion, to take on the appearance of Percival Graves.

*** *Capitalization*

Capitalization, or capitalisation, is writing a word with its first letter as a capital letter (upper-case letter) and the remaining letters in lower case in writing systems with a case distinction. The term is also used for the choice of case in text.

Conventional writing systems (orthographies) for different languages have different conventions for capitalization.

The systematic use of capitalized and uncapitalized words in running text is called "mixed case".

** I suppose you can enhance yourself in some way using transfiguration, but since it's a physical transformation there will probably be side effects to making your muscles stronger and stuff. Maybe it'll mess up blood flow or some shit.
