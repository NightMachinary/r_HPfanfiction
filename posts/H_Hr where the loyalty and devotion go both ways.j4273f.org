Ever since I've joined this sub in the beginning of COVID, somehow I got pulled into Harmony and got to read tons of stories recommended from the past threads despite however disdained and unfavorable the pairing seems to be looked upon here.

Having read so many of them though, I understand the repeated patterns (or tropes) that gave the couple their bad reputations but I can't lie that the 14-years-old-kid in me still get tingly and warm inside from the friends turn lover plot --- thus the subsequently binge-reading and this request.

Disregarding all the sickening tropes (mugglewank, soul bound, etc etc, you know what they are), one pattern I keep seeing and hating is when Harry took her for granted as a friend, only noticed how good of a friend she is and treating her better when he started to realize that he might be attracted to her as a girl while she patiently pine over him waiting for him to notice her since first year or some rot. I don't exactly know why, but somehow encountering this in the story quickly ruin the experience and filled me with cold rage tho I usually still finish the story.

So, my fellow redditors, any recommendations on H/Hr story without all the cliche tropes and my one dealbreaker? I hope to find the stories that haven't been recommended too much in this sub (like those from Starfox and Stanrick) because believe me, I've been going through threads here like a woman obsessed in the past six months so I've probably read them. I've even dig into [[/r/HPHarmony][r/HPHarmony]] but found this sub actually more helpful for recommendations.

No multi, no Ron-bashing (drifting away is fine), no adultery, preferably completed and novel length tho shorter is fine too.

I'll link my favorites below for reference. I've reread these all the time esp whenever I encountered a bad one. Thank you in advance my lovelies!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15761628][Eventuality]] - AU without Voldie. I love this short so much it's breaking my heart that it ends where it is and the author doesn't write more H/Hr story.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9901010][baby birds and other adventures]] - I love the whole series but this one short has special place in my heart.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13413604/1/Brilliant-but-Scary][Brilliant but Scary]] - probably one of the only few Harmony that fits all of my favorite things. Grey HHr, mutually loyal and devoted. I probably reread this five times while waiting for the new update.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24410095?view_full_work=true#main][TBWL, TBW, TBWW]] - Huh. Didn't realize the alliteration in the title before. HHr friends with Neville after Harry and Ron fight in GoF. Slow burning and regularly updated.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13405869/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Paradigm-Shift][HG and the Paradigm Shift]] - Hr taking H to Slughorn party. My only complaint here is that it's not complete yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12548804/1/Lord-Hermione][Lord Hermione]] - interesting take on HHr not being friends in first year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3470129/1/Growing-and-Standing][Growing and Standing]] - Ravenclaw and deaf Hermione. Very heartwarming Harry.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17724725?view_full_work=true][Taking the Leap]] - post Hogwarts. Love Harry characterization here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7451864/1/Stretching-the-Truth][Stretching the Truth]] - fake couple trope but still good.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]]: Very touching story, despite them not being 'officially' together

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/][Escape]] is also very nice, and a reasonable way to fight marriage laws.

*** Oh thanks!! I've read those two! I really enjoyed SoH, perfect amount of angst and a tiny bit of James bashing is my guilty pleasure.

Escape is fun, but a bit too Mary Sue for me and too little HHr acting like a couple because they're too busy solving all the problems in the Magical world.

  The loss of someone closest to Harry shows why the Hogwarts motto is apropos. He now has two missions in life, missions which would make any dragon proud; fierce care of what means the most to him and revenge against those who would do him or his harm. See how he handles the burdens of the end of 6th Year and The Hunt with these new mantras. HP/HG, NL/LL

** Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire is my go-to rec for this pairing, very canonesk and avoids most tropes. It is nice to see Harry in the rare supporting role.

Escape was already mentioned. You also mentioned StarFox, so I assume you have tried Patron (that one is rather AU)
