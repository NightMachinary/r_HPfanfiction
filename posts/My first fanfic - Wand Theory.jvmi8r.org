A Journal. That's what had started this. That was the reason Harry was staring at Albus Dumbledore with an air of indifference.

Watch as Harry takes on not only Voldemort but Albus Dumbledore as well.

This follows Harry through his 7 years at Hogwarts.


** It's a good start, it's interesting the couple of extra bits you've added. I hope that it remains so going forward.
