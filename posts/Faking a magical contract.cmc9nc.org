Looking for a fic that has harry figure out that he can "fake" magical oaths and contracts by using the confundus charm. This fic was inspired or at least the idea was inspired by a one shot with the same idea. Can't remember either.


** I've seen this a couple of times, but the only one that comes to mind is a Stargate crossover. Chapter 3.
