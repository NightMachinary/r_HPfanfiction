I was thinking about a vigilante Harry or the Order throwing up their own version of the Dark Mark when they take out a Death Eater. Same way the Dark Mark instills fear, the Light's can instill hope, there are people still fighting.

A Black Comedy has the Dildo Mark and I recently read For Lack of a Bezoar where Harry's mark had a mongoose eating a snake.

Best I've come up with is a phoenix perched on a lightning bolt. What other Marks are out there or would be good?

*** Because that would be primarily Dumbledore based symbol and Dumbledore is the worst thing since Ron Weasley for some people on here.

** This actually happens later on in Behind Blue Eyes. They draw a symbol on the wall and it spreads around. Warning for those who haven't read this, it alternates between depressing as fuck and angsty as fuck and primarily focuses on Harry interacting with a Muggle OC for the first half. I really enjoyed it though. The few 'light in the darkness' moments really carried me through the immensely depressing parts. And egad, I cannot emphasise how many of those there are.

** A pride of lions crushing the spinal cord of a ferrets, peacocks and snakes.

A snake and a rat being mauled by a stag, a dog and a wolf.

A smiley face ( Imagine Bellatrix Lestrange wearing a smiley face mask while torturing the Longbottoms or Hermione)

A yo-yo (that Voldie stole in Wool's orphanage)

A stabbed diary or a mutilated locket

The letters "TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE " rearranging to "ADD MORE VOMIT ROLL"

** There's one where they made one of a Silver Dagger, and placed it at victories against the DEs and Voldemort. Can't remember the name.

*Hadrian Black: The Other Twin* ,linkffn(12352179) Harry and his friends used the insignia of his Grandfather's platoon in WW2.

*Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!* , linkffn(3695087) The Creevy brothers actually make "Dark Marks" as a side business. The Weasley Twins, Harry/Hermione, Harry/Hermione (as their alternate persona), and Ron have their own.
