I just finished reading [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/#end]] and it made me realize I've never read a good, complete story about Harry in another school. Any recommendations and any pairings are welcome, I just prefer more lengthy stories, like >60k. Thanks a ton in advance


** linkffn(4060448) There's 1 more but I can't remember its name, I'll edit it in once I remember.

*** This was really good.. but it's been "On Hiatus" for just shy of 8 years. I actually don't recommend reading this unless you want to be left unfulfilled with 0% chance of anything happening.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi)

This is the obvious one. It isn't complete, but its the best in the genre you're asking for. In fact it's one of the best HP FF's period.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** linkffn(Harry Dursley and The Chronicles of the King ; Harry Potter and the Mexican Mages ; thé à la grenouille)\\
The Chronicles are magnificent, epic, well thought and written. They are, in short, what SHOULD have happened in cannon (the beginning is in Hogwarts, a bit slow, but O so worth it). By far one of the best story I've ever read.\\
The Mexican Mages are nice, with a good exposure to a different culture (I'm not finished with them yet, I could tell you more about it later).\\
The Frog's tea is nice, if a bit too fantastic for my liking (I'm French, so I'm more liable to spot any strange/odd things - mostly locations).

And I think it's all I can think of that is good (and that I've read).

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

  In which Harry goes to Beauxbâtons instead of Hogwarts. Butterfly effects ensue, with Voldemort reviving without opposition from Harry, Dumbledore trying to save the situation and Fudge making everything worse. Meanwhile, Harry learns French. (Twist on the cliché and a slow-going Independent!Harry)
