It feels like i read all that there were to read that marked as crossover with interesting(for me) second universe. But i saw some crossover fics that were not marked as such, also i saw some fics that were multicross, but due to FF.net limitation didn't caught my eye.\\
E.g. fic marked as HP\Bleach but in fact was HP\Bleach\Avengers, and i wasn't interested in Bleach, but cross with Avengers would've caught my attention. Some additional requirement:

*/Preferably non canon compliant(or at least foken epilogue part)./* Canon was okay when i was younger, but now, after a lot of fanfiction and some mental growth(i hope), whole canon plot just seems inadequate and somewhat stupid.\\
*/Preferably fairly "post Hogwarts"./* I like it when Harry mature, BAMF, with lots of magical knowledge\experience. Not when he is whiny, useless waste of space, without anything to show for himself.\\
*/Preferably not slash./* Consciously i have nothing against M\M relationships, but it still makes me feel somewhat, for the lack of a better word that i know, squeamish.\\
*/Preferably not anime./* Except Naruto and FMA. This is only two universes where i can understand what's happening.\\
*/Preferably complete./* May be in active writing stage, with last update somewhere within 6 months or with author still alive.\\
*/Preferable settings:/* somewhere in space(Mass Effect, Stargate, Halo, Star Wars, Star Trek, etc.) Marvel, DC, somewhere without magic of where magic was lost\forgotten (off the top of my head, something like Game of Thrones), or somewhere where native magic is inferior to HP-universe one.\\
Quality wise i'm not very picky. My shitty grasp on english language allows me to read stories that would make eyes of some of the more educated people bleed.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

** This is a great Harry/Star Wars crossover linkffn(8516157), and the next fic has recent updates and is post Hogwarts, but Harry is very OOC, but the reasoning for that is sound. It is very long though 300k+, which personally is fine for me but not be fine for you.

  Only the strong may rule, this was the way of the Dark Side, and Darth Millennial was about to prove to his master that he was worthy of the title Dark Lord of the Sith, but first a tremor in the Force draws him to the Unknown Regions of space... I do not own the picture
