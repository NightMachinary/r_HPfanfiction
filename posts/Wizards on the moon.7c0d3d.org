Wizards in space is something I've only ever seen done by one author and I was curious as to how others might consider wizards on the moon, mars, and beyond. Why would they be there? Why not? How?


** "Wizards in space is something I've only ever seen done by one author"

...are you referring to the fic series literally called "Wizards in SPACE" by esama? I'm thinking you probably are. If you aren't, well, here, it's amazing (if more than a bit self-indulgent): [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/530818]]

** If I were a wizard this would probably be one of my ambitions.

There are in fact wizards on the moon at some point in linkffn(The Girl Who Loved), but that's mostly because of it's Crossover with Sailor Moon.

** linkffn(Xerosis) has this, but really the fic is kinda bad. Wizards go to the moon to escape muggles. The whole story is pretty meh to me. Harry and Voldemort are on the same side, there's a bit of slash, I don't know why the author even bothered to write that part because there's literally 3 or 4 lines about it and it doesn't really matter to the story.

** Personally I don't think magic would work in space since magic needs stuff like leylines, the moon and the seasons to work, at least rituals do... Maybe magic COULD work in space but only personal magic, like spells, magic that comes from yourself. Anything that requires something from earth to work, won't.

A colony ship run and built by Magicals travelling from Earth to escape persecution and/or war. A concept I've been cooking in my head for a while.

Not only can Magicals maintain and duplicate stored food indefinitely, they can also create rooms that are bigger than the entire ship on the inside and are filled with forests, lakes and all sorts of locales filled with magical and mundane flora and fauna.

That would also solve the issue of materials needed to make wands for the new generations born on the ship.

Each deck of the ship will have its own theme, and be transfigured and charmed to look like famous towns and streets such as Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley. Even the ceiling will be charmed to look like the sky, complete with weather!

For defences, I imagine runes and enchantments built into the hull of the ship can provide anything from heat dissipation to kinetic impact absorption, meaning this ship could theoretically travel /through/ a gas giant and come out unscathed, or travel extremely close to a star.

As for engines and how they travel, well, magical engines can be powered by runes and enchantments once again and cooled using cooling runes. The ship can reach the speed of light but that's it, no FTL I'm afraid, unless some mad wizard or witch can come up with a way to bend space and time safely.

** It has been known since Xenarchus that all celestial bodies are separated by a medium characterised by it's non-existence; the fabulous ether so dear to Plato and many muggle natural philosophers would certainly be fabulous, but while the four elements exists safely of the nothingness, the soul would find itself bare from protection.

I still don't understand how dumb muggles can be to believe it is possible to exit the athmosphere !

(yes my wizards are not really up-to-date with 20th century physics. And the biggest incident regarding the status of secrecy since Grindelwald war was caused by a symposium of drunk muggle natural philosophers in Louvain in 1953: after affirming that the light knew that you would watch it and fainted on one side when you did, 27 of them felt through the wall between their pub and the local antenna of the european quidditch association during the Belgium vs Congo quarter final)
