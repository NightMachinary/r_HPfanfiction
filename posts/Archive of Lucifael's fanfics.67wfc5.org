So I have been waiting for [[http://http://fanfiction.lucifael.com][lucifael's]] main site to come back, and it has been a month or two. So now I am try option B.

Does anyone have an archive of some (or all) of his stories? The one that I am looking for the most is 'Potter's Ponderings', I think that the is title at least.

Any of the others, I wouldn't mind getting either.


** I know he also posts on hpfanficarchive and twisting the hellmouth, so you might check there; as I'm at work, I can't.

*** Yea, some of his older works are on hpfanficarchive (and I have saved those), and the ones on TtH are all Buffy stories.

Listing archives might help, as I may not have found them one, so thanks for this suggestion.
