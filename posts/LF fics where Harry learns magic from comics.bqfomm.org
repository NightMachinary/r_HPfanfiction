As magic is all about intent, I wondered if there were any fics where harry learned spells used in comic books, (before or during his years at hogwarts), anyone here come across something like that?


** Linkffn(12239236) It's short, only 9k words. I personally enjoyed it even though I know nothing about avatar. (No knowledge of it is required, though presumably the story is better with the context.)

  After finding a torn comic in the trash when told to clean Dudley's room, four year old Harry Potter puts it together with some odd things that have happened around him, and concludes that he's the Avatar. - Not a crossover so much as a fic in which Harry Potter is convinced that 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' is a historical documentary.

** Linkffn(9596404) Learn dragon slayer magic and teach fairy tail style magic to others. No need to know Fairy Tail really, just context.

  When Dudley throws a book at his cousin's head, no one could have known the revolution it would spark in the years to come. "I want to start my own Guild! My own family!". No pairing.

** I love fics like these! Sadly they're extremely rare. Hoping to get some great recommendations, already read the story [[/u/MuirgenEmrys]] posted and it was excellent!

** Of Wands And Kunai, linkffn(5846162), is one of the first Harry Potter fics I ever read. Harry reads Naruto comics and accidentally convinces himself so thoroughly that he has chakra that he ends up giving himself chakra for real. He figures out how to use it.

The story's pretty good, but it gets weird after Hermione finds a gun.

** Linkffn(10681251) There's this but as a fair warning it goes into a multi-cross fic later on.

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.
