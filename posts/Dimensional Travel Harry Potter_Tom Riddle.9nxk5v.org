Hey! I read once a fanfic about Harry going to another dimension to recruit the help of Tom Riddle. I remember that Tom Riddle was an Fox Animagus. I also remember that they go to a masked ball and Tom uses a fox mask... I really need that story link (or similar ones, time travel Harry/Tom, but not Dark!Harry). Gonna be in a bus for 10 hours, i really need something to read during it


** I've never read that story. However, I know of one that runs along similar lines.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12888734/1/Jonquils-and-Lightning][Jonquils and Lightning]] - Following the advice of a prophecy, Tom Riddle travels to an alternate universe looking for a Potter who will help him defeat his foes. He finds Harry who, after surviving Voldemort's defeat, had taken up residence in a peaceful world where Voldemort never existed.

  HPTMR. Harry Potter found peace after the war in another world where a large number of Potters live. He makes his living as an animal healer in Godric's Hollow, surrounded by family and away from all wars. But his peace shatters with the arrival of a Tom Riddle from another dimension, who seeks a Potter who can be his foretold weapon in his own war.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

** when you say time travel, how old do you want tom and harry to be? Respective to each other, I mean. Also, the one you're talking about sounds familiar, but I can't remember. You might like linkffn(Black Coat) by Hermione Prime. Though, I could give you more recs if you were more specific in what you're looking for, or fics in general. I've read ALOT of tomarry

​

edit:just remembered this wasn't slash. but it's still a good read

  Seized by Voldemort at the end of his fifth year, in the Department of Mysteries, Harry was transformed into a cat and sent tumbling through time. Armed with nothing except teeth and claws, Harry has to handle the threat posed by Tom Riddle and his teenage followers. He intends to stop the genius young Dark Lord and sabotage him at every turn...in the form of a cat. Sounds simple?

*** I did read this one, it's really good! Someone found the story i was talking about, and i think they were 16 on there... I dont really mind ages, as long as it's not illegal(I remember one that was really good, but Tom was like... 70 and Harry was on school yet - that was kind of disturbing). As long as the author explores the relationship (ya know, nothing like that "Oh, i love you and i'm a good person now" or the "I'm in love with a Dark Lord, i think i'm gonna start torturing people for fun") If you have any good story (it doesnt really need to be slash), i would really appreciate recommentations! :D

**** now im curious: what was the name of the fic you were looking for

​

my favorite depiction of their messed up relationship is linkffn(Verdict of Vagaries). Very long and complete as well, and very little sugar coating

​

anything by obsidian pen is gold

​

ive read a ridiculous amount of tomarry and harrymort, so I do have more reccs if there's particular tropes you're into. Voldemort vs tom, etc.

** It's not slash or dimension travel, but this is the only story I can think of where Harry and Tom are on speaking terms and they go to a masquerade ball together.

It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] linkffn(3766574).

It's a pretty good read, though it's unfinished at 1.2m words and hasn't been updated in 4 years. Y I K E S.
