So i was rewatching the BBC Sherlock seasons when i thought if there is a fic that has a super smart harry who orchestrates everything and outsmarts everyone , so is there something like this out there ?


** I can't think of anything exactly like that, but you might enjoy this since it's similar:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9823550/1/business-harry][Business Harry]] - Harry read Sherlock Holmes as a kid, and identified with one of the characters. So, once he discovers the magical world and its lack of organized crime, he sets himself up as Moriarty.

** Here's a one-shot I wrote awhile back. It's not quite what you're after, but it is a Sherlock/HP crossover.

*** The only bit of sherlock in that is the names. I completely overshot it on my first read-through.

**** I wrote it in reaction to a friend and me discussing our Sherlock/Harry Potter head canons, hence why it's so brief. I guess you have to go into it with the knowledge of that conversation (though no one else has complained about the brevity of their mention.. It is Harry's pov after all)
