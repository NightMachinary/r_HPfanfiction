I'm hoping someone who is currently reading PoS can help me out with a question regarding the progress of the story. I read up to the end of Year 2 a few years ago and decided to stop there until Year 3 was published. The story summary mentions that Year 3 was started in 2016 so my assumption has been that Year 3 is still in progress. It occurred to me recently that the author might have finished Year 3 and just hasn't gotten around to updating the summary.

Is Year 3 finished and if not how close to the end is it?

Thanks for your help.

PS. No spoilers please.

** It is currently covering the events of March, 1994. So likely a fair ways off from done.

** Per author note 1 for chapter 120, he estimated 5-6 more chapters. Chapter 127 was just recently uploaded, so I'd guess maybe 10 at the most left. But we are pretty much in the climax/climax adjacent portion of year 3.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
