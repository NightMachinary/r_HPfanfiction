How likely do you think it is for your head canon of the HP universe for Sirius to get his trial and fairly swiftly be sent back to Azkaban? We know Madam Bones is supposedly fair, but that doesn't mean the laws aren't heavily weighed against him. For example, he couldn't prove he was innocent therefore he isn't. Guilty until proven innocent isn't a stable system, but it isn't unprecedented.

Or maybe Sirius isn't innocent because he gave Pettigrew the role of Secret Keeper by convincing them to swap to confuse people. Guilty by unexpected consequences.

I wouldn't put it past the good ol "He's obviously guilty" tactic even if it is a bit less serious.

I had several more proto ideas that were mostly dismissed due to how paper thin they were such as "He has dark magic in him", but the same case would certainly have had Lucius in some trouble as well. This assumes a natural affinity for certain arts too.

This is idea I've been playing around with. Where Harry gets his godfather, demands him his trial, and Sirius is promptly found guilty. What way do you think is a relatively plausible way for Sirius to still be found guilty?

She really isn't. She took part in a farce where the Minister tried a 15 yo in a full Wizengamot setting. Harry was supposed to have a hearing with the officials of the Magical Law Enforcement and Improper Use. She doesn't raise any concerns about the ethics of this in the book at all.

You know the kind of people who were tried in courtroom 10 in front of the full Wizengamot? The likes of Bellatrix Lestrange. But nope, trying a juvenile for a minor-moderate offence in a relatively similar fashion is okay according to Bones.

*** The way she was described was fair hence my use of supposedly. My knowledge of her is mostly limited to that introduction and her daughter Susan.

** Could also find him guilty for other crimes.

Escaping prison, illegal animagus, illegal use of fidelus charm on an ancestral home while being a wanted criminal, breaking and entering Hogwarts, teaming up with a werewolf on the full moon, kidnapping of Ron Weasley and Peter Pettigrew, attempted 1st degree murder.

Probably some theft while living as his Animagus near Hogsmeade. Illegal entry onto historical site of the shrieking shack. Escaping from his cell in Hogwarts via blown up window on a sentenced to death Hippogriff.

Misuse of muggle artifacts by creating a flying motorcycle. Possession of numerous Dark artifacts in Grimmauld Place. Possession of a Horcrux.(Slytherin's Locket)

*** There is some precedent where criminals are given significant leniency during issues of false convictions. There's a strong case to be made that everything after escaping Azkaban wasn't even his fault - the prison made him insane.

**** Maybe in modern society.

But with Wizard society there is no guarantee those rules apply. In fact I think since Sirius is the "First ever escapee" there is almost guaranteed no rules like that, no precedent.

***** The precedent definitely doesn't exist in the wizarding world. I think the same concept of "Innocent man abused for crime he didn't commit." Would still strike some empathy with the public. Fudge tends to bend to the public unless Malfoy is in his head.

****** Was reading one recently, I think The Bureaucratic Error where Sirius got a trial and was probably going to be found guilty anyway just to sweep it under the rug. Until Andromeda sent Harry a letter with a statement to make to the Daily Prophet, along the lines of '... I'm so glad the Minister will stop at nothing to correct the mistakes of the past administration...'

I think I've actually read a fic that had this... but not as a point about the incompetence and corruption in the Wizengamot, but as an actual somewhat reasonable accusation. Seemed incredibly retarded to blame someone for something they couldn't possibly have foreseen or prevented.

It's totally possible, just let the Wizengamot be entirely corrupt, present faked evidence and testimony against the character of Sirius. "This is clearly a dangerous madman... maybe he didn't betray the Potters, but he was definitely Voldemort's right hand and plotted their demise" and back he goes. Though I'd drop any such fic if it didn't then do some kind of prison break revolution.

*** My idea with the secret keeper is along the lines of it being quite literally a matter of life and death. A remnant of when wizards where in mortal danger from muggles where breaking the trust as a secret keeper is more than grounds for any punishment. He didn't break the secret, but his actions directly led to it in that sense.

I'm not sure what I would imagine afterwards, but I don't believe I ever read any stories with a prison break. That could be brilliant. I recall one where they went to the prison, but it definitely wasn't in the context of breaking them out. I actually think it was breaking in to murder someone.
