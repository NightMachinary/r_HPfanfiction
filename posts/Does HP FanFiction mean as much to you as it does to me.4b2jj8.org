Right. So I don't want to turn this into pity hour or anything, but I feel the need to say this. Maybe some of you can identify with this I don't know. Throw away because I'm a complete flake.

Now, I don't know about the rest of you, but FanFiction is incredibly important to me. The wonderful world that JK Rowling constructed laid that ground work by introducing an amazing ensemble of characters that are so easy to fall in love with. You want to see them succeed, you hate to see them fail. Their pain becomes your pain and you just want everything to work out and for Sirius to STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM THAT VEIL.

Maybe it's because I'm a friendless loser, but I just can't help feeling so /close/ to these characters. The books sparked a hunger for /more/ that I just can't seem to satisfy with other books. FanFiction though, provides me with that closeness that I need so desperately.

I just... can't let go. Believe me it's not that I want to or anything, but I know that if I /had/ to I wouldn't have to strength to.

It's not like I only read FanFiction, but it definitely makes up the majority of my reading material.

I'm well aware that it can't be healthy to have such an attachment to make believe characters, but I just can't help feeling this connection with them after sharing so many adventures with them.

Anyways, I'm starting to ramble, but I hope I conveyed what I meant to and I hope I'm not the only one who has such an obsession with FanFiction and these characters.


** A year and a half ago, my nephew was diagnosed with a terminal heart defect and heart failure, doctors said only way he would survive was a heart transplant that they wouldn't give him because they don't give newborns heart transplants here. He was given a month to live and my family fell apart.

I read fanfiction, when everything is falling to shit it was nice to escape into a magical world that fulfilled my dreams for what should happen. I love do-overs and super Harry because It made me feel like strength was possible. I sat next to his crib in the hospital and read to him, it made me feel normal and sane.

I eventually returned to a sense of normal, not reading fanfiction 18 hours a day anymore but I still love it and it is still my safe space.

*** I'm sorry to hear about your nephew, and while I can't imagine what it must have felt like to be sitting there next to him at the time, my love of fanfiction stems from a similar place.

What you said about reading super Harry and do over fics, I totally get it. I too wish that I could go back in time and fix everything, or that I could wave a wand and everything would end happily. I read fan fiction because I can get lost in the fantasy, and if I try really hard, or if I read enough, I can pretend that /I/ did those things, that /I/ was the one the save the day.

It seems rather childish saying it out loud, but I understand the comfort that fan fiction cam bring.

Thanks for sharing.

**** He survived actually, longest surviving person with his condition at 18 months ATM. He eventually became stable enough for a experimental surgery. He still needs that transplant but they expect him to live to be able get it now.

My family sometimes calls him 'the boy who lived'

I like to imagine Harry helped him through it too, showed us both that you can be strong and keep fighting for yourself and those who love you.

***** Oh YAY! I'm glad he's OK. And the Boy Who Lived is fitting - more so than for Harry, actually. As someone who almost died as a baby too, it makes me happy when I see someone pull through.

** I understand what you mean. Growing up with the books was magical as I'm sure many people agree with. I found fan fiction by accident when I was in junior high & I fell in love. As an only child, I had TONS of free time and that usually meant I spent it reading books or surfing the web. I don't read too much of fan fiction these days because I'm extremely picky (we can blame Turn by Saras-girl for that). I so badly want to be apart of that world JK Rowling created and I don't want the majesty to end so reading fan fiction helps that. I believe the love stories I've seen in fan fiction gave me unrealistic expectations, but that's what's fun about it I guess!

** I totally understand. I often joke that my longest relationship has been with fanfiction - I started reading 11 years ago in my teens and now I'm in my late 20s. It's been the one constant through 4 different cities, two different degrees, living with various family and then on my own, it's seen me through breakups and family death, seen me through falling in love and getting married. Other than tea, it's been the one thing in my life I can count on all throughout that. I feel you dude/dudette.

** I've been reading hpff for almost ten years now. I read... a lot, and most of the time I'm reading fan fiction. It actually scares me a little, because I know that if I spent half as much time reading "literature" as I do reading fan fiction, I would be exceedingly well read. But the truth is, I deeply love it, and I keep coming back to it time and time again.

I think part of it is that I read so much, I don't really have the time and patience to get heavily involved in a new world with each series I read. With fan fiction, the author doesn't need to stop and explain the significance of a character or an act, because you already have all the context you could ever need. It's immediately accessible in a way that only later books in a long series can be. And it lessens the pain of finishing a great work, because you can immediately go and find something else with the same characters or the same theme.

I don't know. It's complicated. But you're definitely not alone.

** This is always the way I've felt about reading, ever since I was a child reading has been an escape for anything from seriously screwed up things (like my parents divorce while I was a young kid) to when life begins to seem monotonous and boring. Fan fiction has added a whole new depth to this. However I want the maincharacter to be I can find a fic for that, and it's the most amazing thing. In some ways fanfiction feels like the most amazing friend you can ever have. It will never judge you, it's always there when you need it, and it always has what you want it to have. I mean if fanfiction can come up with Draco/A bowl of fruit, what isn't it capable of?

** Dear god, you just described exactly how I feel. Fanfiction is just a way to keep the magic going. It's the whole fucking Harry Potter universe that I'm so enthralled with. I remember going to every book release, starting with OotP, and every movie release starting literally from the first. My entire fifth grade class went together to our small town movie theater the evening Sorcerer's Stone (I live in the southeast US) was released. Every single member of my class was dressed up in robes. I attribute that to us having a badass fifth grade teacher.

I just can't stay away. I have all of the audiobooks and I listen to them daily while I get ready in the mornings or while I drive. When I was a kid, my parents used to ground me from reading my Harry Potter books if I did something wrong, because it was the only kind of grounding that had an effect on me. The majority of my books are missing covers, have water and food stains all over them, and just generally look like they are really goddamn loved. I've read so much fanfiction that I've started to dream in Harry Potter. It's definitely just not that you're friendless, cause yeah, I have a lot of friends. And yes, even the ones that love Harry Potter make fun of me for how goddamn obsessed I am. I was finally able to visit Universal Studios last holiday and you would have thought I had died and gone to heaven. Hell, it WAS my heaven. I spent New Years 2016 riding Escape from Gringotts three times with my boyfriend and my little brother, rather than watching fireworks.

So... yeah. No one honestly understands how much it means to me. Except people like you.

That's being too harsh on yourself. People forge connections with fiction for many, many reasons. It's understandable, and, what's more, you're not alone in it.

Characters in a movie or a standalone novel are like an interesting, legendary local you meet in a bar, one who is offering you a drink. Sometimes you don't like what's in the glass, sometimes you do. If you do like it, then you find by the end of the night that your new pal is great and memorable and you're definitely going to tell your friends about them. Sure, they really just have one shtick, but they do it well. You'll be treading old if beloved ground every time they tell their story to you. Regardless, hanging out can be nostalgic and you sometimes catch details you didn't notice before. It's always like meeting up with an old, reliable buddy.

Characters in a TV or book series are the interesting person you meet while pursuing a favorite hobby of yours. Maybe you're at a convention, or reading some interesting threads online, or at the last physical book store within miles of where you live, but you, for whatever reason, talk to this person. If the two of you click, then you have just made a friend who will be around for a while. You catch up with them frequently when they're active, and when they're not, you like to hear the stories about them you've heard before. You grow much closer to this friend than the previous one. Part of that is because they have more than just one tale to tell, usually, or if it is just a single story, it's an epic one. But you also get to know them on a deeper level.

In either case, having fanfiction is a way to hear new stories from familiar friends.
