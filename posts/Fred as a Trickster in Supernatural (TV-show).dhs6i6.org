So recently I read some crossover fics and there is one in which Fred meets Death (from Supernatural) and has to decide of he will stay as a ghost or if he moves on. It's only a oneshot and the description says that Death offers Fred a choice. That being said, I legit thought that Death might offer Fred to become a Trickster in an alternate (Supernatural) reality. I think that would be pretty cool. Also I'm open to discuss that theme even if nobody is going to write that.
