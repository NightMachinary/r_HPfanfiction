I'm wanting fics where Harry and/or peers become professors. I don't care if the (former) students are apprentices (still in school is fine), just starting out, or have been teachers for awhile. Chronic illnesses: mental, physical, wizarding or nomaj all acceptable. No cure, no known cure, or difficult to cure all acceptable.

I don't care if there is mature content or not, honestly I prefer terminal illness fics to be rated M not necessarily for sexual content. I don't shy away from rape, abuse, or any other warnings. I'm not picky on pairings it there are any. Snape doesn't have to be THE main character, but I'd prefer if he were included in some way. I also prefer long fics. Just knowing what to put in a search engine to find them on my own would be helpful.


** Is this a request for combining teaching with chronic illness, or more of a one-or-the-other kind of deal? I actually remember reading a lot of fanfiction about terminal illness a while back, so I'll rec those.

It's been a long time since I've read this so I cannot vouch for the quality, but I believe "Stay Standing" is about Ron and chronic illness: linkffn(7523798)

"Tea Cures All Ills" is WIP but pairs Snape with f!Harry (her name is frankly bizarre to me, but maybe won't bother you) who has cancer: linkao3(5372018)

In fact, I think there was an entire collection of "Harry has cancer" fics, but I cannot find it anymore. They were mostly based on the apparently-popular fic "Recnac Transfaerso" where Harry transfers a Muggle's cancer to himself (I think? It's been a long time) linkffn(1399984)

On AO3, you can filter the tag "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&include_work_search%5Bfandom_ids%5D%5B%5D=136512&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=Terminal+Illnesses][Terminal Illness]]" with the Harry Potter fandom, though of course quality is not guaranteed. I am not certain which of these are "respectful" depictions of chronic/terminal illness and which ones are tragedy-wank, but your mileage may vary.

*** Stay Standing gives Ron a magical infection/disease. I reread it recently and it's actually quite good. It ties in his illness to canon quite easily, gives some insight into characters dealing with the post war all whilst giving an interesting mystery/action story on two sides. The latter does get a bit confusing because you have an unreliable narrator and are bouncing between characters to tell it non linearly but its still written well and is good overall.

Also I completely agree about fem!Harry's name in TCAI, it throws me off everytime I see it.

**** I've started with the Tea, name is odd, but Perunia's thought on finding out someone you resent has cancer may help me out enough to ignore it. Depending on fHarry's response.

  There was a more sinister reason for Hero's short temper in fifth year than adolescence and excess stress. When she has a seizure while gardening outside no. 4 Privet Drive, in full view of the neighbors, the Dursleys have no choice but to take her to a doctor. The devastating news will affect all that is to come.Sorry, this isn't a great summary. And I know this sounds really depressing, but just go with me, alright?

  A magical infection has Ron critically ill, but after the devastation of the war he decides his family and friends don't need to know. How long can he hide it though? And how will the consequences of his actions change the course of the future?

** Linkao3(Our Skeletons) is Harry as Headmaster with a severe injury. It's not the height of fanfiction, but there are some interesting storylines.

  We all have skeletons hidden in our closets. When the Triwizard Tournament is hosted at Hogwarts to 'boost moral' and 'remember Cedric Diggory', all of Harry's secrets start to tumble out as he struggles to balance his new role as Headmaster and the conflicts of interest that could with working with his ex-girlfriend, ex-arch nemesis and his best friend. Not to mention that life changing injury that he has been avoiding for the past four years...AU AFTER DH. Previously posted as "Skeletons" on FF.NET but pairings have been changed since then (was initially a Harmony story).
