** Little did he know it was Ron

Ronald is a masculine given name derived from the Old Norse RÃ¶gnvaldr.[2] In some cases Ronald is an Anglicised form of the Gaelic Raghnall, a name likewise derived from RÃ¶gnvaldr.[3] The latter name is composed of the Old Norse elements regin ("advice", "decision") and valdr ("ruler", "brightness").[4] Ronald was originally used in England and Scotland.

** Started tinkering. Couldn't help myself...

Harry Potter, the most supreme wizard of all the ages, sits exactly three seats down from me at breakfast. The way he shovels spoonfuls of cereal into his mouth inspires great confidence. It's important for Harry to keep his strength up. After all, the whole school is counting on him to beat Slytherin in the upcoming match.

I am Colin Creevey,  a muggleborn nobody with an itch for wizarding history and propensity for the journalistic arts. I started off with photojournalism, shooting with my dad's old muggle Canon SLX, but last year, I captured an actual, real life photo of a basilisk. Let's be honest, there's no where to go but down from there. So now, I am focusing my efforts on the written word, or maybe a podcast. I haven't decided yet.

Harry is the most fascinating subject the school has to offer, and maybe the wizarding world at large. I can't believe I am lucky enough to be at the same school and the same house as him. 

I slide another bowl of cereal down the table to him. He looks up, and his emerald green eyes flicker with surprise. 

"Good morning Harry!" I say with feeling.

"Mornin Colin," he mumbles, looking down at his cereal bowl. His ears tinge pink. 

He must be tired from such an early wake up.

In fact, the Great Hall is nearly empty, with the exception of the teams and a few close friends and supporters.
