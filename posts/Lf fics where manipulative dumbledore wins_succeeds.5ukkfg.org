You know those fics where dumbledore is pondering about his plans. Like he is thinking about how harry needs to sacrifice himself and then he will take harrys fortune and kill voldemort so he can use that influence to create a wizarding utopia. I am looking for fics like that where it shows how dumbledore creates a utopia.


** I'd like to see this because usually MoB Dumbledore just does things because "reasons" and "the greater good" with a lot of hand waving. It would be cool to see how his plans play out besides dying eventually surrounded by the loot of pure and halfblood orphans and vials of tears of the innocent or whatever people think he uses to sustain himself.

Secondary idea- Snape has a spell cast in his classroom that catches tears of first years for potions ingredients.

*** I had this ridiculous idea recently where a Greater Good Dumbledore is committing obviously evil or at least taboo acts, but it really /is/ for the greater good; it might be a Ruddigore style curse where if he doesn't do something evil every day, people die, or it might be that he's deliberately committing bad deeds to burn the interest on his karma account so that his balance doesn't end up having an integer overflow and blowing up the planet.

  "Make way!"

  Minerva McGonagall turned and gaped at the sight of a /naked/ Albus Dumbledore streaking down the hall towards her, clutching a sack of jangling coins in one hand and a bleating newborn baby goat in the other.

  As the indecent headmaster rushed past, McGonagall's vocal chords started working again, "Albus, just what is the mea-"

  "Greater good!"

  And then he was gone, his bare buttocks vanishing out the front doors of Hogwarts.
