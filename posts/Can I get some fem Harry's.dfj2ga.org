#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

** linkffn(9911469) is interesting, though neither finished, nor for everything, it has death!harry(called Lily here), and it is more of a philosophical one, really it is...strange, and the main character does not have the greatest morals ever.

linkffn(12793151) is from the same author as above but the main character has morals in it(it is also a time travel fic), and she is more...well, human.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15832620/chapters/36865599][The fire that swallowed the world]] is about a fem!harry whose soul left them when they got hit by the killing curse, and who is now inhabited by a living flame.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17946929/chapters/42383930][Holly Potter and the Midlife Crisis]] is an avengers crossover about a fem!harry who starts off as a cleaning lady for the avengers(she wanted a muggle life, apparently)

​

linkffn(9937462) is another one, though */WARNING:/* The main character is not a good character, and it has disturbing themes in it, you have been warned.

​

Those are the fem!harry fanfics I remember and/or I could find quickly in my favorites and follows, I am guessing most of them were not what you were looking for but hey, it is what it is.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** Fem!Harry isn't something I read very often, 'cause I find that too often it's just an excuse for writing lgbt pairings as straight couples. That said, I do have one but *it's rated E* so do NOT read it if you're underage.

The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14695419]]) is a Harry/Voldemort fic, which is usually not my thing, but it explores some interesting areas of magic, esp. horcruxes and ancient runes. As for the E rating, the author puts CWs in every end note so you know if anything graphic (thus far, just violence) is going to happen.

​

Other than that, I do have suggestions for trans!Harry. I'm a bit nervous sharing them, since I know slash tends to be down voted a lot here but there are some really good ones I want to share. And it /is/ female Harry, so...

The Girl Who Lived (Again) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7900501]]) is one of my favorite fanfictions ever. It's Harry/Ginny.

Lastly, Magical Metamorphosis linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063298]]) is cute. It has no pairings.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

** 1. Becoming Harriet, linkffn(11578510) --- Harry gets yet another birthday present for his seventeenth birthday (a gender-switch story) ... I like the story, but it is one of those where too much smut actually hurts the continuity of the story (I skipped a lot). Supportive of BSDM, but not in the disgusting amount. Detailed (but completely in-story, not superfluous) description of rape.
2. The Videus Charm, linkffn(13197260) --- this is Harry (err, Harriet) Potter born as such from the Triwizard Tournament onwards, T-rated, pretty nice.
3. A Fair Life, linkffn(13285012) ­--- another attempt to live through as Harry Potter (returned by the Death), this time as a girl. femSlash (Harry/Hermione), WIP, so far not much smut.
4. Snape's Daughter, linkffn(7618752) --- another “Harry turns into a girl”, not bad, but it seems to run straight towards Severitus mixed with Drarry (which made me to stop reading). Not too much smutty, so far.
5. The odds were never in my favour, linkffn(11517506) --- interesting setup. James Potter is suspected to be a Death Eater and he is now in Azkaban. Neville is viewed as the Boy-Who-Lived, and Alexandra Potter (i.e., the fem!Harry) is despised because of her father (Lily is dead). A bit of Gryffindor-bashing and Dumbledore-bashing, but interesting. Very well written. Unfortunatey, WIP and it tends to slide towards super!Harry and super!enemy (even worse than Voldermort).

  When Bella Potter meets Death, she takes him up on his offer to be placed in a parallel universe. She wakes up to find herself in Godric's Hollow on October 31st, 1981. Her mission now is to save & protect Harry, and give him the life that she never had. Simple, right? But with a certain doglike man annoying her, universe hopping doesn't seem all that easy anymore. Fem!Harry/Sirius

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived. (Fem!Harry) Mostly canon-compliant, diverging in book eight
