  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”

  “Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.

  Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

*** To be fair to the op, Delenda Est is a bit of a cheap shot. The fic is hardly about him teaching, since he only teaches for a very short period and it is very much so a minor plot-hook more than anything.

*** Among this list, “Delenda Est” is by far my favorite. Most other Professor Harry fics have him teaching DADA, which can get repetitive after a while. But a Harry who grades potion based on Snape's and Lily's turned in work is gold.

  Slash, HPSS- Harry's date with Voldemort at the conclusion of the Triwizard tournament didn't go quite as planned. Fate steps in with a 'unique' opportunity, offering Harry the chance to live and mature in the past. For a while, anyway.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
