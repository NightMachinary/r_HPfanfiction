Do those exist? Where he's so hopelessly outclassed even going back in time doesn't let him win? Where the evil!dimbledore is so believably manipulative and evil Harry doesn't have a chance?

Crossovers, bashing, slash and dark!characters are fine. Please no harems, romance/smut-centric plot, genderbending, mpreg or pottercest. Thank you!

If you're ever up for writing a huge story with AD as the villain, you got a fan in me.

** In the alternate dimension Harry in the second part of linkffn(Core Threads), Evil Dumbledore clearly would have won (both against his rebellious apprentice Voldemort and this world's Harry) if not for Main!Harry's interference. Not sure how much that counts.
