** It's not exactly the same premise, but in my AU story "The Dark Lord Never Died", Hermione and the other muggleborns are taken from their parents as kids and raised as loyal defenders of the new regime. Unraveling the truth and Hermione's reaction to it is a major plot point.

*** Similar enough! It's the sort of thing I've found myself craving lately - what if the circumstances of the muggleborns was WILDLY different from what we've already seen? What if they were like changelings?

Things like the above is what I suppose I'm searching for, and even thinking of writing. I admit, I phrased the question poorly.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

** That's not really a story though. That's an event that would be character defining for Hermione, but I can't say what I would think about the story when there really isn't a story to talk about.

Now if the story is about Hermione getting her parents back, then I feel like that's a pretty strong motivator for a conflict.

**** Unless you're willing to completely rewrite many Harry Potter characters, I think it would be very difficult to make work.

First, Hermione's parents support her academic excellence which leads me to believe that they're at least educated, if not brilliant themselves. I think them not having an open mind to the fact that Hermione is magical, especially when all it would take for tangible proof is a trip to Ollivander's, would be a very hard sell.

Second, I think it would instill a hatred of magic in Hermione. She would always attribute the loss of her parents to being magical, especially since it would happen before twelve years of age. Especially for a young girl that doesn't get along with her peers, losing her support structure would be emotionally crippling. Once she finds out that their memories are gone and she can't get them back even if she wanted to, I don't know that she would ever recover psychologically from that.

And finally, who authorizes this? Things are pretty calm the year she starts at Hogwarts. If taking a child from her parents, removing almost twelve years of memories of their daughter, and then forcing Hermione to attempt to survive in the wizarding world alone doesn't raise eyebrows /somewhere/, that says way too much about the kind of society that wizards are running even before Dark Lords and purebloods get involved.

I see Starfox linked his (well-written) fic with this premise below. That's the kind of significant AU and corrupt government that it would take to make it work.

**** Definitely. Although I may be biased a bit since it's one of my favorite fics. I wouldn't call it cheesy. It has quite a bit of humour, but it balances it really well with well thought out world building, characters and serious and tense situations. The writing and dialogue is all very good and make perfect sense. It has its slow parts at times which I think is a given considering it's insane length, but I really enjoyed the entire thing.

Hermione is not a huge part of the fic though although she is one of Harry's main friends. Its mostly about Harry's crazy adventures and life, with some seriously involved world building, especially later on.

** One of the story ideas I was thinking through was to have the parents of Muggleborn students be put under a 'magical aversion' charm, kinda like a conceptual notice-me-not, where when their kids are away at school they tend to forget about them.

So while their kids are in front of them over summer, they discuss magic and whatnot, but when their kids are away their mind tends to 'forget' about it and focus on other things.

Besides the horror of being magically forced to not think about your children (Imagine if in your mind every time you were going to think about your childs career you were magically forced started thinking about bills instead), it can be used as a contribution to why everyone expects magical go to 'off into their own world', if at 11 they start forcing a distance between the kids and their parents.

Of course, you have to do something if they find out what is happening to them. The ministry has to protect its secrets after all. Best to make the child and parent forget about each other and have a magical family take in the kid smart enough to figure out the charm...

Haven't quite fleshed it out to a full story yet though :P
