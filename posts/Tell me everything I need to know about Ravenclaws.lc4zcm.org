I need your Ravenclaw headcanons.

I want to write something about a Ravenclaw character, but, being a Hufflepuff myself, I don't really know much about them. So, I'm curious. What's everything I need to know in order to write an accurate depiction of the Ravenclaw house? (During the Golden Era.)

How do Ravenclaws act? How do they treat each other? How do they treat other houses? What do they care about? What do they not care about? What's their common room and their dorms like? What other interesting things can you tell me about? Headcanons?

Thanks in advance!


** The "riddles" that the knocker asks don't have specific answers. Their purpose is not to test your knowledge, but to make you think. So any well-thought-out answer will work.

I also just decided that they used to have an actual sphinx guarding the entrance to the common room. It was probably replaced with the knocker either when Salazar threw a fit because the other founders wouldn't let him keep a basilisk in the school, so they had to get rid of the sphinx to be fair, or when (after way too many incidents over way too long of a time, I'm sure) someone finally realized how incredibly unsafe the entire idea was.

** Luna, Ollivander, Quirrell, Trelawney, Lockhart, Cho, Marietta, and Uric the Oddball were all Ravenclaws. They're a mixed bag, but I've always imagined Luna and Ollivander (and Dumbledore) to be quintessential Ravenclaws: whimsical and weird; people you found to be kind and not altogether there.

** There is nobody no more smug and self-righteous than someone who believes they're the smartest person in the room, for they will always believe they're right. Combine that with the typical teenager who thinks they know everything, stick them together, leave for months at a time and you get Ravenclaw.

A few will be normal people, but the house as a whole will be infested with a sense of smugness and superiority. If someone dares to disagree with them, then the ignoramus merely fails to understand the obvious brilliance in the Ravenclaw's answer.

There are a lot of people in this world, often found wearing Ravenclaw flairs or otherwise identified by their refusal to see Hermione's flaws, that see that being right is always the most important thing. People who think that it doesn't matter how rude or unpleasant you are, so long as you're right. People who can't tell the difference between brutally honest and just being a cunt. Like Hermione in book 3 when it came to Lavender's rabbit (Binky?) It didn't matter how Lavender felt, it mattered that she debunked divination.

Expect Ravenclaws to be a great group of friends, right up until they disagree. They might have areas in which they feel they are experts and you'd want to stay away from, but if you can keep the conversation casual they're great. Dealing with them can tiring as there are metaphorical landmines everywhere. Like you might have an Aunt that you love dearly, but you know never to speak about politics to.

** I consider myself a Slytherin so I'm not sure my opinion can be considered very authoritative, but I've always thought of them as being a bit too concerned with their image. We know in canon that they bully Luna, although we're never given an explicit reason for it, but I've always believed it was because they felt she made them look bad. They want everyone to see them as paragons of wisdom so anyone who doesn't come across as intelligent is going to be a pariah in that house.

Other than that I imagine it would be like spending time with a bunch of autistic people, I'm autistic myself so I know what we're like, they would constantly go off on tangents about some niche subject that they find fascinating. When they aren't too busy reading everything they can get their hands on anyway.

But again, I could be very wrong.

**** Alright devil's advocate. Maybe Luna was just that crazy that she hid her things from herself or was convinced that her things were going missing when they weren't. Sure. Believe that if you like.

I'll be over here assuming that she was bullied. And while that bullying behavior might have been isolated to a small number of Ravenclaws and I wouldn't generally hold it against all of them, the fact that no one noticed she was constantly ‘losing' things and tried to help makes it seem like they have a problem with tribalism. As most people do in general. The fact all her things just so happened to show back up just before the end of the school year tells me that it was bullying and they didn't want her father to realize what was happening. If she was simply crazy her things wouldn't have magically reappeared.

I don't mean to say that all Ravenclaws are jerks. The Gryffindors treated Neville badly because they didn't see him as brave enough. People tend to treat people badly when they don't fit in. That's people for you.

I wouldn't quite go that far. Personally, I always thought she was just a bit absentminded and would occasionally forget where she put something, only for the House Elves to tidy up the area between the time she put it down and when she went back to look for it, then at the end of the year she would put those notices up, the Elves would see them, realize who those things belonged to, and give them back.

****** That is a lovely thought. I'm not a very optimistic person and I've seen too many instances of children being cruel not to jump to the worst possible explanation. I do like your idea, but I don't think I could ever see it as realistic, children are cruel in my experience. I really do like that idea though, it would make a cute story.

** I love the descriptions of the discussions of Ravenclaw!Harry's classmates at the Ravenclaw table in the great hall in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296/chapters/52554820][Blood Crest]] by Cauchy. You can download the pdf/epub and search for "Lisa" (Turpin). She usually has an opinion during these discussions.

Here's an excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  "They're not sentient, are they?"

  "Of course not; you can't make things sentient," said Lisa, apparently never one to let imprecise semantics go uncorrected.

  "I meant it figuratively," Harry muttered, but it was too late, because Lisa and Anthony had already got embroiled in a debate about the finer points of animation. It quickly became evident that neither of them knew what they were talking about.

** Bit late here, but I consider Ravenclaw to be the truest “grey” house of Hogwarts.

When you have people who value knowledge above all else, certain lines are bound to get blurred. What's a little unethical manoeuvring if it gets you the information you seek? What's a little manipulation? Why restrict yourself by only learning about light or acceptable forms of magic when dark and taboo magic is there to dig deep into?

Quirrell ended up with Voldemort on the back of his head somehow, Lockhart erased and manipulated better wizards to steal their achievements, Ollivander reluctantly admitted that he's impressed by Voldemort's skills, and poor Myrtle was bullied by her classmates and lonely enough that she was constantly in the bathrooms crying although I doubt it was just Ravenclaws being dicks to her.

It's headcanon for me that Ravenclaws are sharp-tongued as well, thanks to the wit trait of their house, and would have a very dry sense of humour. I like to think that they're especially good at astronomy because of their common room ceiling, they have a soft spot for Ravenclaw alumni Prof Trelawney and give the eagle-eye to anyone narrow-minded mocking divination (looking at you, Herms), and that they're all terrible procrastinators and really badly organised.

TL;DR - As they say, knowledge is power and power corrupts. Or y'know if we want to go the Riddle route, there is only power and those too weak to seek it. Boom, shady Ravenclaws.

** My headcanons:

Ravenclaws are inherently curious. They'll always ask “how?”? “why?”, “why not?”, and, my favorite, “what if?”. What if we switch that ingredient with this one? What if we tried to add this charm to that curse?

They're not particularly worried about legality. I'm not saying they're all mad scientists, just “why is that ritual illegal? That's a stupid reason, I'm going to do it anyway”.

They have trivia and painting parties, and friendly debates in the common room. When Voldemort returns, the upper years have a cold, logical debate on everything that's happened.

They have a subscription to international news outlets.

there's always one Ravenclaw each year that makes their own clothes. They're either a Luna Lovegood or a Coco Chanel.

They change their dormitories up as they learn more transfiguration and charms. It doesn't just stay in Ravenclaw colors for all seven years.

All that being said, my favorite example of a Ravenclaw would be Terry Boot in the Changeling. Ginny convinces him to break into the Headmaster's office. She stands guard, but she becomes worried and goes to check on him after two or three hours. He says “oh, I broke in hours ago. I'm just playing with the wards.”

** Despite their reputation as the "brainy" ones, they often turn in their assignments late because, while researching the topic, they got distracted by other interesting things and never got back to the main one. Professor Flitwick is the only one who doesn't mark them down for this.

Those in the same year as Hermione despise her, because the first thing she does is run to the library and check out ALL the books on the assigned topic. They have to wait until she deigns to return them to even start. This also contributes to late assignments.

They don't study in groups because they're very competitive about their grades. Not only not team players, but it's every 'Claw for him- or herself.

You don't see many of them early for breakfast because most of them stay up late reading: "lights out" has no meaning in a school where the first spell taught is /Lumos/. When they do show up for breakfast, they guzzle coffee.

Their common room is always quiet, not because they don't talk, but because the the House bookshelves there makes it officially a library, and thus people shouldn't speak above a whisper. Opposite to the other houses, the socializing is done in the dorm rooms instead.

** Smart doesn't mean focused -- Ravenclaws concentrate on whatever they want to concentrate on. Whatever they give 100% to turns out amazing, but often homework isn't their main focus. ADHD is very common among the claws

** You might see this better as a matter of contrast:

The Sorting Hat examines the eleven-year-old's brain and tries to figure out where they'd develop best. This is typically a value judgement- what do they think is important.

- Gryffindors value popularity and accolades- they want to be righteous, but really it's about glory. Boldness is one avenue

- Slytherins value power- over oneself and over others. This is the House of bullies and powerbrokers, who naturally bond in a symbiotic relationship

- Hufflepuffs value inclusion- they want to be a part of the greater whole. Good citizenship is the goal, thus they put in their time but want none of the praise if it isn't given to all those who are deserving

- Ravenclaws value being right. It's usually an intellectual thing, but they have their share of visionaries as well. Loners and free-thinkers are placed there, which means this is actually the House of left-overs just as much as Hufflepuff. Hermione would be in Ravenclaw except that she isn't satisfied to know that she's right- she needs others to acknowledge it as well.

** The thing about turning in papers late because you went off on a research tangent is totally true. My grades throughout high school, undergrad, and grad school were all exceedingly average because I couldn't be bothered to spend time learning about something I didn't care about when there was so much other stuff to learn. Fics always display them as obsessive about grades but I really doubt it.
