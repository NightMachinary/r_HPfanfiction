The only one I can remember is the one where its a Zombie apocalypse, and the pairing is with Astoria. Really didn't enjoy that fic, way too political for my taste for a zombie apocalypse.


** There is one I know where Harry tutors under Madam Pompfrey in becoming a healer if memory serves me correct. I enjoyed it when I read it since it was well-written with a nice plot not to mention it was very lengthy which was a bonus. It also has a harem of you are into that.

*** This was the first harem fic I've read. Didn't even remember it existed, so badly it turned me away from harems. Really didn't enjoy. But thanks for the suggestion.

** It's slash (Harry/Draco), but the Reparations series by Saras_Girl features Harry as a healer-in-training. It's a fantastic series, lots of well-written OCs and an engaging plot. There is a bit of politics/worldbuilding stuff but nothing too onerous.

**** All good, I know it's not everyone's thing. If you can bring yourself to skip the sex scenes I'd still seriously recommend it though - the gen part of the plot is both excellent, and bigger than the relationship part. The author is (IMO) one of the best in the fandom.
