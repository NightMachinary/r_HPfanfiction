Preferably from first few years (not Voldemort focused) . Stuff like Potter puppet pals, or the Slytherin Career day fic, but I am especially looking for something similar to a fic version of those floccinaucinihilipilification comics, with Snaps focus.


** Funny, I just recced this fic elsewhere, and here's another question that it fits. Harry's New Home by kbinnz has exasperated Snape writing letters in his head. linkffn(4437151). One example below:

  /Dear JPE, I would be interested to learn how other Potions Masters balance their time commitments. I find it challenging to create new lesson plans and prepare for laboratory sessions while simultaneously spying for the Light. Does anyone have any helpful tips about combining Death Eater meetings with NEWTS prep?/

This one is especially fun when Harry refers to Voldie as "Lord Vol-au-vent"

Then there's the classic one where Snape gives The Talk to mixed-house, mixed-year boys. Originally called "The Lecture," renamed Severus Snape and the SexEd Snafu by Grindylowe linkffn(439510)

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!
