It's fucking ridiculous.

The depiction of sex involved adults of 17 and above, which meets the Age of Consent in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_North_America][MOST US States]], Canada, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Europe][Europe]].

This ban is fucking insane. If that goes through, we might as well shut down this subreddit and move on.

--------------

UPDATE: the mod has deleted the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dgortn/psa_rule_9_breaking_fics/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf][original post]] I've made this petition for.


** I read the scene in question and it's not really explicit by fanfiction standards, but it's probably still explicit enough that the reddit rule could apply if they were looking for justifications to apply it to this subreddit. Blindness hadn't been added to the banned list yet and probably won't be, at least for now. Unfortunately reddit's rule is intentionally vague so they can use it as justification for removing subreddits they want to get rid of. In reality we're probably safe as long as we make an effort to remove egregious violations and no journalists get it in their head to run a story about smut fanfiction and reddit.

Also, the comments people keep making about the age of consent are completely irrelevant. As [[/u/viper5delta][u/viper5delta]] explains below, the rule is about /minors/, not people below the age of consent.

Fanfic has already started to become mainstream with movies like "After" or the "Fifty Shades" series. But that was dismissed as niche chick lit for bored housewives. When a controversy involves children, that's when a content host becomes extra defensive.

I just wish this community was organised and motivated enough to relocate en masse to some other hosting platform.

I'm sure that it's been seen that way as a way to combat any aspects of child pornography in general, but it's probably better to deal with that than to be insinuated that someone is okay with anything that could be considered as child porn...

While these are fictional characters, the vast majority of people have seemed to associate the actors that played their characters, and then you can see why they go that route, despite the actors all being well known as being adults now.

*** The scene in question is about two 17 year olds having consensual sex, and it's just one brief scene out of a 324k+ words fic that is not even remotely focused on smut, so I don't think it should be banned. However, you are slightly underplaying how much physical description the scene contains.

The author describes kissing, roaming hands, wet skin on skin, etc. I'd say the depiction is tastefully restrained since it described sensations but not body parts and faded to black before the actual sex. It's readily apparent that the scene was written to show how much the two characters love each other, not to titillate the audience.

I think it does actually, on a larger scale at least. It sterilizes everything to the point that realistic character development and interaction is impossible. Very few novel length stories aimed at a teen or adult audience are going to be able to naturally and organically avoid breaking this incredibly vague rule. If it just banned explicit sex scenes I would agree with you, but this might as well be saying you can't depict a minor expressing anger for how impossible it is to follow. Could you write a novel taking place in a school with almost all minor characters where none of your minor characters ever act or or depicted in a way where they might be considered to be angry? Sure, but I bet almost all of them would be terrible.

Sexuality, like anger, is an innate aspect of humans. You can avoid depicting certain aspects of it that aren't relevant to the larger story, but trying to avoid it entirely is a fool's errand.

#+end_quote

They are for just about everyone. Maybe you live in a world where everyone doesn't so much as think about kissing until they're eighteen, but no one else does. Also, keep in mind that there doesn't even have to be any romance or intimacy to break this rule. A character merely thinking it is enough. But you're right, I agree, it's definitely realistic to write novels like Harry Potter with dozens of teenagers and have none of them acting in any kind of way that would break these rules. I sure remember that when I was fifteen sex was the furthest thing from my mind.

********* *Lolita fashion*

Lolita (ãƒ­ãƒªãƒ¼ã‚¿ãƒ»ãƒ•ã‚¡ãƒƒã‚·ãƒ§ãƒ³, rorÄ«ta fasshon) is a fashion subculture from Japan that is highly influenced by Victorian and Edwardian children's clothing and styles from the Rococo period. A very distinctive property of Lolita fashion is the aesthetic of cuteness. This clothing subculture can be categorized into three main substyles: 'gothic', 'classic', and 'sweet'. Many other substyles such as 'sailor', 'country', 'hime' (princess), 'ero' (erotic), 'guro' (gore), 'oriental', 'punk', 'shiro (white)', kuro (black) and steampunk lolita also exist.
