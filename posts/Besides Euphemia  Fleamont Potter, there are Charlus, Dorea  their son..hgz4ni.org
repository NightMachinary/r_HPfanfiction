** I don't recall reading any fic that had Euphemia & Fleamont as Harry's grandparents AND using Charlus, Dorea & their son in the story in any significant way e.g., more than a simple mention in passing.

Until JKR came out at a later date and told folks that Fleamont & Euphemia were James' parents most fanfic authors used Charlus & Dorea as his parents. In fact many fanfic writers today still seem to prefer Charlus & Dorea as Harry's grandparents. I've read & saved ~2000 fics. Out of those only 22 use Fleamont and Euphemia as Harry's Grandparents (there are several I'm not counting where the author mentione Fleamont and Euphemia only to say he is not using them in favor of Charlus and Dorea).

There are 312 fics that use Charlus and Dorea as Harry's grandparents. One fic has Charlus as a brother to Fleamont, and one has him as a first cousin. But both fics only have a simple mention in passing.

I would be interested to see if anyone has come across a fic that uses both Fleamont and Euphemia as well as Charlus and Dorea in full scenes.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

** I started writing an Dimension travel Harry fic sometime ago (Never published it, Lol). In which, Dorea and Charlus went into hiding, as Blacks and another dark family to whom Dorea was promised were against it. They were killed later along with their son.

And Harry travels to that dimension during marauders time and takes the identity of their son. So, no need to change his last name.

I only wrote around 4-5 chapters and lost interest. Will finish it someday.

** I am writing one where Harry dies in the last battle and is reborn in the past(his previous incarnation in this version) as Charlus and Dorea`s son, Harry Charlus Potter(who had been stillborn in the former timeline) and cousin to James(Fleamont is the older brother). Due to this, he has closer relations with the Blacks, who treat him as a close cousin.

**** Not yet, probably going to publish the first three chapters in July, just finishing the outlines, but most of the beginning is already planned out, it's just some days I will read it, find something wrong and edit a lot of stuff that requires rewrites to keep consistency, and then re-read to see if I didn't miss anything.

And Harry travels a lot in the first part(Charlus is a curse breaker and "homeschools" Harry until his third year.) the worldbuilding is taking a lot of time.

******* I think it is gradual: books are the primary canon; films, mostly made and prepared before the craziness obviously overcame whatever remainders of the common sense JKR had, are the secondary one and are applied unless they conflict the first one, and then the rest I take with the gradually diminishing seriousness (the Cursed Child is completely bottom of the barrel). But yes, I pick some things, which are nice even from Pottermore and her Twitter (no, not THAT!).

There are even pieces of films which are better than in films: I am sorry for example that [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucS3xMZcrHQ][this scene]] was not in the books like this. However, talking about the cursed Cursed Child, even there are some good bits: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/f67nlv/exploding_snap_from_the_cursed_child/]]

********** What happened was that in 2006 Rowling drew up a portion of the Black family tree for a charity auction and among the many names on it was a Dorea Black born in 1920 who had married a Charlus Potter and the tree said that they had one son together. The tree also gave Dorea's year of death as 1977. So fans assumed that they must be Harry's grandparents and it became a popular choice in fanfics. In 2015 did Rowling publish a piece on Pottermore about the Potters that named Fleamont and Euphmeia as the grandparents and that had no mention of Charlus or Dorea. And that leaves us with the mess we are in today.
