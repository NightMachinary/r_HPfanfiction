Hello!

I am looking for stories where one twin was genuinely lost for some reason(not given up because otherwise he/she would be in the "better" twin's shadow) and then comes back. I greatly enjoyed stories with a similar plot when I was a kid(I am looking at you, parent trap), so I would like to read something of the like, but more serious.

Thanks in advance.


** Antithesis linkffn(12021325)

Pretty dark Harry raised by Voldemort fic, and the basilisk in this fic is the scariest villain I've seen in any Harry Potter fanfiction (though you don't realize until its too late).

Harry's parents and twin are definitely not bashed here though.

**** It means psychologically abused Harry. He lashes out like a cornered animal at times and has some cruelty to him, but I wouldn't characterize him as a smug arsehole.

**** Part of the problems I find with stories where harry has a drastically different upbringing is that so much of his cannon character us defined by his time with the dursleys. That is mostly because he didn't really get characterized in cannon.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** Prince of Slytherin is the best example here. He wasn't "lost", but while it may appear to have many of the category tropes, they are all explained well and isn't just angst and drama.

*** Explained well, you say? Maybe I should try it again, all I remember is James being a big mean baby in the first chapter, so I assumed it was another baseless bashfest. Thank you.

**** We know from canon that he was an arrogant jerk for most of his schooling. This is a version where he didn't die and we can see how he is grown up, with a lot of attention from the public.

Also, there's a few reasons he's so angry with Harry. It makes sense and you will find out at the end of year one.

Every part of the trope is explained. The arbitrary Squib identification, the abandonment, why no one bothered to check up till Hogwarts, the Dursleys behavior, what James, Lily and Dumbledore were thinking. Everything.

Also I'm given to understand that the author may have changed the story a bit at some point. Maybe you read it a while back when the James plot was actually bashing, but it isn't now, even if it seems that way the first year. He's developed a great world, scary villains and some of the changes to canon will make your head spin.

*** I don't think he was lost, He was given up or abandoned because James believed in a stupid prophesy, i don't think that is a good enough reason. And he was mean, idiot, however you sugar coat it.
