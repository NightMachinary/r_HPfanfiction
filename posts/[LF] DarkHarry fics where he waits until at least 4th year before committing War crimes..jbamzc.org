Breaking the Geneva Convention before 15 isn't cool. :(


** In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] Harry is 16 before he starts being a criminal, and he even waits till he's an adult before he violates the Geneva Convention by committing genocide ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ what a good, patient boi he is.

** I would also like to know of some fics where darker harry slowly comes into himself instead of first year super wandless magic rise of a dark lordish fic. Perhaps backstory to it as well. Something happens to trigger a deep distain of muggles

** linkffn(harry potter and the dark's rise) is a pretty great fic and the political arcs are very well written, even though the ending is a bit rushed, and not really my type of ending( i'm a sap for happy endings). But its an overall great fic would totally recommend you read it.
