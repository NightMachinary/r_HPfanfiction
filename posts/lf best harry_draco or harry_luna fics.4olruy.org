Any and all, smut isn't required in the harry/draco side and I know there aren't as many Harry/luna as people would like. A harry /draco with a good story that doesn't turn Draco into a saint would be good. Edit: I only made one post as to not clog up the feed.


** I haven't read a Harry/Luna worth recommending (although I'm sure they exist) but there are SO many great Harry/Draco I could recommend if you're into that pairing (which I assume you are from your request).

Can you be more specific with what you're looking for and/or what you've already read and liked? Here's a few of my fav fics with more of a traditional (aka dickhead) Draco:

  It started with the spin of a bottle, and now Harry and Draco have gotten themselves so far into their own game there's almost no way out again. Except to keep playing.

  "You're dead, Potter... I'm going to make you pay..."  Draco swore his revenge on Harry for Lucius's imprisonment, and Harry all but laughed at him. But Draco is planning more than schoolyard pranks this time. The old rivalry turns deadly when Draco abducts Harry for Voldemort. It's the perfect plan, guaranteeing revenge, power, and prestige, all in one blow. But when Draco's world turns upside down, the fight to save himself and Harry begins, and the battle will take them both through hell and back. If they come back.

** Okay so now of my suggestions are really smut, but I do like then all.

This first is more of a sweet child like story. It has its moments of disbelief, but I liked it when I read it linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2919503/1/Luna-s-Hubby]])

I don't actually remember the next two. Not because I have read them, but because I read them ages ago. I'm not sure about then, so if you do read them let me know. Then we're just in my last of things I have linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10037020/1/The-Unwilling-Participant]]) linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062928/1/Harry-Potter-and-Ice-Cream-Delights]])

This last is both a recommendation for the author and this fic. I love nearly everything he has written. Yes he references his stories a bit, but they are all a bit of crack fiction with a decent story. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3248583/1/Ground-Hog-Day]])
