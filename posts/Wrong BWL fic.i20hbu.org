A wrong BWL fic in which Harry's twin is the BWL. Harry is the main character but is not the BWL. He may think he is but will be wrong. He is more powerful than his twin but won't be able to kill Voldie. He realises this after he fights voldie multiple times with Voldie surving by strange things like a falling debris saving him from a killing curse of before escaping with a portkey. Or slipping and falling out of the path of a destructive spell. A portkey malfunction getting him out of a fiendfyre attack. Until Harry's twin accidentally kills him in a weird way.

If it's a long fic with good character development it would be awesome!


** I don't know about the rest but I have a couple Harry's-sibling-is-BWL...
