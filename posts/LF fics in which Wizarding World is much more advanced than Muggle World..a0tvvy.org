** Probably isn't quite what you're looking for but linkao3(3412346) is quite good.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719529][Ninja Wizard: The Adventures of Harry Potter, Dimensional Traveler]] are both long series that explore how magic gives wizards the advantage when it comes to having a high quality of life without ruining the planet. The second one is slash, but Mischief's Heir's slash warning is for minot characters, not Harry.

*** The Hermione bashing is surprising and amusing. If it were more common I wouldn't like it, but in context it's a refreshing bit of AU-ness.

**** The bashing eventually stops as all parties grow up and gain some maturity.

Personally, I don't think Hermione is evil or anything, I just remember being really annoyed with her attitude when I first read the books (still am). I was a stubborn, independent, contrary child (still am sometimes) so her attitude and behaviour annoyed me a lot even though I agreed that Harry and Ron could have put more effort in there studying. She was basically a female Percy who, due to the troll incident, made friends with interesting people and got caught up in their adventures. And the movies annoyed me even more because they worked very hard to glamourize her often at the expense of other characters.

***** In the books, there are occasions where Harry eventually reaches a boiling point where he explodes at her, he is so angry he immediately cows her and she stops whatever she's trying to force him into. This gives their friendship a kind of balance, where she makes him do things, but he lies to, avoids and eventually attacks her when she goes beyond his tolerance. She is often right in her advice to him, but her tactlessness and antagonistic approach guarantee he often doesn't truly listen to her.

Thanks to the movies, fanon often doesn't reflect this balance between their characters. She is often this flawless character to easily cows Harry into submission, if she doesn't just convince him straight off or even just run the show with him being superflous. The scenes where Harry shows he is not some spineless follower, indeed he is the person who personally stood up to and killed Voldemort, seem to have no bearing in the typical fanon dynamics between Harry and Hermione.

*** The part where Dumbledore deliberately manipulates the situation so that the aunt and uncle gets angry at Harry was so retarded it wasn't even funny. Also, Harry's acting bit of a OOC cunt. Pass.
