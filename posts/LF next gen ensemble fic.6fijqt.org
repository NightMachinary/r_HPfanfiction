Hi! I'm looking for an ensemble next gen fic with the canon characters(James, Albus, Rose, Fred II etc) not too many OC's. Something with multiple plots going on. I LOVEEEED [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9370328/1/Until-the-Morning-Comes]], but the author hasn't updated in forever. Thanks!

  Armies of harpies from Planet Twilania came roaming into a room with illusions of the forest until the three Z-Fighters with Oturan surpassing through the illusionist room. There's no other way keeping up with Harpien race. Will the Z-Fighters believed they can get out easily, or not? Scene preview of Pillar Of Twilania! Quick songfic!
