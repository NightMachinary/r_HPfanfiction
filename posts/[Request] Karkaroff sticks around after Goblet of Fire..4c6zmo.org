Karkaroff decides that the safest place from Voldemort is at the side of the only wizard Voldemort is afraid of.

With a former, unrepentant (i.e. Not acting as a spy or claiming imperius) death eater supporting Dumbledore and Harry's claim of Voldemort having returned, the magical world is forced to take said claim more seriously.
