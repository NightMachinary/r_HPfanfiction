I would like to read a fanfiction that doesn't have a super-powerful Harry, where Harry isn't scheming and thinks he's better than everyone else. I would like a generally depressing fanfiction where he could be abused or mistreated by his parents and/or Remus and Sirius. Status on Dumbledore doesn't matter as long as it isn't too OOC. No Slytherin!Harry either please. Thanks!


** I cannot think of a single WBWL fic that doesn't have at least one of those. Your search is likely hopeless.

*** Very good to know. Thanks anyway. I want to read the WBWL plot, but not where it doesn't fit the magical standards and character personalities, ya' know? Well, when one cannot find the book they are looking for, one must write it. We shall see where that goes.

**** Good luck. And if you do manage it, let us know! It'd be interesting to see a trope-defying WBWL fic.

** Birth of a Phoenix, linkffn(3503388)

No scheming or superiority complex - check. Depressing tearjerker - check. Minimal bashing - check. Non-slytherin Harry - check.

This is my go-to rec for bash-free WBWL. Could've been amazing with a beta, but it's still very good. It's also more strained relationship between Harry and his parents rather than bashing. You also might want to punch Dumbledore... he isn't ooc but... Just saying.

  Complete. No pairings. Twin:Harry. Fatally ill Harry runs away for years only to return when his twin brother needs him the most. Being discovered he starts to crumble to his illness. Includes Character Death but that isn't the end for him.
