Bonus points: he tried to hide the fact he's a dark wizard from everyone.

Example: Descent into darkness (but without the slash)


** Definitely the Downward Spiral series starting with linkffn(Harry Potter and The Homecoming). 6 books, and had what you want. I mean, it's in the name lol.

**** It has some extremely disturbing content, that's the reason most people drop it. Maybe you did it for that reason too?

***** no surely not. Whats the point of reading dark fics without "disturbing" content?

Probably dropped it cause there was some plot twist/direction I did not like

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.
