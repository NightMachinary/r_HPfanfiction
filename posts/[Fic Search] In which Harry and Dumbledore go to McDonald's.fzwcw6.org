That's literally all I remember, but Dumbledore was funny and very well written. I think it was after Harry's trial?


** That's in "Harry is a Dragon, and that's OK". And yes, it's after his trial - though it happens in his early years, and the trial is about his right to go to Hogwarts as a dragon.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
