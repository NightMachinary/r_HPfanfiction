** Lots of these threads recently. As always I'm going to recommend 'Monster'. linkffn(11133389)

It is from Riddle's perspective, well it's a third-person narration having Riddle as the protagonist. It's decently written and has been very interesting so far. Riddle is as sadistic as ever, only now he has a playmate.

  What if Tom met his match in his fifth year at Hogwarts? What if someone upset the power balance before he became The Dark Lord... And changed the trajectory of history? That person is Amalia Gray. (NOT a time-travel fic!) [Awesome]Fem OC x [Evil]Tom Riddle

  !COMPLETE! The story of Lord Voldemort's life, from the moment he becomes a wizard to the moment he dies. Everything---Slug Club, Horcruxes, Chamber of Secrets, Death Eaters, working at Borgin's, both wars, banishment, resurrection. With details of what happened in Albania. Names and dates are all canon. Gets significantly darker as the story progresses.
