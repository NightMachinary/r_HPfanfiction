:END:
I once read a fanfic in which harry got adopted by a man who had a weird job, i remember that harry saved some veelas from fewnch malfoys, he got a hair or blood from unicorn as a thank you for saving him, he also got laid with some troll lady when he saved the tribe from a traitor, that traitor also was thw troll from philosopher stone, which he later killed in hogwarts


** Not your exact fic, but they also have to save the Delacours from a French Malfoy in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]]. That part is well executed and extremely satisfying

Not exactly sure if this is it but fits well enough from what i remember.
