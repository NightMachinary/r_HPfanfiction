The Hero's Journey is a traditional narrative form where a Hero leaves their familiar setting and moves through novel or extraordinary events, then they defeat an enemy and return home changed. I'd like to see fics that take this kind of structure.

Also fics that have a sort of Heroic/Saga feel to them. Extraordinary events done by extraordinary people and all that. The sort of story you could see a bard telling in a medieval tavern.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.
