:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember a lot so this won't be perfect. I think it was a Hermione travels back in time fic but it could also be an OC. Her, Remus, and Severus were all very close. They had like a triad bond thing I feel like it was a Hermione/Severus or OC/Severus fic. They did apprenticeships together under different professors. There was definitely phoenixes involved now that I'm thinking hard about it. The scene that really comes to mind is when Lily kisses Severus and it causes a really bad reaction to the girl he is bonded with and could kill her. I'm sorry it's very vague I read it a long time ago. If anyone has any idea I would be very thankful!


** Was it this?

  AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius & Regulus Black, & member of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.
