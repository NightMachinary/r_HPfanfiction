**** Isn't it!??? It's properly terrifying. This fic had me chuckling and whispering "oh no" every 5 minutes. Somehow reading about Angels is so much worse than watching them on screen it was awful

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

I didn't link the more popular crossover fics like the misunderstandings 'verse (MCU, SUPERNATURAL, ETC) and the HP/Loki fic that's infamous but I forgot the name of :(

Hope you enjoy these

EDIT : So one of the fics is private and you need a ao3 account to read it, it's the HP/Twilight one and the FFN bot recced some other fic - Supergirl fandom or something similar, just ignore that lmao.

And another link is for a HP/MCU crossover series, that too which the bot didn't pick up. I assume that it's because of the link being to a series but I'll link it [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285285][here]] . It's Bucky/Harry and so good!

  For as long as Harry Potter could remember, he had only ever really needed---and wanted and longed for---one thing. Family.Family cared for one another, even at the expense of others that was not part of that family. In that, Harry could say that family is selfish and he was okay with it.And Death had always been a part of his life and he might as well hold on to what was left for him. It's that Harry Potter is Harley Keener AU nobody (including me) was looking for. HIATUS

  They say the road to ruin is paved with good intentions and wreathed in well-meaning lies. Will two boys, souls scarred forever by the weight of a prophecy and seeking to forge their own path, unintentionally change everything? (Courage is not the absence of fear, after all, but the strength to fight despite its weight pressing down against you.)

  Dumbledore said Harry had a choice. He could go back, go back to battle, end the war. He could go on, be with his loved ones in the afterlife. Somehow, he settled for in between and landed somewhere in America in the year 2010 with two guns pointed at him. Plucked from one war in one universe, Harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of another. (Betas acquired!)

  Whether the civilians need a last-minute cake baked in time for a birthday or a limb fixed because the hospital is too busy or even a bar fight broken up because nobody else is willing to interrupt two drunk shinobi, they all know to go to the green-eyed foreigner. So it stands to reason that, sooner or later, ninjas would come knocking as well. Insanity ensues -- they're messing with a Marauder after all.

  Harry Potter is the Master of Death. After the war, Harry needs to get away from his past, and in an act of desperation he walks through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries. The world he discovers on the other side is unlike anything he's ever seen before. Peter Parker is a senior at Midtown High School. He lives with his Aunt May, “interns” at Stark Industries, and sells selfies to the Daily Bugle. He's endlessly fascinated by the new kid in his Chemistry class. -- Or, Harry Potter finds himself in the Marvel Universe and meets Peter Parker.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.
