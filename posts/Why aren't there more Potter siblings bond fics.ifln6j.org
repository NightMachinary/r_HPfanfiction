Every fan fiction I've read about or fanfic that includes the Potter siblings has them not getting along. James Sirius is just an idiot bully, Albus Severus is the "disappointment", Lily Luna either has no personality or only speaks internet slang and is therefore incomprehensible.

I want more fics that explores the kids. I good example of this is a fic I read (but do not remember the title and author) where Harry and Ginny gets de-aged and James, Albus, and Lily (ft. Teddy Lupin) has to take care of them. James acts like a reliable and responsible big brother who took charge the second things went wrong, Albus immediately tries to find out a way to fix it and alerts the adults, and Lily, as the youngest, makes sure her big brothers don't push themselves too much and helps wherever she can.

They're literally the kids of Harry "I defeated the Dark Lord." Potter and Ginevra "I revived the DA and led them to war." Weasley. Not to mention their other relatives Ronald "I went on the adventure of a lifetime and was in the forefront of the war." Weasley and Hermione "I used my intelligence to end a war." Granger.

On a more serious note, Harry and Ginny would never let their kids act like a bully, or be a prey for bullies. Harry who grew up neglected and Ginny who grew up with a huge family who doted on her. Harry who learned that he isn't a freak way too late in life and Ginny who knew from the start that she would be independent and strong willed.


** Because there's little reason to write about them since any big adventure they might end up in should be handled by their parents. Writing Harry and co as incompetent adults is straight up bashing.

Honesty, short of killing off the trio and most of the DA, I see no way you could write a decent fic about them rather than their parents, and given how little we know about them, Hogwarts fics with the kids are basically all-OC stories.

*** This is a fair point, but by the same token kids away at boarding school can't always go to a parent for advice. Even kids with functional relationships with the adults in their lives get into "situations", because no matter how great your mum and dad are, when you're a teenager you aren't going to tell them /everything./ Plus parents don't always have the answer and they make mistakes no matter how competent and good they are at the parenting. You don't have to write Harry and Ginny as "incompetent" to write a fic where their kids get up to their eyes in some nonsense behind their backs.

**** Yes, but what kind of trouble comparable to what Harry and co went through? If it was anything serious, it ought to be handled by their parents. Which makes any potential story seem, well, boring since what are their troubles compared to Slytherin's Basilisk or fake Moody?

I mean, you can write next gen romance, but that's basically OC/OC.

  incompetent adults
#+end_quote

I think Sanderson mentions this is in one of his lectures on writing middle grade fantasy. In all that genre of books you sort of have to make the adults incompetent in order to make the story readable. Otherwise you end up with a main character with no agency and making no decisions, which is boring.

Harry Potter's first 2 books are solidly middle grade and you'll see the incompetent adult trope in there. The Dursleys are cartoonishly cruel, Dumbledore is absent, McGonagall is dismissive, Snape is a petty bully, Hagrid is both incompetent and an idiot.

This forces the kids in the book to act on their own.

If you're writing a story based around 8-12 year olds you pretty much have to make the adults either incompetent or absent. If you want to write a next-gen fic and don't want to "bash" Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione then you'll have to either make the stakes lower (no new dark lord that needs fighting) or take them out of the equation (kidnapping?).

Alternatively you can age them up to their teens or older and have the adventure start there.

*** Time travel! That's how you do it - send the kids back so they're now around the same ages as their parents or grandparents and have at it!

You've got all sorts of options from there - did the trio over-prepare their children for any situation because they remembered keenly how out of depth they felt and how it was pure luck they survived a lot of times and never wanted their children to experience that? Did they refuse to talk about the war at all and left the kids with incomplete knowledge of recent history because it was all too painful to talk about? Were there ever incidences with crazed fans when the kids were younger that had a lasting effect on how they would deal with seeing the whole "boy-who-lived" craziness hitting unprepared 11 year old Harry? You've got a lot of leeway to do any kind of story you want here.

** Why does everyone think the only interesting stories have some dark villain included? Don't every single one of our lives have tons of problems in them despite the lack of villainy? Teenagers at boarding school don't have interesting lives and moments of personal growth? I think exploring the “life after the war” era and societal/class changes is a good enough reason to write about the next generation, and slice of life is a great genre too.

Also, not that many people are interested in the story Post-Hogwarts. You'd have to /really/ impress/interest me to get me to read a story that starts out outside of canon. Take the kids for example. I don't know the kids. I don't care about the kids. Unless the premise is something I personally find appealing (which, sadly, is rare; my tastes are really niche) or it's a story highly regarded as good quality, I wouldn't read it.

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

** Because there just wouldn't be conflict that way. The only conceivable threat you could spin off canon is Delphini Riddle deciding to actually do dark lady things instead of pretending to be a dude's niece while playing with a time turner, and that threat would definitely be handled by Harry, not his kids.

Like even if you include conflict with death eater children in Hogwarts, it would just end up being a slice of life with characters that the majority of the fandom doesn't care for and no real 'endgame' to the conflict.

*** Yeah, but you don't have to just write something that spins off canon. There's loads of scenarios you could write that brings the kids in. Just as an example off the top of my head:

New teacher (probably DADA) is /dodgy./ James Potter Jr knows this, and is determined to find out what this guy is up to. McG dismisses his concerns as him wanting to create a problem so he can follow in his dad's footsteps and tells him to leave it be and stop harassing innocent faculty members. There is an element of truth in this, so he doesn't tell Harry or Ginny, he wants to solve it himself like his dad would have. Obviously it becomes a whole "thing" and after James gets in loads of trouble, including McG telling Harry he's harrassing a teacher and Harry being all like "don't bully people James not even your teachers", it turns out the teacher is trying to do something such as take the elder wand from Dumbledores grave or get his hands on the book that records magical births so he can delete muggleborn, or he's nicking expensive stuff from the school and selling it on. Eventually James finds some evidence and is vindicated and Harry comes in to arrest the guy and is all like "omg Minerva when will you learn to listen to Potters because this is your attitude over the Philosopher's Stone all over again, you daft cat."
