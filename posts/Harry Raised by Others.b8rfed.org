I don't mind if it's a crossover or even raised by Severus Snape, I just don't want it well known. I know most of them. Please try and keep up to only Teen.


** There are lots ‘Harry raised by others' fics, the trick is however to find one that also has an original plot. Too many such promising fics end up regurgitating canon plot rails, which gets really boring after a few hundred times.

That being said, I do have a selected few fics that has Harry being raised by someone else and has an original plot:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871): Harry is blind and raised by good Dursleys. He never went to Hogwarts, but he gains some serious powers later on.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): Grindelwald had raised him for several years. He shows up at Hogwarts for several months in Year 7 and left with Ginevra. Very unique ending.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): Petunia is a squib and an BAMF archeologist. She, not Harry, is the true hero in defeating Voldemort. The interesting part about her characterization is that she's very much recognizable as her canon version.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): Harry becomes a cat animagus at a very young age, runs away, and is taken in by the Grangers. This story still follows canon too closely for my taste, but its sequels, linkffn(12088294;12076644), are entering completely new territory.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/][The Daring Win]], linkffn(12005755): A very unique Harry raised by Umbridge fic!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Finally, a Harry raised by Sirius. This is a major AU in which a more brave and cunning Lucius Malfoy outmaneuvered Dumbledore after Halloween 1981. Dumbledore had to evacuate his remaining followers to France. Harry and the Weasleys thus all went to Beauxbatons. After 18 years, they are ready for their revenge.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/][When in Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363): Gilderoy Lockhart found Harry on that doorstep and took him in. This Harry is very cunning, and Year 1 ends very differently than in canon.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** Here are some lesser known ones on AO3.

- *the dogfather* by Hollimichele. Complete. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487]]) - Upon finding him at their doorstep, the Dursleys surrender Harry to the police and he is adopted by a loving Muggle couple who've been wanting a child for years. With no blood protection, Death Eaters track the Dursleys down off-screen and possibly torture and murder them. Sirius reads the headlines of the Dursleys demise and breaks out of Azkaban earlier than canon to find Harry. The rest is a wonderfully fluffy fic that manages to tackle the first year in fewer words than The Philosopher's Stone (this is quite the achievement when you check the word count on many canon re-writes of first year fics). This version of Harry raised in a loving home has basically spoiled me off most of the edgy fics that push his childhood abuse up to 11 for cheap gravitas.

- *The Phoenix Burns Brightest* by AnyaYanko. WIP. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17475989]]) - A new fic that got updated just a few days ago. Harry's first burst of accidental magic happens at four and apparates him miles away from Surrey. The muggle police are called to investigate, Dumbledore comes to check up and he's horrified at how the Dursleys are treating Harry. He takes Harry and raises him himself in seclusion, temporarily stepping down from all his positions. It's very promising, the author has made it to the Diagon Alley shopping scene quickly, always a good sign for a WIP fic that's rewriting first year. This Harry is brighter than canon, having been raised by Dumbledore himself. He's confident, thoughtful and loves his father figure dearly and Dumbledore loves him just as much or more. There's foreshadowing throughout about the troubles to come, and that makes the fluff all the sweeter IMHO.

The next ones have Mature or Explicit ratings on some of their fics, but are long series and the explicit scenes are normally between his caretakers or between Harry and his love interest when they are in their late teens. I'm including them more for other people reading this thread, because I think they're quite excellent fics.

- *Stealing Harryverse* series by copperbadge. Abandoned in the Middle of 3rd Year. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408;https://archiveofourown.org/works/991387;https://archiveofourown.org/works/991389;https://archiveofourown.org/works/991396;https://archiveofourown.org/works/991398;https://archiveofourown.org/works/991401;https://archiveofourown.org/works/992265;https://archiveofourown.org/works/992288;https://archiveofourown.org/works/992558;https://archiveofourown.org/works/993712;https://archiveofourown.org/works/994963;https://archiveofourown.org/works/1000039]]). Sirius and Remus steal Harry from the Dursleys, against Dumbledore's wishes. They raise Harry and the story takes us through the first three books with some quite marvelous changes to canon that I wish had been more popular in the fanfic community. One particular idea the author has is that an adult accompanies Harry through his end-of-year adventures, and the adult is the one doing the heavy lifting bringing Harry along only because he has a certain skill needed (eg Parseltongue to open the Chamber, etc). So Harry gets to be the hero but the adults don't look like shit for abandoning him either. I think the author planned for 4th year, as Harry's loss of innocence, the adult helping him on that adventure would die. Such a loss that the author lost interest midway through the 3rd year. Wolfstar slash pairing is the main source of the explicit scenes.

- *The secret language of plants* series by Endrina. Complete. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9323225;https://archiveofourown.org/works/9476138;https://archiveofourown.org/works/10181825;https://archiveofourown.org/works/12821004]]) This series is fucking brilliant and really should be better known on this sub IMHO. Snape takes Harry from the Dursleys and tracks down Remus to raise him. Eventual slash Severus/Remus happens. Harry is given a loving childhood for a few years until the Ministry raids their little home while Snape is away. Remus is subdued like an animal and Harry is ripped away from his parents traumatically and forced to stay with the Dursleys. This trauma changes his magic, he hates Hogwarts and all the teachers, and refuses to do magic in class unless forced. From such a sad start comes some amazing ideas I've never seen anywhere else in the fandom. The Slytherin students set off socialist, feminist and other agenda revolutions in Hogwarts all on the same night, Harry learns how to break all of Gamp's Laws of Transfiguration while dancing with his WalkMan, and Seamus shows Voldemort why there's no snakes in Ireland. Eventual Harry/Draco, but this Draco read the writings of Karl Marx and realized that "house division is merely a mechanism imposed by the super structures to keep the lower classes, that is us the student body, unable to unite and demand more rights." so he's cool.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
