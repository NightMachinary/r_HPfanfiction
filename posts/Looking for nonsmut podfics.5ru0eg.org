Heyy. So I work in tax, and my foreseeable future consists of me waking up, working, going home at midnight to sleep, and repeat (only minor hyperbole ofc), and audiobooks are basically what gets me through the season.

Do you have any recommendations for good podfics? Longer fics preferred, good voice acting, etc, but I feel hella awkward listening to romance books that turn smutty while I'm at work, so nonsmut definitely a requirement. I've never really delved into podfics, but as far as regular fics, I'm into a lot of tropes like peggy sues, want of a nail, aus, etc, and I can't think of any ship that will automatically turn off my interest. I honestly prefer romance, but the love->sexsexsex thing makes it difficult to find anything I can actually listen to without nervously skipping randomly in the audio and ending up missing parts because I don't want to accidentally come back in on a description of dicks, you know?

Do you have any recommendations?


** Jinjurly is really great when it comes to podfics, but they've experienced a content malfuction, so some stories you try to get may not work. Sadly, however, most of the stories are pretty short. I'll link you to a couple of my favorites that do work and are more on the longer side.

Tissue of Silver by Fearless Diva HP/DM

Shiver, Whisper, Cringe by FaithUnbreakable. This is a crossover with Buffy. I guess you could say that it's Buffy/Luna/Harry. Kinda.
