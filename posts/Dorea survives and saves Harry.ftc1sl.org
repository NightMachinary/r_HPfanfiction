So Dorea wakes up in Gringotts and discovers that James & Lily are dead so she goes to rescue Harry. She survived dragon pox because she had a blood transfusion from an Antiquian Opaleye (probably, I'm not quite sure).

I can't remember much else about the fic other than the fact that it was on AO3.

Does anybody know what it's called?
