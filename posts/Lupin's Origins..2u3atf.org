I know, I know, search for it first, go through sites, etc etc. I've tried for hours.

There's this great story about Lupin's childhood, starting all the way from the attack, going through school. I never finished it, but it was over 100 chapters long. Im pretty sure the title had 'moon' in it. I'm also pretty sure I found this story because it came up at some point on [[/r/harrypotter]]

Any help would be much appreciated. thanks.
