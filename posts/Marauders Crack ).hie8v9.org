Ok here me out. I have a Marauders Era playlist on Spotify and I added the song We Didn't Start the Fire by Billy Joel. Whenever this song comes on the only thing I can think about is Sirius and James walking into the great hall blasting this song and having a lip sync battle in front of everyone. Lupin will be standing awkwardly behind them, but enjoying the music. Peter will be hiding in the back hoping no one sees him. Lily will be sitting at the Gryffindor table with Marlene trying not to laugh at how stupid they look. Marlene will hear the music and stand up and start dancing looking like the queen that she is. Snape will sneer in disgust as everyone cheers and McGonagall will be trying to look disapproving but in reality loves the show they are putting on. And finally Dumbledore will have a twinkle in his eye as he subtly turns the volume of the music louder.

I mean am I wrong


** Is... is the answer not for them to do a prank with fake flames everywhere while doing all of this? Teachers running around trying to put out a young Serverus Snape and Regulus Black?

** Sorry, but I have to say you're wrong. We Didn't Start the Fire isn't Marauders era as it wasn't released until 1989. If you're looking for Marauders era, Cold Spring Harbor, Piano Man (album, not just the song), Streetlife Serenade, Turnstiles (one of my favorites, personally), The Stranger, and 52nd Street are pretty definitely Marauders era. You can make an argument for Glass Houses (another of my favorites), but that's 1980 so they wouldn't be in school still.

*** Fred and George perhaps? 1989 was their first year so I can see them setting fire to stuff while playing this.

*** Thanks for the suggestions! I know that this may not be completely accurate but it's still funny for me to think about ðŸ˜‚
