I don't remember every detail of the story but I remember one scene where Harry has to save a student from Beauxbatons student who was Fluer's friend after she gets badly burned during a task in the Tri-Wizard tournament. He has to exchange her lungs for his so she can breath properly.

Thanks for any help you guys can give.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
