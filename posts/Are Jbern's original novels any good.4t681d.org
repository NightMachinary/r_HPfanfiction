*** I think it's just someone being stupid and obnoxious. I mean, most of that person's posts are posts rather than comments, often stupid ones at that, and there's one that's basically “how do I circumvent a ban” amongst those.

**** considering there's been three jbern posts and two had the same sentences that were repeated in the post with the same missing period after first sentence and missing space and the posters had shitall for post history, I'm gonna stick with bots improperly setup.

** Well, I've read Dead Eyes, Penny for the Ferryman, and I can tell you that it's terrible. Bad romance, bad characterizations, and everyone is mostly unlikable, and random humor elements like with ghost cowboys falls really flat. So, yeah, pretty much exactly like his fanfiction.

** Not his novels, but [[http://ferretbrain.com/articles/article-423][this review]] of a short story collection Bernheimer self-published comes down very harshly on the collection. Some of the problems highlighted are no doubt due to the self-published nature of the collection, but others (especially Bernheimer's bad handling of women characters) wouldn't be so easily fixed by an editor.
