:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I started reading this a while ago and lost it. It is a time travel fic where Harry goes back in time to first year but he remembers everything that happened; so he makes all the “right” choices. It's very long and there's a lot of sassy harry. I think he also becomes very rich..sorry if this description doesn't give you very much. But I'm veryyyy desperate :(


** Might be linkffn (Oh God Not Again! by Sarah1281)
