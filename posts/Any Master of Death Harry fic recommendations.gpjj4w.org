The only really good fic that I've come across is linkao3(Step back in time - Part One) and the rest of the series but I haven't come across any other decent fics. Any ships are welcome save for Harry/Hermione (if Ron's in the picture, mind you) and Harry/Voldemort.


** This [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fapnkx/master_of_deathharry_excel_collection_help/][thread]] has a link to a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hhzXz1gjLoTW0QMNPqdwcpUj0QuOrZ5IdEYoyXDwtvE/edit#gid=0][google sheet]] that's a collection of MoD fics someone made a while back. It's got 72 fic recs so far. It's also got things like word count, completion status, ships, and what makes Harry MoD in the fic as categories next to each recommendation.

  When a bitter, dark, and battle worn Harry Potter steps through a rip in time. He didn't think he would find himself with a baby in his arms on his Aunt's front doorstep on the night his parents were killed but that was just the beginning.

** You could also look at All Was Not Well by White Angel of Auralon

linkffn(8821847)

Or A Darkened World by sprinter1988

linkffn(8418356)

You can try a slightly different take on the Master of Death with the story Harry Potter and the Old Friend by Sinyk

  Harry was massively disappointed in how things were going after the final battle. Nothing had changed, it only looked like it on the outside. So he decides to change the past to prevent certain things from happening. Being the Master of Death has its perks. Time-travel, Harry / OC

  Hermione and Ron both leave Harry behind in the tent. Neither return, and were among the few to escape Britain when Voldemort took over. Years later, their daughter Rose has joined an ICW operation that tries to stop Voldemort's power from spreading beyond Europe. However things take an unexpected turn when she discovers what became of Harry Potter. Ron Bashing and Deaths.

** linkao3(1358209) is one of my favourites, but sadly it's incomplete and doesn't look like it'll be updated.

A shorter but well-done oneshot: linkao3(6122017)

Edit: oh and if you're okay with a Sherlock crossover, linkao3(1134255) is excellent
