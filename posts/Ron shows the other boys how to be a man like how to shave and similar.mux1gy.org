Ron is really the only one in the dorms (that he shares with, anyway). That actually has a father in his life. Seamus could, but we only ever hear him mention his mother. We know that Dean's father left, Neville's parents are both in St. Mungo's, and Harry's are dead.

Just thought it could be funny/wholesome or similar, to have Ron show the boys how to do stereotypical "manly" stuff.

Would also be nice to see more positive Ron stories in general, I tend to get annoyed with the constant bashing.


** I'm pretty sure Dean mentions a stepfather at some point.

*** Yeah, Dean mentions not talking to his "parents" about what happens at school, and he also has several younger half-sisters.

It's still a good point, though. Dean is the oldest in his family, while Ron has a sleuth of big brothers.

As for Seamus...whatever happened to his da, anyhow? He mentions it was a nasty shock for his father to find out his wife was a witch.

**** Nah, at least not yet. I made a comment that basically said this yesterday so the well mannered thing to do is to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/mulzv6/ron_strives_to_become_a_version_of_himself_that/gv6lx67/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3][link]] it.

The little fic I was referring to in the previous comment though is the second one Daisy_neco linked called â€˜lessons learned' by headcannonsandmore which is also on ffnet linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13396926/1/Lessons-Learned]])

#+begin_quote
  One morning, Ron discovers that maybe having so many older brothers isn't so bad, especially if your friends are in-need of some brotherly support due to absent fathers. (Warning: contains allusions to child abuse, child neglect, domestic abuse and domestic violence)

** I've definitely read this in a fanfic before. Maybe The Cupboard Series? Like with this explanation brought up by Ron as he decides he needs to do it.

** Your post highlights just how normal Ron is compared to everyone else in the dorm. I'd say Ron probably helps out in lots more stuff than just that.
