Death took on human form and had a kid(s). The decedents from the kid(s) are all immune to AK from being related to death. Word gets around and everyone knows that one family are immune to ak. People start to want to know why so they want to run experiments on the family. The family ends up running, and give the kid(s) they have to random muggle family's, never having more then one child in a muggles family. The kid(s) grow up thinking their muggleborns and go through life not knowing that they are a part of the family immune to ak. After generations the family's secrets are lost yet the wizarding world still talked about the family immune to ak. No one knows who it is, even themselves as no one has cast ak on any of them, until Harry.

** In this case one of his parents at least would survive, to say nothing of the fact that this immunity would eventually be passed to the descendants of this family that married in other families/started their own. Depending on how much time this goes on and eventually it would happen more often than not until the AK just went out of use entirely since almost no one would be affected anymore.
