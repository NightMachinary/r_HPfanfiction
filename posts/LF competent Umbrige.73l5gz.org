I look for a fiction with an Umbrige who does her job(the right way).

Like enforcing equal punishment, hiring more teachers, firing incompetent teachers, end the double occupation (teacher and head of house at the same time) stopp bullying and teaching age relevant dada (I mean running away and getting help is totally the way to go she is right about that, but you cant teach that over seven years.) Maybe modernise the curriculum.


** So an OC with the name Umbridge.

*** No, more like an Umbridge who does what she /claims/ to do. If a story had, say, a Lockhart who really did all the stuff he brags about, you wouldn't call him an OC, just a wild departure from canon, right? This is the same thing.

** I have a feeling that a competent Umbridge doesn't exist, and never will. She's just too messed up

*** I remember reading a story where Umbridge and Amelia Bones worked to clean shit up and defeat Voldemort. Umbridge was a spy in Fudge's staff. It was amazing.

Don't remember a name though.

**** Yes, but you are way more likely to find porn with a Harry/Umbridge pairing than you are to find a fic where she is genuinely competent. And isn't that a somewhat scary thought?

I'm not saying there's none, mind you, but there's just not enough for most people to have stumbled upon them, let alone remember the titles. For what it's worth, though, I wish you good luck with the request, and I hope that the stuff that's recommended by now actually is what you want.

** The Daring Win

One of my favourite authors, Lomonaaeren, is currently writing a "competent umbridge raises harry" story. Years away from her going to work in Hogwarts, if ever, but you might see the kind of character you're interested in.

Edit: amilly suggested it first. Not that it's a race.
