I closed out of two stories today due to some of my turn offs and it made me wonder what other people dislike about fics?

For me, I dislike a lot of things that are common in HP fanon. I dislike the 'Harry has an epiphany and is suddenly in love with Hermione' trope. I avoid fics about pureblood politics and Harry being the 'Heir of Gryffindor, Slytherin, Emerys, Ect...'

The worst for me is the Wrong Boy Who Lived, Harry's younger brother is BWL, or Neglected Harry (by his real parents) fics. These are just putting OCs in Harry's body. You may as well just make Harry the BWL and use an OC.

I have a myriad list of other stuff but what about you?


** Lots of things, but foremost:

1. Canon rehashes, especially in time travels

2. Voldemort and Death Eater apologists

3. Hermione subject herself to a marriage law

4. Bashing of Potters and Weasleys

5. Manufactured drama/angst

6. Dumb down characters to jam through a particular plot

7. “Good guys don't kill” trope

That reminds me that a huge no-no for me is the Dursley's being overly abusive. Like bone breaking, starving, raping abusive.

It's just to make Harry more tragic. Like he needs it lol.

**** Yeah this one really grinds my gears.

Obviously the Dursleys are by now means decent people. But going from negligent to full-on abusive/rapists is just too much.

There are many different ways to make your character go through hardship without making characters so incredibly over-the-top bad. Dark Lord Dumbledore is another one of these.

*** For number 2 are you a fan of the fic "On the Wings of a Phoenix?" or the treatment of death eaters in "You'll be the death of me" Would you consider that fic under the umbrella or death eater apologists?

I ask this because in canon we really only see 1 viewpoint that is in direct opposition to them. I've yet to see a well done fic besides the aforementioned one to add some depth to the villians, or even allow them to give their side of the story.

Do I think they are good people? Probably not, but I don't think it boils down to just plain evil, that seems like a copout; humans are much more complex creatures than that.

**** Actions, choices, and intentions are far far more important than the vague good vs evil.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler][Heinrich Himmler]] was said to be a great family man and a loving father. It didn't prevent him from becoming one of the greatest mass murderers of all time.

Similarly, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann][Adolf Eichmann]] had never killed a person by himself, and he was one of the chief architects of the Holocaust.

Many in the SS and Einsatzgruppen were brave, honorable, loyal, and total war criminals. Many in the Gestapo firmly believed they were "only following the orders".

Finally, Adolf Hitler was a really nice boss. His secretaries had nothing but praises for him.

--------------

Just because these monsters had some redeeming qualities, didn't mean they should escape justice.

Death Eaters, as repeatedly depicted in the Books, were hardcore sadistic genocidal serial killers. They were even more vicious than the mentioned Nazi war criminals as these individuals personally enjoyed murders and torture.

The Carrows, for example, used Cruciatus Curse as standard detention punishments on children. Think about it clearly, what that means!

***** *Heinrich Himmler*

Heinrich Luitpold Himmler (German: [ˈhaɪnʁɪç ˈluːɪtˌpɔlt ˈhɪmlɐ] ( listen); 7 October 1900 -- 23 May 1945) was Reichsführer of the Schutzstaffel (Protection Squadron; SS), and a leading member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) of Germany. Himmler was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and one of the people most directly responsible for the Holocaust.

As a member of a reserve battalion during World War I, Himmler did not see active service. He studied agronomy in university, and joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and the SS in 1925.

--------------

*Adolf Eichmann*

Otto Adolf Eichmann (German: [ˈɔtoː ˈʔaːdɔlf ˈʔaɪ̯çman]; 19 March 1906 -- 1 June 1962) was a German Nazi SS-Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel) and one of the major organizers of the Holocaust. He was tasked by SS-Obergruppenführer (general/lieutenant general) Reinhard Heydrich with facilitating and managing the logistics involved in the mass deportation of Jews to ghettos and extermination camps in Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe during World War II. In 1960, he was captured in Argentina by the Mossad, Israel's intelligence service. He was found guilty of war crimes in a widely publicised trial in Israel, and was hanged in 1962.

After an unremarkable school career, Eichmann briefly worked for his father's mining company in Austria, where the family had moved in 1914.

  Arthur is an idiot that shouldn't even be in his department
#+end_quote

I totally disagree. Not only wasn't Arthur an idiot, but actually a bad ass, who often used self-deprecating humor to appear harmless:

- He raised 7 powerful and competent children, despite meager economic resources.
- He managed to pass the Muggle Protection Act against significant opposition in the Wizengamot, and despite himself ranking not high on Ministry hierarchy.
- He, in his spare time, managed to charm a flying invisible car, who also had developed its own sentience.
- He and Molly actively ENCOURAGED his children to befriend Harry and Hermione, after they displayed significant potentials. (my headcanon)
- Although Molly was loud and domineering, he seemed to be in control of ALL major family decisions.
- He and Bill could both cast the Fidelius Charm with ease.
- He fought in the Final Battle and didn't seem to have been injured at all.
- In the end, Weasleys had suffered the fewest losses relatively, while most other major families were pretty much depleted. They further brought the two strongest of the next generation into the family, and built an alliance with the French powerhouse Delacours.

As for the rubber duck question, you need to read a bit more between lines. His supposedly 'stupid' question had indeed put Harry instantly at ease. So, why couldn't he just be kidding with Harry?

** One major pet peeve of mine is when Harry does an inheritance test at Gringotts and discovers that he's secretly the long lost heir to the Most Ancient and Noble Wizarding family of X, and then he *inherits a giant goddamn fortune that has just been sitting untouched in the vault for centuries*!

Like how the fuck do these authors think it works? If a rich accountholder dies with no heirs, the bank just holds onto the money for hundreds of years, on the off chance that maybe someday someone will show up who is a distant genetic match to the former owner, so the bank can then just hand over the fortune?? How often does that fucking happen?!

Not to mention the fact that everyone in the wizarding world are all distantly or closely related to one another, so the chances of someone dying not only with no heirs but without even a single distant relative in the entire inbred community are practically zero.

And these are */goblins/* for fuck's sake! Their whole shtick is being greedy thieving bastards. How does that comport with them politely keeping an ownerless fortune in trust for generations when there is no one coming to claim it? And really, if some scrawny orphan shows up and it turns out he's actually the Heir to the giant Hufflepuff-Peverell pile of gold in the goblins' vaults, what's to stop them from just saying, "Tough luck, kid, looks like you aren't the heir to anything" or "Neato, you're the secret heir of Merlin but sorry there's no corresponding secret fortune" and just keeping the damn money? It's not like anyone is double checking these tests, or auditing Gringotts!

Not to mention the Ministry trying to get its hands on any abandoned money that happens to be lying around. If say, Tiberius Ogden died with no living relatives, wouldn't the Ministry immediately try to claim that wealth? That's how it works in real life- if no heir can be located, the money escheats to the state.

And all those arguments apply tenfold to the stories where the inheritance has a fucking /manor/ thrown in!

#+begin_quote
  Who owns that giant mansion next door?

  No one, it's been empty for centuries.

  Well gee, isn't that a bit wasteful? I'd sure like a big manor, maybe I should just move in!

#+begin_quote
  Torchlight flares to life surrounding the chamber from 16 separate wall sconces placed around the room. With the lights fully aflame, Harry and Moony take a look around at the contents of the Potter Vault.

  Harry: "I don't understand."

  Moony: "It's all paper."

  Moony reaches down to pick up a parchment laying on the floor.

  Moony: "This is a certificate for 40,000 shares in a magical flying carpet corporation, dated 23rd November, 1982."

  Harry: "Aren't flying carpets banned in Britain?"

  Moony: "Yup."

  Harry: "Griphook, is there a way to get an assessment of the current value of the contents of this vault?"

  Griphook: "Two galleons for the answer."

  Harry: "Fine."

  After Griphook pockets the two coins, he smiles.

  Griphook: "You may have the clerk of courts evaluate the paperwork for review of contracts to look for improprieties, but at this time, there is no value in this vault. Except perhaps as insulation or kindling."

  Harry: "No value. Griphook how is the Trust vault sustained?"

  Griphook: "One galleon."

  Harry: "I'd ask to run a tab but I doubt my funds will hold out."

  Griphook: "You're not as dumb as most. Your Trust vault is renewed to a level of 50,000 galleons every 1st of August from the contents of this vault. As this vault is in arrears, you have been refilling the Trust vault from a modest loan for the last 8 years, interest set at a forgiving 3%, compounded monthly."

  Harry: "If I were to put the money from the Trust vault back into this one..."

  Griphook: "We can process that request for a 1% handling fee, as you do not have financial control of this vault yet. As it stands, your Trust vault will be replenished with additional loans until you have the authority to change that arrangement and order it so."

**** Not quite: it was empty for a bit less than fifty years apart from a caretaker. That implies either a will trust (highly improbable, there are so many things wrong with that from a legal and business point of view it's not even funny) or an illegitimate child who inherited on the failure of the original bequests kept it mothballed out of the income of the rest of the estate so as to have a bolthole and/or a trophy from the family that rejected him.

Headcanon for me is that the second one is what happened. Tom claimed under the Intestacy Act, and got the big house (unlikely to be a manor house, the main village of a manor is generally not called Little anything, more likely a Glebe or just an old family pile not quite grand enough to attract the attention of English Heritage or the National Trust) and a lot of other rental properties whose income was just enough to keep the house in basic repair and a caretaker paid. A caretaker who could be magically compelled to remain in post long after retirement age despite being looked at funny every day for fifty years, and probably obliviated and confunded every few years when his "boss" needed to lay low there for a few weeks. Poor man's brain was probably like swiss cheese.

I just like the idea of Mr Evans also being one as well. The vast majority of what Harry has about his family is from his father's side, and I think it would be nice if his name was something that /both/ Lily and James had reasons to want.

Petunia calls Harry a “nasty, common name”...but the thing about my version of Petunia is that she married up a bit, Vernon's family is a bit richer than hers was and she's /acutely aware/ of that slight distinction. She's deliberately trained her voice into something approaching Received Pronunciation, rather than whatever her natural accent once was. She keeps her house obnoxiously, spotlessly neat so that none of the neighbours will ever have cause to think she doesn't fit in Little Whinging. She /pretends/, a LOT.

Rejecting her own father's name as “nasty” and “common” is her reaching desperately for that little extra scrap of suburban respectability.

Most /towns/ in the UK have their own accent. Liverpool and Manchester are 35 miles apart, centre-to-centre, but you can tell a scouser from a manc as soon as they open their mouths. Usually to argue about football.

"Regional" accents in the British Isles tend more to be groups of accents, once you look closely. Take my native Lancashire: you've got Scouse (Liverpool and environs, within which there are variations) and everyone else, except that "everyone else" covers Manchester, Preston, the Fylde, and East Lancashire*, shading into the Lake District accents to the north.

*Including Pendle, of witch-trial fame. My personal headcanon is that the Longbottoms inherited Malkin Tower from the Devices ** and the reason nobody knows where it is nowadays is three hundred years of muggle-repelling and unplottability enchantments. And Augusta Longbottom, /nee/ Nutter*** is an inveterate writer of indignant letters to the Blackburn Telegraph.

**A fine old Lancashire name, although usually spelt "Davis" nowadays to better match the pronunciation.

As for martial arts, Hermione was almost a year older than Harry, and that's a significant advantage at their age.

As for how well they could fight, this story has depicted a very detailed duel between them halfway through year 1. They were evenly matched.

So this is definitely not a Hermione wank fic. In fact, this Hermione is relatively weaker compared to canon, while Harry is relatively much stronger. Even on the academic front, Hermione ranked number 1 (expected), Harry was either number 2 or 3, a lot higher than in canon.

If you don't enjoy them, they don't have to be present! Shit, send them away on holiday in one sentence, and you'll never have to mention them again!

It annoys me no end to see a character who's been deliberately included in a story for no other reason than to be the monster, and subsequently have everyone else (and the author, often) lay out The Reason They Suck in great detail.

TLDR - What's the POINT of bashfics?!

I feel you on that one. It's awful, because if you're going to write about Harry, write Harry either as he is in the books/movies or that but changed because of the premise. If you want to write about an OC, make an OC.

** Certain pairings, such as: Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, Tom(Voldemort)/Harry, Dumbledore/Voldemort, Hermione/Snape, Draco/Hermione, Remus/Tonks. If you haven't guessed I really hate Canon pairings, and too out there pairings.

Too OOC. I really hate OOC fics, some characters are hard to get right and I get that. However there is a line where it should be obvious even to the author that it is way too OOC. I get some writer's aim for that, and that's okay, it's just not my cup of tea. I prefer closer canon-characterizations. Not to say that the characters can not "Grow-Up" so to speak due to certain situations, etc. I don't mind that. Let's take Snape-Mentors-Harry. I like these fics, however too often I find they have OOC Snape, or Snape suddenly changing his ways, or his mind, about Harry, three chapters in. Character-Change has to be made realistically over a period of time, for reasons that make sense, for it to be of any interest to me.

Anything with Harry/Draco being brothers, or a pair.

Anything with poor spelling, or grammar. Or the dreaded mis-spellings of spells, names, etc. And what really gets me is when they mis-spell it differently each time it comes up. LIKE CAN YOU NOT JUST USE GOOGLE IS THAT TOO HARD?!

When Romance happens for no reason. JK I'm looking at you bro.

Bashing of Characters. I can understand this to a certain extent but when your story is bashing All-Weasleys', Hermione, Dumbledore, McGonogall, and All-Gryffindors save Harry, it's so fucking annoying and unnecessary, ridiculous and cringe-worthy. A lot of times I see it when they want to make Draco and Harry friends. I'm sorry but if you need to make every other character in the series an asshole to accomplish that then you're a bad writer.

When people make characters extremely stupid. This is irritating, cause I'm sitting there thinking my god is the author self-inserting themselves into this character, is that why the character is so unintelligent? It's cringey, and too read it makes me want to throw myself off a building. I just read this fic where Snape was trying to explain what the term "Self-Fulfilling prophecy" meant. He explained it in simple words, different ways each time. Gave visual aids and still harry goes "I don't understand." My eight year old niece understood it perfectly fine the first time it was explained, with the same words Snape used. Harry was 16. I honestly don't know who is more stupid, the harry portrayed in that fic, or Voldemort who can't even kill off a basic idiot.

Smut. Porn without Plot.

Over-Powered or Creature fics.

Rich Harry who is from the best of all 50 bloodlines, who is the owner of the wizarding world.

Where everyone is raped, repeatedly by numerous people.

When people use Draco-Saves-Hermione-from-rape to get the two characters together.

When people use Rape as a means to get two characters together such as, Harry Rapes Hermione, Hermione realizes she likes it, or realizes she loves harry so it's okay, etc, and they get together. No.

Just no.

Fics that have Harry killing in self-defense and him getting all depressed and 'omg i'm as bad as them'. No. In case you forgot Harry crucio'd Bellatrix Lestrange, tried to do so to Snape, and did so somewhat successfuly to Amycus Carrow, turned Quirrel to ash, did nothing to 'save' Umbridge, Or to save Wormtail from choking. He didn't weep over them. Let alone something he had to do in self-defense (Which most of those were, give or take a few). Get real.

Self-Harm, or Drug-Abuse fics. My life is going so swell I long to read a fic that makes me want to kill myself, so thank you for writing them.

MPREG

Slavery Fics.

Marriage-Laws/Bonds.

** (First consider that Rowling's face of Slytherin for a while is Draco, who has all the cunning of a hamster)

He fooled Quirrellmort into monologuing, stalling for time.

He figured out how to kill Tom Riddle with a basilisk fang in about two seconds, hoping it would restore Ginny.

He was smart enough to not let Sirius kill Peter (the end result withstanding.) The plan was good, and only Remus really fucked it up.

He figured out the maze pretty easily, even though he had help, he WAS 3 years younger than the others.

He figured out how to hold a secret meeting for months and was only found out because he was betrayed. He let Lucius monologue and then figured out a pretty smart plan to get his friends out of there.

He figured out how to make the best of Felix Felicus, and even used a placebo effect on Ron, which was pretty cunning.

He figured out on his own that the Elder Wand was his and that Voldemort couldn't hurt him. He also talked the Grey Lady into telling him about the Diadem.

There are others, and I'll be the first to admit that Harry is mostly hotheaded and broody, but he has a lot of cunning when he puts his mind to it.

*** Slash isn't really a genre on its own... It's more of a category that's separate from "genres" as we know them.

A good amount of slash and non-slash fanfics are just garbage no matter what. It's not about the fact that they're gay, it's just fanfiction(and potentially writing in general) having a lot of bad eggs.

I also don't know what you're trying to imply about "what straight guy could read it without vomitting"

If you don't like gay fanfiction... don't read it? I don't know why you feel the need to come to threads like this and post shit as if it's a bad thing that it exists just because you don't like it.

For the record, I don't read slash. I never have and never will, because I'm not really interested in that sort of thing. It'd be cool if I was because that'd open up a LOT of new content to read, but I'm not.

But shit like this just seems unnecessary and annoying.

You're clearly not the target audience of slash fics if you don't want to read gay(m/m) fanfiction.

This sort of shit is exactly why I commented.

This is fucking unnecessary, it's literally a homophobic sentiment that wasn't asked for whatsoever.

Learn what a turnoff is-- it doesn't mean "come in here if you think gay people are disgusting and use writing as a cover to spread it" it means actual things inserted into stories that are turnoffs.

Rich Harry with 5000 titles is a turnoff.

Manipulative Dumbledore that's the "true" evil mastermind is a turnoff.

Weasley bashing is a turnoff.

Slash? That's a fucking category of fanfiction that you actively hate on because you're a disgusting homophobic piece of shit.

Not a turnoff.

I don't care if you read it or not. I don't read it because I'm not into slash, but my reasoning doesn't devolve into disgusting sentiments like "gay people having sex(or even KISSING????) is gross!11!!"

There's no "doubt" you literally described gay people kissing as "disgusting/repulsive"

Dress it up with the "Oh I don't actually judge people who do it but I just think it's super gross and it repulses me to even think about it" all you want I guess, but it changes nothing.

Then you bring politics into it.

You're such a tasteless person. "Leftism" isn't why I get mad at blatant homophobia(which yes, saying gay people kissing/having sex is disgusting/repulsive IS homophobia)

This isn't a political issue. Don't try to lower it to one, and feel free to fuck off and not spread literal hate speech in niche fanfiction communities for no reason.

Thanks bud.

TLDR: Keep your homophobia to yourself or don't be surprised when you get called out on it.

You're not homophobic for not consuming/liking slash fanfiction.

I also don't consume/like slash fanfiction.

You're homophobic for repeatedly saying that gay people kissing/having sex is disgusting.

Full stop.

You can make up all the definitions of homophobia you want to conveniently excuse yourself and other stereotypical conservative "I don't dislike gay people! I just don't want to see, hear, or think about their disgusting degenerate gay actions!" attitudes all you want.

I don't really care, this argument is unproductive at this point-- people like you will never change because you've morphed your mindsets on the topic so much that you actually find your views justified and convince yourself that you can actually not be homophobic while spreading this crap.

I'd just ask you to keep this sort of shit in T_D where it belongs rather than trying to spread your anti-gay sentiments into communities where this argument has no business taking place.

I'm blocking you. I hope eventually you become a better person-- not for your sake, but for all of the other groups of people that you probably discriminate against while also not holding yourself accountable for doing so.
