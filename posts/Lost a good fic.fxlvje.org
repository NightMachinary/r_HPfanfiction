Goblet of fire, AU, harry x hermione (can't remember if it is tagged as that but they are in a relationship), hermione's mother is a dragon pretending to be a muggle, hermione and harry become dragons, and shape is a weak dragon pretending to be a half-blood that's all I remember.


** "On Crimson Wings".

  Response to GoldenSteel's My gf is a what? challenge. GoF: Hermione has a secret. One that even she doesn't know. When she unearths a highly dangerous ritual to help Harry in the first task, the two of them never expected that secret to hit them both and change them into Great Dragons! Are they doomed to be treated as beasts? What does this mean for the TWT? H/Hr; AD/RW/MW putdown.

**** That depends on your personal preferences. If "putting down" Dumbledore, Ron and Molly doesn't annoy you, and you like dragons, you'll probably like the story.
