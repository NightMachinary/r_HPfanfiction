** I don't recall the name of it but there is a well known fic about post-Hogwarts life that has some strong Ron scenes. It's primarily about Harry and Ginny. Ginny becomes a healer . Ron and Harry are aurors but Harry becomes an Azkaban prison guard . Ron warily keeps tabs on Malfoy and he and Harry buy a house together. He & Hermione are together in this fic happily . Sorry its not more Ron centric but that's the fic that snapped into my head when I saw your question.

*** If you or perhaps someone could find it I'd love to read it. It doesn't have to be Ron centric stores, just as long as there are good moments with him.

**** I remember now . It is After the End. It is epic length and was written before the last couple of books were published , so it deviates from canon --- but it isn't an attempt at AU- it was just speculation (and they got a LOT right !) It is firmly Ron/Hermione.

Don't let the low number of reviews fool you , this was published on a fan site called The Sugar Quill and didn't move to ff.net until a couple years later.

** Ron generally is a hero in my stories. He's one of the two main characters in "The Dark Lord Never Died", as a spy for Dumbledore in Malfoy-ruled Britain. He also has a number of great moments in most of my other stories, especially in "Divided and Entwined".

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
