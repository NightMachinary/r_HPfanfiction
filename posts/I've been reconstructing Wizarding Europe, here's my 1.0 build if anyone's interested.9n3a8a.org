The Statute of Secrecy was signed in 1689, so I started with the assumption that wizarding countries in Europe were more or less identical to their muggle counterparts at that point (indeed, there arguably wasn't any such thing as a "wizarding country", with few exceptions) but then began to diverge.

The major powers of Europe are the Kingdom of France, still ruled by a cadet branch of the Bourbons; the Wizarding Roman Republic, which was built from the administrative structure meant to oversee the Holy Roman Emperor's magical subjects; and Iberia-Sicily, which has not been ruled by the Hapsburgs for a very long time but has remained intact to be a counterweight against France and the W.R.R. when necessary. "Divided we fall" and all that.

Checkered areas in the W.R.R. represent "free states" (placeholder name) which have considerably more autonomy. Many of them are centered on particular cities but, given the low population of the magical community and their penchant for teleporting around, are larger in territory than a muggle version might be.

This is meant to represent Europe as it stands in the 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union (some Russian wizards saw what Grindelwald was doing with Hitler and had the bright idea to try it with Stalin, only they thought too highly of themselves and too little of the muggles, and came out of it rather the worse for wear).

Anyway, if you've been wanting a Wizarding Europe that's more than just "All the countries correspond to muggle ones, and also they all have ministries because everyone is British" then here you go, and feel free to ask questions if you'd like.

*** Nod. I'm much less satisfied with everything east of, oh, let's say Germany and Italy, than I with Western Europe, where my biggest annoyance is not being able to decide what color to give to Corsica. I'm probably going to chop off part of Poland-Lithuania (especially along the west). I may also add part of Ukraine to it.

I'm not as concerned about languages and mutual intelligibility: there are plenty of multi-ethnic or even multi-language countries in history, and we know that Viktor Krum, a Bulgarian, attended a school located in Norway or Sweden, so multilingualism may just be expected in the magical community.

That said, part of why I posted this was to get feedback like yours, so I'm definitely going to be taking it into account and thinking more on it when I return to work on this.

*** Such a thing as a baltic language doesn't exist... Lithuania is a baltic state but the languages that are spoken in the baltic states don't have a lot in common. Estonian and Lithuanian for example are completely unrelated. Also at the time Estonia and Lithuania both were known as one single country/area Livonia. At the time such a thing as the batlic countries didn't exist.

**** Okay.

If it interests you, I have a headcanon of what Magical Albania is like --- basically, it's a Dark Wizard's greatest dream, /the/ place where all dark creatures and wizards who have been chased or exiled out of everywhere else go. Hence why Helena would flee there to hide the Diadem and why Voldemort went there and why Quirrell /and/ Pettigrew knew to look for him there of all places.

I further have the headcanon that the official Wizarding Albanian Government is therefore disliked by everyone else in the I.C.W., but are nonetheless given a voice because the many dark beings in their debt are a force to be reckoned with. (They have a sizable force of Dementors in their army ---though nothing next to the Azkaban population ---, Heliopaths, Trolls of various breeds, rebel wanded Goblins/Kobolds... plus quite a few Bellatrix and Greyback types.) Their Sorcerous President in the 1990's is one grumpy, trigger-happy fellow, too.

***** Interesting! That sort of fits with some of my own thoughts.

For a long time, my headcanon has been that the Carpathians and Balkans were once ruled by a group of dark wizards. The region has been a hotbed for dark activity ever since, and dark magic is an easy go-to for nationalists and xenophobes because it heartens back to the days when their people were the terror of Europe. Carpathia explicitly casts itself as a successor state to this dark kingdom (but is pragmatic enough to realize that Poland-Lithuanian could stomp it in a heartbeat if they tried to reclaim “their”northern territory) and it's not hard to imagine that Albania might have done the same thing.

Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** I'm less interested in whatever specific political geography you have created than I am in what political mechanics you have used to reach them. From the language in your post, you seem to have taken quite a Muggle approach to geopolitics -- states which are interested in territorial conquest, Great Power gunboat diplomacy, power being concentrated in state institutions rather than individuals, etc.

This is a stark contrast to canon geopolitics, where the relationships between magical governments are somewhat like those of EU member states (there's still competition, but within certain constraints, and a lot of very close cooperation) and where individual wizards of great power can have more power than states. Was this a planned departure based on some particular reason? Or was it more an unconscious defaulting to the familiar?

For me, it seems inevitable that wizarding geopolitics must be quite different to Muggle geopolitics, for the following reasons:

1. The population is highly mobile.

2. The population, including business/industry, requires very little in the way of infrastructure.

3. There are very few genuinely scarce natural resources of value.

4. All citizens are in principle equally as well armed as the state and it is not uncommon for some citizens to be so powerful that they are effectively beyond state control.

5. All states are engaged in a massive collaborative enterprise in which they are fully invested and which requires a great amount of cooperation (wizarding secrecy).

6. Non-human magical species exist who might threaten all human magical states.

7. The population is extremely dispersed, with small populations spread across vast areas. Further, the vast majority of citizens deliberately avoid population centres, prefering to live in remote areas.

8. There are no armies.

*** To be honest, you're perfectly right, and I've actually written a few articles that address some of these issues, but every time I've tried to approach things from that angle the result doesn't maintain the original flavor of the HP series and the books themselves don't fit into the new setting anymore.

If I were building a magical society from the ground up for my own setting, you can be sure I'd be tackling these issues and presenting a much stranger society (that, in all likelihood, probably couldn't be mapped at all in this way).

** I have been doing the same thing with the world. I've taken the world around the 1650s as well and expanded on it. In mine, the Ottomans still exist and are the big counter-weight to Europe (and a huge reason why the SoS was enacted). Can I ask why the Ottomans don't exist in your version? They certainly were around, and powerful, in the late 1600s.

*** Very interesting map! That looks like it'd certainly be a lot easier than what I was using, which required me to keep saving text files and painstakingly mess with little details every time I wanted to go in and edit stuff.

Do you mind if I lift some of this from you, especially the North American stuff? I'll give credit, of course.

It's too much to say that the Turkish Empire doesn't exist anymore, but I did kick them out of Europe simply because I wasn't sure what to do with them (at the very least they wouldn't still be /Ottomans/, any more than the Napoleonic French were Bourbons) and it was easier to just give that little slice of Turkish land in Europe over to Greece-and-Macedonia (in my defense, I can say only that I'm a grad student and realized I have a paper coming due! >:P ).

In future versions of this map, they may well come back, but I do want to maintain the independence of, at the very least, Albania and Bulgaria, which are referenced in the books in a way that's hard to overlook, and Carpathia, because I just really like them.

1. I spent far too long on this project. While I didn't do a lot of research for e.g. France's borders, because the French were considerate and have been a single state (in one form or another) for centuries, I spent a few hours on countries like Belgium.

2. I have far less to go on. My headcanon for East Asia is that wizards there were by and large very secretive already by the time of the Statute of Secrecy (in some ways, European witches and wizards were latecomers to a state of affairs already present in many other places), so I wouldn't know where to start. I've been discussing Asia off and on with a friend though, so...maybe this won't be as much of an issue later on.

This picture is somewhere around the middle of the war. The main force (green) has almost conquered all of the United Kingdom, with the enemy (red) controlling Ireland.

[[https://gyazo.com/7f79c45f89dc2b0b6efa38d6a1603646]]

This is the very start.

Green = The main faction

Red = Enemy

Orange = A treaty between a faction and the main faction

Burgundy = Voldemort

Purple = Royal Crown (Queen of England and such)

All this makes very little sense without having the lore behind it, but yes. It plays out slowly, with territories being obtained and lost as the war goes on.

*** I apologize for the offense. I didn't spend much time on names for most of these (you might be able to tell that some have official names and others don't), and I spent less time on the British Isles than I did for literally any other country. It seemed from the books that Ireland was unequivocally under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Magic (see GoF, where it's Cornelius Fudge who represents the Irish Quidditch Team) and I saw no reason to change that.

The final, official name, if it isn't something-or-other Britain and Ireland, will probably be broken down even further (e.g. England, Ireland, Scotland, & Wales, or something), but I can see how the brief appellation that I granted it there could be problematic and, again, apologize for causing offense.

EDIT: Finland /was/ Sweden for a long, long time. Messing up the name that I use is one matter, and I ought to have kept that in mind when I made the legend, but I'm not going to be setting up national boundaries just because some people might be annoyed about which fictional people are part of which country. You'll notice that Catalonia and the Basque Country are similarly part of a larger country, Ukraine doesn't exist, Luxembourg and Venice are rather large...
