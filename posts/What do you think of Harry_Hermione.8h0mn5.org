** They had a nice moment dancing in a tent. I really liked it, but the reason I liked it was because I saw them as friends. Friendship between male and female is so rarely exists in any form of media where there are no implications of romance. But friends can have their nice moments too without it being sexualized.

So no, I don't see them as a paring even though Ron and Hermione don't have any chemistry.

** They had a good foundation for a successful relationship. For the most part, they are extremely receptive to each other and trust each other reflexively nearly all the time. Hermione in particular is loyal to an almost absurd degree to Harry, willing to give up her own love and well being to be there for him. That's just... damn.

I never thought they were a "harmony" in the sense of being perfect for each other, because /no one/ is. The only "perfect" couples are those whom you only restrict yourself to thinking about in very shallow ways. Real couples disagree, learn about each other and grow together. I think with growth, they could be good for each other.

However, anyone who thinks that people who bicker and argue all the time /before/ getting into a relationship are expressing sexual tension and are romantically compatible need to get into a real long term relationship. If you fought a lot beforehand, all getting together will do is make you a couple (or spouses) who fight repeatedly. And that destroys relationships. There's a reason JKR had to make certain comments about Ron and Hermione after the series, they just aren't that compatible in canon, but more to the point, they fight too much to survive without a /lot/ of couple's counseling (if they're lucky anyway).

*** This^^

The "Chemistry" between Ron and Hermione is like a Mentos in a bottle of coke. Might give you a good bang, but will fizzle out quickly and leave behind a huge mess.

And while Harry and Hermione are in no way a match made in heaven^{^{TM,}} they definitely share a bond forged in battle. They would have their fair share of arguments, but in canon, Harry never says something aimed at hurting Hermione, while Ron nearly makes a habit out of it.

**** I disagree. Ron can be insensitive, but the only thing I can remember him saying intentionally to hurt her was in Transfigurations in sixth year after she made fun of his mustache.

#+begin_quote
  /"They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration; working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again."/
#+end_quote

But Harry does however say he doesn't like hanging out with Hermione, whereas Ron casually sings her praises.

Ron and Hermione's relationship is extremely complex. Most people believe that you have to be compatible to be a successful couple, but in their case, they fill a void in the other's life. And as we've seen as the series goes on, they love arguing; it's like foreplay for them, and when they come to an impasse, they drop it or resolve and learn from it.

***** Chronic insensitivity isn't really any better than intentional put downs. It shows you don't care enough to think about what you say.

That said, he was intentionally hurtful in Book 1 (though he rightly felt bad for it), PoA he went overboard when he thought she was overly careless and caused Scabbers to be killed and when she got the Firebolt taken (I'd say both were at fault, and Harry going along with the latter case was a bit much, but it was in-character for Ron honestly). Probably others, but those three came to mind.

#+end_quote

I really dislike this thought process. They very clearly don't like arguing, they argue because they get mad at each other. Arguing and meanspiritedness re not foreplay, I'll never understand why people think this. These things break relationships, especially when they become common (which Harry notes that it was common by the time of OoTP, I think). People who argue before hooking up don't suddenly stop being argumentative, it just doesn't happen.

****** That's Ron's upbringing. The Weasleys are loud and like ribbing each other, so it's just his nature to say whatever's on his mind. It also makes him honest, which is a very desirable trait.

He didn't mean to hurt her. He was angry that she was patronizing him and he made a joke about her. Everyone does this. He wasn't being hurtful about Scabbers, either. He simply wanted her to apologize for her cat, who he thought ate his rat, and she was adamant that Crookshanks didn't. People always blow that one out of proportion. The Firebolt too.

That's just it. There's no mean spirit in their arguing. And they hardly ever get mad at each other. Even at the Yule Ball, when they argued, they were talking the next day like nothing ever happened. They rarely ever get mad at each other. The only times that come to mind are in sixth year when Ron finds out about Krum and he starts dating Lavender, and during the horcrux hunt, where Ron was under the influence of a horcrux and Hermione was angry with him when he came back.

It's actually not that common in fact. They've arguably spent more time with each other than anyone else in their seven years together, including all of the times Harry wasn't around, and they've only gotten into a handful of serious arguments, all of which were centered around some outside force. First it was Scabbers and Crookshanks, then it was Krum, then Lavender, and then Ron being unable to apparate back after leaving.

But one of the biggest aspects of their characters is that they're both argumentative. It's just casual for them and is how their relationship developed. You say it's common, meaning that it happens regularly, yet they still stay together through all of it. My parents argue all the time and are still happily together after almost thirty years. My partner and I bicker incessantly about the most mundane things, but we're still together.

Arguing isn't bad. It's when you go out of your way to hurt someone, which you do less and less as you mature, which we never got to see the full extent of, since they were eighteen when the series ended.

That is not the same as being carelessly mean. If you're always :saying what's on your mind" and those things are often mean or rude, then you're probably not a nice person. Which is an undesirable trait. Honesty is not to be confused with saying the first thing that comes to mind.

I already covered this. Continued insensitivity is a bad character trait. Also, his actions in HBP with Lavender (even after the bit you quoted earlier) was a particularly bad example of unintentionally hurting her.

You're confusing two different points. Ron says and does some mean spirited things to her, and they also often argue. The idea that they aren't mad when they argue is just silly. Are you simply unfazed by getting into repeated arguments with someone? Of course not. Also, everyone was under the influence of the Horcrux. Harry in particular had to deal with its influence and the physical pain it caused him. No one gets a pass, especially as he Apparated after he took it off.

You are ignoring that this was commonplace (according to Harry) years before they ever got together. That doesn't set up a good relationship, hence JKR's comments about them being incompatible.

If you are, maybe this is a question you should address yourself. Do you honestly feel like not talking to your S/O because you can't agree sometimes? Remember that a debate is an argument. Are you incapable of debate?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It affected Ron more than the other two. For one, he's more emotional than them and has a lot more fear and insecurities for the locket to feed on. He had to deal with holding Harry and Hermione back thanks to his injury, constant fear that his family was in danger because of him, fear that Hermione preferred Harry over him, fear that his mother didn't love him, fear that he was useless, or pitied, or that he constantly lived in someone else's shadow. Hermione's family was safe in Australia. Harry had no family to speak of. And even if they wanted to leave, they couldn't because they were Britain's most wanted, whereas Ron could have gotten by on his pureblood status. He didn't have to starve himself, risk bodily harm, nor the safety of his family, but he did for Harry.

I said carelessly mean, not thinking about how what he said will be taken. Book 4 is the usual example where "You're a girl..." is a revelation. And to be fair, asking your friend isn't ones first thought, but that's a pretty bad way to verbalize that.

Ok, there comes a point where you can't blame other people for how you choose to act. Harry didn't have such either (and canon is replete with examples of the results of his lack of that), but I don't think it excuses him when he acts like a drama queen.

Sooo, she was in the bathroom in book 1 because no reason.

#+end_quote

You are mixing terms. Colloquailly, an "argument" is a verbal dispute, usually with a negative connotation. In everyday language, that is not the same thing as a debate, which is usually assumed to be a more formal activity. So yes, in general I do not enjoy arguing with my fiance the way Ron and Hermione are told to have throughout the series.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

How? The main issue the Horcrux is told to exploit is his fear Hermione wanted Harry, to the extent that it used that as a last resort to try and turn him. The other things were definite concerns, but DH shows us that before they even had the locket that the Ministry bought the deception that the transfigured ghoul at the Weasleys was Ron with spattergroit. Some of the other things (living in someone's shadow) weren't mentioned as factors in that book. I think.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I suspect that the kind of arguing that Ron and Hermione engaged in is not the kind of arguing people enjoy. Debate can be productive, or at least fun. Arguing in the everyday sense is usually seen as a bad thing:

Argue: "exchange or express diverging or opposite views, typically in a heated or angry way."

Keep in mind that we only get Harry's perspective, who is emotionally reclusive and was raised in a household where you shouldn't be open about your problems. We don't get to see Ron and Hermione's downtime, when Harry's not around. You want Ron and Hermione, think New York Italians and Jews.

Normal teenage boys are also prone to acting as such. As for examples, OoTP has two examples: post-Dementor attack when he's venting at Number 12 and when he thinks he's being possessed by Voldemort and contemplates running away and tries to push everyone away. Now yes, these are understandable but they were nonetheless overreactions that he needed to be cooled down from by his friends.

I said he regretted it later, and he didn't bring it up again because they became friends later that night. Generally making rude remarks about people aloud is intended to hurt their feelings.

As I said, that's not the case for most people and crucially: there is no canon suggestion those 2 enjoy arguing. If we're just going to fob that off on Harry's narration then we night as well say we know barely anything about them.

** Just my two cents right here:

Ron and Hermione have one kind of chemistry, Harry and Hermione have another. The main thing that bothers me with RonxHermione is that they don't really have a whole lot beyond chemistry, except maybe shared trauma.

Ron is never going to really understand Hermione's passion for knowledge and figuring things out. I would expect him to keep making fun of that aspect of her life. Hermione enters the story with a desire for growth. Without all of the crazy happening, she just wants to learn, to know and to make an impact. Ron is more of a hedonist. He grows because he has to, but really just seems to want to live an enjoyable life.\\
Their potential for interaction is fairly limited, since there isn't much outside of the relationship that they share. Ron also just seems to be significantly less intelligent than Hermione, which doesn't help either.

--------------

Harry fits better, in my opinion, because he, like her, is driven. Where Ron is mostly motivated by helping his friends, Harry seems to be at least somewhat motivated by a desire to make the world a better place.\\
Harry and Hermione play really well off of each other. Harry is curious, just like Hermione, but he is also reckless and risk seeking where Hermione is initially cautious and Risk averse. They balance each other out really well that way. Harry is at least capable of empathizing with her passion for learning, and he's curious enough to put in the effort to actually engage with the things she cares about.

--------------

When I imagine HermionexRon what I think of is Hermione being reduced to a Molly 2.0, giving up a lot of what defines her to live a somewhat jolly family life. I can't conceive of a dinner conversation the two could have after being together for a while, except maybe for Ron feigning interest to make her happy. I think of Ron stumbling through social situations with the grace of a dunk elephant, which results in him hurting Hermione a lot. I think of Hermione treating Ron as a job, trying to help him get somewhere while Ron really doesn't have any goals besides getting old and having a family.

When I imagine HarryxHermione what I think of is both of them supporting each other. They are both capable of being sincere, and they both have at least enough tact to realize when they screw up, and enough humility to feel bad about it and work through it. I imagine Hermione bringing up some project of hers and Harry being legitimately interested, even if he may not care about the details as much as about the ELI5.

--------------

TL;DR: Ron/Hermione have chemistry. Harry/Hermione have substance and shared interests beyond each other and past trauma.
