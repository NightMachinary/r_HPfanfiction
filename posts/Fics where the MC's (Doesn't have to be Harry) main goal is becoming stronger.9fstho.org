Yo.

I'm looking for fics where the MC wants to become stronger for whatever reason, whether they're on the dark or light side. The fic should be focused around that somewhat, but not completely. For example, I enjoyed Lady Archimedes very much. Although it can be characters that are in the stories, I'd love for it to be an OC too.

I'd love for it to be 100k+ words. No bashing, preferably no pairings(but if the ones you know all have them, please suggest those that don't focus on them). Please don't have stories where the authors make the characters hold the "idiot ball" in order to make them do something stupid for plot progression. I always find that such lazy writing. Characters should, in a sense, act logically (although they'd still be kids so this doesn't really matter.)

I'd rather the story take place during the main canon timeline, not James and Lily's or after the events of canon.

These are a lot of demands, but thank you for taking your time!

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

** Here we go:

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi): Harry really only wants to become better at magic

Linkffn(The Mind Arts): similar to the above but strong here is on a much higher scale

Linkffn(on the way to greatness by Mira mirth): sort of, but it really starts in 4th year.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge): Harry gears up to fight Voldemort, with some backup too.

Linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) has Harry working to beat out his competition, only getting more competitive as time passes.

Linkffn(Champion's New Hope): Harry decides to up his game to take on Voldemort, trains like crazy. Not the best, but this one is actually completed.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
