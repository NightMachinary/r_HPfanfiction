How would you feel about a Dracula-esque story? That being, a story that's written partly in diary entries, paper articles etc. I've thought this over a few times because one of the main flaws of fanfiction is a lack of imagination. We tend to hang onto tried and proven methods of writing, often without giving it a personal touch. So, your thoughts?


** What plot do you have in mind ?

*** Haven't got a time frame, but the basic plot would be a disgraced pureblood trying to restore his family by becoming Minister of Magic or something of the like.

**** Ooooh. That could definitely be fun. Good idea! Do please post a Self-Rec thing on the sub when you upload. :)

EDIT - Oh, also yes, the format is cool by me. But I enjoyed House of Leaves, so I'm definitely not a representative opinion. :D

** Go for it. Anything else than going through the same old Stations of the Canon is good idea in my books.

**** OK, sorry, I didn't mean it that I would like ANYthing other than Stations of the Cross (I am not particular fan of the pureblood Lily), but I am certain you will find your readers who will enjoy it.
