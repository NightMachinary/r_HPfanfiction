I don't think I've ever seen a ship like this but I would like to read one just to see the reactions of the marauders and the rest of the school when they find out.


** Why does it have to be fem!James ?

** They weren't entirely sure how it had happened in the first place. One minute Severus Snape and Joanna Potter had been sniping at each other, the next they had fallen into a (suspiciously convenient) cleaning cupboard and started kissing in a clumsy, passionate frenzy of tongues and wayward hands.

That had been two years ago, and they had been falling into cleaning cupboards, cozy alcoves, the Forbidden Forest and that little grotto where the first years moored before the Sorting ever since. Somewhere along the way, Joanna had actually got to know Sev and - even though he was a grumpy git who liked shiny dark things too much - she had grown to enjoy his company. He was dry and clever and blushed beautifully when she teased him. She had told Sirius to lay off him soon after their first clandestine "date", citing OWLs and later NEWTs. He had shrugged and accepted it, saying he didn't want Snivellus ruining his grades anyway.

Joanna never told Sev what she had done, but he smiled at her more often when her friends weren't looking. When he started hanging out with Evans and her friends more, she took dragging him behind library shelves for a quick kiss; reinforcing good behaviour, y'know?

But now they were in Seventh Year, and what was once illicit and thrilling was now something that felt like a dirty little secret. Sev deserved better than that. She deserved better.

She took a deep breath. It was Monday morning, so the entire school was there. She ignored the Marauders' friendly waves and marched up to the Slytherin table and stopped in front of Sev.

"Severus." She intoned loudly. The Great Hall seemed to freeze and watch what was about to happen. "I am a coward. For nearly two years now, I've taken you for granted. We've stuck to the shadows and not named this /thing/ between us. Don't get me wrong, the snogging has been fantastic, but I can't hide anymore Sev. I love you." She said simply. She held out her hand to the dumb struck young man in front of her. "Will you be mine?"

In one fluid motion, Sev too her hand and stood up. He pressed her fingers to his heart:

"Always."

He dipped her into a kiss which had the entire place descend into a cacophony of cheering and wolf-whistling. When they came up for air, a distinctly unimpressed Sirius Black was waiting for them - flanked by a giggling Peter and a Remus who looked like the world couldn't swallow him fast enough.

"Really, Jo? /Him?/ I knew that you kept sneaking off to snog someone, but I thought it was Moony!" Sirius flapped his hands for emphasis.

"Leave me out of this..." Remus muttered as he turned puce.

"Yep. Him. Gotta problem with that, Black?" Joanna asked him in a time which seemed as cheerful as it was dangerous. Sirius snorted and turned to Sev:

"Hurt her and I will curse your knob so badly that even your grandchildren will wince every time you piss."

"You'd have to beat her to it," Severus shrugged. Sirius had to admit that he had a point.

Peter put a chummy arm around Sev's shoulders:

"Congratulations, you have your very own Joanna Potter! Now, here are some ground rules for the care and maintenance of your Jo: One, make sure that she us regularly fed and watered or you will die. Two, your Joanna comes with a triple set of Marauders for life..."

Severus Snape groaned so loudly that he was sure his unborn grandchildren had heard.

** Snape is secretly a masochist who adores pain and gets off on public humiliation and degradation. James, being the kind soul he was, felt nothing against Snape when he found out and went out of his way to ensure he got everything he wanted without letting anyone know the truth.

Snape's hatred of James only blossoming when his beloved, the only one to truly know his secret and indulge his fantasies, ran off with his best friend and left him in the dust as soon as he truly realised that what he felt for the dorky pureblood with his scruffy hair and pretty eyes wasn't lust anymore...
