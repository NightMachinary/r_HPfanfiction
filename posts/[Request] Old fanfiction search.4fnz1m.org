I got into fanfiction with Harry Potter on Wattpad. It's been years since and I can't remember most of them, but these two stood out and I'd appreciate help in finding them again.

 

1) A trilogy where Voldemort adopts Harry as his son after the Goblet of Fire. Harry reacts realistically to Voldemort's attempts to be paternal but over the course of the series thaws slightly to him. One major plot point in the series was Voldemort using a sort of time magic to go back and play out the night he murdered the Potters in different ways to see if he'd still get a worthy heir. One version of Harry he actually adopts becomes Draco-lite, a second who he spares is a coward and I forgot what the third was. All 3 are unworthy and he decides to go ahead and fire the killing curse at Harry.

 

2) This fic wasn't finished even when I read it, but hopefully a decade has done it well. Baby Harry is sucked into a wormhole of sorts and ends up in a generic fantasy land and becomes a warrior sorceror. He grows up in the land with trolls, orcs and rune and colour based mana until he receives the Hogswarts letter and a portal back home. He's much more domineering in the first year and slays the troll offscreen before dragging it to the great hall. Looking back it wasn't that great of a fanfic, but for the sake of nostalgia I'd like to know how it went.
