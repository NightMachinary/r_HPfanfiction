This is post-war fic, with a fem!Harry being a Head Auror(Let's call her Rose) The scene is like this: An Auror barges into the office, waking the overworked Rose. Rose wakes and asks: What's going on? Auror replies there's an emergency. Rose gives out orders. Heres the place I struggle with. Does Auror replies with the acknowledgment to the Orders with: "Yes, sir" or with something else? Because the boss is a female, is it okay to reply with "Yes, Sir!" Or should the Auror reply with something else...like "Yes, Miss Potter." Etc. Help plis. Edit: P.S. Rose Potter isn't Married yet...


** I think they'd go for "Yes Ma'am".

** They definitely wouldn't call her Sir. I don't know if that's American or Hollywood, but calling every superior officer Sir regardless of gender definitely wouldn't happen here (in the North, at least - I admit, I don't know for certain how it'd be in London).

Likely it'd be Yes Ma'am (pronounced like Harm rather than Lamb - which also applies to female judges, if you're writing a courtroom scene), or Aye Ma'am depending on accent. Miss Potter might work, but the last time this came up, my police relatives said ma'am is most appropriate and Miss Potter is a bit more bureaucrat than officer (ie. the clerks might call her that, but the aurors probably wouldn't). You could also have them refer to her by rank as in 'Yes, Head Auror' in the 'Aye, Sarge' sort of manner.

But yes, definitely not Sir.
