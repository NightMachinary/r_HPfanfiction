The Quibbler's nonsensical postings and articles are all encoded with various messages only certain individuals will understand. Perhaps a normal picture of some scenery contains a memetic trigger that activates in certain agents, and the topic of the crossword is a clue for an agent in the field. Xenophilius has nothing to fear because he has a reputation for being peculiar, even more so than most wizards, and the Quibbler is known as a joke - something that the Department of Mysteries counts on to pass on their messages.

** Benedict Hanks was beginning to regret this decision he'd made.

He'd applied for the job because he'd finished all his holiday homework (rather proudly, he noted that he had them all done within the first two weeks) so that he could have some pocket change for once. His parents had even nodded approvingly, saying something like "how he was finally getting off his lazy bum to work." The job was also quite simple - operate a small trolley in Diagon Alley, selling various magazines and newspapers, some snacks and various other small things.

But he was just /utterly/ bored out of his mind. Doing tricks with his wand and practising various charms had helped in the first day or two, but after a week nothing seemed to help clear the cloud of weariness that seemed to hang over his head.

Who knew that even magic could get boring? True, he wasn't /strictly/ supposed to be doing magic out-of-school - but here in Diagon Alley, in his little trolley, nobody would blink if they saw him using his wand. Not that many cared to pay any attention, he groused. At least all this free time let him go over some of his Arithmancy revision worksheets a second time, so it wasn't all bad, he supposed.

He looked up as the enchanted copper bell on his desk rang twice, signalling the arrival of not a customer, but rather one of the suppliers of the various things on sale. Grunting, he stretched his legs, sore from having been put in an awkward position for the better part of that day, and got out of the trolley to meet the supplier, who was currently unloading stacks and stacks of newspapers from a hovering box. He was accompanied by a small girl, possibly a second-year in Hogwarts, who helped to neatly assemble the newspapers on the ground.

The man turned around, and Benedict felt a grin creep onto his face. It was Mr. Lovegood! He was as barmy as everyone said he was, but he always seemed to cheer up in Mr. Lovegood's presence. He waved at the quirky author of the /Quibbler/, who waved back twice as enthusiastically. Benedict flicked his wand at the stacks of /Quibbler/ copies, and received a mental count of the number of issues present a short moment later. No problem here - Mr. Lovegood had brought the correct number of copies. He then turned back to the eccentric wizard and said a friendly hello.

Lovegood nodded, then greeted Benedict while dusting off his robes. He began to delve into the Rotfang Conspiracy, a plot to bring down the Ministry through a subversion of dental health, all while waving his hands in the air. Benedict nodded as Lovegood continued, stopping occasionally to interject some point or other as he squeezed the newspapers into a large drawer, then put several copies out front for display. Eventually, both he and Lovegood were done. Benedict offered the little girl - probably Lovegood's daughter, what was her name again? - a Chocolate Frog, which she accepted with a pale smile.

After waving goodbye to the both of them, he settled into his seat, returning to his Arithmancy worksheet.

​

​

Some time later, Benedict heared the copper bell ring once, signalling the arrival of a customer. He looked up from his work, then politely greeted the green-robed wizard that stood at the trolley. The wizard inclined his head, then handed over some coins for a copy of the /Quibbler/. Benedict counted his money, then nodded in satisfaction. The green-robed wizard cracked a small smile before leaving. Benedict returned to his Arithmancy practise, not having observed anything particularly significant about the encounter.

An unremarkable man relaxed on a bench in a park in the town of Hereford, dressed in a neatly pressed collared shirt and dark brown trousers. He was flipping through a newspaper that many a passerby seemed to look at and then suddenly /blink/, before hurrying off to some appointment or other. Nobody paid the man much attention, although many people seemed to actively avoid him and nobody seemed to even look in his direction.

A young lady in an equally unremarkable getup walked over and sat next to the man. She tapped him twice on the knee and rotated her bracelet around. The man marginally lowered his newspaper, then clicked his tongue twice. The two seemed to stare at each other for another moment, before tension seemed to drain from both persons.

The man inclined his head at the woman, and smiled. He pointed to an article on the newspaper, where large block letters spelled out, "ROTFANG CONSPIRACY UPDATE: SARGOT DEFECTOR MAKES STATEMENT!"

The lady quickly skimmed over the article, making humming noises at various points. She finished reading, then sighed, pinching her nose. "Ugh. More Death Eater business. This blows."

The man nodded understandingly, because nobody in the Department of Mysteries liked having to deal with Death Eaters. "I know," he said consolingly, patting the woman's arm. "Well, at least this one is just a Death Eater safehouse. Initial ops haven't put out anything particularly important, it's unoccupied save for what appears to be several animated utensils."

The woman shuddered. Whoever in the ranks of the Death Eaters kept animating utensils as weapons was clearly disturbed in the mind, perhaps more so than the norm when it came to Death Eaters. She said, "So, we stick to Standard Kilo Four Seven this time?"

The man said, "Yes. No need for the Standard Limas or Landyard Whiskey this time. Us two should be enough. Also, you should look at this." He flipped the newspaper to another page, where several large photos of an unidentified mountainside were present. The lady's eyes unfocussed and flashed yellow before she blinked twice, then turned back to the man with an incredulous look, "Are you saying that...?"

"Yes," he said gravely. "This is info from Visha 97, so you can trust it to be accurate. Plus, you didn't die after looking at that image, so I know for sure you're clean." He flipped the newspaper to some crosswords.

"Well then," the woman said after a glance. "That is quite a pickle. Full Party or Green Maze?"

"Green Maze. There are signs that their cell have been too deeply compromised. We'll need to disinfect the place after."

The two nodded at each other, then left in opposite directions. The man rolled the newspaper up and tucked it under his armpit, where you could read the words 'The Quibbler'.
