Hi! I try to find a fanfiction that I've read ages ago. It's written in english and probably a slash story. I actually don't remember a lot about it, but I do remember loads of fluffy moments with Harry and an OC Blair Zabini, who is Blaise little sister and has been sorted into Gryffindor. Blaise asks Harry to watch over her. Any ideas?


** There is /definitely/ not enough info there.
