What's the biggest harem you've seen that actually manages to work?

*** Harry doesn't need to love every girl but he at least needs to be friends with them. There needs to be a reason for the harem, not just randomly adding girls

  Set in the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter has an unusual awakening after the demonstration of Unforgivable Curses in that fateful Defense Against the Dark Arts class. How different is a Harry Potter with one deviant obsession, a twisted kink? Perhaps not at all, or perhaps incredibly so in the most meaningful of ways. Multiple pairings all centered around Harry, more of a web really.

  Hermione begins to learn the truth after Harry is named a Tri-Wizard Champion. The solution is not what either extect. Mostly H/HR but it won't seem so. Some Ron and Dumbledore BASHING, but not much...

  AU post OoTP. Poor Harry. Sirius left him far more than a house and some money. Dumbledore is the Dark Lord? And what is he supposed to do with the women he was left? Sometimes, Pranks suck and others they are opportunities. H/Multi
