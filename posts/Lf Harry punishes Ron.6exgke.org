I'm feeling a little anti weasley today (Normally I don't hate them) and I thought that Ron usually needs a little punishment (I know people that would probably kicked his ass for less that he has actually done)

So any fic, where Harry beats the hell out of him or curses him, or uses the unforgivables?

Bonus if Ron repents and they reconcile.


** Linkffn(harry potter and the champion's champion) no physical torture by harry, just mental. And mostly nonintentional.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** I know some people like that, too (myself actually...then again: I feel anti-Weasley every god damned day :) - except for the twins (They are a damned hoot after all and we haven't heard them bullying anybody, so they are more or less equal opportunity pranksters!) and Bill (despite that I think he's much to old for beautiful Fleur!) and Charly (come on somebody who works with dragons has to be cool!) :) )

Sadly I can't recommend anything (I seldom back up or favourite fanfictions...I forget to do so after reading them most of them time -.-), there's not many stories out there that do this (unless you want a total split from Ron, then almost any Harry/Slytherin-Girl would do probably!)

Hm on second thought, there's one thing (only because I've read it not that long ago!)...as long as you don't mind Hermione getting some flak (deserved in my opinion, her blind obedience to authority (unless one of her friends is truly in danger, because normally she treats the rules as golden and to be obeyed!) and books would just rub me wrong!), then maybe look up:

*** Everybody of the Trio has their Strenghts and Weaknesses. Hermiones Strenght is her Brain and intelligence, but in her eagerness to follow the rules and grow "fondly" to the teachers in that way, her "blind" obedience in Authority is her weakness. Harry may be great in performing Difficult Spells (Patronus), but he is also an idiot, that wants to hear out Rons Opinion, before he makes a decision (Hermione wants Harry to teach them). Damn, its like Harry needs Rons agreemant for anything in his life! Oh, and he is also a master of keeping stuff to himself, instead of sharing it with his Friends (why Snape really stop teaching him occlumency, but ok, Snape can Scan Rons and hermiones Brains to know, if Harry kept his word, so there i forgive him). Ron is a "tactical" Brain, but its actually only shown in the CHessgame in Book 1. He is actually the humorous friend, who makes jokes with no end (and without the lack of tact), but his weakness is his insecurity. He didnt even grow "mature" after the Locket destruction, like many people say. He tries to grow friendly with Hermione and even objects with Harry on some terms just with the reason of "in the War and the Love, anything is allowed. And This is a little bit of both", seriously?! Despite Harrys statement that Hermione is "like a sister" to him, the Redhead seems still to be afraid that SOMEONE (in this case, especially Harry) could still take away his "beloved" Hermione. I think he is only sure, that Hermione is his only one, if she dies in their Marriage before him, so he can say "Ah, great feeling. Hermione was MY beloved wife and no one took her. Finally something i gained without Harry. Im great."

Maybe i play Hermiones Authority obedience down, but i can only see her acting against Harry in Book 3 and that she did because she was worried about his life (reasonable, if you ask me). I see Rons and Harrys Weakness much more annoying

**** Harry's biggest weakness is not Ron but that he is not standing up for Hermione which makes him a shitty friend.

Look at the Yule Ball. Ron is a total prat to Hermione and rips into her in Harry's name despite Harry not having any issue with Krum as her date. And instead of calling Ron out for that he sits there with a bag of popcorn and watches the trainwreck. And he does that whenever they fight. If two of your friends fight and one is undeniably right you should defend him/her. Especially if the other person is talking in your name.

***** There's actually potential for real tragedy here. In an AU of 6th year Hermione could isolate herself from Harry because she just can't handle it anymore. I mean it's not Harry's fault that he gets into so much trouble, but he has big issues by seeing the world as revolving around him. Did he actually thank her for risking her life at the DOM? I'd be pretty traumatized after those events and getting hit with a deadly curse, barely surviving and then everyone just moving on.

In a way Harry's apathy about anything that doesn't directly relate to him is the cause for a lot or problems. Ron probably could have become a better person if Harry cared enough to confront him about his shitty behavior. Sirius death probably could have been prevented if Harry didn't wallow in self pity and used the mirror for once, etc. etc...

There's a lot going on here, but most of that can also be blamed squarely on Harry's upbringing. It's not entirely his fault that he doesn't understand how to interact with people...

****** I would totally agree with the DOM thing....But the thing is, that the following chapter begins with Hermione reading from the Daily Prophet. Means: between Dumbledores Confession and Hermiones reading is a certain Time passed, but we dont know, how much. And its never mentioned that Harry apologized to Hermione for being so dumb (or apologize to the other for being so dumb at all). So either he did it already as the chapter begins or he is so paralyzed by Sirius death, that he didnt think about such a matter of course. If Harry really didnt apologize than Rowling really made him a Bastard (not the first guilt, she is taking)

******* I'm not really worried about Harry not apologizing, he's quite used to taking the blame for things... I'm talking about true appreciation, something that goes beyond a martyr complex centered around coming his own guilt. It's difficult to put into words, but apologizing can be self-centered as well I guess

***** Yes, The Yule Ball is just one mentioning. Another might be Rons blaing Crookshanks permanently in Book 3. Harry didnt get the chance to explain his witness about her Pet waiting on the Boys Dorms. And we never know (but its probably, that its not so), if Harry ever apologized for Hermione telling McGonagal about the Firebolt. Harry is about to apologize, as Ron is panicing about his Rat. But if we read the Beginning of the next chapter, we learn, that Harry didnt tried to apologize to hermione Further. I would gladly read a Fic, in which Harry stand up and defend Hermione more in the Yule Ball. But also on everything else, like Rons apologize after the first trial, i dont want Harry to forgive so easy, dammit!

Both Malfoy and Snape deserved to be put next to the term awful human being, not be allowed to walk free and get a child named after him. And put Dumbledore on the same list. The amount of shit the old coot did for the greater good is just unbelievable and ranges from child endangerment up to the responsibility for hundreds of deaths.

******* Well, about Harry naming his Son after Snape, who "kept harry alive just because he loved Lily", but also treated him badly during his School time (to be honest, i think the Author needed atleast One Teacher that doesnt like Harry and vice versa. Anything else would be boring...but still, naming his Son after him?!) And Dumbledore, who interfered in his life since he was a Baby. Not even ordering some of the order to keep an eye out for Harry so that the Boy wouldnt be treated badly. Harry "swore" to himself, that he wouldnt forgive Snape ever, same goes for Dumbledore in Book 7....and then, he "matured", "oh we, it wasnt that bad actually"
