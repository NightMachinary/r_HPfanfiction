:END:
This was an abandoned fic and I think it happens in 5th year?(not sure). The basic premise is Dumbledore asks all the youngster to write an essay. Not sure about the actual topic. But harry writes one where he mentions how almost all the defence teachers have tried to kill him. It causes a change in most of the staff and the other youngster realise this and pester(except Hermione) harry on what he wrote.


** I literally found this just the other day. I haven't read it yet, however.

** ‘4 out of 5' is a great story; I've read it a couple of times. It makes me sad that it isn't ‘finished' but it doesn't have an aching cliffhanger, so it ends in a decent spot.
