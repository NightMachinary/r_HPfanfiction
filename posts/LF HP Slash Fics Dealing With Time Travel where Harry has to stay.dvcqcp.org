:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Sorry if this isn't the proper place. I suddenly got this feeling I wanted to re-read an HP Fanfic dealing with Time Travel that I had read many years ago. It's a slash fic and most likely HP/SS (Snarry) though there might be a possibility that it's Harry/Slytherin...

The main point I remember is that Harry is sent back into the past and they're unable to send him back to his present immediately so he has to live our years or months before he can reinsert himself and be known as Harry Potter again.

If you can link me any that fits this, that'd be helpful! Thank you

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry uses a Time Turner in an attempt to rewrite history. However, something goes wrong, and he's thrown back fourteen years into the past.
