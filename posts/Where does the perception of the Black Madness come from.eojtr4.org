** I imagine a fic did it back in the day and people noticed it, thought "That's pretty cool." and then did it in their fics, and so on.

It is fanon, but it's relatively interesting-sounding fanon like Ragnok the Goblin King and so on. People keep it in because it adds a little bit of colour to the Blacks that Rowling never did since they weren't terribly relevant to her plot. As someone convinced me recently, if it's not in the text, we have to speculate and fill stuff in ourselves.

Also, I'm fairly certain inbreeding adds up over time. It's called a bottleneck, I believe? So, even if the only one of this generation were second cousins, that doesn't mean their parents or parents' parents weren't more closely related, and that means that the 'damage' is done earlier on and leads to the insanity now. My field is mental health, not physical, so while I can talk about the effects of genetics on depression or schizophrenia, I'm not overly familiar with the actual genetic mechanics of inbreeding. It is what happened to the Hapsburgs and other members of European Royalty though. Even if you're only intermarrying between thirty families, if you do it for long enough you're eventually all related somehow and you're eventually all feeling the effects.

  The sword was made to Godric Gryffindor's specifications by Ragnuk the First, finest of the goblin silversmiths, and therefore King (in goblin culture, the ruler does not work less than the others, but more skillfully).

*** Really? for me it never really seemed all that interesting, it sort of just felt like brushing Sirius's family aside as crazy and evil. Personally, there's so much worth exploring when it comes to the blacks, particularly Sirius's relationship with his parents, it just seems pretty boring to me to have them be 100% crazy and evil. If there's anything the books have taught us it's that people are complicated, I have no doubt they were assholes but I can't imagine his parents just hating him and running around the house cursing him silly. It seems like thats how the black Madness trope is used a lot of the time, just to go "oh look how crazy Sirius's family is, he's the only good one" and it just seems like a bit of a cop out tbh.

**** I think it's from an older 'Harry goes back and joins the Blacks' fic - can't remember the title atm and I'm leaving the house in twenty so I'll try find it later - where Harry actually had to deal with the 'insanity' and find ways around it. It was very dynamic and realistic for a fic that used 'insanity' as a general catch-all for a myriad of mental health issues. Imagine an asylum of ambitious, cunning, and moderately amoral people who perceive themselves as the greatest thing since diffindo'ed bread all of whom are as mad and unpredictable as a box of cats on speed. The fun you can have navigating that dynamic is incredible. Especially putting in the 'saner' bunch as straight-men to their insanity.

Sure, it can be used badly, but... well, a trope being used badly doesn't necessarily make it a bad trope. Some people do real good things with it. I particularly liked the relationship between Bellatrix and her folks in Delenda Est, specifically the 'look after her. She's a little fucked up' conversation with her dad. A good fic can make anything work well, right? :)

I've just been a bit addicted to these portrayals Ive read of Sirius and his family recently where his parents are insanely dysfunctional, pompous, and arrogant, but still love both of their children in their way, and I guess im just projecting my frustrations that there aren't more fics out there like that that actually take the time to delve into the motivations and feelings of the blacks and examine them as complex beings rather than crazy monsters who use unforgivables on their children. It just seems like such a waste of potentially great characters to me, but oh well, to each their own. And yeah, that fic actually sounds great lol.

****** Agreed. It's like they say, all the best fics were abandoned years ago, but the fic you hate the most will have a million words. I still can't believe Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth actually finished!

There definitely need to be more fics that do the 'Black Madness' well, yeah. Flattening them out into caricatures is totally a waste, you're absolutely right. Mental health or not, they're so much more interesting when they're people. But really, that's the worst thing about monsters. They're just people, too. (/insert cheesy ominous organ music here/).

I think the fic I talked about before had them mostly having difficulty with emotional regulation where they feel everything and can't really suppress their instantaneous reactions like neurotypical people can - think River Tam from Firefly. A few had other issues, I think one was a schizophrenic, another couple were psychopaths, one IIRC was bipolar, etc, while Sirius and Andromeda played Straight Men for the insanity. They still loved one another - even the psychopaths, disappointingly - but they fought a lot and were very passionate and mercurial folks between the colder stretches.

I remember an exchange that was quite similar to one in a Critical Role fic, where a couple were talking about how they dealt with the problem of him leaving his clothes all over the place. She (his wife) promptly tried to murder him, and they conclude with the fact that he now keeps their bedroom tidier and she doesn't throw vases off random balustrades. That specific example is one from Stuck on You by Griftings in the Critical Role fandom, but I remember this fic had something similar and slightly more murderous.

I've taken a quick glance over my bookmark folders in the five minutes since I got back, but no title is jumping out at me as the fic I'm talking about. I'm going to put up a new prompt/request thread to see if anyone recognises it or knows any fics similar., but I'll keep poking around my lists because I really want to reread this fic now (if it isn't just a fever dream of mine, anyway :D). If it doesn't exist though, one of us could always write it. :)

**** The general theme of family madness is linked to child-raising traditions and genetic disposition towards mental illness, so stories which include it are generally drawing on those real-life issues. I've read quite a few stories where the “madness” is clearly bipolar-2 and the author was obviously aware of the connection they were making. Likewise, I've read stories where the family is rampantly abusive to their children and the “madness” is linked to that abuse. Like all fantasy, it's a way of exploring real issues through a fantastical lens.

****** I had read a Fic a while back where 'The Black Madness' was directly connected to family magic and blood, and when they used magic to kill The Blacks couldn't control themselves due to a sorta magically induced blood lust caused by some sort of a blood curse on the 'Original Black' which distorted their perception (like scare crow fear toxin) and also made them look monstrous to others. what made Sirius special was he was the first documented 'Black' who could suppress the madness in the first war, it was However majorly AU, and Sirius was let out of Azkaban after 15 Years, instead of breaking out. So his Mind was pretty broken and he kept calling Harry, James. If i remember correctly, Harry was 'Heir Black' cause of Dorea being his grandmother thus he began to suffer from 'Black Madness' after a fight that replaced the one in the DoM, where Harry killed the person who cursed Hermione. It was well written and started at the beginning of 5th year, and they had ended it with a Crazy Sirius trying to explain to Harry how to Suppress The Madness.

** It is inbreeding and it's not only just the Blacks. It's all the elitist families that care more about having "pure blood" than their sanity. Blacks, lestanges, Rosiers, u get the idea. These families have been inter-marrying for centuries and that is where the "pureblood" madness comes from. The Malfoys are an example of an elitist family who wouldn't chance insanity, hence bringing halfbloods in their family tree without losing the "pureblood" status.

**** I don't remember if there was any mention in the books but from Rowling's website on the Malfoy family page there's this: "From the imposition of the Statute of Secrecy onwards, no Malfoy has married a Muggle or Muggle-born. The family has, however, eschewed the somewhat dangerous practice of inter-marrying within such a small pool of pure-bloods that they become enfeebled or unstable, unlike a small minority of fanatic families such as the Gaunts and Lestranges, and many a half-blood appears on the Malfoy family tree."

**** The same page referenced by Lady of the Shadow Gate also says that the Malfoys were against impoverished muggles or wizards (that is, anyone who couldn't offers jewels or prestige), that is to say the royalty. They only change their tune for political reasons when they realise that pushing the cause further will stop them having influence in the newly formed ministry.

So they may be far less inbred than say, the Gaunts who might go back to Salazar and beyond. Even if both the Royal Family and the Purebloods are too closely interrelated. I suppose that's where the half bloods came in.

Also, the sacred 28 seems to be all families who have lived in Britain for a while but it could be possible that the Malfoys, who showed interest in Beaubaton and Durmstrang for Draco may have found partners in mainland Europe.

Alternatively, I suppose, families might have been feeble/unstable (such as the reduced Black life expectancy) but the problem truly kicked in with the dramatic reduction of people in wizarding Europe post-Grindelwald. By the end of Voldemort the sacred 28 is almost decimated.

*** That's definitely a good point, but there doesn't seem to be a hereditary madness within the family as some people like to think. That's my main point. We've only seen three blacks that could be considered 'mad', two have been locked up in a prison that drains all the happiness from you for over a decade, and the other effectively lost her entire family and was left alone. These are all extreme circumstances that would drive anyone crazy, so there doesn't seem to be a tendency towards insanity. This kinda reminds me of how in the game of thrones books everyone says that half of the Targaryens went crazy when in reality only 5 of them did lol, and three of those are debatable.

**** In the books we only 'meet' five pureblood Blacks: Bellatrix, Andromeda, Narcissa, Sirius and Walburga. Three out of five were unstable or outright crazy. We can claim circumstances for Sirius, though I'd argue that the extremes of his teenage bulying behavior were far from normal long before his stint in Azkaban. Fanfic authors can go either way in their interpretation of his personality. However, judging by what other characters have said, Walburga and Bellatrix were noticeably unstable even before the circumstances that might have pushed them further 'round the bend.

Three out of five (or even just two out of five) in the space of two generations is an extreme deviation from the rate of insanity in the normal population, which is why fanon settled on the idea of the Blacks having a genetic predisposition to madness.

Also, while it could be used as a proof that Sirius is wrong when he says "/They were all horrible/" (as if Andromeda, and in a lesser extent, Regulus were not already a proof of that), I think I prefer the Potter to take Sirius in without any other reason that he is James friend (as a kind of mirror of the Weasleys with Harry).

** It is fanon, one time of inbreeding with 2nd cousins who only share 6% of their DNA, doesn't make everyone in the family crazy, especially when Bellatrix wasn't even the child of those two people. Azkaban made Bella and Sirius kinda crazy.

A lot of people don't accept it, because it's not in the books, but JK drew the Black family tree and listed tons of people for it, and the only, I repeat the only, instance of incest we see is from Walburga and Orion. I don't think it was to keep the "Blood Pure" either, I think it was because Walburga's father was the head of the family. Since he owned Grimmauld Place which has the family tapestry it's presumed he's the head, He had a son, Narcissa's father Cygnus, Walburga probably wanted to take over instead of having her younger brother take over the family as head, and so she married her second cousin to keep the Black name instead of getting married off to some other family because she was a woman. She kept Grimmauld Place because she obviously raised Sirius and Regulus there, and her brother presumably had to do something else. That sounds like a pretty plausible and logical explanation to me so that's my headcanon for it.

We see from Pottermore, that the only families that are so supreme with Blood Purity were the Gaunts and Lestranges, that's from the description in the Malfoy family: "The family has, however, eschewed the somewhat dangerous practice of inter-marrying within such a small pool of pure-bloods that they become enfeebled or unstable, unlike a small minority of fanatic families such as the Gaunts and Lestranges, and many a half-blood appears on the Malfoy family tree."

Even then inbreeding doesn't seem to affect magic. I've seen so many stories with "Inbreeding causes squibs in Purebloods" which just isn't true when we see the Lestranges and Gaunt Family. Both are incredibly skilled in Dark Magic and frequently hold their own against others (Morfin vs Ministry official) and (Rodolphus and Rabastan vs tons of people) If anything squibs would be less prevalent in inbreeding families like the Gaunts and Lestranges because they've been doing it for a while.

*** My headcanon for Orion and Walburga's marriage is along the same lines, except I think that Grimmauld was passed down to Orion - from Phineas Nigellus, to Sirius II, to Arcturus, who retired to the country and passed the daily governance of the family to his son Orion.

I think that young Walburga was as obsessed with her family name and all that entailed as she seemed to be in her portrait, and instigated the relationship with her cousin. She could keep her name and move into the ancestral home. I'm writing a Walburga-POV fic from Sirius's birth to her death, and in it she develops an obsession for her "twice-Black sons" - in her mind, Sirius (and to a lesser extent, Regulus) are all the more important/powerful/noble/pure precisely /because/ they have Black blood from both her and Orion.

Totally agree with you RE inbreeding not causing squibs. Although, I think there's something interesting in the fact that the first Black to marry outside of the pureblood families (that we know of) gave birth to a metamorphmagus!

**** True that's a good point Sirius was older than Pollux, so it makes sense he would have inherited the family home, making Arcturus and then Orion the main branch of the family. That definitely makes me rethink it. I still need to work out some headcanon on how Sirius inherited everything even though he was blasted off the tree. I guess the simple explanation is Walburga didn't go through the legal process of removing someone from the family.

In one of the fics I'm working on, I have it to where she did follow the legal process and on her death, everything she had in her possession went to her father Pollux, since he was still alive, and he's going to give it to Narcissa since in my story her father didn't want it, and she's the only "good" Black not in jail.

Also on the metamorphmagus ability, it is really interesting because that means it was an ability in the Black blood and it took the muggle-born blood to reawaken it, or it was an ability from Tonks and whatever squib he was possibly descended from if that's how muggle-borns are made and it was the Black blood that reawakened the ability. I like to personally think it was the latter.

How about the patriarch deals in all the legalities and the matriarch deals with the more familial/household aspects - so Orion would have been the one to alter the will/line of succession/whatever needed to be done, while Walburga was in charge of the family tree. And... he still hoped that Sirius would come around? He worried that Regulus wouldn't survive the war and didn't want the house/everything to default to Malfoy?
