I always find it interesting the differences in between America, and the UK/Britain. (Not even just America, but other places as well) Not just with the spelling, but the culture and such as well. For those from the UK/Britain, what are the key elements that tell you someone isn't from the UK, outside of just the spelling?

Any other things that we should be aware of, culture wise, while writing a story as well?

Any questions anyone has, for anyone in the UK? That any UK people could possibly answer, would be cool/good as well. Or maybe UK people have questions for other people, that's fine too.

** Education stuff. Credits or Extra-credits, Majoring and Minoring, Picking Classes, 'College' Degrees, etc.

Food stuff. Again, pancakes here aren't like pancakes in the US. We don't really do the fluffy thing, pancakes are most often like crepes here. Same with things like Bear Claws. I still have no idea what a Bear Claw actually is. Biscuits in the US would be scones here, or possibly dumplings if you cook them weird.

Money stuff. Using Dollars instead of Pounds being the most obvious one. Health Care is broadly free, same with education. Money idioms also reflect that. It's 'penny for your thoughts', not 'nickel'.

Language. We use words like fortnight and shan't that America doesn't seem to. We also swear like buggery and greet our friends in ways that would be mortal insults to an American. I've had friends greet one another like "Hey Cunt!". We're a weirdly sadistic/sardonic bunch like that. We're also more minorly multi-lingual. It's not weird for a British Person to know how to ask for directions to the library in French, to greet someone in Spanish, and how to swear in German. Not overly common for people to have fluency in multiple languages though. Just snippets.

Politics and Society stuff. Generally whenever Harry starts prattling on about economics or free trade or deregulation or crap like that, it's usually indicative of an American. Not always, but usually. Same with the 'wands are like guns and wands are good' arguments. People in England couldn't give a flying fuck about weaponry. Also assuming that we have free speech laws (which we don't).

Sudden Christianity. In the UK, even the Fundamentalist Christians are secular by American Standards. Pretty much every fic I've read where characters are Christian has been written by an American.

** Things Americans do that make it really clear that they're American:

Obviously Americanisms such as 'trash', 'dude', 'pants', etc.

Americans often talk about the arrangement of 'blocks' in Harry's neighbourhood. Surrey was not built in the same planned way that American cities were built, so there isn't a set grid system. You can't say that someone lives 'a few blocks away' because we don't have straight lines for streets in the same way.

Any time when an author talks about extra credit. Extra credit does not exist in this country, you get your grades entirely based on the exams at the end (unless there's coursework, which can be externally moderated).

Also whenever a character says "I got a 97" it's a clear sign. You don't say "I got a 97," you say "I got 97%." On the topic of exams, they're not called 'finals' here.

Now this one infuriates me when I read it. You don't 'write someone.' You 'write /to/ someone'. Can someone please explain how on earth Americans decided removing the 'to' was a good idea?

Now onto non-native English speakers (these don't annoy me because I really can't insult anyone for making mistakes in a second language when I can't speak one):

They use a lot of Americanisms, because unfortunately, that's the way the language is taught abroad these days.

With Germans especially, I notice that sometimes they use 'had been' instead of 'was'. A lot of the time it's technically grammatically correct, but just sounds a bit weird.

Sometimes non-native speakers have different spellings for names that aren't immediately clear how to spell (i.e. Kreacher)

When we Germans learn English, the tenses are drilled into our heads again and again. And, at least when I was in school, special attention was given to past perfect continouous. So I am not surprised that writers feel the need to use that tense.

I have noticed that German fan fic writers love to comma splice. I can make a pretty good guess on a writer's native language being German based on the way they use commas. It is sadly something I tend to do, too.

I... don't think they did? I'm wondering if that's caused by email, texting and the author's age. "I'll email Jane" is fine. "I'll text Jane" is fine. "I'll write Jane" is not. I'm Canadian so my opinion here is suspect... but I'm curious if its an age thing rather than an American thing.

Also tuition, not only is it canon that they don't exist, according to ancient tweets, but as a government run school, they are paid for by the government. If you go for the fanon there are worse ministry run schools whereas Hogwarts is the dogs bollocks (supposedly for some), then as long as it is hinted at the being free state run schools when that's done. Other than Americanisms like asshole instead of arsehole, describing people as British. No one describes themselves as British unless in a formal setting. You are English, Welsh, or drunk.

This one depends on time period & region though. In the 80's, when Seamus was a child, 87%+ of Irish people went to church every sunday. In the 1940's, Tom Riddle's era, historians agree that the UK, especially England, was as religious as it'd ever been and a truly "Christian" nation. Even as late as the 70's, surveys reported that 71% of Brits went to church regularly. Has been declining exponentially ever since though.

So yes, the UK is very secular today, but most fic isn't set in the Next Gen era (our era).

**** Yeah, I didn't know figures were that high. I was born in the 80s went to school in the 90s, and the only times I went to church were for the very few school activities. There was some religious study in the Boys Brigade but no one took it seriously, compared to my dad, who was at the church 6 days out of 7 in the 1960s, it really isn't a lot.

**** We were never quite so... enthusiastic about religion in England as America is, though. We may have believed and been Christian, but our government was never really influenced too heavily by it. It was culturally done to go to Church, but not many of the assumptions that would follow that for a modern American. Or at least that was my impression of the history. You sound like you know something about this, so your view might vary?

***** I'd disagree with you for the immediate post-WWII period and before; the church was an active part of most British lives. 1/3 of Brits prayed daily prior to the Second World War and protestant ideas ran rampant (newspapers throughout the empire protesting "paptist" games and cinemas). Birmingham was only allowed to open a cinema in 1931. You're right in the divide between regions though; cinemas in England opened on Sunday while almost no Welsh or Scottish ones did until after the war. Realistic portrayal of the religion in that time period would be "puritanical", which I'd argue affected British people more pre-50's than in America in the same time period.

Like I mentioned before, the late 70's was when most British (not including Irish) people stopped identifying as religious. I'm presuming you grew up then or after?

87%+ of Irish people (both North & Republic) attended church in the 80's and church attendance only fell below 50% in the late 2000's. The Catholic church has always influenced life in that region.

So yeah, historically the UK was a Christian nation. Not today though obviously. If you want to read more, I highly recommend Religion and Society in Twentieth-Century Britain by Callum G. Brown.

****** I did. I was born in '96, myself. Though I am a history and culture nerd and enjoy looking into this sorta stuff. I'm also Irish-Italian as hell, so my familial Christianity drove me to Theological Switzerland-status pretty quickly. Republic of Ireland and non-local Italian family though, so not helpful for giving me knowledge to answer this question. :)

I also think I articulated myself badly in my original comment. I was intending to refer to the 'in the 70s, 71% of brits' bit and apparently failed dismally and forgot to add in specific mention of that focus. My bad. I'll blame sleep deprivation or a temporary brain fart and simply apologise. Basically, we may have still gone to Church in the 70s and 80s, but by Harry's time it wasn't really too much of an influence. Egad, me.

I actually definitively agree about the Wartime period. I've worked in a care home (Nursing Home, to some) and the old folks there are still very religious despite being riddled with dementia. It's actually interesting, how old prayer and songs can bring back memories for them. That's quite the aside though. I've talked to them a little about things like the cinema laws and it's ridiculously fascinating.

I would possibly quibble (moreso than debate) the point about it effecting us more than America, but I suppose that comes under the 'assumptions that follow' religion rather than religion itself. McCarthyism, Gender Roles, Stereotypical, societal pressures like that. The initial dominoes (religion) might've had lesser effects in England, but those dominoes the US one lead to seemed far more significant. If that analogy makes sense, anyway. I apologise if this seems garbled, I probably shouldn't debate sociology when I'm having to think about how words are spelled. :)

Thank you for the recommendation! I definitely want to read more about this sort of thing. I DM and Worldbuild for a hobby, so more reference books for societal stuff are always handy and I don't have that one on my shelves! If you have any more recs for similar books, I would accept them with immense gratitude.

** I think I've avoided all the common mistakes, but I have a big advantage in that I've studied/lived in the UK and picked up so much slang from the friends I made there. I've also tried really hard to do my research.

The one question that I have for people from the UK is: what are some Nineties-specific concepts or slang that I need to be aware of? Have you seen any British terms in fics before that still don't make sense for the time period or age of characters? Thanks!

** Pancakes or waffles for breakfast

Mailboxes at the end of the drive

Refusal of medical care on the grounds of cost

Armed police called Officer or Captain Smith

Graduation from school

Very high marks for anyone but Hermione. A good mark in an a British exam (apart from maths) is 70 or over. Mark inflation is very American.

Surrey is a county, not a town. Think state.
