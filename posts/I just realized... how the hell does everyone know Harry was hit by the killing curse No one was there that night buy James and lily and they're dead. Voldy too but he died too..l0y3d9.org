It seems a bit of a stretch that someone jumped to that conclusion that the killing curse which is supposedly unstoppable just managed to bounce off a baby and hit the one casting it. If anything walking into that scene of a dead voldemort on the ground in front of a dead lily Potter would make most think she somehow defeated him to prevent him from killing her child. Not that the baby was the one to do it. Who thinks like that? "Oh must be the baby who killed the formidable dark lord, oh yes of course even has a scar to prove it! Don't mind that children hurt themselves often in accidents and that this looks like a scratch- oh no never, definitely dark lord killer mark." I'm just a bit confused lol


** 1. Magic leaves traces.
2. Studying the wands and the most recent cast spells.
3. And finally, while it is never actually stated outright in the books... Harry's situation is not unique, just incredibly rare. Dumbledore and Voldemort both identified what happened after the fact. Voldemort may not have foreseen it due to not understanding love, but he was familiar enough with the concept that after his resurrection he stated what happened, verbatim. Dumbledore was familiar enough with everything to not only identify what went down, but to improve upon Lily's protection, ensuring it lasted at least until Harry was an adult.

** Everybody knows because Hagrid has a big mouth and hangs out in pubs all the time. (Remember, when he first took Harry to Diagon Alley, the first thing Tom the bartender asked was if Hagrid wanted his usual.)

I've read at least one story where Dumbledore had been planning to pretend Harry didn't survive, only to find out that while he was dropping Harry off on the porch, Hagrid was telling the story to a pub full of people and thus it was front page news.

** I think a fair bit of the story came from conspiracy and a convenient story. Plus, Harry surviving the killing curse is both an exciting/dark story with a beautiful simplicity. (No esoteric theory needed.)

It's widely believed Harry stopped Voldemort, whereas Harry was more collateral damage.

In this case:

1. Two adults die fitting the profile of the killing curse (the absence of cause of death indications). Both adults had personally challenged Voldemort.

   1. The baby survives, but has a mark on his forehead. Why would Voldemort leave a baby alive? Harry has a scar but not other traces of spell - thus it appears to be a killing curse that left a mark instead of causing death.
   2. Potentially witnesses to a flash of green light to the nursery? For unknown reasons, the Fidelius charm falls without Pettigrew dying - maybe he just releases it?
   3. The dark mark fades and Death Eaters fall into disarray. People imperius'd by Voldemort come to, those who want to fake imperious come forward.
   4. Hagrid blabs to everyone that Harry has been put into hiding - implying he needs to be protected from angry mobs despite the war ending.
   5. Sirius Black is convicted for murdering Safe Keeper Peter Pettigrew, reinforcing the idea that the Potters were specifically targeted.

2. Dumbledore doesn't challenge rumours as he wants to keep the prophecy a secret.

   1. The ministry launch on the story because it provides a tidy solution to their issues. The ministry definitely want to limit rumours that a new, traceless (bar scar) spell is potentially circulating.
   2. Nobody for Voldemort is found, implying some sort of backfire. The ministry propagate rumours that he died to reduce hysteria.

** Think about it. Voldemort was terrorizing the wizarding population. Suddenly he disappears one night. Soon people start speculating what happened, conspiracy theories start coming out.

The order is compartmentalized, but a few members in the order know that Voldemort attacked the potters, this information spreads, soon it's the most popular theory.

Information about Harry (a 1 year old baby surviving voldemort's curse) also circulates. It's so bizarre to think about, that it spreads like wildfire.

Wizards want to verify if the story they heard is true, they visit the Potters house, the proof is there, standing in front of them. The house in ruins, roof blown away.

Dumbledore hates all the conspiracy theories, and the attention Harry will be receiving. He silently moves Harry out of the wizarding world, not just to give Harry blood protection, but to also keep him away from all the attention till he is older.

** It's a plot hole.

But if you think about it an entire day passes from the night of Halloween to when Albus, Minerva and Hagrid drop Harry at Privet Drive, during this 24hr period Harry's location is unknown just as Dumbledore and Hagrid's is. It is unrealistic to assume that Hagrid when flying on the motorbike would take twenty four hours to cross the country, and by the time he hands Harry to Albus on Privet Drive Albus knows of the scar, suggesting that he has already seen Harry since that night.

Going from this it can be assumed that Hagrid returned to either an Order Safe House or Hogwarts before coming to Privet Drive and that during this time Dumbledore and possibly the Ministry investigated the cottage. We know that neither James or Lily used their wands against Voldemort and so Priori Incantatem would not yield information on what had occured. We also know that the Ministry can detect when someone's death is due to the killing curse, therefore it stands to reason that they can tell when it has been cast on someone, this in turn would lead to Albus discovering that Harry was hit with the curse and then he somehow discovered the Blood Protection and so should have been able to figure out what happened.

The fact that the Ministry can detect when the killing curse has been used on someone is obvious from the fact that they knew (rightly so according to Harry's memory) that Lily was killed with that curse and yet they could not have gotten the information from Voldemort's wand as Pettigrew had it.

If you think about it, it's entirely possible Voldemort was accompanied to the cottage by Pettigrew, I say this because we know that Voldemort's body was destroyed and that Peter had managed to get hold of Voldemort's wand.

If the Ministry had the wand then they would have destroyed it, it was the wand of the most feared Dark Lord in history and we all know how superstitious they are about wands and the wand picking the wizard, therefore it can be inferred that they would not want the wand to exist and risk corrupting another, even though this isn't what happened in the first place.

Once Albus realised that Harry had been hit with the curse and that Voldemort was destroyed he would have had to inform the Ministry THINK ABOUT IT a war was going on and he was a major figurehead. From there he most likely visited Harry and Hagrid while news that the Potter's were attacked and Harry survived began to circulate and so everyone figured it out because the Ministry was corrupt and could not keep the details Albus provided on the attack secret; remember at this point Death Eaters were positioned throughout Ministry departments.

** This gets me too... Aside from the assumption that it was probably the killing curse and apperently it's the wand movement, you know, fine. Maybe it feels like a cursed scar? I dunno.

How did Dumbledore even know the house had been attacked?? And why did he send HAGRID?? Why didn't he go himself? Why was Hagrid there so quickly? Hagrid arrived just as the muggles were showing up meaning he has to had been there within minutes. As far as I know, Hagrid can't apperate.

I'm assuming the Potters had warning or something directly to Dumbledore if there wards were breached? Meaning Dumbledore had to send a message to Hagrid who had to portkey to the Potters? Since he has to borrow Sirius's motorbike to get back.

Why didn't Dumbledore go himself? And how did he get the message to Hagrid so fast?

Unless Dumbledore already knew Voldemort was going to kill them...

*** The Potters weren't the only wizards living in Godric's Hollow. Bathilda Bagshot, a mentor to Dumbledore and friend to Lily, lived just down the street. Dumbledore has a phoenix and the ability to send a quick message via patronus. So Hagrid could have gone by floo, Fawkes, or a portkey delivered by Fawkes.

Hagrid is resistant to most spells and given that he knew they prophecy and Voldemort better than Voldemort knew himself (knew he'd kill Lily, Harry would survive, and that he'd come alone) I can see why he sent Hagrid and stayed at the school or headed to the Ministry.

*** But it its stated outright in Canon that the curse leaves no marks on any of it's victims, so why is there one on Harry?

Furthermore how did Dumbledore know, given he never went to the Cottage but instead sent Hagrid?

The only way for Dumbledore to truly know is for him to have placed some form of monitoring spell within the house itself or even one on Harry

which begs the question if he knew Voldemort was there and what spells he was using at that moment why did he not gather reinforcements to try and save the Potter's, instead he waits until after Voldemort is seemingly defeated before telling Hagrid to go get Harry, meaning he knows James & Lily are dead and that Harry somehow survived despite never going to the cottage itself

The whole thing screams of a set up, especially for Hagrid taking Harry from Sirius & flying from Godrics Hollow to Little Whinging but the entire wizarding populace have already spent the past 24 hours in a constant stream of parties celebrating Voldemorts miraculous defeat and praising Baby Harry

So where the hell did the Boy-Who-Lived story come from? Cant have been Hagrid as he was flying the motorcycle carrying Harry, cant have been Sirius as he was chasing after Pettigrew, doubtful its Snape given he was mourning Lily and it sure as hell wasn't Voldemort, which just leaves Albus as the only one who could have told people and yet he is the only one who Canonically never went to the Cottage in Godrics Hollow before, during or after the Attack

**** 1. It left a mark on Harry because that's where he was tainted by Voldemort's soul

2. He almost certainly received word from the ministry or one of his spies that there was a massive explosion or burst of magic at Godric's Hollow, and given the only people of note that we know live at Godric's hollow are the potters and bathilda bagshot it's pretty easy to deduce what happened. I don't understand what you're asking here. Voldemort tried to kill an infant, his body and cloak were on the ground, dead, infant lives with a scar in the shape of the wand movement of the killing curse.

***** You contradicted yourself, if the mark was left by Voldemort's Soul tainting him then it could not have been made by the Killing Curse as the Soul Shard could only exist after Voldemort was destroyed by the spell itself

Canon wise there was no body left behind either, just a destroyed house and a crying child as Pettigrew took the Wand and ran

Meaning the person who could guarantee Voldemort was in fact destroyed by his own Killing Curse was Harry, so once again how did Dumbledore know?

Snape arrived mere minutes after Voldemort was destroyed only to be interrupted by Sirius and flee, only for Sirius to not even make it to the door before Hagrid arrived and demanded he give Harry over to him as Dumbledore had ordered Harry be collected

This took place within the span of a few minutes at least after Voldemort being destroyed, given there was no sign of any Ministry Officials or Aurors it can not have been more then 20 minutes in total give or take

So once again, how did Dumbledore know to order Hagrid to collect Harry within literal minutes of the attack ending if he was not already aware of what occurred?

It was a complete set up

Or Perhaps they found Voldemort's body killed by a killing curse. It would be trivial to find that Voldemort died after Lily did. No one else could have been in the house due to the Fidelius. Harry had a "power he knows not" which informed Dumbledore that the child was responsible for Voldemort's demise. Combine these facts and the conclusion can be reached.
