**** I think it symbolizes a lot of important things. Quidditch was one of the few things that made him happy and gave him strength. The first snitch he ever caught contained the resurrection stone, which he used to summon the people he loved the most to give him strength as he walked to his death.

**** FML stands for F*** My Life. Basically, "why me?"

I would think that would be his feelings about all his so-called "adventures." They weren't fun, and were usually life-threatening. Assuming he even wanted to have a perrmanent reminder of them on his body --- as if the scars weren't enough to remember them by --- I can't imagine it would be anything celebratory.

It was a toss-up between that and "Never again."

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
