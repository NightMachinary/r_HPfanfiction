Been going on a fanfiction binge lately and the most tedious part of it has been and always will be the beginning of most fics I read. The aforementioned scene is normally the first (and very rarely, the second) chapter of the story and I never find myself reading it. It's always written the exact same way, with Volds appearing on the street corner (add in a description of how dark and intimidating he is), going into the house, fighting James and Lily or just James whilst Lily runs to the children, killing/disabling/defeating James and then doing the exact same to Lily.

I'd describe this set of actions as the core of these chapters, never changing. On occasion, Lily and James will be replaced by a random assortment of characters in order to keep them alive, and they're normally either James' parents, some random wizard babysitter girl or Sirius/Remus/Pettigrew. However the changing of these characters never affects anything, other than the action of the chapter being replaced with poorly written Peter/Voldemort dialogue about how much Peter admires Volds, if Pettigrew is the replacement. This is the part of the chapter that I don't even bother to scan, unless the first few words are immediately gripping or different.

Next you have the actual defeat of Voldemort, and the events after. Most fics will include the defeat of Voldemort, the exception normally being the Dark!Heir style fics who refuse to make Harry the BWL. The defeat is normally the part where divergence from canon happens, and it's rarely worth reading as it just reiterates whatever story trope/cliche the author mentioned in the summary. Here's a quick breakdown of how it changes based on a couple cliches/tropes. You can use these to instantly skip the first chapter of most fics!

Have a WBWL Harry? His brother/twin will be described as loud and constantly crying, whilst Harry will be well-behaved and quiet. Some authors also like noting how baby Harry is literally Adonis reborn for some reason. Voldemort will often make Lily choose between the two siblings, although it's not used in an exploration of the psyche of a mother/Lily but instead to make the reader instantly feel bad for Harry, who when a choice is made by Lily, is never the one chosen. Either way, the chapter within this trope almost always results in Lily being kept alive. It ends with Voldemort attacking Harry, him receiving a magical scar (although some authors don't include this for some reason) and his sibling also receiving a scar from falling scaffolding or magical backlash.

From here, the chapter ends or events take place involving Dumbledore. He either arrives at Godric's Hallow and in mere minutes declares Harry's brother as the Boy-Who-Lived or Lily and James travel to Hogwarts, where Dumbledore also in mere minutes declares Harry's sibling as the Boy-Who-Lived. Especially lazy authors will also include a scene where they discuss Harry being sent away to an orphanage or the Dursley's (if the author doesn't want Harry living with his family).

Have an adopted!Harry? Harry's parents will die as per usual, except this time after Harry defeats Voldemort the person who adopts him will either roll up and collect him, or he'll be sent to his relatives/an orphanage.

Have any other type of Heir, indy!Harry, elemental!Harry etc. fic? Why not include this scene for no good reason, even though it has no bearing on the story at all? Your readers will definitely enjoy trudging through 2k words of meaningless dribble for one small detail change!

The part about this chapter that annoys me the most is that some genuinely amazing fics have it, and include so many of the predictable events I mentioned above as well. I've definitely missed out on some of them, because I will often just close a tab if the chapter after doesn't grab or interest me at all. If you guys can think of any good fics that fall victim to this, feel free to link them below or PM them to me.

To tie this all into my statement about you being better off not including it is because it inhibits creative introductions of your themes and tropes and serves as an immediate discouragement to readers. It is not a gripping scene, and it doesn't explore any themes or ideas. As much as I now dislike the later Harry Potter books as an 18-year-old, the best possible example of how to do it right is the first book itself, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone. It immediately establishes the setting Harry is in, and the characters themselves all whilst slowly drip-feeding information on his past. I'm not expecting all, or many authors to be able to meet this standard of writing but I genuinely believe most would be able to transfer the information provided in their "Voldemort raiding the Potters" scene into a different setting, where they can show it rather than serve it to the reader as straight up exposition. Rather than;

#+begin_quote
  "Voldemort studied the twins for a short while, debating between the bawling auburn-haired elder twin, and his seemingly melancholic emerald-eyed sibling."
#+end_quote

You could instead provide that information with interesting dialogue in an introductory chapter, such as;

#+begin_quote
  "You're quite fortunate your eyes are that shade, Harry." remarked Petunia. "Any less hue and you'd have woken up on November 1st surrounded by twenty other bawling rejects."
#+end_quote

and later dialogue hinting at the existence of his brother, like;

#+begin_quote
  "To think that the child with Lily's eyes is the unwanted one," Petunia laughed bitterly. "Oh how the script has flipped"
#+end_quote

I don't claim to be a good writer, far from it in fact. The most writing I've done is an unpublished oneshot where Harry grows up as a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns15eHLDv1I][bogan.]] To however provide an example of my point in the wilderness that is ff.net, I can easily point to linkffn(The Thief of Hogwarts). Whereas most fics following a thief!Harry would have the regular Voldy scene and move immediately onto him living it rough in the streets in unfamiliar and boring settings, The Thief of Hogwarts immediately grounds itself in the Harry Potter universe whilst establishing it's differences to the source material in a few hundred words. It's immediately gripping and interesting, and a great example of why including the "Voldermort raiding the Potters" inhibits your story, rather than enhances it.

  Chapter 1: Childhood Misdemeanor

  June 4, 1988, #4 Privet Drive, Surrey

  "Look at what I got... " Vernon Dursley said proudly as he showed in his hands a gift wrapped in colorful packaging paper to his son. His son's eyes widened and the boy dropped the current toy he was playing and raced across the living room, eager to get his hands on his latest gift. The young chubby boy snatched the package from his father and in seconds tore away the expensive wrapping paper.

  "You got it! You got it!" Dudley Dursley shouted as he jumped up and down in excitement. He remembered to give his father a quick hug in gratitude and rushed back in front of the TV to open his latest gift.

  Vernon looked on proudly as his son played with latest toy that was popular on the market... his son would once again become popular amongst the kids he played with around the neighborhood. He noticed a pair of green eyes staring at his son from the dark cupboard and he smiled in satisfaction. It was always satisfying to see the look of longing and envy on his nephew's face... it gave him the pleasure and a sense of superiority over the boy.

  Harry stared enviously at his cousin's latest toy. It was the action figure that he had seen on the commercial on the telly yesterday. He wanted one badly.

  So far he had a few toys in his own collection, and they were not the broken toys his aunt usually made Dudley give to him, since he discovered a way to satisfy his own wants.

** I think more experienced writers know better than to include it, but many new writers basically want to use fanfiction as an avenue to write down their headcanons, not necessarily tell a good story. The fic may not be good, but if someone desperately wants to include such a scene, they might as well.

**** Expanding on this, it's about removing extraneous details. To paraphrase Chekhov, if you're going to put a loaded gun on stage, it needs to be fired at some point. If you aren't going to do anything with it, you shouldn't have included it in the first place.

If anything, OP is saying to treat Voldemort raiding the Potters as one would Chekhov's gun: never include it /just because/. If you're showing it, it needs to be important in some way.

***** I support that advice. There are /rare/ exceptions where scenes that are seemingly pointless to the story can be excused for adding to something other than the plot.

An example of this is in Indiana Jones (Can't recall which movie) where the first scene is the MC going on an adventure. This scene has no significance to the story whatsoever. However, it informs the viewers that the movie is about adventure and it is fast paced. If they opened up with the first relevant scene which was just the MC teaching a class, then the audience would be left with a totally different impression of what the movie would be. The opening scene could be removed without leaving the audience with any confusion about the plot of the story, but it being there still has a purpose.

The rules are guidelines, but you can't break the rules until you know what they are and, most importantly, why they are there. Knowing why something doesn't work will let you find a way to make it work.

And usually achieve more than one thing. ex. Indiana Jones. See him be pretty competent yet things not go as planned, struggle, try and fail, get betrayed, and get robbed at the end (and introduce rival/one of the villains). All this builds character and sympathy (or engagement) with him, in addition to laying down the tone/genre.

** The hazard then becomes, what do you write? The interminable months between chapters where Hermione is turning pages, Ron is eating, and Harry is flying? Without writing an entirely AU setting, how does one avoid some key moments?

Sure, we don't need to see Uncle Ben or the Waynes gunned down to know where Spiderman and Batman come from anymore, but does it really detract that much?

For example, the Triwizard drawing. Omitting that entirely is a bit iffy. Granted, we should all aspire to be more than copypasta chefs, but it sets up the following drama.
