I have a stressful event coming up in a few days and I'm looking for something (hopefully completed) to take my mind off things. Anything suggestions over 50k words with at least a few really fluffy moments? Don't care otherwise about genre, but I'm hoping for at least some cute parts.

Thank you!!


** */[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13285012/1/][A Fair Life]]/* is one of my favorite ongoing stories. (so sorry */NOT COMPLETE/*) Reptilia28 Reaper challenge, Harry is told Hermione is his soulmate (as always in this type of story (I will note that this story DOES NOT have soul-bond type stuff in it...)) but this time has an answer for why he didn't get together with her. She doesn't swing that way. Reaper checks Harry's file, he is supposed to be a girl...

The story is (so far) about Fem!Harry Learning how Magic society works (and how it is different now that she is female) while going through the triwizard. Love the relationship between Harry and Hermione, doesn't just come on, there is some buildup. Very fluffy.

 

If you are okay with Fem!Harry and like H/Hr, I'd recommend */[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11197701/1/][Yule Ball Panic]]/* and it's (600,000 words of) sequels. I find the relationship between Fem!Harry and Hermione in it adorable. This one, once you get past the first story (which is entirely Fem!Harry slowly coming out to Hermione) is fairly fluffy, combined with a strong plot.

 

Fem!Harry as Batgirl to Adam West's Batman. */[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11806414/1/][Amy Potter is Batgirl]]/* More actiony than fluffy, sorry.

  Harry has died for the twelfth time and his Reaper is NOT happy about it. Given a chance to go back to fourth year and do things again, Harry jumps at the opportunity. But what's this about being a girl! Don't Fear the Reaper with a twist. Fem!Harry. FemSlash.

  Amy "don't call me Amaryllis" Potter never went to Hogwarts, but the Goblet of Fire makes her a compelled competitor in the Triwizard Tournament. Will three years of tutelage by the Dynamic Duo see her through the treacherous tasks? Will being Batgirl help her beat the villainous Voldemort? And what's with that bewitching yet bothersome, bushy-haired bookworm? Tune in to find out!
