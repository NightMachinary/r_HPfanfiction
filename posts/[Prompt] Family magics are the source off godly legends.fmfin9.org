The head of each family has powers that inspired the tales of the gods in all old cultures. One family controls lightning like Thor. One illusions like Loki. Basically any godly power in any culture is the result of a wizard family using that power back before the seperation of muggles and wizzards. This is why the wizarding world doesn't want the old families to die out.


** I forgot which series it was - one of the lord black stories I think which has this. Family name indicated their specialty such as The Bones family basically had necromantic powers. The "craziness" of the blacks had to do with war berserking powers. Peverells I think, were soul mages.

** I started thinking on a fic (quarantine bores me pretty quickly), and I was working on an OC family, I drew out a family tree with "The Allfather" at the top. Basically I wanted most "old families" to have a mythical origin. My MC was to be Thor kinda (ie strong lightning affinity) and I wanted the Blacks to be masters of illusions and descended from Loki and the Peverell descended from Hades.

** Dude, this sounds amazing! Which powers would be designated to the old families, and can their powers merge if they were joined together?
