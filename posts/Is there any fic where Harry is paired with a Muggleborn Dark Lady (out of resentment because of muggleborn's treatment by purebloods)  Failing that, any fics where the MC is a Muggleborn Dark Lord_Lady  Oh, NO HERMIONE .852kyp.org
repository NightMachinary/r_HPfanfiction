Would seem interesting to read this. The ideology of this DL would be to punish pureblood supremacists, basically, but being as dark and evil as Voldy or Grindewald.


** They end up targetting children but like all large groups will have some dissent within the faction.You have Hermione being one of the council leaders but she is not the protagonist. Harry will be torn between both sides. NO pairings :P
