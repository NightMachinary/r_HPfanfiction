Nobody ever suspects the duffers until it's too late.

What if a dark lord/lady's love of hard work overpowered their ambition? What would a Hufflepuff takeover of the world look like?

  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.

**** Ain't it just? It's the best attempt at 'Horror-puff' I've currently got in my collection - though I'm still trying to re-find a few.

I remember one where joining got you integrated into an eldritch entity that was basically a cross between The Blacklight Virus and The Borg. Though I have started to think that one might've been a Tumblr textpost. :D

  It's 1991, and eight newly Sorted wizards and witches are about to start their first night in House Hufflepuff. There'll be singing and camaraderie and macaroons and only a little bit of screaming. Arguably AU.

** "Bow before me children, for I will be your shepherd, your guide, your light in the darkness." Sprout said in a fevered tone. "Take the Red Chalice and drink deep from the Well of Power. Give your blood to seal the Pact of Unity."

"We are one." Replied the Hufflepuffs in chorus. "We are ready."

...

"Say, Pomona, how do get your charges to be so chipper?" Asked Minerva, "I still have to deal with homesickness every day."

"Oh, you know Minnie, we 'Puffs are a chipper lot."

** Just recommended to somebody the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] series, which is Hufflepuff-centric and very good.

** Not exactly in this style, but you have one fic where Tonks is actively trying to become a Dark Lady and fails epically.
