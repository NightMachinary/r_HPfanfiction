That probably could have been said better, but one of my major pet peeves (if you could call it that) is Slytherin!Harry or fics where Harry even just deals with / is friends with Slytherins, but pureblood bigotry is rationalized/justified in parts, and Harry /agrees/ with some of the justifications.

The prejudice in HP isn't cleanly transferable to the real world, but the bigotry is generally like racism or anti-semitism--correct me if I'm wrong. In the real world, people justify racism, antisemitism, /slavery/, etc. I find so many fics where Harry joins the magical world and his classmates explain how muggleborns are ruining pureblood culture, and Harry often grudgingly agrees or points out that muggleborns weren't taught wizarding culture, so then a class is added and there's one happy compromise. Nevermind that the purebloods often refer to /all/ muggleborns with a /slur/, "mudblood," or that it's rationalizing bigotry--and then getting the main character to /agree/ to it. That's not even counting the fics where Harry "realizes wizards are better than Muggles" (/superior!/) or suddenly purebloods are oppressed because of religion from muggleborns / making "Dark Magic" banned. Or just in general, what's the term--apologetics? I forget the term, sorry, but in general there are a /lot/ of fanon ideas that could be made into something interesting and awesome but end up /justifying 11-year-old racists/.

My question: are there any fics, where it discusses an issue like these (culture, house-elves, the make-up of the Wizengamot, the Statute of Secrecy, even religious holidays though only written /well/ and not the fanon trope) /without/ the main character/s submitting to something that rationalizes either something horrible (slavery) or the general HP plot (Voldemort murdering and torturing...x, since the 1st war was more about his crazy-fascist politics and the 2nd was just crazy-disgusting-guy who mostly killed kids).

For example, this could be different ways: progress for house-elves (or other magical creatures, and /not/ Hermione knitting hats without talking to an elf and /not/ Harry ignoring Kreacher's disgusting treatment that was literally like his own but worse), Slytherin!Harry /changing/ his classmate's views instead of /being changed/, ways bureaucracy & "Dark Magic" affect life, creating a primary school (or whatever they call it in Britain) for Muggleborns to learn about magic earlier, progress in the Ministry (a post-war fic where Hermione learns how to make change the right way and realistically changes the Ministry would be awesome), etc.

I honestly can't think of any fics like that, because so many go "elves love to work! / elves need magic to survive and that's totally mutually exclusive with payment and fair treatment!" or "oh no! the Ministry bans "Dark Magic" and not all "Dark Magic" is bad and the Dark Lord is saving our magic!" or "we celebrate Yule but muggleborns force us to call the break Christmas Break therefore they all are bad!" (okay...the naming of "Christmas Break" and "Easter Break" annoys me too, but it's easy to call it secular).

Honestly, anything about the main character even just realizing how fucked up the world is, like hiring requirements based off of blood, and then doing /something/, would be awesome.

As for pairings: I'd prefer if there weren't any, or if it wasn't the focus, but I assume that /if/ there's any fics like this, many will be post-war and therefore canon pairings, which is completely fine. I don't love some of them, but they're very easily deal-able. Harry/Hermione or Harry/some random personality-less girl shaped to be whatever the author wants (*cough* Daphne/Susan/Katie/etc.) are.../very/ un-preferable. It's fine if there are pairings though, just please note them if they aren't canon. I don't mind slash. Where did "slash" even come from anyways? The name, I mean. (Another pet-peeve: people writing "no slash!!!!" on fics or posts, or people /not/ writing "includes slash so don't read if you're homophobic" and then getting hated on for not going so. Honestly, I /prefer/ reading M/M if Harry's the main character because I've read so much fucking...there isn't even a fanfiction word for it, is there. So much hetero /everything/, books to movies to fics. The number of plot-heavy, long fics that are F/F is practically zero, annoyingly. I'll probably go make a post about that, since it's /annoying/. The word "femslash" is weird too. Gah. Someone will probably explain it and make me look like an idiot, but that's okay.)


** Hmm have you read linkffn(The Accidental Animagus)?

Oh and slash is called slash because of the / symbol used to join names denoting a romantic pairing. I'm not sure if it started with Kirk/Spock from Star Trek but I know they were massively influential to the rise of slash fanfiction.

  The Accidental Animagus

Thank you for the info about slash!

I've attempted to begin The Accidental Animagus multiple times, but keep getting put-off by the knowledge of the pairings. I'm pretty bad at reading stories where I (very much) dislike the pairings, but thank you for the suggestion! Kind of immature of me, but I can't help it...I think.

***** The pairings in Accidental Animagus are pretty incidental. I can't even recall who Hermione was dating, it might have been Neville but I'm not sure. Harry/Luna happens but they're not declaring undying love or anything; they're good enough friends to go on dates together, that's all.

It is very long, though, which can easily put people off.

** There's the Sarcasm and Slytherin series on AO3, and it's a bit split up because the author changed their account. But towards the end, Slytherin!Harry faces conflict about what is right and wrong, and which side he should follow. It's also Twin!Harry, but I can't recall/not sure if it's WBWL or not. but Harry grows up with the Dursleys. He's definitely not bigoted though, and is friends with Gryffindors and other houses, and his Slytherin friends are too.

I've linked the first book in the series, and the part of the fifth book that's under a different account.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  The conclusion of the AO3 work Sarcasm and Slytherin. Chapters 1-16 are available here. https://archiveofourown.org/works/15848610/chapters/36912186This is Sunmoonandstars, back from the dead. Original work summary: Harry Potter returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts amidst an increasingly unstable political situation. And this year, for the first time, Hogwarts is no longer firmly under Albus Dumbledore's control. Threats inside and outside the school put pressure on some of Harry's closest friendships, and power struggles lie beneath the surface of every faction in the brewing conflict. At its center is the Potter family, and Harry's position is more critical, and more precarious, than ever.Happy reading everyone. I have no clue when book 6 is going to be done or ready to post but have at least the end of book 5 because it's been languishing on my hard drive for too long.
