** "HA! Pay up," said James, chortling, as Luna and Harry walked side by side towards the Slug Club's Christmas party.

"Just because they're going to a party together as friends doesn't mean anything," sniffed Lily. "He asked /both/ Patils out to a Ball - which is a much bigger deal - and nobody thinks they're going to get together."

"I seem to recall one Potter couple having their first date this way," James said, drawing her close. "And this from the woman who thought Harry and Cho would work out their issues."

Lily blushed, embarrassed in retrospect about her perception of that entire fiasco. "I didn't think she'd still try to defend her friend! Not to mention trying to attack Hermione over a reasonable precaution that they ended up needing anyway."

"Who do you see him ending up with at the moment, by the way?" James asked, having lost track after the Cho Chang affair.

"Young Miss Weasley's certainly come out of her shelll as of late," Lily said, consideringly. "And you can't argue that she has a certain... something going for her. Something that really makes me think she and Harry could-"

"You just want redheaded grandchildren," James accused, cutting her off.

"I want them /so bad,"/ Lily groaned. "You got your messy-haired, brunette, nearsighted athlete son. I *deserve* this."

**** Desperately in need of a friend? Slightly aloof? Childhood trauma? Bullies? Name that means 'Moon?'

She's basically a cute girl version of Lupin. James would be /all over/ her getting with someone who could help her out socially and appreciate her.

***** You could also make the argument that James would want Harry with Ginny, because James is into sassy redheads and therefore assumes his son would be into them. Or he'd want Harry with Hermione, because Hermione and Lily are similar in a fair share of ways.

All interpretations are valid imo.

** Since I think it'd be funny if they were both wrong, in honor of my HP OTP, I came up with this, entitled, The Dark Horse.

What no one tells you about being dead is that it can be pretty boring. Entertainment in the afterlife was few and far between, most people default to watching their still living relatives and find the experience somewhat akin to watching a very long and detailed pensive memory. For Lily and James Potter the life of their son, Harry, was more interesting (and more terrifying) than most could claim. They had watched with a mixture of pride, worry, trepidation, and sometimes awe as Harry and his friends tackled their many adventures.

As interesting as their son's life was, Lily and James favorite “scenes” as they had taken to calling them, to watch were any that involved Harry's live life. They had watched with wry smiles on their faces Harry's first crush on the Ravenclaw Seeker, a pretty girl named Cho Chang. When Harry had asked Cho to the Yule Ball they had felt sympathetic. As time went on they came to debate over who Harry would end up marrying, it had become somewhere between a bet (though they had nothing to win or lose beyond bragging rights) and a game.

“Oh, go on Harry, ask her to dance!” Lily listened to her husband say as they watched Harry and Ron sitting stubbornly down with their Yule Ball dates, the Patil twins. Both girls were clearly getting bored, particularly Ron's date, Padma, as Ron had not danced with her at all thus far, and if his glare at Hermione and Viktor Krum was any indication, he wasn't going to anytime soon. For Harry's part he had been dragged along the dance floor in the opening dance, but since then seemed inclined to sulk over Cho Chang who had come to the dance with Cedric Diggory.

It was with a disappointed sigh that Lily said “Looks like we can cross Parvati off the list. Sirius need to teach him to treat a lady better in the future.”

James nodded glumly “It's a shame too, they might have a good couple. I'm disappointed.”

The next year they watched in a mixture of exasperation, sympathy and amusement as Harry and Cho went on a date in Hogsmead.

“Well that was...” James started and trailed off trying to find a word strong enough

“An unmitigated disaster.” Lily agreed her words at odds with her face as she struggled not to laugh at her son's misfortune, he was just so clueless.

James shrugged “Well, I wasn't betting on Cho anyway she might have been a good first girlfriend though. Oh well, live and learn.”

A few months later they were joined by Sirius after an emotional reunion and Lily lecturing him for to taking Bellatrix seriously, they caught him up and or course he want to join in on the “bet.”

“All in on Hermione.” He said with absolute confidence. James and Lily gave him a the same look that clearly said “you're crazy” but he wasn't deterred as he explained his reasoning. “Ron and Hermione might look like a sure thing, but trust me they won't get together in the end they fight too much, Ron's too insecure.”

“I still think you've lost it, my theoretical money is on Ginny, Harry is going to continue the trend of feisty redheads, what do you say Lils?” James said waggling his eyebrows at his wife.

Lily rolled her eyes “Passing over your feisty redhead comment, you're not too far out there with Ginny, she's not who I'm betting on though. I'm hoping for Luna.”

James did not seem convinced but chose not to comment in the back of his mind he had to admit Luna might be weird but her and Harry would be a cute couple.

Sirius barked out a laugh “We'll see, they might work out if she wore fewer vegetables as jewelry.”

There were precious few developments until Harry very obviously developed a crush on Ginny (a fact that made James insufferably smug. Harry took Luna and though Lily hoped something might come of that development, she was disappointed as he ditched her to eavesdrop on Severus and Malfoy. Near the end of the year however it seemed like James was on the way to being right when Harry kissed Ginny in front of the whole common room.

“YES!” James cried in triumph

“Go Harry!” Sirius whooped seemingly forgetting or not caring that he had bet on Hermione

Even Lily was pleased, Ginny had grown on her and thought she loathed to admit it, James was right. The good feelings weren't to last however as in what Sirius referred to as a fit of nobility Harry broke up with Ginny in an effort to protect her. Lily Patted James' back and consoled him that when Voldemort was gone they were likely to get together again.

Indeed as they watched Harry stare at Ginny's dot on the Marauder's map it seemed that Lily was right. It was therefore a shock when a month after Voldemort was killed Ginny and Harry both came to the sad conclusion that they wouldn't work as a couple anymore, there was just too much pain from the war, they were both too damaged.

It wasn't until Harry started teaching Defense against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts that something came up Harry was reintroduced to one of his classmates who would be teaching a new elective called “Advanced Magical Theory.”

The professor was a tall attractive blonde girl named Daphne Greengrass. From what Lily saw of her, Daphne was sarcastic, sometimes crossing the line into being caustic. She didn't seem to be at all star struck around Harry. Lily thought she could see what attracted them to each other they shared a sense of humor that caused them to hit it off instantly.

Daphne's no nonsense attitude often pulled Harry out of his brooding moods when he'd blame himself, she treated him as Harry not as the-boy-lived or the chosen one. For her part Harry's good nature and charm seemed to humble her when she got too smug. She was a bit on the high maintenance side, but it was not a problem for Harry who had more money than he would every care for and loved to make her happy. All in all Lily decided they were a good couple even if a part of her was still hoping for either Luna or Ginny.

“I...I can't believe it.” James said “I mean, I saw it happening all these years but...they actually got married.”

Sirius was laughing “I should have known! Always bet on the dark horse!”

Lily smiled, things may not have turned out how they thought, no one would have guessed Daphne Greengrass, now Potter, but her son was happy, all was well.

Note: I haven't proof read this or really edited much, but here it is, also, this is a long one.

**** I'm not happy with the Daphne here either, I rushed it toward the end and didn't want to take the time and extra effort to show what the character was like, the main point was to have everyone rooting for a different person only for someone to come kind of out of nowhere and make them all wrong. Thanks though.

****** Thanks. In the intrest of not hijacking the thread with fanfiction bot links I'll just say that one titled "Ice Cream" and another titled "Daphne Greengrass and the importance of intent" are both quite good. Additionally "Three black birds" is potentially going to be good Haphne in the future but currently is a bit frustrating. All three are on fanfiction.net
