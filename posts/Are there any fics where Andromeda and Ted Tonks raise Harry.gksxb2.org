  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turned out to be the best decision Sirius had ever made.

  Kreacher has a special bond with the Black heir. What happens when he's abused? Who will Kreacher turn to? Is the damage too great?orBefore the abuse can get too bad Harry is adopted by the Tonks family. He gains a new big sister, a snarky house elf, two parents, and much more. What happens over the course of him growing up? How will he continue to relate to his much older sister? And how will his unique "disability" affect his magic? Not to mention his interactions with a squib, a horse, and a herd of thestrals...Currently on a long hiatus, I will get back to it someday soon.

  Harriet Tonks wasn't completely ignorant of her past. She knew that she used to be a Potter, that her Lily-mum and her James-dad loved her very much, that her mums had been good friends, and that her ‘Dromeda-mum and Ted-dad had taken her after her parents had died.She knew how they had died, and why, and what people were calling her, even though she didn't like to think about it very much.And she also knew that she was supposed to be living with her aunt and uncle, but they hadn't wanted her. And that technically (“The technical sense being the most important, when you're trying to get out of trouble, pet,” Ted-dad always told her) her mum had stolen her.
