I love Harry Potter and I watched Narnia yesterday, but I never saw HP / Narnia crossover.

â€‹

I think Harry would fit well into the world of narnia.

Do you have any recommendations?

I think that Aslan would resent the competition from another Christ-figure.

** Well there are about 300 [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Chronicles-of-Narnia-Crossovers/224/1043/][here]]. No idea which or if any are particularly good.

** I really like this one linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13397406]]) The whole series is worth a read to be honest but most is purely Narnia.
