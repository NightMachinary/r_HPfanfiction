**** No link yet. I've got a beta reader going over it before I publish chapter 1. Here's an excerpt though:

Potions with Gryffindor were no better. They were working in pairs, Draco with Crabbe, Blaise with Goyle, and Harry with a fat kid named Neville. It was hard to say who had the more useless partner. While Crabbe and Goyle seemed content to let Draco and Blaise do all the work, Neville was all too willing to try his hardest and kept screwing up the instructions.

“You know,” Neville began, “it seems rather silly to just tell us not to go in a hallway. They should know students will try and check it out.”

“Well, should they just let students stumble upon it by accident?”

“No, of course not, but there are loads of more sensible ways. They could summon a temporary stone wall, or an age barrier so no students can get through. Dumbledore could even make the whole hallway invisible and unplottable with a Fildelius charm.”

Harry stopped, dumbstruck. Once Neville said it, it seemed obvious that any of those courses of action would work perfectly. Harry stared at Neville, suddenly and unexpectedly impressed by the boy. Then Neville added lacefly wings instead of wartmoss causing their potion to congeal into a solid block in the cauldron and the effect was ruined.

I feel like Fidelius should be exotic/unknown... at least to kids.

I also feel that Neville's point was made before the fidelius being brought up, so the fic wouldn't lose anything by removing that reference.

****** I'll think about it. I'm trying to intentionally front-load all the tools so that I don't have the same "Here is exactly what you will need for some random event that will happen in 4 months" cycle from canon.

I don't recall Fidelius being exactly hidden knowledge. Going back to check canon, Harry first learns of it overhearing Flitwick and Mcgonnagal casually discussing it with a barkeep in a pub.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is already looking to be more complicated than the first. He has a place in Slytherin House, but it's by no means secure; he's still feuding with his father and his twin brother; he still has a problem with trusting authority. On top of that, there are whispers of dark things coming to Hogwarts, and as much as Harry might like to stay out of it, he probably won't be able to. Especially since he's the Slytherin Potter.

***** Eh, there's a better way to use a time turner. Build a (liquid) infinite-fuel rocket, put one end of a pair of vanishing cabinets on it, accelerate to 0.99999999c. Use the cabinet to teleport on the spaceship, turn back 6 hours, teleport back to Earth. You're now back quite a bit more than 6 hours. Thank Einstein for time dilation.

****** It could work like that. Or, instead, time dilation could reduce how much one turn turns you back, so that you always go one hour back Earth time per turn. Or the vanishing cabinets go out of sync immediately and stop working.

Sure, it's worth testing... If you can actually build, enchant, and launch the rocket (probably Dumbledore can do it, but hardly students), procure the vanishing cabinets, and be willing to mess with time.
