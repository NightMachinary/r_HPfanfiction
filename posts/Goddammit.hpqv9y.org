Am I the only one who gets annoyed with the repetitive use on “Mione” for Hermione?


** I mean, no, it's very much a thing in this fandom - one I don't really understand, personally, but each to their own. Why do you dislike it?

*** I don't really know. To me it's just kinda annoys me, like a pet peeve. It's fine if it's used occasionally, i can't remember what fic I was reading, but it only referred to her as Mione.

**** I can understand that. Overuse of anything can get annoying, especially terms of address. Like, nobody refers to other people by name as much as characters in fanfic do.

It does fit though, her having a nickname. The UK is a place where 'hey cunts!' is a joyous exclamation of affection and nicknames are a semi-prevalent thing, so it's culturally fitting to get a nickname and Mione is pretty much the best of the bunch to pick from. You've got Mione, Mia (which is a stretch, at best), Mi, Herms, and Hermy, and I don't know about you, but on that list, I prefer Mione.

I do wonder if it's an American thing, though. Most of the people I've seen complaining about it have seemed to be American. Might I ask if you are?

*** Personally, I am not a fan of "pet names", and I don't think it would fit Hermione character to have one at all. But my main problem with this specific one is that . . . it's not a nickname.

"Mione" is used exactly one time in canon, when Ron tries to say "Hermione" while talking his mouth full.

**** Is that a cultural thing or a personal thing? The dislike of nicknames, I mean. I've noticed that it does seem to go along cultural lines sometimes - Americans seem to particularly dislike them, for some reason.

And well, you're right that it wasn't a nickname in canon, but I mean, if the fandom has him use it as a nickname, then it kind of becomes one. If we can make Harry into a time-travelling demigod, we can make a random garbled name into a nickname, no? But if he nicknamed her something that wasn't 'mione', would you be more okay with it?

***** When I said I was not a fan of nicknames, I meant in Harry Potter ,I have no special problems with them in real and they are pretty common in my country (France).

I dislike fanon nicknames because, most of the time, I can't just imagine someone using them. I mean, I could totally see someone shorten Ronald into Ron, just like I could see a Mickael become a Mike. But in the case of Hermione? Herm, Mione, Mia, most of them are either way too different from her name to be a nickame (you don't transform a William into a Bob), or just sound plain terrible. The fact that Hermione don't seem to be the kind of character to have a nickname (she seem . . . too serious) don't help the matter.

This distaste also goes for most fanon nickname (except maybe Reg for Regulus?), I'm not a fan of Drake, Har (?!) and Sevy.

****** Ah, okay. Cool. And fair, but you do transform a William into a Bill. And Henry into Harry. And Nicholas into Colin. Or we do in England, at least. English nicknames can be quite... stretched.

I can see your point about Hermione not being the type though. Do you think it might change in the later stages, when she's mellowed out a bit?

And I do agree with you about Drake, Har, and Sevvy - except if Drake is used as a clearly ridiculous nickname by his over-protective helicopter parents or Sevvy is used by Sirius as a bullying nickname. Har is always ridiculous though.

******* I don't think French people use as much nicknames as English people do. At least, I never heard about anyone being called Colin (Nicolas can be shortened into Nico, but it's not always the case, and Henry isn't really shortened, except as a joke or reference.

I don't really think Hermione would either be the type to get a nickname. Ron may become close enough I guess, but it would be more to call her "Honey" or "Dear" rather than any modification of her name.

​

As for some nicknames depending of the context, I think that's the case for all of them. I mean, in most case, /Drakey/ would sound stupid, but if it's used by a girlfriend type character like Pansy (like Lavender with /Won-Won/), it would at least fit the context, and even Ron or Harry may later use it to mock Draco if they ever heard him being called like that.\\
Even /Pup/ could be justified like that, as a one time jock from Sirius to annoy the hell out of Harry.

******** Yeah, nicknames are definitely a culturally wide-ranging thing. I remember talking with a Brazilian person about how it's apparently common in their culture for nicknames to be used quite quickly (eg. in the first day of a new class, you might introduce yourself by your nickname and be called that by everyone).

I'm no expert, but I'm pretty certain British Nicknaming is down to our nightmare of a language - when you pilfer words from across the planet, you're going to have to do some linguistic gymnastics to get them all to fit into the same grammars and syntaxes and so on.

And I can see your point vis a vis Hermione. I don't think I agree - I can see a later Hermione to at least acquiesce to Harry or Ron starting a nickname - but I see it. The context thing I definitely agree with though - you put it far better than I did. Also, we definitely need more friendly-joshing Sirius.

*** I literally included this as an allias for hermione in one of my fics. Shes Hermione in text but any dialogue has her as Mia. It only last for like two chapters.

I got 3 flame emails within two days. It was super funny.

** Like all nicknames it gets weird when it's used to address her every time or by characters that aren't Harry, Ron, or her parents, but I don't get why people get angry when they see it. It's just a shortened version of her name.

** Yep, this is one that really annoys me. Authors usually use it as an easy way to shortcut establishing the friendship between Hermione and Harry.

To reinforce this crappy authors will have characters say the name of the person they're talking to constantly.

The only time in canon she's ever referred to as 'mione is when Ron's nearly died from poison and isn't even awake. He can barely speak and mispronounced her name.

At least that's what I think. The mix of unnaturally adding a characters name to every sentence of spoken dialog and trying to show they're close by Harry/whoever giving her a petname gets on my nerves.

You rarely have to add a characters name to dialog to begin with.

** Yes, yes you are. I have taken a poll of everyone in the world and you are the only one who answered yes to that question. Sorry bud. But on a positive, you are truly a unique individual! :-)

Seriously though, it really doesn't bother me that much. It bothers me more when people use the whole "Mione" / "It's HERMIONE!" thing, with Hermione constantly correcting people (namely Ron). Mostly just because I feel like by fifth year, Hermione has mellowed out a lot and especially with her close friends, she might express annoyance with the shortening early on a time or two, but would grow to accept it and would chastise someone for not knowing her well enough to use the shortened form. I am not a fan of overly anal-retentive Hermione characterization fics though.
