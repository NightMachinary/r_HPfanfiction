:END:
... it was some of the most beautiful writing I'd ever encountered. I can't remember specifics, but they were two separate yet related AU fics by the same author. After the war, hermione retreats and is a librarian in a muggle library. Snape shows up to visit(?), either on hogwarts business or bc he's nearby - I Cant remember why. She has her cottage burn down and is torn up because it was her post-war refuge in the second part. They were tagged as Snape/hermione fics but I don't remember anything really happening, beyond sexual tension and smoldering looks and whatnot.

I know this is vague; but any wisdom helps! Thanks so mu cg!
