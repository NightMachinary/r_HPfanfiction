Let's say you read a fanfiction and you really like it. Either the original author finished the story, went MIA, or took it a different direction than you really wanted. Obviously mentioning the original work and author if you remeber it. Is it ok to put your own spin on the story (not doing it word for word or story point by story point) but like it's this story but I changed these elements and/or it's set this many years after that fanfiction. Would that be considered ok or not.

I would see it very similar to what people ussually do with the original story but with already fan made works. Obviously you would have to tell people it is based off the fanfiction and either give author and story name or as many details as you can of the original fanfic.

I am curious on other peoples perspective and why.


** I think you can but I would get the authors permission just to be safe. Plus they might have some insights into the story about why they went where they went that could help you.

** As a writer, I'd be flattered that someone wanted to create fanfic of my fanfic but I'd like to be at least credited somewhere for the inspo.

** I've read a couple of stories that were a fanfiction of a fanfiction. In one case the original author had already given carte blanche approval for anyone to use/build on her stories as long as they gave proper attribution. As far as the others they contacted the original author for permission. Then there's a whole slew of stories where the author just states they were "inspired by" another fanfic.

For instance the story Protecting Harry by Fairywm is a fanfic of Potter's Protector by mjimeyg

linkffn(13032752)

linkffn(7665632)

The story Harry Potter and the Children of Change by T. E. Tanglebrooke has someone writing a fanfic.

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.

** If you've ever heard of the Naruto fanfic "Dreaming of Sunshine" by Silver Queen, we basically have this down to a science. It's called recursive fanfiction and generally it's ok as long as you either ask permission from the author, or at least give them credit, and state that it's not "canon" to their universe unless the author of the original fic states that it is.

** I am of the belief that no one owns the rights to any fanfiction idea - Rowling owns the hp world but that's it. Giving credit would be polite but beyond that it doesn't really matter.

If a fanfiction author wants to actually own anything they write, they should write original fiction (though I'm glad they write fanfiction instead).

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)
