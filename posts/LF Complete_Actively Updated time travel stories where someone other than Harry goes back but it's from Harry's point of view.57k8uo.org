Basically someone other than Harry goes back in time to fix things or whatever but it's still about Harry and Harry doesn't know about the time travel, at least for a while.

Does this exist?


** Linkffn(7733386) Draco goes back to his younger self after the world goes to shit. His grandfather thinks he is a Seer who has prophesized the end of the Malfoy family if they keep following Voldemort and takes an interest in raising Draco and the younger sister that Abraxas... /procured/ for Draco at his request.

  AU. The best place to start is at the beginning, and Harry supposes it all began with the mysterious Professor H. J. Prewett. Years 1 through 7.

  James Potter would never forget the first time he met Hermione Granger. Nor would he forget just how much he owed her for all she had done for him, his family, his world, and his future. HHr, through the evolving eyes of James Potter. HHr/JPLE

** Not /precisely/ what you're asking for, but Deadwoodpecker's three "Backwards With A Purpose" stories feature Harry Potter going back in time along with Ron and Ginny, without realizing that... er... others have also done the same thing. The first of the three stories features a Harry POV. I'd say more but it would spoil everything.

Highly, highly recommended. The first of the three is (to me) by far the best Peggy Sue fic ever written.

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love. This story is now complete! Stay tuned for the sequel!

  This is the continuation of both Backward With Purpose and The Book of Albus. If you haven't read either, you are going to be REALLY confused.
