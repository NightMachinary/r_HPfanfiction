Not sure if this is the right place to get help. I'm still trying to figure out discord and the discordme says the link is expired.


** [[https://discord.me/thesinisterman]]

It works perfectly fine for me, this link. Try it again, I'd say?

***** Aaaah got it, I had to copy and paste the link instead of click, “accept invite.” Thanks for help, I really appreciate it.
