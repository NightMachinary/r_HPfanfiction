I have been reading a lot of political fanfic and oh my, I love it. I don't mind if Harry is in another Hogwarts house or if the main focus is not politics.

I don't care about ships (just not something weird like Harry/Voldemort and weird age gaps, please).

I'd like more a morally grey Harry and some Dumbledore bashing.

Complete story is a must.

I'm not picky, just bored.

A few examples I love in AO3 are Sarcasm and Slytherin and Empire of Albion.


** linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower)

Most political story I know. It's got fecking everything. Complete in-depth descriptions of the ministry, governments, laws, how their run and created. So much detail about titles, what they mean, what they stand for, different layers of authority. War Mages, Protectoris, Lord's, Ladies, Magical Masteries. A look to the interconnection between Muggle and Magic. There's secret societies. Plots within plots. Tricks within schemes. Specific dates have meaning. There are uncovered rules about magic that have meaning.

It's dense as hell. And it's fucking incredible and I completely adore it!

If you like Politics, go checkout the author Flamethrower on Ao3, they have it mastered in every genre I cannot recommend them enough.
