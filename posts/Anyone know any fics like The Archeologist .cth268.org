Looking for some fics that have the same kind of adventure and curse breaking to this fic.

(for anyone that wants to read it, don't be discouraged because of the crossover tags. It isn't a crossover, they just use Yharnam as the an expedition site.)

  During his exploration of the history of the magical Far East, Harry Potter finds cryptic references to an island Kingdom called Yamatai, supposedly ruled by the powerful Sun Queen Himiko until its sudden disappearance millennia ago. He never was able to pass up a good mystery.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".
