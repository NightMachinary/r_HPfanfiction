Are there any fics that have witchcraft and Wizardry be different types of magic (maybe witchcraft would be potions and herbology and astronomy ect and wizardry be purely wand based subjects)? This would leave open other schools for other types of magic, maybe Beauxbaton doesn't teach witchery at all and instead teaches Wizardy and Alchemy whilst Durmstrang might teach Sorcery and Druidry ect. I just think that having terms like this be specifically for types of magic that follow a common school of thought or practice would be more interesting than just gendered terms, as it is Hogwarts may as well just be called a school of magic- there is not need to say it accepts both genders.


** I know this is not answering your question but until now I never realized that the terms were gender-based (duh obvious). I always assumed that witchcraft, as the name suggests, would deal with the practical applications of magic and wizardry would be used for more abstract concepts since wizarding is used for gender neutral concepts (e.g. Wizarding World, wizarding money, ordinary wizarding levels, etc.)

**** Witches in folklore are associated with a person of any gender that practices magic and their practice is called 'witchcraft'. Prior to Harry Potter, wizards were associated with elderly long white bearded men that wore pointy blue hats with stars on them, who served as the mentor to the hero, which indicated that they had transcended beyond simple spell casting and their magic was very abstract.

It was JK who made this distinction as based on sex. So I am not even sure whether she's an actual feminist.

****** Well people tend to be petty when they are jealous. Ron also got petty with Harry when he got way too much attention. Draco was petty with Harry when Harry rejected his friendship. So Fleur is not such a special case tbh. Tonks had a child... if a mother won't take care of him... I think that the whole point is to vilify Lupin who left them. Lavender was hated by Hermione who was Harry's friend, who also felt that she was stealing his friend away. I have no explanation for Molly though.

******* By treatment of Fleur, I meant Molly and Ginny being cows to her, Tonks specifically was supposed to be this strong female figure ( a police officer, with her own special powers, that rejected certain aspects of society) but was reduced to a mother- a statement that women cannot rise above that.

As of when I'm posting this link, this fic hasn't violated rule 8 yet, but looks like it might in the future. Just a warning.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

** I do know of one, but... rule 8. Its a DARK fic, even if there is no explicit scenes I can recall. But it discusses a lot of what you are talking about: Wizardry and Witchcraft as magical arts. Its a rather popular series and fully finished. The Black Queen series. PM me if you are interested in a link, I wont drop one here, even if it is just FFN.

** From lore of other places Wizardry is just study of magic while a witch has to make a deal with devils for power.

Hire a succubus, crank out a kid for em and you're more powerful. That's witch craft.

Learn spells is wizardry. You can be a witch and wizard but a male witch is a Warlock.

** I remember a story which was based on this premise.

Witch and wizard were gender neutral terms. Witch stood for people who could use magic but without the support of strong magic source they could not cast spell. That is why they concentrated around magic rich places or around a strong wizard. However, they were able to do things that did not require magic heavy spell casting like potion and divination.

Wizards were those who were able to use their own innate magic to change the world around themselves. Charms and spells were their main focus.

Above them went to Mages who has much more power than an average wizard and would be able to use transfiguration to a great extent without tiring out ( Think how Dumbledore used it in the Ministry battle in the 5th book).
