** ...well... If you include pottermore/tweets/etc in your canon, then Dementors may not have been a thing prior to the 15th century. So it's a relatively small window between Dementors being found on the island of Azkaban and chocolate being imported.

*** Or maybe even it's the secret chocolate conspiracy in the first place that spawned the dementors! It all makes sense now --- Ekrizdis, whose public mask was that of mr. Wonka, was the one initially responsible for the creation of these abominations, and his motive was to artificially increase consumer demand for his factory's primary product!

**** I don't think it's a conspiracy. I think it's just law of nature. Can you imagine something as wonderful as chocolate being created without some horrible price being paid? Dementors are what's left over when chocolate is extracted from the fabric of reality. That's why it neutralizes them!

*** Hmmm I more or less interpreted that Dementors were a thing before the 15th century and Azkaban is merely a habitat where they "naturally" thrived without any human contact.

**** I figured that answer was too easy.

I'm not willing to argue that wizards would have been able to travel intercontinentally sooner than the average muggle, however, I would argue that once a continent was originally found they would be faster at exploring it.

In order to apparate you have to know where you are going and in order to use the floo you would have to have another connected fireplace. They would have to travel across with muggle ships and then apparate and side-along apparate from there.

I don't know much about the introduction of the cocoa bean (obviously) but it would stand to reason that they could have brought back the bean and found its purpose for lessening the after effects of dementors a negligible amount of time sooner than the first piece of chocolate.

***** Intercontinental Apparation is said to be extremely rare and extremely dangerous, fit for only the most exceptionally powerful wizards. Portkeys might work, since their range is never really questioned in the series and seemed to be the go-to for the Quidditch World Cup, a large portion of the audience for whom were international, including transatlantic. Or maybe there's an entirely different way wizards travel internationally. Hopefully we'll see in Fantastic Beasts, when Newt arrives in New York

** I agree with your self text; Whose to say wizard and muggle developments are even? They probably weren't, they likely had, for example, cleaning spells long before muggles regularly bathed which probably lead to the whole mudblood thing come to think of it.

It's never discussed just how far portkeys, apparation and floo can take a wizard to my knowledge, nor how far an owl can fly and how fast, since they're obviously a magical subspecies or secretly magical species, no ordinary owl could possibly carry books or brooms after all, nor find a person just by their name without prior training. Even without that, it never states when flying brooms and flying carpets were invented to my knowledge

For all we know some enterprising wizard discovered coco beans long before the muggles, and either hated muggles and didn't want to deal with them despite possible profits, there wasn't enough for both worlds at the time, or they thought they were magical beans. I think I like the third possibility the best, it's just whimsical enough to be something people like Arthur Weasley would think.

This is my belief as well. Puts Salazar not wanting muggleborns at Hogwarts in a new light. Especially when you consider that the average muggle at the time wouldn't know how to read.

*** I would think that for the vast majority of history, wizards and muggles shared the same world and countries, so if muggles didn't bathe regularly, wizards of the same social class wouldn't have been likely to use cleaning charms either since they were part of the same society.
