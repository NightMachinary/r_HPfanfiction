My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.


** Idk why but Ginevra sounds cool and medieval to me while Ginerva sounds dorky and stupid. I always get annoyed when authors do that.

I kinda enjoy when I come across a "Virginia" because it /should/ imply the fic is from before HBP* came out and gave us her real name.

*I think thats the first mention of it but I'm not sure. Finding ancient fics is cool tho.

******* Nope, in Monouth's version Arthur left Guinevere in Mordred's (his nephew here) care while he went to go fight Romans on the continent, during which time Mordred seduced her, they got married, and Mordred stole Arthur's throne.

As I recall, most of the other abduction stories actually come up much later, after Lancelot was introduced, since they mostly involve him rescuing her. The only exceptions I can recall are the versions where Guinevere is abducted by a rival king (sometimes Melwas, sometimes stuff I'm not even going to pretend I remember how to spell, but I think they're usually the same guy), written by contemporaries of Geoffrey.

Coming up with new magic, different explanations for Voldemort's immortality, different reasons for which the Potters were attacked, different ways through which Harry would complete his task. Albeit many were not masterpieces, they are still more fun to read than rehashed canon elements. Honestly I won't even bother with fics that have characters who willy-nilly perform unbreakable vows, have a million horcruxes hidden in the most absurd places, the twins invent another variation of the skiving snackboxes and the Elder Wand is the Deus Ex Machina.

Guinevere ( (listen) GWIN-iv-eer; Welsh: Gwenhwyfar pronunciation ; Breton: Gwenivar, Cornish: Gwynnever), also often written as Guenevere or Guenever, is the legendary wife and queen of King Arthur. First recorded in Welsh literature in the early 12th century, she has been portrayed as everything from a villainous and opportunistic traitor to a fatally flawed but noble and virtuous lady. A notably recurring theme in many Arthurian tales is that of her abduction. Queen Guinevere has been introduced to international audience by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his Historia Regum Britanniae, a pseudo-historical chronicle of British history in which she is seduced by Mordred during his rebellion against King Arthur.

***** I mean, that doesn't necessarily invalidate your headcanon. Many people find their names embarrassing or just weird and so decide to shorten them or go by something else entirely. If you're interested in a fan fiction where it feels like basically all of the characters do this, try Prince of Slytherin. The Death Eaters all have code names, the Slytherins are basically the only people who ever use their full names (and even there you have Hadrian who goes by Harry, Amaryllis who goes by Amy, Gregory who goes by Greg, Vincent who (sometimes) goes by Vince, Theodore who goes by Theo, Ginevra who goes by Ginny, and Draco who (eventually) goes by Drake). The Weasleys obviously all still have that thing where literally everyone uses a nickname because otherwise they just sound like characters from the Arthurian legend. Several adults are called nicknames by their friends (Augusta is Gussie, Severus is Sev, Minerva is Minnie, Artemus is Artie, Ludovic is Ludo, Bartemius is Barty...) and don't even get me started on the names that Regulus uses instead of his real name.

So, long story short: it's actually not that uncommon for characters to go by shortened versions of their names for all kinds of reasons. Just because Ginny's full name is some /different/ ridiculous name than you thought doesn't invalidate your headcanon that she doesn't like it and therefore goes by "Ginny" instead.

Harry: "Yeah you're Ginny"

Ginny: "It's Ginevra"

Harry: "Cool, Ginny's fine"
