:END:
Sooo... I've read this fanfic once and I can't seem to find it, so I'm hoping someone can help me

- emotionless harry
- has an older brother and parents are still alive
- parents are genuinley sorry for leaving him, but they did it to protect him
- once they talk about everything and want him back in their lives, they get him from the dursleys
- once they find out what the dursleys did to him (to make him emotionless and the rules they placed) they go off (especially lily)
- older brother is beileved to be the boy-who-lived, but he's a good person and not aroggant

if anyone knows what fanfic i'm talking about....can you link it up?
