I submit to you "The Rise of House Potter," linkffn(10739343)

Someone recently asked for recommendations for "GOOD Time/Dimension Traveling fics where Harry doesn't tell everyone and their mother about him being from another universe." As these tend to be a guilty pleasure of mine - actually, not so guilty, you all know my love of crack - I thought, "paperhurts, for sure there will be some gems of crackily goodness in this thread!"

Scrolling through I looked for one I hadn't read before, hoping for a nice long one to keep me occupied in between putting out fires at work and while code compiles slowly on my non-engineering tower of sloth. I saw the link to "TRoHP" and got excited, and even opened it and read a few reviews just to be sure I wasn't going to sink time into something truly awful.

Oh, how wrong I was. Allow me to just put some quotes here to contextualize why I think this is a complete abomination:

CH1;

#+begin_quote
  "You wish to kill me, Potter?", Bellatrix almost seemed surprised at the words that she spoke and then continued in the same vein. "You tried to kill me. That is surprising", she muttered to herself as if in a trance and slowly moved an errant strand of hair from her face. "But you failed to kill me. You do not have the will", she smiled now and said, "Let me teach you, Potter. Let me teach you the art of killing." Saying that, Bellatrix moved...
#+end_quote

OK and we just had a thread started on dialogue, right? So you can read that and see that I had some red lights going off in my head. It doesn't really get much better; actually, it gets worse. The author implies some kind of Super!Power due to Voldemort possessing Harry and Harry absorbing not one but ALL of his horcruxes, and Harry decides "He would try to harness that power." Uh oh. Harry also "lied down" on comfortable grass. But I'm procrastinating getting to the really good parts. The "surplus of magic" makes "a series of impenitrable barriers around" the horcrux "that would prevent it from interacting with the main part of Harry's soul." More red lights go off in my head, but I'm bored, so I go ahead and try for chapter 2.

Next chapter, we find out a couple things. 1) Harry is dirty stinking rich. 2) Ron, Ginny, and Hermione write Harry a letter saying "We can no longer support you the way we have in the past," essentially telling him to f-off and stay away from them, especially since he's poor now (supposedly). Um, ok? Strange way to get all the bashing/characters the author doesn't want to write out of the way, but I think maybe it's a rocky start and the story gets better? Nah...then Harry has to go over for multiple paragraphs all the reasons why he didn't like them anyway - and he's rich so who cares! Never fear, dear reader, because Fred and George write Harry telling him their family sucks and they're still his friend, oh and here's a lot of money just in case, since the ministry stripped House Potter of it's funds since he trashed it fighting the Death Eaters.

I haven't even mentioned the fact that the author does fun things like this;

#+begin_quote
  "Twelve grown up adults couldn't take care of six untrained fifteen year olds didn't sit well with him and he had punished them with a few crusios and had let htem off. As they all settled he began

  "My friends, Welcome to the Malfoy Manor. Today, I have called you here to discuss some plans with you. But first, Yaxley what have you got for me?

  The brutal faced man replied with a bow," My lord the ministry is in an uproar after Bones's death. There have been rumors that Mad-Eye Moody himself is going to be called back to head the Department of magical law enforcement. Moreover, Scrimegeor looks to be the firm favourite for minister. His stance is against us but we don't know his method of approach."
#+end_quote

Just...what? Oh it gets worse. Random punctuation, capitalization, weird dialogue, all making it impossible to get into a flow while reading this stinking pile of manure. Using Dumbledore's full name when speaking from Dumbledore's perspective is a personal pet peeve of mine, but now I'm just getting nit picky. Let's see what else offends, shall we?

Ah! A letter from Minister Fudge!

#+begin_quote
  Dear Albus, I have got a brilliant idea of how to keep my position as the minister of Magic. You see, yesterday evening when I was quite hard at work in the ministry trying to figure out ways to combat You know who, I also pondered the problem that I won't be able to help the public if I am no longer in office. So, what I need is someone sponsoring me for the upcoming ministry elections.
#+end_quote

Really. Fudge just confiscated all of Harry's money and now he's writing this insipid letter where he demands Harry support his reelection bid. We're now entering refusal to suspend disbelief territory where this author is concerned.

Dumbledore has meanwhile quit all jobs except being headmaster of Hogwarts, so that the "kid's gloves would be coming off now" and he could tutor Harry. With a "personal hand." Snicker.

Blah blah blah, a bunch of action that stinks, blah blah blah, they attack Harry at his relatives house, blah blah blah, Voldemort speaks in all caps, Harry uses magic, and then time for Harry to die and meet death and go to this fancy new dimension finally. It's all rushed DESPITE the author having no idea how to self-edit, which is pretty awesome in it's badness actually.

#+begin_quote
  Harry instead of dodging, simply roared,"* iudicium vocation.*"
#+end_quote

Death sends him to a new universe where he takes over the body of a Harry who drowned while being raised by Remus Lupin, Neville is the pompous boy-who-lived, and Harry (despite being a 24 year old in an 11 year old's body) repeatedly uses the insult "retarded" during the first chapter at Hogwarts. That is when I gave up. The fic is just super tropey, terribly written with awful dialogue, and a plot that rips off at least a dozen good fics, and half a dozen really bad ones.

So, fellow readers, other than the Usual Suspects who tend to get bashed on here, have you read any really terrible stinkers lately?


** Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness. Not only is it not bashed enough, it is frequently recommended, despite being one of the most awful stories I've ever encountered.

This [[http://uke-nagashi.livejournal.com/?skip=20&tag=dayd][sporking]] does a good job specifying why it's so atrocious.

*** I can see why people like it, but I totally get the hate for it as well.

- IMO there's too much focus on characters like Susan Bones, who don't have enough personality in the books for me to give a shit about their backstories.
- Characters will constantly have have conversations where they completely lay bare all their most private thoughts and emotions. They casually talk about past traumas in a way that is completely unrealistic.
- It's quite repetitive, after a few chapters it all looks the same.

When I recced the story someone was asking for timetravel where Harry keeps it secret, that is actually a pretty small portion of the genre so I had to reach a bit.

  What happens when a person loses one of the very last persons he can depend on and the others betray him. A fic where Harry explores the very depths of magic and attempts to find the cure to his mother's coma and become the most powerful wizard. Some chaps have paras from orig but it's being massively edited for that. Kickass, Independant Harry/ Dimension travel/ No slash

He awakens the Longbottoms aaaaasnnnd that's where I noped out. I'm sorry, but the way the Longbottoms acted after waking up was just awful.

About Bungle? Well, I might agree with you there, but not for the same reason probably. The story might be good or it might not, but I just can't stomach the second person narrative.

**** Bungle: dumb POV - the novelty wears off quickly. Pointless Luna. Terrible and boring magical game (dodgespell or w/e it's called). Pointless MILF plot. There are things I like about it, such as the actual adventure parts, but the story is just so filled with needless baggage that its a bit mind boggling. JBern could probably trim 50k off the story and it would be better.

TLIL: Oh boy, where do I start? Like most people, I loved the story the first time I read it, sometime in 2009 probably - I remember waiting until it was completely finished before reading it. But, after being exposed to thousand of other fics and taking off the rose-tinted goggles, and then going back to reread it, there's just so many bad elements in it. The most egregious is probably the fact that this is actually James/Fleur, not Harry/Fleur, in all but name. I've done a chapter by chapter analysis of the story, so I don't really want to go into too much detail here.

HP&TBWL: This is the biggest fanboy story of all time, I'm sure. Thousand of people joined DLP just to read a few extra chapters. My problem is that the character interactions are written quite poorly (just look at Mrs. Weasley in the receptacle scenes, and every scene mentioning the Dark Arts), and the power creep is needless, wasteful, and will likely dead-end the story before we even get halfway done. Also, everything involving Harry's attempt at entering the tournament was poorly thought out. Don't get me wrong, I still think it's a good story, but it's nowhere near being the pinnacle of fanfiction that people think it is.
