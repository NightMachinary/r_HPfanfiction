[[http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/books/138262/Rowling-gives-OK-for-online-Potter-sequels][So, we all know JK Rowling gave permission for people to write sequels and fanfiction]].

But, she also requested that they not contain pornography and racism.

I am just wondering what level of explicit content would be considered pornography? Because, frankly, a lot of what I have seen can get pretty explicit lol


** Oh, yeah, "pornography" in Rowling's wording is a refined way of saying "smut". Thousands of fics on ao3 are in violation if it. I don't know where she'd stand on occasional 'explicit content' in a story that's not billed /as/ smut, explicit scenes of the sort you find in all sorts of "grown-up" novels not classified as erotica.

*** Since the original readership grew with the publication of her novels and the characters in the books, I would think some encounters if not explicit would be OK in sequels.

But yeah, fics that have a lot of sexual content between underage kids [under 16 for my country], even when consensual, is a little off-putting for me.

**** While also obviously something she'd disapprove of, the matter of underage characters isn't what I meant. It's just that I think she doesn't want there to be /Harry Potter/ erotica (underage or otherwise), even if she might accept mature /Harry Potter/ novels whose main characters are occasionally followed into the bedroom by the narration without this being the main draw.

***** I guess this is what my post was asking...where do people draw the line as to what is erotica?

I mean a lot of general fiction for adults [not specifically adult erotic fiction] has sexual scenes as a matter of course. They aren't smutty, it's part of adult fiction.

**** I think she means nothing too explicit. I agree about the underage thing, im not nieve to think it doesnt happen and fine for it to be implied but i dont need to read all the in's and out's. (Excuse the pun - it was intended)

** I think she merely meant anything explicit at all.

But I consider smut/pornography (which is just a fancier name for smut) to be fics where the main point is the explicit sex. A fic might have explicit scenes, but that doesn't make the fic smut alone.

Personally I don't mind fics featuring explicit scenes between people 17 in age, while 15-16 only incurs minor wariness (Swedish age of consent is 15, which is probably why that's the cutoff for me), but I'm very likely to skip the explicit scenes (I rarely actually read the smut). I treat Wizarding majority as muggle majority for most intents and purposes, so anything that would be weird on minors -- marriage, whatever -- is a nonproblem for me for people 17+, rather than 18+.

Age is rather abstract in 99% of fanfiction -- most people can't write characters acting their ages, so whenever I actually decide to read an explicit scene, I subconsciously age-adjust people to not be weirded out by it, up to a point -- huge age differences are normalized, etc.

*** I mentally do that, too. Ignore the character's age and base it off of how old they're acting. Even if the character is 17 in the fic but acts much younger, I just can't. But thankfully, like you say, most authors write more mature characters than their age should imply.

*** 16 is the cut off for me for actual teens.

Dawson casting? Is much iffier.

** I suspect she means everything that contains descriptive sex. Her Harry Potter series was never intended to have anything more than kisses in it, so I would assume she would like any fanfiction to stick to that.

** I am really sure if something like " For the love of Magic" ever comes into her hands, she would most likely set her lawyers off and sue people for technicalities.

and no, I do not think she meant any smutty as in pornography, but who knows what goes in her mind?
