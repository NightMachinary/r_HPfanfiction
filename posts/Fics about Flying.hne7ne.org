So, we get occasional things where Harry is like "I don't care about Quidditch, it's the flying I love" but it's usually an offhand thing and not really mentioned much. Do we have any fics where it's a bigger thing than a single line? Where Harry waxes lyrical about flight, goes all 'Whole New World' over the great Bird's Eye Views he gets, or otherwise uses brooms for something other than official Quidditch games? Maybe fics where he's all about being free and high above everything else like a bird? Anything like that.

Basically fics where Harry loving Flying over Quidditch is more than just an offhand line.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

“Please don't,”

“Towers, corbels, and windows,”

“Stop,”

“Tell me Sorting Hat, now when did you last get on a broom and fly?”
