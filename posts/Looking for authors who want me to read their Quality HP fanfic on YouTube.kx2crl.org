** How do you feel about swearing? Very few of my fics have sex scenes but they do have an occasional swear word - not all though. I'd love any of my missing canon moments/alternate POV fics read! [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/1407286]]

** I'd love to have my one-shot read. It might be a bit niche since it's about Daphne Greengrass though.

No particular terms or anything, it's just fanfic.

** I don't mind you using my one-shot "A Delacour Situation" from what I remember it has mature themes but nothing overtly pornographic. I think the closest thing to that is the word "intimate".

But give it a read if you feel like it, but it's up to you. If you decide to use it then I would love if you could drop a link to my FF profile and/or my AO3 account.

  Another one of my ideas turned into a One-Shot format. I would love it if you could tell me if the characters feel in character 3
