See above. Other characters disrupting bashes is also fine.

For some reason whenever I see some inexplicable badness happen to someone in a fic, my mind gets stuck on plotting vengeance on their behalf for ages afterwards. I'm just wondering if anyone has fleshed out those sort of thoughts and written them down.


** Not exactly what you requested, but in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11136995/1/Potter-Ever-After][Potter Ever After]], Ron becomes aware that this is a Ron-bashing fic and he and Harry have a conversation about it.

It's a crack-fic that pokes fun at a bunch of fanfiction tropes by having the characters openly discuss the tropes as it happens.

Classic exchange between Harry and Dumbledore:

#+begin_quote
  "Why, yes, Harry. I've been manipulating you your entire life - all for the greater good, of course."

  Harry's mouth gaped.

  "Would you like a Lemon Drop? I can absolutely guarantee you that they're not laced with anything that will harm you."

  The silence stretched. "I'm sorry," Harry said. "I don't buy it."

  "It's true," Dumbledore said, his twinkling eyes shining rather twinklishly. "I've controlled everything about you, turning you into my perfect sacrificial lamb."

  "No, no, no," Harry replied, shaking his head. "I call bullshit."

*** Mm-hmm. That fic skewers everything except for goblin-raised Harry.

Funny thing, it actually gives an understandable reason for why Dumbledore has to die/be a bad guy; I don't know about the rest of the Hero's Journey concept, but it's true that the mentor has to be gotten out-of-the-way in order for the hero to shine. That's why he's out of the castle at the end of Philosopher's Stone, out of the castle at the end of Chamber of Secrets, Harry is out of reach in Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire, Dumbledore is out of reach again in Order of the Phoenix (and when he does finally show up, it's ultra dramatic), and he gets his big scene in Half-Blood Prince only to die at the end and clear the way for Harry completely in Deathly Hallows.

really, voldemort doesn't do much dark lording either. the whole evil empire is pretty abstract with the exception of that one scen with the snatchers. 99% of the magical population could be completely unaffected by any of it.

Towards the end we see more characters doing things (Snape's flashbacks show Dumbledore and Snape throughout the years, Neville talks about Hogwarts, etc.). But yeah, most books are set up with a vague over-arching story that's gonna come to a close at the end of the book and is relegated to the background the entire time.

It could also be dramatic, if you focused on how someone's mental state might be affected by suddenly being shunned, a run of inexplicable bad luck, suddenly being incompetent at everything, et-cetera, while a former friend of theirs suddenly becomes popular, wealthy, successful and powerful.

...Put like that, I could see a serious story being written that takes the typical 'independant Harry gets strong and cool' and looks at it from the perspective of characters who are trampled on along the way. Perhaps they'd investigate the possibility of their good fortune or 'karma' somehow having been stolen by Harry.

** While I think this is an interesting idea, the end result would very likely be just as unbalanced as any bashing fic.

Bashing doesn't emerge out of nothing. In an effort to paint their Mary-Sue protagonist as a paragon of virtue, authors who bash have the victim commit acts that go against their canon personality (e.g. Ron/Molly/Ginny stealing from Harry's vault) so that the main character can faultlessly display a profound moral centre by 'righting a wrong.'

If the bashed character sought revenge, they'd still be a villain.

Nah, bashing has deeper underlying reasons. Since you can't blame the author (JKR) without breaking the 4th wall, the characters have to stand-in and take the blame. It's super obvious in regards to Ginny: There's very little in the books that suggest she feels entitled to Harry (she's barely a character), yet this is a very common theme in Ginny bashing fics. Why? Because it is a reflection of how her relationship with Harry was pre-ordained by JKR from the outset: It is transplanting the idea that characters belong in certain slots, no matter how the dynamics changed over the books, into an in-world perspective. When Ginny acts obsessive about how she and her Harry always belonged together it is a reflection of JKRs reasoning (and of course also rabid H/G shippers).

IMHO something similar is going on with Ron. Many people disagree with JKR that Ron is that great of a friend for Harry and express that notion by their incarnation of Harry taking a more pro-active approach towards that friendship (of course in most cases their Harry is always right about it and it rarely turns out that Ron was genuine in his friendship - though I have seen authors redeem Ron as a friend from that point, after the IMHO deserved dressing down).

Yeah those are the big ones... I notice that the people in the anti-Ron camp lay much higher weight on abandoning a friend in times of need. Some people think it's not that big of a deal, opinions differ.

Something that isn't mentioned very often is the whole Firebolt incident in Book 3. It's more subtle but IMHO it shows a nasty side of Ron. Harry has the right to be angry at Hermione (mostly for going behind his back), but Ron's role in this conflict should be to mediate between the friends (after maybe a few days to let things blow over). At least that's what I think a good friend would do (just imagine Hermione in Ron's position... she'd sit them down together and knock their heads straight). Ron can't seem to control his anger and almost seems to revel in the fact that he now can Harry have all for himself (of course that's my subjective interpretation of the subtext).

Anyway, if his anger is such a dominating force he either (a) has anger issues or (b) doesn't care about his friendships enough. I don't want to beat a dead horse, but it's fun to imagine how these things would have gone down with a different (aka better) sort of friend: Should have been really easy to explain to Harry how Hermione could easily have been right about the broom, she didn't want her best friend to die, to Hermione that she shouldn't have gone behind his back and have them shake on it.

#+end_quote

I've seen that done, but I can't remember any particular fic right now, maybe something comes to mind later.

In my opinion though it always needs a moment of catharsis, a moment when Ron realizes his missteps and decides to be a better friend (in "A Marauders Plan" Bill has a pretty good and encouraging talk to Ron about his issues). Same as is done for Hermione in canon, where she realizes that books / authority figures aren't everything. Or similar to the implied shift of attitude by James Potter. I don't feel like Ron ever had that moment in canon and if you just write him as an idealized character without justification in Fanfics it feels like whitewashing to me.

Edit: Just remembered another anti-Ron moment (since you asked for them) that's relatively subtle, but important to me: When he is confronted with the Horcrux his biggest weakness/fear is that Harry and Hermione could get together. It isn't the dead and battered body of Harry, or the Weasly family tortured by Voldemort (because Ron fights against him instead of bowing - trying to get him to back down in order to protect his family seems logical) or his girlfriend being captured and killed... no, his biggest fear is that he doesn't get the girl in the end. The Horcrux seems to think the best way to drive a wedge between the trio is to make Ron believe that Harry and Hermione might love each other after being abandoned in a forest. How horrible! /Sigh/. JKR really did a number on the poor guy.

There's a whole unwritten scene in my head where the Horcrux taunts Ron with his inadequacy, that because of his struggle his whole family will suffer and that he should just accept that defeating the great Voldemort is impossible. This could end in him truly overcoming these issues, seeing how he is actually a great help to the effort instead of having Harry re-assuring him, further nurturing his fears ("She's like a sister!"). A strong, good, dependable Ron wouldn't worry about his best friend stealing his quasi-girlfriend.

****** I've always read that scene not only as Ron losing Hermione but also as losing Harry. Iirc ( I haven't read DH in a while) they both say they don't need him and that he was worthless for the Hunt.

About using his family instead I don't know if in that situation it would have been the best way for the Horcrux to turn Ron. Ron already feels like Harry and Hermione will never forgive him, and the Horcrux playing on that plus Ron's natural insecurities of not being good enough for Hermione were the easier road IMO, especially considering that Ron knows his family will fight even if he doesn't, and accepting defeat won't change the suffering that they'll go through if they lose.

On a different note I don't think Ron would even consider not fighting at that point in the series, at least because his family was threatened. To me it always felt like a big part of Ron's identity was being a "Good" Pureblood, hence all the importance he gives Slytherin Vs. Gryffindor, and being part of a family that follows that same ideal, even if he feels like he can't always live up to it. To stop fighting because of his fear for his family would betray that. His two best friends forgetting and leaving him (from his point of view) might be enough to take away his will to fight/live, and that's what the Horcrux wants to do at the moment.

Yeah you are totally right and have a good point. Ron has always been a "doer". I mean, the whole point of him leaving is because he feels like they are not accomplishing enough.

Back to the drawing board I guess, but I feel strongly that the scene with the Horcrux could have been done in a better way, without the jealousy and pettyness implications.

***** I enjoy Ron bashing, and I've only seen the first couple of movies, so that's not where it comes from for me. I just genuinely don't like Ron that much as a character. I don't go out of my way to read Ron bashing or anything, but I have no qualms about reading a fic with Ron bashing in it.

My main reason for not liking Ron is that he's not the kind of person I would enjoy spending time with in real life. He's often quite horrible to Hermione, and I've always felt he took advantage of her lacking any other real friends to treat her even worse, because he knew she didn't have anywhere else to go.

That being said, I do occasionally read fics with Hermione bashing as well. The thing about bashing is that often it's not canon characters being bashed, but a bit of a parody of the characters where their worst flaws are emphasized. I'm fine with reading bashing of a Hermione that sticks like glue to rules and authority figures, but I would be deeply uncomfortable reading bashing of a canon Hermione. And I've read fics with a Ron I kind of like, so if that author suddenly turned to bashing him I would be a little uncomfortable.
