  “There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer's Stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower ... I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength."

  “Kill the spare.”

  “How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?” he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. “And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?”

  “Listen to me, reliving family history ...” he said quietly, “why, I am growing quite sentimental. ... But look, Harry! My true family returns. ...”

  “I smell guilt,” he said. “There is a stench of guilt upon the air.”

  “I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact --- such prompt appearances! --- and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?”

  “And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again? They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death? They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living?

  "There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it."

  “I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences.

** Voldemort is awesome. He is just presented as *flat out powerful*, not a mythical sort of power like Sauron and the ring, but as a human reaching their full potential. However unfortunately JK sacrificed this on the altar of stereotypical villain incompetance, Voldemort still remains an incredible bad guy.

Oddly enough, I find him as the only villain I find myself willing to actually follow or serve. Its honestly disappointing how he is kind of given the shaft towards characterization towards the end of the books, but regardless the fact he managed to get an entire generation of wizards to be unable to say his name speaks to his influence.

*** I have said this before, but I will say this again. Voldemort is essentially a fusion of two separate characterizations.

At first he was a stereotypical fairy-tale villain: he's bald, he dresses in black, his eyes are red and slitted, he has a fetish for snake paraphernalia (who wants to see my giant snake?), etc. His motivation essentially boils down to "because he's evil and crazy."

By about the fifth book, Rowling seems to have shifted to a more grounded story and world. Now Voldemort begins to bear many resemblances to historical examples of charismatic revolutionaries or freedom-fighters (if fire fighters fight fire, what do freedom fighters fight?). He is charismatic, has assembled a cadre of powerful, wealthy and influential individuals, has created a multi-faceted organization loyal to him (mostly), and takes out both his primary opposition and decapitates the government in a span of less than two months. He presents a compelling vision that people flock to or at least can rally around. Arguably, he is probably closest historically to something like Alexander the III (or the "Great"). Both were raving narcissists, charismatic enough to compel people to join their cause, they saw themselves as above the masses and beyond human, and lead outnumbered forces to victory through essentially going straight for the opposition leadership (bye-bye Darius the III).

It actually makes him a great villain for fanfiction: you have two different characters that you can use for your fanfics, depending on what kind of a story you want to tell, and still be roughly like him in canon.

***** To be honest, I don't think Harry's opinion of Voldemort really changes in the story: he's that jerk who murdered my parents, I hope he dies.

What changes is that Harry begins to lose his own perspective on what is acceptable. Its not a world of black and white, but an endless plethora of gray.

Voldemort literally changes his personality in the story. Sure, the overall goal seems to be the same: increase his power. At the beginning he appears nearly as inhuman as possible; he is practically the pimple of doom sticking out of the back of Quirrell's head.

But by OotP, and possibly GoF, you begin to see him depicted more in the vein of modern leaders of terrorist organizations. Sure, he lords over them like a king, but he also rewards them for loyalty and success. Snape was the person with the most questionable loyalty, but when he off'd Dumbledore he essentially made him his right-hand man (and you can't really blame him, nobody would have assumed Dumbledore was THAT crazy).

This isn't Harry's perspective, its Rowling realizing that you can't make a realistic terrorist organization like the Death Eaters work if their leader is a cackling maniac who hisses and has no plan beyond make himself god-king.

Let me put it simply: *at the beginning, Rowling basically had Voldemort as something like Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty, and about halfway through she changed him to more like Scar from the Lion King (this makes even more sense if you look up the backstory for Scar and why he has that name instead of his original name).*

***** Also, I just realized the parallel between Voldemort and Alexander is even funnier than I thought. So Alexander named or renamed like 32 or 33 cities after himself (ex. Alexandria), and even one about his horse (no really). Voldemort tried to get rid of every house in Hogwarts except Slytherin (his ancestor/blood line) and changed his own name.

But just imagine he named a city (or cities) after himself. So everyone is going around saying "he apparated to The-City-That-Must-Not-Be-Named." Or better yet, just for laughs, he renames Dublin as "Nagini" (take that St. Patrick!).

*** Also, [[/u/momoogoat][u/momoogoat]], I think you might be misunderstanding Sauron and the One Ring. They are not in any way mythical. Sauron has a physical form that basically resembles the male elves but taller than the modern breeds. In terms of power he isn't even in the top five people /on Middle Earth during the Lord of the Rings story/.

Let me put this in perspective. You know Galadriel? The elf lady in the woods? Yeah she's older than the freaking moon. Gandalf was over /thirty thousand years old/ when he met Frodo. Hell, Smaug may have been one of the last dragons created by the /source of all evil in Arda/.

Sauron isn't even the main bad guy of the world of Arda. That title goes to Melkor, or Morgoth as he later was known by.

Sauron was a Maiar, one of the lesser beings serving under the Valar, who were originally created by Eru Illuvitar (God of their Universe). He was Melkor's lieutenant, and was roughly on pair with the other Maiar serving him, also known as the Balrog's (yes those Balrogs). /The Maiar are basically low-level angels./

/The wizards in Middle Earth are actually all Maiar too./ /This might help explain why an old man can go toe-to-toe with a giant lava monster./

Sauron wasn't that powerful, even Gandalf was stronger. BUT he was incredibly good at manipulating individuals to do his bidding and swaying minds to his whim. The nature of the One Ring is derived from this aspect of Sauron. His strength was charisma, his title as Melkor's lieutenant, and his long term manipulation of the races of Middle Earth. But he was never mythical, thats just how the movies portray him.

On a side note, I just realized that the One Ring is almost exactly like Sauron's Horcrux. Well played Rowling.

**** I think Sauron was way more powerful than both Smaug and Galadriel who are not of semi-divine nature. He was definitely more powerful than Gandalf to, Gandalf himself says this to Gimli in the Two Towers ""Dangerous!" cried Gandalf. "And so am I, very dangerous: more dangerous than anything you will ever meet, unless you are brought alive before the seat of the Dark Lord." Furthermore Gandalf was afraid of Sauron to the point that at the beginning he refused Manwe and Varda when they told him to go to Middle Earth in order to fight Sauron, because he felt he was too weak.

***** Its kind of a weird thing in the Tolkeinverse. What power and strength are is not really clear. As an example, Melkor was acknowledged by all as the strongest of the Valar, even by the other Valar. And yet, on several occasions Melkor personally displays or admits he is afraid of entering battle with Tulkas, who has strength that outclasses his own.

Additionally, the power of divine beings relative to that of lower level races like elves and men is kind of up in the air. Melkor was injured seven times when he battled Fingolfin in the first age (I think). And while elves are immortal (at least from aging and disease), they are far lower in terms of power than that of the Valar and other Ainur.

Rowling and Tolkein were somewhat alike in this regard I think. Even the strongest beings could be felled or defeated by less powerful individuals or through clever maneuvering (ex. Dumbledore was disarmed by Draco and Voldemort was beaten by wand-loyalty BS).

****** I always thought that in the Tolkienverse there is a strong distinction between spiritual/magical power and physical strenght and battle skills for example Morgoth is spiritually/magically the most powerful Valar but Tulkas is stronger and better in battle, also when he fights Fingolfin he has been weakened by spreading his power over Arda. The same can be said for the Maiar with Sauron being the most magically powerful but not holding a candle to someone like Gothmogh the Balrog when it comes to battle prowess.

******* Even there you get into similar problems. For example, Morgoth needed the help of the seven balrogs to defeat Ungoliant (who is herself one of the hardest to explain parts of the entire universe).

I will give you my honest opinion here about this aspect of the Tolkeinverse, but understand this is speculation on things that are not clarified or detailed well in the Silmarillion and other books.

It is hard to buy any of this. And no, its a fantasy book, I understand its not real. What I mean is that the only thing I think that you can say with a reasonable degree of certainty, and *that screams through the history of Ea*, is that power and strength are not objective statements. They are opinions of others watching these events (or at least thats what it appears like). All these descriptions and trying to determine if "this Valar is stronger than that Valar, that elf is stronger than that Maiar" are an exercise in futility.

Strength is not nearly as quantifiable as even the HP universe, which is /notorious/ for its nebulousness in canon. Sauron is described as powerful and the most dangerous person on Arda during the Second and Third Ages, but on several occasions he is revealed to be incapable of numerous magics and tasks that far lesser beings are able to replicate. Tom Bombadil is described as being unaffected by the Power of the One Ring (though he could be Eru Illuvitar anyway, so take that with a grain of salt) when people such as Gandalf, Elrond and Galadriel were intimidated by its power and mental influence.

Tolkein was writing a story in a more ancient mythological manner, most reminiscent of the Norse Mythologies and the folk tales of the various Germanic tribes. Everyone acknowledges Thor is the "strongest" of the Aesir (i.e. Ainur) but most describe Odin as the most powerful and wise, and even the greatest in battle (depending on the particular tale of course).

***** First, I used the term "low-level angels" to put this more in a fantasy, D&D-style context of power. Maiar are powerful, but they are /less/ powerful than the Valar, who are more akin to the Archangels in the Abrahamic religions or the lesser dieties of nature in the Vedas such Indra or Agni.

Secondly, when someone uses the term mythical, its not about power, its about the status of the story/claim/history.

Here is an example: the city of Atlantis is a /mythical city/ because we know its spoken of by Plato, but nobody has any proof that it is actually real or in any way based on actual events. By contrast, the city of /Troy/, made famous by Homer's Epic Cycle and particularly the Iliad, *used to be a myth as well*. However, in 1868 a german archaelogist went looking for it in modern day Turkey and uncovered its ruins. So the city is no longer a myth, but the stories of Homer's Epic Cycle are still.

In the Lord of the Rings series, these aren't like myths of gods and demons in our world. Lots of people know Gandalf, Saruman, and many other Maiar. There are elves who personally knew the Valar and fought in the First Age. Even the humans, who are mortal, are pretty aware of all theses things being real. Mythical is about the status of belief, not about the power or strength of individuals.
