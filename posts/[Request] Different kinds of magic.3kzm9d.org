Hey guys (and girls),

I have another - non specific - request:

I'd appreciate it if you could give me the best stories involving different kinds of magic from all over the world (I mean the British magical tradition isn't the only one, then there's magics only certain creatures normally use etc. etc.) - go wild, the things I mentioned are just examples, I am taking almost everything here (with the exception of things like soulbonds and such things...don't like them, sounds like slavery to me)

Please though: Don't give me Slash (at least not involving the main character) - Het is ok (Smutt is ok, too) and Gen is acceptable as well :) and please indicate if Harry is the main protagonist (I prefer those stories but will check out others if they come highly recommended)

...Next one (doing it all in one posting while convenient but makes it hard to keep everything organized, so I am will open two more requests)


** I found linkffn(Magics of the Arcane) to have some great magical worldbuilding and some interesting concepts of magic.

linkffn(Wit of the Raven) is an extremely well-done fic with a completely new take on magic. It's a must-read. It's incomplete, but I can say without hesitation that it's one of my favorites.

linkffn(The Sword of the Hero)'s sequel has some great magical worldbuilding, as does linkffn(Wastelands of Time). You'll find some interesting magic in those two fics.

One of my favorites is linkffn(The Denarian Renegade), which combines Harry Potter with Dresden Files - which has /loads/ of interesting magic. It also has some absolutely *amazing* concepts in terms of magic, original as far as I can tell, especially in the third book of the trilogy. I won't spoil it as it's super-interesting and you should experience the adventures firsthand. Again, it's another must-read, arguably a classic, and one of my favorites.

Harry is the main protagonist in all of these. None of these are slash. All of these are action-packed to the brim. All of these involve heavy worldbuilding outside of HP canon, so you should like them.

*** The more AU the better (well, almost...certain crossovers etc. are a little over the top...though not all of them)...can't stand canon!Harry anymore (same for all the other characters), he's just an unfortunate guy who stuff happens to and who is a doormat (he doesn't stand up for himself...with Umbridge he should have tried everything, from getting in touch with the guys who oversaw the OWLs (don't remember the department name -.-), to writing to the board of governors, to giving an interview (no, not in the Quibbler as it's even more of a rag than the Daily Prophet is (sorry, Luna - but quit seeing stuff that isn't there -.-)) or even trying to get the DMLE involved! This isn't the only such situation: He should have tried CPS (wizard equivalent of course) in order not to be sent back to the Dursleys for example...there's too many to list them all IMHO!) and doesn't use his gifts (he's somewhat powerful - patronus in third year! - and does have some leadership ability (the DA!)...and doesn't really use any of it -.-) and gets by on luck and the help and sacrifice (sometimes literally...poor James, Lily and Sirius) of others...and he's not even great at school (Lily would not be proud of that IMHO)!
