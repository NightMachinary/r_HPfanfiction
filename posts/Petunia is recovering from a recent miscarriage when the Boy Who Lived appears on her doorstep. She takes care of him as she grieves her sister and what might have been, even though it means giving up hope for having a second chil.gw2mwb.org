Content warning for pregnancy, miscarriage, and blood. This is the first fic of this kind I've written before (a closely drawn character study of a not very sympathetic character in canon) and I'm pretty proud of it!


** I really enjoyed it. It was a great character study and I love the dynamics. Petunia is not a good person, and this shows more to that. I like what you've done with it

*** Thank you so much! I was definitely trying to keep her in character and not a great person, but show potentially another side to her.

** Very nice. Is the miscarriage a head-canon thing or would this be an AU element? Because if it's the second one I'd be curious to see how this would affect the rest of their relationship between now and when Harry gets his letter. Especially in the intervening years with all the accidental magic.

*** It's just a oneshot so I'm not really planning on expanding it, but it would be really interesting to explore the subsequent ripple effects
