Hey! I'm looking for the fanfiction that really got me into Dramione. I think there used to be a tumblr that was a library of Dramione fics sorted by category and stuff like that, but I haven't been able to find it. I don't know if it was deleted or if the name changed, but anyway there was a fic on there that I would really like to find. Here's what I can remember about it: -rated M or explicit -Draco was a single dad -Hermione moves in with Draco maybe? She ends up at the house -the first time they have sex in the fic I'm pretty sure they are getting back from a party or something and Draco pins Hermione against a wall -it's a long, possibly novel length fic, I know it has chapters I know this isn't much but I would really appreciate suggestions. It was really well written and I read it over and over again when I first found it.


** I think that Tumblr site you're talking about went down which is a bummer because I used it a lot.

Anyway, the story that comes to mind with Draco as a single dad is linkffn(A Wonderful Caricature of Intimacy by Countess of Abe)

If that's not it, you can also try the [[http://dramioneasks.tumblr.com/tagged/Draco%3A-Single-Parent][Draco - Single Parent]] tag at Dramioneasks on Tumblr (also a good resource).
