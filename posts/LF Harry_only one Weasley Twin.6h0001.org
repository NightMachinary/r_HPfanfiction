** Linkao3(2020146) Don't run away because of the love potion tag, it is very nicely done. Won't even call it ginny bashing, just people being people sort of thing. It's not much of a fic, just a short read.

  A few years after the war, Harry thinks he has the ideal life. He's working his way up to his ideal job, he's still together with his Hogwarts sweetheart, he's got a couple of great friends, and he's love potioned to the gills.

**** I had dismissed that one because of the love potions thing, but I'll definitely give it a try now. Thanks!

**** Okay, now I've read it I have to say thank you so much for the rec. I never thought I'd read a love potioning fic that was actually thoughtful, well-written, and not a huge bash-a-thon.
