It seems like everyone agrees that it was Lily that stopped Voldemort, sometimes with the help of James but most time without. I'm looking for anything that has Harry's latent powers protecting him. Perhaps he and dumbledore believe Lily's sacrifice saved him, but in actuality “the power he knows not” was what saved him. This might lead to an eventual super Harry, and I'm ok with that as long as it's well written.


** It'd be cool if this tied into that golden fire thing that came up literally once in DH as a Deus Ex Machina and is never used or important again.

**** Exactly! lmao

It's super important and cool, and it saves his life. Then it's never mentioned again because JKR couldn't have Harry actually do something proactive and interesting.

***** Part of it might be because what happened is literally impossible to be proactive about. I don't remember the specifics of that scene so I could be wrong, but iirc, the fire was a result of his wand acting in defense of him, and he had nothing to do with it. In the wiki entry for Phoenix core wands it says:

"They show the most initiative, sometimes acting of their own accord, a quality that many witches and wizards dislike."

I think the golden fire was an example of that in action. It wasn't the same kind of accidental magic you usually see Harry learning to harness. So while technically there could be a spell that exists with the same effect, Harry doesn't know it, and there's no reason he would be able to duplicate something that he didn't actually cause.

(Also, golden fire just screams Phoenix to me, and given the core is a Phoenix feather, it's even likely it's a result of the core.)

Now, I still think that this particular method of wand self defense should have been explored more instead of the weird one off we got, but ultimately it wouldn't come about from harry being proactive.

****** That's not the point though. Harry does one proactive thing in all of the books, and that's driving off all of those Demontors. So we KNOW he is powerful when he tries. It's a spell that most adults can't do, after all, and he did it in his third year.

But then the ONLY TIME his wand defends him like that is at the end of the saga. It doesn't do that any other time he dueled. It's just another example of JKR making the environment or something else defend Harry, because she realized that she made him a wet noodle, and never let him grow up. He would've died if his wand didn't suddenly become alive, just long enough to save him. Because he couldn't do jack shit for himself.

I mean, ffs, he won the whole war with a Dues Ex Machina.

******* I agree with a lot of what you said, I was just saying specifically why it wouldn't make any sense for /Harry/ to be able to duplicate the golden fire wand, because it was never /Harry/ who caused it in the first place.

**** The stuff that shoots out of his wand at Voldemort and destroys Lucius' wand. During the Battle over Little Whinging. Just another case of other things being special around canon Harry and he himself being fuckin unremarkable.

****** It was, but, like, apparently Harry wand had “learned” to hate Voldemort from the last time, so now this happens no matter what wand Voldie uses. It's really contrived.

** Hopefully my vague memory will prompt someone else - a story had Harry able to control both the Potter and Black family magic at a level previously unseen. The first instance was actually in the womb when Sirius was captured during an auror operation and near death - the Unspeakables prevented anyone from speaking/remembering the incident.
