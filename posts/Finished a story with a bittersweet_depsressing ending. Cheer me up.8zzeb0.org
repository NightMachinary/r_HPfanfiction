Fluffy romance(doesnt have to be!) or whatnot! Warning : i already have read most of the more popular ones.


** Some of the most fluffy HHr romances are written by Potato19 (just skip "Don't you worry" for now until you're up for sadness again).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11951348/1/All-The-Small-Things]])

and

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12243818/1/Sooner-Or-Later]])

are both fluff overload, but almost all of her fics are good.

#+begin_quote
  Set the summer after OOTP. Hermione gets struck by Dolohov's Curse in the Department of Mysteries and that sparks a change in the relationship between Harry and Hermione. They help each other deal with the grief, finding solace in each other and, eventually, love. Rated M for mentions of child abuse, some swearing and mild adult situations.

  Post-Hogwarts. One year after the Victory over Voldemort, Hermione Granger is finally graduating and Harry Potter is worryingly restless. What follows is a summer of mutual attraction, new discoveries and a misplaced 'friends with benefits' deal that will alter the most important relationship that they have.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The-Wendell-That-Wasn-t][The Wendell That Wasn't]] is absolutely hilarious and fluffy.

Severus Snape is forced to haunt Harry Potter. Neither one of them is the least bit happy about this. Also, Ginny is a horrible baby namer.

[[https://pubfiles.elusiveguy.com/J4AEk8cTPwNAzaw][Faith and Understanding]] is my favorite fic.

Ginny and Luna's friendship and Ginny's musings therein. As heartwarming as they come. A true platonic love story.

** Apologies, these aren't all extremely romantically inclined. Going in presuming you've read nonjon's Where In The World Is Harry Potter trilogy, I suggest [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11318985/1/][Favorite Things]] or [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9526039/1/][Out Of The Fire And Into The Cupboard]] or perhaps [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10856724/1/][The Greatest Prank Ever Played]]
