Hi guys, im looking for.some stories where Harry either has or gets a phoenix familiar.


** If you ignore horrible notes in the end of each chapter, then linkffn(3230439) is not that bad. Not exactly my cup of tea (too much action), but it seems like well written (except for Hermione, which is fortunately not that prominent).

  Post OoTP Harry's life takes an unexpected turn when Fawkes provides Harry with a means of mobility. Ch 32 concludes the final six-chapter arc. Forget Book 7.

** Rather than try to remember, I'll pass along LiraSnape's list of lists which I read through 15 years ago or so... there are likely older stories you have never heard of (but just as likely to find dead links...)

After you go through the Phoenix stuff, check out the rest!

********* It's just disturbing.

Here's why:

- Snape is much older.
- Literally treats Harry like crap.
- Compares him to his 'swine' of a father every single time despite him being open-minded and shy.
- He's partly responsible for the murder of his parents.
- He suppported the death eater ideals meaning he sees his mother and best friend as lesser human beings.
- Is the most unfair and second most bigoted teacher ever. Always supports his own house before others whether or not they're right or wrong.
- Let's Malfoy get away with sabotaging Harry's potions which could be life threatening.
- ...

I could go on and on but I think it boils down to this: people like Alan Rickman. He's a fairly good looking guy in an edgy way. They also somehow think Snape is 'good' because he did his part in opposing Voldemort. No. Life's not black and white.

The only possible reason he could have for wanting a romantic relationship with him would be to get one back at James Potter. And that would just be disgusting, to normal people.

Oh and exactly the same thing for Draco. And Voldemort/Tom Riddle is even worse.

Love and hate are completely opposite things. Any one who quotes something like that never loved or is in an unhealthy & toxic relationship.

Oh and Harry is straight in canon. So to be fair changing an entire character's moral beliefs/ideas/situation and sexual orientation would no longer make it the same character. Irregardless of then having the same name.

********* On one hand, you have to be passionate about someone to love or hate them; the opposite to both is apathy. On the other, love and hate go together like "abusive" and "relationships," which is to say that they often do but never should.

********** Aprodite and Ares = love and war or hate are both the same as they are both extreme emotions . It is not random that Phobos and Deimos (Fear and Terror are the result of the union of Love and War) They are both extreme emotions that cannot be understood by the Intellect.

*********** They are greek gods, not a study in human psychology. The gods of ancient greece did not produce "results" as their offspring, they were not even representations of their "aspect".

Also, Aphrodite is not the goddess of love, but of beauty. And for the ancient greeks, war was very, very, very different from hate.

********* That's an insane statement.

Hatred and Love are two polar opposites. Two emotions couldn't be further apart. One is the unnatural epidome of anger and wrath borne from our own mental complexity and tendency for feedback loops, the other is the unnatural epidome of strange attachement between two people.

If you hate someone, you wish to harm them. Injure, mentally and physically. You curse their name, you wish the worst for them.

If you love someone, you wish to protect them. Prevent harm and soothe worry. You become sick if they're in danger, and you are incapable of wishing bad upon them.

I don't know if you meant some strange poetic delusion, but is is an extremely untrue statement. Hate and Love are two incompatible emotions, one cannot exist if even an echo of the other remains.

  Slash, HPSS- Harry's date with Voldemort at the conclusion of the Triwizard tournament didn't go quite as planned. Fate steps in with a 'unique' opportunity, offering Harry the chance to live and mature in the past. For a while, anyway.
