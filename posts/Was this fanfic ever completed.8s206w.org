** Short answer: No

Long answer: The author had a major accident about 2-3 years ago, and has been slowly recovering since. He actually has a [[http://www.viridiandreams.net/][blog]] you can check that is updated based on how many words he has written.

For the first time in a while, it was actually updated 3 months ago. But its slow going and there is always a chance it will remain unfinished.

*** I had no idea that this author was in an accident - I feel really bad now for the number of times I've cursed him.

Thank you for linking the blog and for explaining.

**** I understand that sentiment, it sucks when you get really drawn into a story and it just stops.

Some of my favorite fics (ex. linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent; What You Leave Behind; Ectomancer)) are unfinished and likely will never finish. Its not impossible, but it is improbable.

But you have to remember, most of the time we as readers don't know what happened to the authors. Here is an example: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_(novel_series][The Millenium Series]]). The author was writing several books, finished part of the way, and died tragically before it finished. Fanfiction is even worse, because most of us are anonymous and cannot know what caused it to stop.

Ere on the side of caution, and don't judge people harshly for something they do for free and our benefit.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
