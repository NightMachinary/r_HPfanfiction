Harry Potter is a boy, but for some reason everyone around him thinks he is Harriet Potter, the Girl-Who-Lived, who looks exactly like her mother, but with her father's eyes...

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly_Evans_and_the_Spiral_Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]] This is a great story, some large twists in it that took me by surprise. Complete at 405k words.

I've read quite a lot of these. IMO, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A_Butterfly_Effect][Butterfly Effect]] is the best fem!Harry and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3894793/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Distaff_Side][Distaff Side]] is the best universal genderbender.

*** Yeah, Butterfly Effect beats the pants off pretty much every GWL story in existence. And it's /femslash./ How did that happen exactly?

On topic, Taure's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra_Potter][Alexandra Potter]] is off to a good start.

**** Femmeslash and slash fics get a bad rap because most of the people writing and reading it are more interested in the sex than the story. But it can be good on occasion. Butterfly Effect is a good example. It has some sexy bits, which I'm not really a fan of, but it also has a fantastic plot and absolutely BRILLIANT characterizations.

**** Aha, warm and fuzzy feeling from being recommended here.

In addition to Alexandra Potter, my story In Essence Divided may also be worth a look. It's not a gender swap, but it does involve something similar.

**** I know right? Year long hiatus is killing me. But I talked to the author on her DA account and she said she's just really busy.

Then again, that was a month and a half ago. {╯°□°}╯︵ ┻━┻

** If you're looking for an actually gender /swap/ (i.e. not born different, but they change gender in the story) the only one worth a look is Effects and Side Effects.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4606270/1/Effects_and_Side_Effects]] Author: Pheonix Dawn Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.

Rated: Fiction M - English - Adventure/Romance - Harry P. - Chapters: 28 - Words: 358,021 - Reviews: 1,154 - Favs: 1,954 - Follows: 2,314 - Updated: 07-23-12 - Published: 10-19-0

This is the best genderbender out there, but it still isn't great. It's very slow moving, full of unwarranted angst, and Harry is a rather pathetic emotional wreck, even if s/he also does get supered up a bit.
