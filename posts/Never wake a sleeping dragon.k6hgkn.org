Anyone seen a crossover with Game of Thrones? What if the "dragon" in Hogwarts' words refers to a Targaryen? What if the then-ruling Targaryen family promised protection to the students of the school - a safe place to learn magic?

(Personal preference for Severus Snape to be the "dragon", but interested to hear everyone's thoughts)
