  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP

  After 5th year, the “talk” with Vernon at the train station is counter-productive and Dumbledore learns how big a mistake he made by continually sending Harry back to the Dursleys. A one-shot, no pairing.

** I would call this fic deeply melancholy rather than depressing, but that might be a meaningless distinction. It was written after HBP for a Snape/Harry fest, but it has an IC cold and bitter Snape and reads like a gen fic. That is, even though the emotional undercurrents are complex and intense, they remain subtextual (which is part of the point). You'll probably notice a few SPaG errors here and there, but I don't think they detract from the fic.

Warning for character death.

Ack! Edited to change the link because it reproduced the entire lengthy and unnecessary author's note - which I recommend skipping.

  Even magic has its limits. She helped end a war and lived through some things people never should, but there are certain things that no one can overcome or undo - not even Hermione Granger - and it's a long, hard road to accepting the hand that fate deals. Hermione/Ginny

** [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=6501][Getting The Hang of Thursdays]] is dark --- Snape repeatedly fails to save Hermione from dying every day, Groundhog Day style. It has an extremely depressing ending, in addition to an alternate ending if you didn't want to go that dark.

It's Severus/Hermione, which isn't everyone's thing, but they start out quite in character and their being trapped in a time loop at the only ones aware of it, and the extreme was of the situation, make whatever-the-hell they end up to each other believable.
