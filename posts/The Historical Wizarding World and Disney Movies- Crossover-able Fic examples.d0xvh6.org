Every time I've searched for crossovers between HP and a classic Disney movie that used the characters in Disney (for example, Snow White's Evil Queen, Rapunzel's Mother Gothel, the sorceress in Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella's Fairy Godmother, Mary Poppins, etc.) - they're usually the high school AU's where the various Disney characters are going to Hogwarts.

I'd like to find fics that could actually place these characters in the history of the Harry Potter world. Mary Poppins' childhood and what House she was Sorted into, if the Beauty and the Beast enchantress may have gone to Beauxbatons or knew Nicolas Flamel, if the Evil Queen from Snow White could have been an ancestor of an evil modern wizard. Things like that. I've written fic for Disney, but feel like there isn't enough canon evidence that the worlds could be crossed over in a fanfic. I think there's good evidence for Mary Poppins, not sure of others.

Any known 'historical' fics that are actually set in both universes and not the 'High School Hogwarts' teen stories?


** Oh yes, someone already made this absolutely fabulous video [[https://youtu.be/u0K-cHESi1c][Beauty and Lord Voldemort]]. Tom laughing is so adorable.

*** I love it! Laughed so hard at the birds on Voldy's shoulder. When the spell breaks, he'd transform back into young Tom Riddle. :)

I realized also that this would turn Gaston into 'Harry.' :P

** Well, not Disney /Movies/ per se (though of course, the movies are canonical to the comics), but there is an official Disney comic story where Magica De Spell gets a job as a Defence Professor in what is obviously Hogwarts in all but name, complete with appearances by Hermione, McGonagall and Snape. It's fun.

At any rate, onto how well various things fit --- the sort of magic displayed by the Enchantress of /Beauty and the Beast/ doesn't really fit /HP/ magic at all, but Grimhilde could plausibly be a /HP/ Witch in a time period when wands weren't quite so widespread.

But the obvious thing is /The Sword in the Stone/, which Rowling has stated was a major influence on /Harry Potter/, complete with Vernon Dursley basically being Sir Ector and Dumbledore and his office cluttered with strange implements mirroring Merlin and his house full of machines and gizmos from the future. It is also the likely reason why Rowling thinks of the /HP/ universe's Merlin as being from the 11th century or so, as well. About the only piece of magic in /Sword in the Stone/ that doesn't seem to match the /HP/ magic system is the way Merlin and Mim can shapeshift into a great number of animals: it obviously influenced Rowling's Animagi, but also doesn't fit with the specifics of them. But that's fairly easy to brush off if one takes into account that Merlin was the most powerful sorcerer of all time. Come to think of it, the crossover also provides a neat way to both have Merlin as more powerful than any modern-day wizard, /and/ to have magic progressing rather than regressing over time: /Merlin's a time traveler/, who has learned spells only developed long after his birth, and remains ahead of even Dumbledore and Voldemort because he's traveled /beyond/ the 21st century.

/Bedknobs and Broomsticks/ also fits perfectly with the /HP/ magic system, and, no surprises, also looks to have been a significant influence on parts of /HP/ (the Hogwarts statues marching into war in /DH/ come to mind, put next up to the Museum's suits of armour in /B&B/...). Miss Pryce --- and, one supposes, Emelius Brown, in light of the twist at the climax --- would both be examples of the "Late-Bloomers" Rowling has told us exist but never actually used, Muggle-borns whose magic only begins to manifest at a later age.

/Tangled/ doesn't fit HP magic very well, and /Frozen/ and /Princess and the Frog/ don't at all; /Cinderella/'s only possible if you take the common fanon position that prior to the Statute, and even for some time /after/ it, wizards and witches passed for the Fair Folk to Muggles, explaining the Fairy Godmother as a witch. (There's an interesting story to be told there where she's actually Cinderella's birth mother, born of an affair with Cinderella's Muggle father.) Even then, you would have to ignore the sequel, as it relies on the idea that anyone can perform magic if they get hold of the Godmother's magic wand, which obviously wouldn't work in a /Harry Potter/ context.

There's no particular reason not to allow in /Aladdin/ (I think Djinns are referenced somewhere in extended-universe /HP/ material), but only with the understanding that prior to making his Second Wish, Jafar isn't a wizard, just a Muggle who, this being pre-Statute, has gotten hold of many enchanted objects. The absence of any full-blown wizards in Agrabah are curious, though. Not impossible, but curious.

Could I get a quotation for this statement? It would be very interesting. I thought that late-bloomers just don't happen, when you are eleven you are either definitively in or definitively out, and it is very important for the story I am in the process of (very slow) writing.

**** Sources are [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Late-bloomer][on the Wiki page]]. She talked about this in a couple of old interviews --- she originally planned to include a late-bloomer character in the books but eventually dropped the plotline.

***** That is very interesting, thank you. Yes, obviously, my late bloomer is exactly Petunia, but I had to limit the canon I follow to books and films anyway (Petunia is without any explainable reason killed in the cursed Cursed Child), so I will just stay there.

She gets into troubles when while living in Czechia after The War and almost kills a Muggle policewoman by a bout of the accidental magic in her age of forty. She gets stuck at Budeč ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(Kladno_District)]]), which is a Czech magical school, because the authorities just have hard time to excuse something which looks like a magical manslaughter by the accidental magic of forty plus years old lady.

Well, I will adjust my story a bit.

****** *Budeč (Kladno District)*

Budeč is an early medieval settlement within the modern Czech Republic. It is located 17 kilometers northwest from today's center of Prague in the community

Zákolany in Kladno District in Central Bohemia. Eleven centuries old church of St.Peter and Paul on this place is at the core the oldest standing building in the country. According to archaeological findings, the hill was inhabited already in prehistoric times.

  I know both her and Queen Grimhilde use wandless magic, but I always wondered if maybe they were powerful enough to be able to perform wandless spells and curses
#+end_quote

It's not just the wandlessness, but the ability to Transfigure an entire castle's worth of people in moments. And also the "conditional" nature of the curse --- we don't see anything in /HP/ that's even remotely like a Transfiguration getting reversed if certain abstract conditions are met before a rose wilts --- though I suppose the 2017 movie does hew closer to /HP/ in this regard, as the curse, IIRC, is actively lifted by the Enchantress who had been keeping an eye on things.

Rowling did, for the record, address the in-universe origins of the Snow White story [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Malodora_Grymmi][over here]], if it's of any interest, though it's more the fairy tale than the Disney adaptation, with the witch (hag, actually) being called "Maodora Grymm" instead of "Grimhilde".
