Darsynia has tried to make an SI fic work, and I think she's managed it from what I've read so far. She has a real knack for characterisation and dialogue that is funny, heartwarming and captures characterisation particularly well. The focus of the fic is a love triangle between Remus, Sirius and the protagonist; but there is a lot of exploration of both canon events and its links with wider world history which is fascinating.

Her recommendation for people who aren't a fan of ch1 is to skip ahead to ch4, when more canon characters appear and her writing really takes off.

Clarification: What does "SI" stand for? I don't recognize this abbreviation...

*** Sorry, self insert. Basically sticking someone from our world into the hp universe, not necessarily the author. The genre has a bad reputation because of lots of people writing wish fulfilment stories, but occasionally someone does something more interesting with it, like Darsynia has!

It's called self insert for a reason. If it is someone who's not the author it would be a someone else insert.

***** Even if it isn't specifically a carbon copy of the author, it is still often classified the same way. Was that really necessary?

Was what really necessary? Pointing out to you the meaning of the words "self" and "insert"? Not really, but talking about fanfiction at all isn't strictly necessary either.

In any case, I just think this kind of attitude is the reason why words like "nonplussed" or "literally" have lost all meaning.

******* Literally hasn't literally lost all meaning. It's now become contextual. Sometimes it does have meaning.
