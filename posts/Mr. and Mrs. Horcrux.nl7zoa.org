Harry and Ginny are married and all is well. But both of them are quietly working to take over the wizarding world, because they are both actually one of Voldemort's horcruxes (Harry = Harry!Horcrux, Ginny = Diary!Horcrux) and only pretending to be their former selves. They become suspicious that the other is on to them, but they really have grown to love their spouse so they're hesitant to just kill them off. Hijinks ensue, maybe ending with a duel/brawl a la Mr. & Mrs. Smith.

Ideally ending with them in their own twisted happily ever after together because I do think Voldemort is that narcissistic.


** I'm just imagining the fight scene from the duel and that anybody hearing them will think that is just them getting frisky with each other.

** Apart from "Seventh Horcrux" and a few wacky ones, there aren't simply enough Harrymort and Ginnymort fics in this fandom.

What I prefer though, is having respective Horcruxes merging with them and becoming independent beings (no longer as soul anchors). They can be rewritten based on authors' needs, and they can get immense power boost without much suspension of disbelief.

Harrymort and Ginnymort teaming up to overthrow Voldemort will be fun and create lots of mayhem!

** This has sort of been done before.

Check out [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] by Emerald Ashes. The fic is a bit of a cracky one, but it's a classic.

**** She wasn't. She ended up turning into a mini Bellatrix with how obsessed she was with Harry and how desperate she was to please him.

***** I do remember that. But the way they put it here made it seem like Seventh Horcrux had a Ginnymort/Harrymort.

*** It might legitimately be the best Harry Potter fanfiction written. I don't like most of Emerald Ashes's stuff, but this is just so unique and well-written, it is one of my favorites.
