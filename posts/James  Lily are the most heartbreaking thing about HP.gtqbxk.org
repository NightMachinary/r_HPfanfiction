The story of James & Lily always struck a cord with me and it was so sad with how young they were. I honestly steer away from any fanfics from the Marauder era because I don't think I can get through a fic of them without becoming sad. Part of me hopes that we'll get an official book or a series/movie about them but another part of me... the fanon is so strong with this couple.I don't want it ruined. I just saw this fanvid: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwjK_f4xHCc]]

and it's honestly the best James & Lily video I've seen. It was so heartbreaking. What are your thoughts on Jily?


** Reading hp as a kid, I only saw James and Lily as The Adults. My parents had married and had me at the same age too, after all. But now I'm 21 and holy shit it's horrifying. Sirius is always worse for me, though. I miss the days where I could put myself in the shoes of bright eyed child heroes and have fun reading their adventures, now I'm stuck with the tragic has-been characters.

** I mean they did die in their early 20s within a year of their kid's birth. That's as heartbreaking as it gets

** I used to love the pairing and the Marauder's Era fanfiction in general. But I have stopped reading them because it really is sad reading those stories and knowing what they are going to end with. I feel equally sad for the remaining Marauders as well, the death of the Potters had a huge impact on the rest of their lives (especially on Sirius').

** I absolutely loathe the movies's portrayal of James and Lily. I mean, they are supposed to be 21 when they died, and the movies show them as 30 something year olds. We really need a better Harry Potter TV series.

I love the Jilly pairing as long as it ends happily, that is in fics where they don't die (like time travel fics). Thus, I avoid any fic with James or Lily bashing like the plague (or should I say COVID?)

** Love the JP/LE pairing, tragedy and all. I tend to avoid Marauders era fics though, because so many fanfic authors are too busy jacking it over how Snape is "so broody and edgy omg", and tailor the story to make a hero out of the guy who put out a hit on a one-year old baby so he could try and get with the kid's mom.

** I made their house in the sims (I was doing a whole hp world, I know, I'm a nerd) and legit cried because of how sad it was. I mean I was listening to the scientist by coldplay so that only added to it, really. Their story is heartbreaking.

** yeah that's why I only ever read Marauders era fics where I know a lot of things are gonna change e.g. linkffn(The Last Peverell by animerocker646)

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right? (FemHarry)

** Ignorance is bliss, damn I think children are the happiest creatures on earth. They do not fully know it yet how painful life can be.

As a child, I never really realized that Snape had one shitty life. Forced to serve two masters, and always hiding below his mask of indifference while his insides were boiling with the pain of losing Lily - his only friend and love.

*** I just recently saw recommendations for linkffn(The Peace Not Promised). Angsty, but a fantastic characterisation of a Snape who's been given a second chance to earn a happy ending. And having Lily around and lighting up his life, he just can't keep up the prickliness forever, he gradually starts to mellow. A bit.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

** Hi sorry to spam so long after your post, but if you're into fanfiction and want to get your heart torn out, I HIGHLY suggest [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/][The Bureaucratic Error]] It's about Remus Lupin being thrown 5 years into the past after his death, his clearing Sirius' name, and the two of them trying to live beyond their grief and trying to help Harry. James especially features strongly in their memories, and it makes you so desperate to have James and Lily alive again. I finished this in one sitting (took me two days) and cried at the end. Hope you give it a try.
