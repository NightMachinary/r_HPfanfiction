** Welcome to the fandom!

It's a fic about all the slytherins in Harry's year that we don't really hear about. Their interactions with Harry, Hermione, and Ron are practically non-existent.

Since the fic you refer to seems like a Self-Insert, I'll give you a popular SI fic. Main character doesn't interact much with Harry or Ron. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff]])

  Even though i'm looking for some new main characters, if there is a story with the same main characters, but it's very different from the main story it can also be recommended.

This is a very broad statement. I'm going to throw some of my AU favorites. I feel that these fics are among the best written ones out there (though there are certainly more). These are Harry-centric, but most don't have the full Trio together. All of these are very well written, IMO.

For Lack of a Bezoar is a story where Harry isn't able to save Ron when he drinks the spiked pineapple stuff in Half Blood Prince. Short, quick, dark. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13108396/1/For-Lack-of-a-Bezoar]])

Trial by Troll is a quick one shot about what happens when students are actually sorted by having to fight a troll. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11106651/1/]])

That Which Holds the Image is a Dr. Who-Harry Potter Crossover that is a Horror/Mystery. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/]])

Red Amber is a short crime mystery story of the hard-boiled genre. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12896758/1/Red-Amber]])

Hogwarts Battle School is what happens when the plot of Ender's Game gets shoved into the Harry Potter universe. It's long and the author hasn't finished it yet, but I thought it was really fun. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]])

**** You're welcome! Just FYI, the first two fics I recommended are noticeably lighter/fluffier than the rest of them. All the Harry-centric ones are much more serious.

Happy reading!

** I can't offer much except a plea to retry alaxandra quick, her character progression is present and intentional. Her flaws can be obnoxious and you are justified in your dislike but i think it still stands as excellent literature.
