Examples being like, say, SI into Voldemort's wraith form in PS (presenting the SI with the moral problem of how to get a body back, what to do afterward with the appearance of magic hitler), or SI into Molly Weasley, or SI into Mundungus, or SI into Winky or Dobby, or SI into Bellatrix while she's still in Azkaban (presenting the moral conundrum of breaking out with the other Death Eaters when the time comes, and then sticking with them or running off to the Order for sanctuary), or SI into the body of Vernon Dursley for the chance to make him a better man than he ever was (and make life better for harry of course), or Stan Shunpike for extra uselessness?

shit, there's so much original and awesome story potential here, but I haven't found anything except the standard repetitive SI in harry's body or an OC related to a main character just so they can make stupid egotistical romances with "themselves" and their favorite character.


** I don't remember the name of this fic, but Tom Riddle had a voice in his head (named Jerry). The voice was a basically a self insert and thought Tom how to be an evil overlord.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
