I just read the german book all is quiet on the western front by Erich Marie.

I was wondering is there a similar story like his in the hp fanfic universe??

For people who haven't read all is quiet on the western front it is about the story of a german soldier after the first world war and its difficulty for the men who returned to return how they were before the war and how to live in the new one.( for anime fans its like Violet Evergarden).


** "All is Quiet on the Western Front" is a very good story, and there are thousands fics with Harry as a PTSD basket case. A nice one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167). All of them were suffering badly here, and when the Ministry and Wizengamot failed them again, they struck back with a vengeance.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
