THE PREMISE: Fake Moody messes up real bad. The Goblet of Fire picks Lavender instead of Harry.

Harry get the feeling that this was another thing aimed at him, and as such feels kind of responsible for making sure Lavender doesn't get the big ded. Lavender regrets spending all her time on cosmetics charms.

Eventual Harry/Lavender because the whole mess turns her into a complete badass. Hermione assumes he's trying to go out with her from the start, and is supportive in a 'vaguely amused mom' kind of way.

POSSIBLE TITLES:

- Lav-Lav Victorious
- Cosmetologist: Eternal Glory Edition
- My Life As A Teenage Gladiator

How do y'all feel about this? Would you read it?


** I'd love for her to use cosmetic charms tactically, or know really obscure charms but only for their cosmetic uses. "Lavender! Wasn't that an 18th century torture spell made to replace using the rack on prisoners?" "Whatever you say, Hermione. I just know it's perfect for those days where you really want to pull off the straight hair look and your fringe is all over cowlics."

Do I absolutely need to read it all in order? I don't remember the end of first part, do I need to know anything before I begin part 3? Thanks very much.

** Find some way to absolutely make it Harry's fault.

Like, i think a theory is that fake moody tore Harry's signature off one of his assignments and used it to enter him into the goblet.

so maybe harry was sick of DADA and bribed lavender to copy one of her papers for him. the goblet changes the magically changed harry potter signature back to the lavender brown signature and thats what comes out of the goblet.

** I like your idea of the Goblet choosing someone besides Harry but Harry feeling responsible somehow and helping them. I also like the idea of it turning into a pairing for Harry. However, I am not in love with the idea of it being Lavender Brown.

Just saying, I would rather see other "underdeveloped character" possibilities such as Katie Bell, Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott, Astoria/Daphne Greengrass, or others. Lavender is just so... unlikeable to me. But maybe thats just me.

*** Crouch summons 'potter signature' and gets a torn piece of parchment where the said character was practicing writing their possible future name. Eg. Susan Potter. Fic can then becomes a trope bender by having a the questions asked. Does the ministry accept that Susan is now mrs Potter. If Harry is the last Potter, are they married? Are they now accepted as adults? Add a lordship trope? Aunt Amelia is now involved and is ? (Pansy parkinson tried it in first year? And the page is ripped from her diary?)

Going crackfic. Crouch summons a pile of parchment. Thinking why add one signature when you can add many, he rips the names from the pile and drops them into the goblet. Now the harem fic occurs as ALL THE GIRLS/BOYS with or without harry is entered. Harry basically starts up the DA a year early. Subvert tropes now!

  Harry Potter was looking forward to see who the three Champions of the Tri-Wizard Tournament would be. But nothing is ever quite so simple in Hogwarts, at least not for Harry. There is more going on than the revival of a dangerous competition, that much is certain. An alternate take on the 'Goblet of Fire'

** I love it, except for the idea of the eventual pairing. I always love to see Harry make new friends, and the books show he likes to go for the unexpected friendships, and Lavender would be that.

** This is a premise that demands to be explored! As for the title: My Life As A Teenage Gladiator gets my vote. Lavender Brown is a character that deserves to be developed further.
