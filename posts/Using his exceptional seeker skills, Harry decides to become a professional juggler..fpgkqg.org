**** I suppose so. I can't juggle more than two balls which isn't really juggling. The obliviators get annoyed with Harry cause they think juggling 7 or 8 balls is impossible without magic, Harry is adamant that he isn't using magic, he gets so pissed with them interfering in his art that he decides to open up a juggling school to try teach purebloods. This Harry is a drama queen BTW. "Juggling is so an artform Hermione"

*** Excellent hand/eye coordination and reflexes. Juggling is just throwing balls into the air and catching them.
