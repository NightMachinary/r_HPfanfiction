** To achieve what?

To make it more competent?

To make it more transparent?

To make it 'cooler'?

To make it seem more set against muggleborns so I can bash wizards?

Change for the sake of change is often silly, but there is plenty that could be changed with good reason.

** Consistency!! It makes ZERO sense that the Malfoys got away with no punishment. Although if we're going for reflecting 'real life', I guess it's realistic to have a corrupt government....

Side question, because I'm mulling over a fic set when Hermione is in charge, how is Minister of Magic selected? If there's no canon explanation, what system do you think they have in place?

  how is Minister of Magic selected?
#+end_quote

As far as I remember we know three things from canon about this:

- Dumbledore is offered the post (iirc, several times)
- Dumbledore refuses the post
- Fudge is surprised that the Muggle PM thinks he might still be in power after all the calamities described at the start of HBP

I think there's also a line about "not being surprised at why they chose Scrimgeour" but I think it's either Harry or the PM who says/thinks it and neither of them are really well placed to comment on the process.

So... what seems to make the most sense to me with those three facts is that it works on something like a process of "affirmation".

I suggest that we think of elections as a formalised opportunity for an electorate to provide feedback/information about what's going on. In a system with elections it doesn't make much sense to hear that Dumbledore is offered the post unless people repeatedly elect him despite (a) not standing and (b) having a history of refusing the post.

An affirmation system (and I don't know what people usually call this but I'm going with affirmation) there's no formal process. What this means is that people decide a particular individual has the support of everyone else and they go up to that person and say "yo, wanna be minister?" or whatever. If that person turns the post down, they'll go with someone else. Fudge presumably got in because he seemed (a) harmless and (b) obsessed with listening to Dumbledore (i.e. who they really wanted). And the flip side is that as soon as people believe other people have lost faith in a Minister, that Minister is out on their arse. This is because the system is built on beliefs about beliefs and faith that the right person is in charge. (Remember, Arthur writes laws so bureaucrats in the ministry are, as far as we can tell, the Wizarding legislature.)

An affirmation system makes Fudge's actions much more understandable... he has no way of manipulating electoral processes to present his "theory of the case" or to hold snap elections when he's popular to forestall criticism by riding out the electoral cycle. Instead, Fudge is just left with whatever guesses he has about what people think. If you want to maintain power under affirmation, then it's necessary to act in a paranoid fashion... you can only ever guess at what people think and there's no systemic prompt to reveal information.

The only real question is who "they" are. The heads of departments? The wizengamot? Maybe it's even more extreme... you just have to present yourself as representing some sort of group (e.g. the 1973/4 Hufflepuff Quidditch team) and say "we think you're really great, want to be Minister?" And then you say to everyone else, "Hey don't you think X would be Great?" (or vice versa). And if no-one raises any particular objections... voila, a new Minister.

The other possibility is that they use something like the Goblet of Fire and it just chooses the person whom (a) the largest proportion of people would support and (b) has the capacity to work as minister. If that person declines, it spits out another name. Presumably it just spits out names whenever it feels like.

Fudge might be a terrible leader but he managed for years to organise a government in a corrupt society that may not have taxes. He's an amoral or immoral (not sure which) leader rather than an incompetent one is what I'm saying.

**** Thank you for that. It makes sense for it to be that haphazard I think!

How would you explain Hermione getting the post? Presumably all the blood-purists weren't locked in Azkaban. There must have been enough people still free who would be unhappy with a muggle born taking the post.

I love it though! TBH, it's one of the only Cursed Child plot points I can fully get on board with!

***** Well, I actually got the impression that Hermione hadn't been Minister for very long in CC (and likewise Harry as the head of the DMLE). For the fic I'm working on myself (which is theoretically compliant with CC), I actually put Delphini's attack at the start of the second school year for which Hermione is Minister. Which means there's 20 school years of Hermione's making a name for herself in the Ministry. 21 and a bit years of post-War reconstruction. And 21 and a bit years for people like Lucius to just naturally lose influence as they become less and less familiar with the people who are important/worth knowing. And, of course, Hermione is a hero... you can trade on that for a very long time.

Whether by election or affirmation I really don't think the minority of blood purists would have enough influence after 20 years to get in the way of Hermione. Or, more accurately, that they wouldn't be ready to openly obstruct her ascendancy.

I do have a kind of... logical argument for having Hermione be a relative newbie in the post. I mean, I really don't understand why Harry would want to become head of the DMLE and it's pretty clear from CC that he's not very suited for the job either. Harry's being head of the DMLE has, to my eyes, a time limit on it, which implies that he hasn't been the head for very long at the start of CC. It would make sense for Harry to take up the role when Hermione becomes Minister... both since she vacates the post and because I think Hermione would encourage Harry to take the role.

**** 1. I think that in canon the Minister is elected or nominated by the Wizengamot, which Members are selected by the Minister.
2. In every form of government except democracy, the rulers are those that are believed to be the most fit to rule. In both Monarchy and Aristocracy the ruler or rulers are those that are believed to be best. Both those systems revolve around the idea that quality are better than popularity something that our modern government are terribly lacking. Both systems can also evolve around some form of inheritance ( transmission of knowledge and experience from father to son, oriented education from birth to hold the high position of society). In Democracy, the system is also build on belief, the popular belief of the majority be it wrong.
3. Ruling does not have the same morality as others, often the rulers has to take decisions that are the most immoral one can take because of it.

** Enforce a proper division of power, there is absolutely no reason the minister or his undersecretary should have any control over who dementors attack/kiss. Theres probably a hell of a lot more, but fanon/canon is kinda blurred in my head by now, and canon was never really clear how anything works to begin with.

** 1. Fire Fudge

2. Investigate everyone that was suspected as a death eater in the last war. If you were 'Under the Imperious,' then you shouldn't have any issues answering some questions under truth potion. If you decline, that's okay, but you can't work here. Also, if you have a dark mark, you're out. Again, if you decline to prove yourself, we will accept your resignation.

3. Revamp security. The fact that a group of 14 and 15 year Olds was able to just walk right in and make their way to the most top secret area of the ministry does not inspire hope.

4. Mental health checks. Why? Waldin McNair, Umbridge, Runcorn, Barty Crouch Sr., Fudge... The list goes on.

5. In war times, oaths that you are not attempting, or associated with groups attempting to, or planning to attempt to overthrow or undermine the ministry or the DMLE.
