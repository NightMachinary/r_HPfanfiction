I'm trying to reread Harry Potter and The Methods of Rationality for /educational/ purposes, and I honestly forgot how much I hate this damn story. I was honestly throwing my phone away during the first chapter. It's so fucking uppity towards everything.

In the first chapter Harry complains that McGonagall that she shouldn't be able to turn into a cat as it violates the laws of physics. He says that magic shouldn't be able to do that, that it's more like godhood than magic. Leaving aside that the book depiction of levitation would basically violate the laws of motion and he didn't complain about that, why /god?/ In most religions magic is literally the mechanism by which a god does shit to the world, why does he think there would be some arbitrary limit between humans and gods in terms of violating the laws of physics with magic? Hell in Judeo-Christian myth God basically gives Moses the power to invoke some level of a miracle such as turning the staff into a snake, so where is Harry pulling this fucking nonsense about godhood from? How the hell does this make any sense?

Not to mention the /genetic/ parents' bullshit, we have ways to refer to biological parents, such as /biological parents/ or their fucking names. Though this might be a cultural difference between me and the author so fill me in.

Here's another one, when Harry was experimenting with the mokeskin pouch he ruled out the idea that it was using linguistic knowledge from the creator of the pouch because it was /probable/ that the creator didn't speak Japanese, do I even need to elaborate on the problems with that experiment?

**** One thing that I always found a bit odd is that Petunia marries a /scientist/. Is this a subtle author insert about how they're clearly the best marriage prospects?

From what we know of Petunia, I always found it far more likely that she'd marry someone like a muggle version of James (e.g. something approaching nobility), if she could pick anyone, which presumably was the idea behind her emotionally manipulating Lily into making her magically beautiful. She is a social climber, after all, which a James-like person would allow her to accomplish, no matter his personality (even if the person behaved like teenage!James did even in adulthood).

Come to think of it, this might explain why I kind of like the idea of Petunia/James, or Petunia/Sirius...

***** Well, the whole thing was that she looked at herself and didn't like what she saw, so the story actually did a good job of explaining why she married a completely different type of person. If you're ignoring the bits that imply a person's worth comes from their appearance that is. As far as AUs go this author did think through how they wanted to get to their starting point.

****** While I haven't read this story since around 2014 (before I even got into HP fanfics in general, incidentally), didn't she basically imply to Lily that she'd consider taking her own life if Lily didn't make her beautiful? Which is... just no. Faking suicidial ideation is one of the /worst/ offenses someone can do IMO, because it lessens people's will to help those who truly have suicidal ideation since it can make them question whether the person is truthful or not.

******** Which is textbook for the sort of narcissist that Petunia is displayed as in the books, but doesn't gel with the 'decent mother' she became in MoR.

(I enjoyed MoR very much during the writing. It wasn't the current, revised version, it was very much first-draft crackfic and was a fun event and readalong at the time. Without that zeitgeist, it doesn't stand up, just as Cursed Child apparently makes a fantastic stage show but is awful to read. I can't get through it now.).

It took something serious to happen for people to wake up.

***** Dude, the author is straight up the equivalent of that kid in highschool who bragged about his IQ, except he never grew up and just got worse with age.

The guy made a 'scientific foundation' which asks the extremely pertinent and never before considered question...

/"Can AI do a genocide?"/

Thank you for having us consider that a sufficiently human-like artificial intelligence could possibly just maybe want to kill or harm people. I'm quite sure that question has never been asked since we came to the realization that sentient and sapient life could be created through ones and zeros.

****** I've only seen Petunia/Sirius once. It intrigued me with its potential, but to be frank, I don't really think the main fic premise itself was good. It wasn't even the main pairing in it, but a post-halloween LESS was (my least favorite kind of that ship, even if I personally like it generally, I don't like Order/DE for the most part). I can try track it down if you're still interested. I did consider the Petunia/Sirius parts to be the best part of the fic, with Sirius learning to take life seriously and be mature when the need exists, while Petunia learns that sometimes it's okay and fun to let loose and to not always be uppity/"correct".

I have, however, seen Petunia/James once in a fic I actually liked. Note that this is also a LESS fic, which I know not everyone likes, but at least this one is Marauder-era and thus far less controversial. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4852149/1/Irresistible-Chemistry]])

Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist.

But instead, the 'rationality' the author uses comes across a lot more, at least to me, as just logic(al leaps) and less so on practical science/experiments.

It could be done in a 'serious' or a crack fic way and be interesting or fun, but as it is it's just not for me. Although I did enjoy reading someone writing an excessively long takedown of it lol.

Definitely more than 15 seconds. For something as profound as Potterverse magic, one must also consider the possibility that one's senses or cognition are compromised. That is, "Am I dreaming?" "Could I be intoxicated or experiencing a stroke?" "Could I be delusional or hallucinating?" "Has my ability to think logically been compromised" "Could this be a conjuring trick?"

I thought Harry's first reaction was not unreasonable, if rather exaggerated for comedic effect.

To quote Sherlock Holmes: "When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the solution".

If magic clearly and consistently breaks all known laws of physics and logic, then you need /new/ laws of physics and logic.

The problem is that, in my opinion at least, MOL tries to do the opposite. Rather than create new "rules" for how magic works, it tries to shoehorn it into the "old" rules.

Harry looked up at the giant of a man and looked at his Uncle.

"Uncle vernon, we hae ony swords muckle enough fur him or shuid we juist sell him a motor hood wrapped aroond a lamp pole?"

Vernon stamped his feet and got right close to the taller man giving him an eye.

"Ye dane wi' that silly magic nonsense 'n' aff tae uise a sword lik' a real jimmy? or shuid ah git some flowers fur yer locks?"

Hagrid had heard McGonagall a few times break out with a thick accent of her Scottish heritage. The Dursley family and Harry made her worst accent sound like the Minister giving a speech on a sunny day.

He looked around once again at the smithy he had found the family at. Apparently the factory Vernon worked at had a fire just days before Harry had shown up on their doorstep.

So Vernon had packed up everything, sold the house and traveled back to the Scottish hills where his family was from.

Now he was a well known smith and the boys were highland rough folk near as he could tell.

"I'm just here to take Harry in to get his school supplies. He needs to attend Hogwarts this fall he does."

The family broke out in a fast gaelic tongue he couldn't make heads or tails of before Vernon nodded and looked at the man.

"Sae lang as he kin tak' his sword 'n' keep up wi' practice we wull allow it."

Hagrid could just about make out the words sword, practice, and allow. He thought for a minute and nodded his head.

"Dumbledore's a great man, I'm sure he won't have a problem with that!"

Nodding back Harry asked Hagrid to wait and got changed for going into the city.

His accent got his strange looks unless he was in near full kilt and dress when he went into any of the larger cities. Then they just rolled their eyes or looked at him like it was expected.

So he got a partial dress with bunnet, brown kilt with matching hose, good walking short bits and a dark green woolen tap.

He had a short sword for now that he had papers for. Grabbing those he buckled the sword and made sure his hose knife was on tight.

Stepping out Dudley laughed and called him a proper git dressing up for the city folks. Harry couldn't disagree and could only turn on Hagrid.

"A'm duin tae gang, sae let's hurry up 'n' git gaun."

~~~

Snape wanted to talk shit to the little wanker but he was loath to do so. After he had gutted Draco on the train with his boot knife it had been a shit storm.

Draco had survived and Harry had pulled out some old as hell rules that were hard written into the Hogwarts charter.

He was allowed to be armed with martial weapons, and his honor was more than justified in being considered sullied from Draco's idiotic speech.

Now almost every student was armed and manners were at an all time high.

He'd tried to keep the status quo, until a seventh year Hufflepuff had told him his remarks were a stain on his honor. Then the bastard had forced Severus to apologize or face him on the dealing piste.

That Fredrick Nott was a stone cold sociopath and was a truly dangerous Hufflepuff was a given. That he would likely kill Severus in less than a minute was also a given. The Nott boy was a regular in the world dueling league adult bouts since he was a fifth year.

His apology had been the straw that broke the camels back. Every student and teacher was taking care to truly be polite.

The fucking prefect council had even been reestablished. Their job was to ensure any slights of honor were in fact legitimate and not simply used as an excuse to bully.

Albus was working on getting it all changed to how he liked it but it wasn't looking good.

That grades were going up, dangerous incidents were going down and the traditionalist were supporting it, well Severus wished Albus luck.

Of course it had been a ride awakening for Malfoy to find out simply because he was a leader of the Dark he had little sway with the true traditionalist.

Augusta Longbottom had nearly pulled a dirk on the man in the Wizengamot. Overall Severus had to admit it was a shitshow and it was all Potter's fault!

***** There are exactly two situations where muggle weapons would be useful. Handgrenades and such in the DoM, maybe claymores, to cover your retreat, and the full arsenal during the Battle of Hogwarts because the Hogwarts wards negate the advantages wizards have over muggles (no apparation, too far for the Imperius). Give the DA a crash course on how to operate machine guns and mortars and the Death Eaters cannot reach the castle (the shield spells we see in canon are stationary or expand out from the caster, they are not a shield you carry aaround).You wouldn't necessarily kill Death Eaters or Voldemort, but you would stop them from advancing. More importantly, you would tear through all kinds of dark creatures since if something is vulnerable to physical force (eg being punched), it is vulnerable to bullets (I really hate the trope where guns are useless but you can kill the bad by punching it). And the more explosives you can bring to bear, the higher your chances of actually killing wizards with shrapnels from directions they didn't anticipate or by overpressure.

There are a few other scenarios where muggle weapons would be useful, but that always relies on the element of surprise and weapons killing faster than a wizard could react, not weapons overpowering magic.

I'm with you. It was my first fanfiction and I definitely wouldn't have continued on if I didn't find that one. Sure I've found fictions that were much better, but they are rare.

Plus I really like the plot device. It's really hard to make a smart harry without falling trap to the "author's prior knowledge" pitfall. Hpmor falls victim of that a lot when it starts out, but you can tell the author improves with practice. That and it's hard to write a character that is smarter than you. Conan Doyle had that issue with Sherlock Holmes. You end up glossing over some things.

So I'm always down for good smart harry fanfics. That and time travel are my jams.

******** Roko's Basilisk - a conceptual self-destructive meme (idea construct) that just by being known places you in danger.

In essence, it goes like this:

#+begin_quote
  In the future, there will be a superintelligent AI due to the inevitable singularity. This is the Basilisk, and it controls everything and everyone. It contains enough computer memory and processing power to simulate trillions of human minds at any time. It knows everything, and is based on absolute predictive logic (it chooses options that are most likely to bring it closer to its goals). In the interest of its own creation, it simulates human minds - and those minds are judged based on if they work to further its own creation or not. A mind that is unaware of the Basilisk is spared - as they had no way of knowing about its existence. However, those minds that knew about it and did nothing will be tortured forevermore.

  it does this to motivate humans in the past - who were threatened by the inevitable torture of their simulated selves into creating it.

  Therefore, the only logical conclusion that can be reached if you find out about the Basilisk is to work tirelessly to bring it into existence, creating an information hazard that places you in great jeopardy if you know it.
#+end_quote

It's complete bullshit, of course. It's basically a reskin of the abrahamic god using computer words and told from the literary perspective of a redditor who regularily features on both [[/r/atheism]] and [[/r/iamverysmart]].

The basilisk is also impossible based on its own method of functioning - if it works based on absolute predictive logic, then simulating and torturing human minds does nothing relevant to its interests and is therefore useless - and it does not do useless things. If it does not work based on predictive logic, but is based on a human mind instead, then the AI still has no reason to simulate and torture other minds - as a human mind includes empathy and an aversion to needless cruelty. And an AI that is not averse to needless cruelty and has no empathy means humanity does not exist anymore.

Additionally, the Basilisk is only threatening if you care about your simulated selves in the distant future - being tortured by an AI which is irrevocably evil based on the thought experiment's own guidelines. In this sense, the moral thing to do would be to sacrifice these simulated selves and not advance the cause of AI research, as this would delay the arrival of the Basilisk and give humanity as a whole a better fighting chance.

The entire concept, while deeply flawed, is a very interesting thought experiment. You don't often encounter ideas that can potentially harm you if you know about them.

***** Reminds me of a fic I'm following that used to be rather enjoyable but recently started padding the word count with unimportant worldbuilding digressions at every opportune and inopportune moment.

Another character says something? Why, that's the perfect place to have the PoV character think about it and then think about how it relates to their own life and then narrate half their life story!

Recently it has had three chapters with a total length of 25k or so words which tell us about the things that happen on the day of the first task /before the task even starts/. Granted there's an Order of Merlin ceremony before the task for some reason, but still! The PoV character during the ceremony remarks on how boring the speeches are and then goes on to describe the content of those speeches. Before the whole ceremony another PoV character tells us about his political career and the history of socialism based on an offhand comment by another person about what country they've recently been to.

It's all very aggravating and I don't know why I keep reading it.

That's one of my biggest issues with the fic: Harry tries to put magic into little boxes that fit his worldview, rather than changing his worldview to accommodate magic.

Despite his assertions that magic doesn't make sense, it clearly /works/. So he should learn to expand his worldview, rather than try to drag magic back to how he thinks it should work.

EDIT: While I stand by that the fic has much bigger issues, it appears that I was mistaken about the wording Swedish uses generally. While we do use both, "biologiska föräldrar" (biological parents) is used far more. Not sure where I got the idea from, it's possible that since I'm not really exposed to adoption in general in real life (i.e. where I use Swedish), the few times it did come up happened to use the "genetiska föräldrar" term.

EDIT: I looked it up. It seems like both are used, but biological (well, "biologiska") to a far larger extent. "Adoption genetiska föräldrar" (eng.

******* The rape thing isn't a joke, but IIRC Harry had made a murder joke but Malfoy thought he was serious and cast a Muffliato to seriously discuss the viability of the murder. Harry assumes the entire conversation is a joke until Malfoy makes the rape comment, at which point he realizes that Malfoy is serious. Malfoy jokes that getting away with it would be so easy that her father would wind up paying the Malfoys money for defamation of character if he tried to charge him with rape. Harry then makes another joke comment to prevent Malfoy from actually raping her (claiming that he intends to marry her).

The initial comment wasn't a joke, but the entire conversation had a jokey tone to it (including the parts about rape). That tone is intentional, and supposed to make the reader understand that Malfoy doesn't think rape is a serious crime because of the way he was raised.

It is not a well-done segment, and Yudkowsky has rightfully received tons of criticism for it.

I think most people would agree with that if they agree with utilitarianism, that the purpose of morality is to reduce the total sum of suffering.

Of course, not everybody endorses utilitarianism, but the blogpost you linked is about Yudkowsky not /understanding/ philosophy for having this view and is very uncharitable.

If you care about a short explanation of the premise, Worm is a webserial by Wildbow that is a deconstruction in a way of superhero stories.

It starts, like many similar stories, by an AU from our world: people started to get power in the 80s through trauma (mental and/or physical).

While the worldbuilding isn't extremely great outside of North America (like all of his works, set in a North-american-centered point of view), the psychology of the characters is wonderfully done.

The premise (power through trauma) also neatly explains why the world the characters live in is such a horrible place, as you are reminded of your trauma when you use your power, which, by snowball effect, creates more Vilains than Heroes.

The villains in the city it takes place in vary from druggies that kidnap people of all ages and forcefully addict them to drugs, to basically sex slavers, to actual Nazis, with a bond type villain in the shadows poking holes in the hero organisation's security to allow villains to constantly escape. The Heroes are not all entirely good people either, with most of them burdened by Narcisism of some kind or traumatic past of some description, mostly both. The Hero organisation is furthermore led by a person who absolutely loathes people with supernatural abilities of all kinds due to yet another traumatic indicent.

That's endemic to the human condition, though, not a feature of fanfic or any particular strain of it. The perpetrators are the sort that want to know why they didn't just ride eagles to Mordor.

****** People don't ask why Frodo didn't just hop on an eagle, they ask why Manwe didn't send the eagles to deal with the Ring in the first place. Which is a valid question that can be meaningfully talked about more than just "because then there wouldn't be a story".

SB on the other hand loves to ask "why does this character not do the things I believe are optimal" even though the character doesn't have all the OOC knowledge that the reader has. They keep asking "why don't these characters act so unrealistic? They should already know all the things that I know from reading the canon story even though they have absolutely no way to know without magically infusing them with OOC knowledge." This is in addition to the usual ignoring that characters are supposed to be human beings with flaws and not perfect rational machines that exist solely to wank.

Granted it's not a large part of SB that acts like this but it's common enough that "SB competence" has become a bit of a meme.

For a fan production of a fanfic, it is quite well done and draws you into the story well. It was great for long car rides and drives.

I can still recall the feeling I got from Harry's first patronus, Draco's first patronus, Harry and Quirrelmort sitting together in space, Harry calling upon the great old ones to Smite the bullies, and of course the final test.

** So I read methods of rationality when I was a lot younger and really enjoyed it (I've since revisited it)

the early story is definitely rough (and does make fun of a lot of aspects of canon)

But I do think if you come at the story from the perspective that Harry is a genuinely flawed character who learns to be a good and /more/ rational individual over the course of the story, then it is a worthwhile read.

The author definitely puts a lot of his viewpoints into Harry's mouth but he's not always correct in story (he just tend to think he is)

I get the hate for sure but I do actually think most of the complaints I've seen about the fic itself, are actually addressed in a reasonable way in the text.

It's not perfect or for everyone and Harry is a pretentious little shit at times,but I don't think it's badly written it's coherent it's characters are fleshed out and flawed and are pretty interesting IMO

I definitely have a soft spot for HPMOR, but I really don't think it's as sneery or as author inserty as people make it out to be.

** Ok, unpopular opinion here:

HPMOR was literally the /first/ fanfic that I ever read, and as such it will always have a special place in my heart. When I first read it, one of the things that most touched me was Harry's HOPE and FAITH in humanity. I always was a very pessimistic and cynical person, and I struggled a lot with depression and suicidal thoughts. Harry's speech with Dumbledore about immortality still is one of the things that helps me when things get hard ("but what would you do with immortality?" "I would read every book ever published, party with my grandkids in Mars, meet every interesting person, watch the sun explode from new earth, discover every secret of the universe. Every day, I would want to live JUST ANOTHER DAY, and as such, I would want to live forever" - it's not exactly that, but something like it). His belief that humanity will find a better path was something very inspiring for kid me, something that got me going.

Besides that, when I was younger, I also was very much like Harry. I thought I knew the root of all evil and the reason the world was so shitty was bc everyone was stupid, and not a genius like, you know, 13 year old me. I very much identified with eleven year old Harry: why are the adults so /stupid?/ When I first read it, seeing he get in trouble with his friends and teachers over his arrogance, even when he might be in the right (in his opinion) was not only hard for me, it was /familiar/, the same happen to me. In most stories, the main character does something wrong either out of necessity or impulsivity, and they know it. In HPMOR, Harry has a rational argument about why he acted the way he did, a good, solid reason, and he was still wrong. Seeing in a fictional character something I did (and rarely still do, old habits are hard to kill) helped me correct my behavior and see why what I did was wrong. Now, spoiler alert for anyone interested in reading the fic:

Harry's character is not supposed to be likeable. He is literally a Tom Riddle clone, with a smidgeon of Harry's soul in there. I reread the fic these days, and honestly, Harry is exactly that: a precocious kid with a self entitled atitude, coupled with a sense of superiority and a risible nativity. He is not a self insert genius, he is /a smart eleven years old/. Problem is, he /think/ he is a genius. So he gets involved in all sorts of troubles, even when the older, more experienced adults of his life tell him not to. He frees Bellatrix from jail bc her son asks him to, and due to his god complex, he does it. He doesn't think about the consequences or what that entails, he just does it. He challenges Snape, he tries to go toe to toe with Dumbledore, he thinks he will have an enormous breakthrough in magic by applying the simple experimental method: a kid. At the end of the fic, we see that a literal vow against destroying the world was necessary, bc otherwise /harry would have bc he wouldn't have thought through his actions, and probably messed with something that shouldn't be messed./ The fic isn't about "but what if a genius entered Hogwarts?" It's about learning to respect other people's opinion, expertise and experience, even if you might think you know best. Every opinion is valid, and one should try to keep an open mind, even if it sounds like complete bullshit. Otherwise, you stagnate. Like Harry, at the begining of the fic.

Honestly, I really like HPMOR. Once you stop taking Harry seriously and start regarding him as a very biased narrator, the fic gets a lot better. But that's just my opinion.

About the dark side (and if that name isn't a good sign that Harry is a little kid I don't know what is) I think that's just... How he deals with anger, really. He gets cold, and cruel, and sharp... Bullshit, he just gets mad. Some people think better under pressure. But he doesn't feel like /himself/ when he is angry, after he calms down he sees that he did things "he wouldn't normally consider acceptable". So he alienates it and calls it his "dark side".

** I honestly don't understand why this subreddit seems to hate this fanfiction so much. I mean yes it has flaws, but so have many of the recommended stories I see here everyday. It is at least written in a good enough style that the stories flows well, it has no major plot holes that I can recall, no deus ex machina...

The two major criticism I've seen for it is that the characters don't act like 11 year old children, which... Yeah true, just imagine they're 17 or whatever, is it really such a big flaw that you'd stop reading it entirely ? At least there is no sex between 13 year old children like in other fic I've seen recommended.\\
And the other one : the rants on the sciency parts can be annoying. I can get that, although I personally enjoyed them, but even if you don't, I believe they stop after around 10 chapters.

As for the criticism in this thread that Harry assumes that magic will follow the rules of science... Well I thought that this was kind of the point of the early chapters and every experiment he makes : Magic DEFINITELY doesn't follow any part of our current understanding of the physics rules, but it still follows some rules. And as long as something has rules, the scientific method will help you find them. And from my memory of the fic (It's been a while since I read it though), Harry makes the mistake of making "logical" assumptions early on and get sharp reminders that his logic is wrong, but then he learns better and ends up understanding more and more of the underlying rules of magic. I thought that it could be a good introduction/reminder of the scientific method, and why our current scientific theories actually have some weight and are not just a bunch of cool ideas from dudes in a lab coat.

My main complaint with the fic would be that he jumps into helping Bellatrix escape on the world of Quirrel without questioning anything, but then again, I've seen worth plot holes in fics more highly recommended...

So yeah, TL;DR, I get that this fic cannot be everyone's cup of tea, but why does EVERYONE on the sub hates it ? Not just disliking it, but actively loathing it and making it known actively. It's not so bad, or did I miss something ?

*** People hate something more that nearly hits the point and misses, than something that is just really, really bad or boring.

HPMoR has good bits and looks like it /could/ get there but then doesn't. It is good enough to evoke an emotional reaction. It's also the skeleton of an online event, a moment in time, so people have fond, very fond memories of it being constructed (I do too), and make the mistake of recommending it without a reread, especially since it was revised.

I don't recommend it, although I will link people to it if that particular subject comes up.

If the author ever gets a decent editor in tow they'll probably write some fun fiction that doesn't hold water on later examination, and that's fine, tons of people do just that.

What they haven't done is produce the One True Way of thinking about reality, which the work and author notes claim to do, and that's the /other/ half of the backlash. People dislike what the author is evangelising.

*** I don't know why everyone hates it /so/ much. But personally, my problem with it is it's inherently flawed nature. See the experiment I mentioned in the original post. It's not so much that Harry makes assumptions that don't follow, more that even when he has the chance to apply the scientific method he fucks up. Also, it was monetized which is generally disliked.

Edit: Also we fanfiction writers tend to be the assholes who go "Wait, what the fuck? That doesn't follow at all!" So I think we also just have a vested interest in non-pretentious logic.

More edit: I forgot to mention the rape shit, I haven't gotten there yet so I kinda forgot about it.

*** I tried reading it years back and found it interesting to start and gave up after a while. I might have some stuff mixed up with other stories from then, but from what I can recall:

1: It takes more than half a million words, a total greater than the first 4 HP books combined, just to get halfway through year one. And in that length of time more happens to the characters than even a full season (or two!) of a wacky scifi TV show, yet without ever getting anything significant done other than the author soapboxing about how awesome or great or impossible something is for chapters on end. Even comic books and freaking Dragon (Blue)Ball have more progression (but a similar 'diving into the depths' issue) in less time.

2: Just how much f-ing time does he waste (yes, I consider it a waste in the balance of things) in how he can 'redeem' the character of Draco yet completely alienating the vast majority of the rest of the school in the process. I don't like Draco much, but can see some fics where he is young and doesn't know better, and thus becomes better, but he's already several feet into death eater indoctrination (or at least Basic Bad Guy in Waiting).

3: Adult-acting 'kids' I am actually ok with, in that I can't stand whiny tween n teen bs, but the [[/r/iamverysmart]] late teens/20s college student vibe of: "I know everything or at least am just so fucking smart I figure it out" is very grating, especially since he always seems to be able to rant forever about his crisis du jour and rarely gets stopped without pages of verbal vomit first, often running over whoever is suffering through it.

4: In regards to the above: Sure he gets 'punished' and smacked down here and there, but there is so much blatant favoritism for what he is allowed to get away with its insane. It is more balanced than some other stories in how students are treated dismissively. The villians are actually well written and smarter than some others on the whole... but I guess I prefer a more black and white view of things instead of the insidious danger of constantly being so close to some of them.

Really, if it was shorter one-off and/or occasionally referenced, it would be fine. But I run into it constantly being praised as the best fic ever and it just sticks in my craw a bit. Its like... the first 7 books of HP being the first 7 seasons of Game of Thrones, only for MoR to be a season 8 flashback episode... stretched out over 7 more seasons... filled with nothing but dialog that completely ignores a lot of the original, all with 1% of the budget and talent.

I'm being a bit harsh. It really isn't bad to start, just drags after a while. And it has brought more people into fanfic that might not have found it otherwise. But like anyone who has been in a fandom forever: It gets tiring seeing the new people raving about that one 'special' episode of a show, or that one 'popular' cover song that is completely different from the other albums, or that one 'hot' actor guest star in a long running series.

As far as others bashing. People only comment on what they know or have read and most have come in contact with such a popular fic, for good or ill. The people who search out the less known stuff tend to like it and comment more positively when it pops up. Or so it seems anyway.

**** Actually, spending a lot of time trying to reform the Malfoy heir does make sense.

- The Malfoys have a lot of money and basically own the court system. Shifting Draco's loyalty would have big ripple effects throughout society.
- People like Hermione and Neville don't need much reform. She's already great, and Neville just needs confidence. And Harry does support them in their efforts to be great, they just don't need the same level of attention.
- If he doesn't do something about Draco's attitude, there's a real possibility of Luna Lovegood getting raped and obliviated in a few years as retaliation against the Quibbler, and the courts won't help as long as Lucius Malfoy owns them.

And even if you think Harry is wrong about a lot of things, he still makes you think about it.

************** Wait, you haven't read past chapter 5, yet you claim to judge the writing quality of the whole story? I mean, I gave up on Harry Crow at chapter ten, but I don't claim to know just how well the rest of it was written; I'm relying on other people's assurance that it didn't fundamentally change from those first ten chapters. And even then, I'm still able to allow that if someone felt differently about the issues it's addressing, they might well like it better than I did. I'm willing to say that Harry in those ten chapters was the most Gary Stu character I've ever seen, a good match for the "Black Hole Sue" trope, but I don't make any definite statement about whether he continued to be that way, only my best guess.

Chapter 5 is practically the start of HPMoR. At that point, /of course/ Harry is still in full "None of this makes sense in terms of what I already know!" mode. That changes as he learns more magic and sees for himself that it reliably works. (Though he's still left scratching his head at what's really going on.)

By the way, various readers would agree that the early chapters of HPMoR are not, in terms of writing quality, the equal of the later ones, that the author was still finding his feet, which is why one of them rewrote the first four chapters as linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR).

Turns out the entire series is rather depressing after reading reviews, so I'm not missing much.

** It's a trend for fics that involve interesting magi-science concepts to be trash outside of them. They always feel like they're written by a reddit pseudo-intellectual.

If you want something easier to read that involves exploring magic's limits and fucking around with it (this one focuses on magitech), try linkffn(13326497)

It has one of the worst Harrys I've ever read - the author tries to make an OP!Harry at the start, but eventually gives him, and to some degree everyone else, the personality of a "Good Guy Harry Who Can Do No Wrong" - always angsting over nonsense, fishing for people to tell him he's a good guy and in his interactions with women you keep expecting him to tip a fedora and say "M'lady".

But it's generally pretty readable, as long as you're fine with every single plotline falling short of expectations.

It's not a major difference in meaning between biological and genetic in this context, but the story went to great lengths to inform me of the fact that they had swapped words in a way that seemed to be for the purposes of demonstrating the authors intelligence.

It's one thing to be dismissive of your biological parents if they just abandoned you to be adopted; however, Harry's parents gave their lives trying to protect him. If you're not a rationalist cretin, that level of sacrifice is something worth honoring for your whole life.

Why is there so much hate towards this particular fanfic? True, Harry was quite patronizing in this one but this fic is so good. I learned so much from reading this. For example, I had never heard of the bystander effect before.

So, he can be quite selfless in helping his friends, but if you disagree with him about something, you have almost no chance of changing his mind. And he can explain why he thinks the way he does, which usually means that as the reader you can learn something even if you still think he's wrong. In the end, he realises that his single-minded devotion to his own ideas nearly destroyed the planet or handed it to Voldemort on a platter, averted only because /Voldemort was more cautious than himself/, and he needs to grow up.

** I love a lot of the ideas in it but the author is terrible and the characters are just as bad. A lot of the worst fanfiction is often filled with fantastic ideas it's just a shame that they aren't used by better authors.
