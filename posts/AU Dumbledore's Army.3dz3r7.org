Hey all!

I'm looking for fics where Harry turns the DA into an actual fighting force, more a quasi-military group than just a once-weekly club. I love fics where Harry actually acts like a leader, something like in "Taking Control by fake a smile".

Obviously, these fics tend to be AU in nature. I'm NOT looking for anything like the well-known "Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness"; In particularly, I really want it to be Harry taking charge, teaching and leading the DA.

Thanks in advance!

** There's All is Good in Love and War, which may be what you're looking for. Not one of my favorites, but decent all around.

linkffn(All is Good in Love and War)

Edit: Sorry, that should have been Art of War, not the one mentioned above. I'm not sure why the bot linked to the wrong fic for the first one, maybe it sees the title and assumes you meant "fair" instead of "good" but that would depend on how it's programmed. Anyway this is hopefully the correct link. linkffn(Art of War)

** Found one that would perhaps suit your needs:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5137052/1/Harry-Potter-s-Army-A-General-s-Lament][Harry Potter's Army: A General's Lament by Sharptooth]]. I read it years ago and from memory it was quite good and features a rare pairing of Harry/Padma.
