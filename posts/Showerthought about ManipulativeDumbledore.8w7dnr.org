More of a loo thought but-

The lynchpin of the whole series - the prophecy - was...kinda given straight to Albus. I don't necessarily like the trope partially because I never see it done with any amount of believability, but I pause at remembering that Dumbledore was the one who the prophecy was given to.

It could be used to give more context to why Albus's hand was so deep in attempting to meddle with the prophecy. He was the one who heard it after all.


** See the thing about this is it doesn't really seem all that manipulative. Sure, Dumbledore in the last book was incredibly savvy to predict things out. Other than that though, if he were pulling all the strings, he must have a bunch of broken fingers.

You want to hear real manipulative Dumbledore? What if there never was a prophecy, and he planted the memory in Snape's head so Voldemort would attack a newborn child in the hopes of triggering the love/sacrifice magic? And he deliberately made it more likely for the Potters and Longbottoms to be found, which is why they ended up as orphans?

Thats not that impossible to swing with 1) Magic wielded by the most power wizard with the most powerful wand and 2) a good understanding of Voldemort's character on a personal level. Compared to this, it makes Dumbledore in canon look like the most "hands-off" teacher in history (pun intended).

*** Also someone who is manipulative generally has goals. Dumbledore's only goal seemed to be to coast through life and die alone and Voldemort's bullshit put a real crimp on that.

A manipulative Dumbledore probably wouldn't be headmaster of Hogwarts. He'd be leveraging his position as Chief Warlock to engage in more global politics and spend most of his time doing that.

**** I would disagree. What better way to control (future) society through its youth? Even Hitler understood this. Due to the slow aging, many generations would view Albus as first and foremost Headmaster, his former students would likely still at least partially defer to him.

Summary: Headmaster is a more powerful position than you think.

***** Not to mention its not really clear in canon /how powerful his other positions are/. By all accounts, it appears that Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump are largely ceremonial positions rather than owning any significant authority.

Conversely, as Headmaster he has educated in one form or another the overwhelming majority of the British population for seven consecutive years. So everyone knows him and forms an opinion about him, but he has the opportunity to watch and see who will be a mover and shaker and who will be sheep.

Furthermore, Hogwarts is also seemingly the most defensible position in Britain. As long as he is there, effectively the magical community can never be overthrown (much like during Grindelwald's War). Dumbledore, like Voldemort and probably Grindelwald, are the equivalent of tactical nukes; you can only really oppose them by having your own or using subterfuge to achieve your goals (read: the Imperius Curse).

****** it doesn't matter if the position is ceremonial as long as people listen to you, value who you are and what you say and do, and more importantly back your plans.

look at the modern Priest scandals and notice how they are not in jail so much of the time. society chooses to let them get away with it because they are holy men of a church.

take a look at Asari Justicars for a fictional account on a ceremonial position. they can basically go anywhere and kill anyone and every other Asari will let them do that despite having no official position in their government. they're basically murder hobos and the Asari are okay with that because of their historical significance.

******* I wouldn't use fictional examples to try and prove your point. Conversely, allow me to provide my own: Tony Blair as special Peace Envoy to the Middle East at the UN.

A ceremonial position for a /very/ manipulative individual, and the most he's done in years is collect his salary and whinge about Brexit/Corbyn/UK Government in general. Ceremonial positions in /politics/ often have very little direct power - I agree that if people value your views and beliefs as an individual then you can absolutely create power in a ceremonial position, but that power is a silhouette of actual political clout.

Hitler didn't take up a teaching position because that's not how a master manipulator goes about subverting the youth while still having time to do everything else he does. He appoints minions to do that for him.

** This is from one of my own stories, where characters try to convince Hermione that Dumbledore is a Manipulative and not-so-good Leader of the Light Persona. This is basically what I think about Manipulative Dumbledore. Some of the stuff discussed is AU, (such as in my story, Harry's parents are alive, and Sirius was never in Azkaban (Director Black is Amelia Bones, Sirius' wife) and "Eli" is Sirius' son, and "Rose" is Harry's sister) but it still stands as a point.

  “I suppose I overlooked Professor Dumbledore's reactions to Mrs. Norris' Petrification, and the writing on the wall regarding the Chamber of Secrets. How he had prevented owls from taking messages out from the castle. How he had initially refused DMLE inclusion to the investigation and said he and the Professors could handle it. I guess... I guess I hoped it was a one-time thing.”

  “An old man's mistake, perhaps?” Daphne asked.

  Hermione stared at Daphne. “That sounds like a quote.”

  “Because it is,” Daphne said. “My father says it is Dumbledore's favorite line when people point out any mistake he makes. I imagine Lord Potter, Lord Black and Director Black are going to be meeting with Dumbledore about the Tournament, and security. They'll point out all the flaws we heard today. Flaws that he seemed to ignore, because remember -- most, if not all, of the decisions made regarding the Tournament -- before today -- were to apparently be met with his approval. Not the Magical Games and Sports, not Minister Fudge. Albus Dumbledore's approval. How long before Dumbledore blames these flaws on 'an old man's mistake'?”

  “After the first flaw is pointed out?” Dora replied, with a snort.

  “Probably,” Harry scoffed.

  Hermione frowned as she looked at Harry. Harry knew exactly what she was thinking about.

  “It is hard to hear bad things about a man you look up to, isn't it?” Harry asked her, “You told me once that when you were introduced to our society, you read about Albus Dumbledore, the 'Leader of the Light'. A book that obviously painted a very nice picture of him. How he is a most revered man. How he's the only one Voldemort ever feared. He's the longest Headmaster of the most prestigious school in Europe, although most who say that are usually biased toward Hogwarts. And then there is the fact that he holds three prestigious positions.”

  Tracey snorted. “Notice how each of those three positions allows him influence over specific portions of our society. Hogwarts -- the children of the British wizarding society, who become the future of said society. Oh, and let's not forget that as Headmaster, it is usually his job to hire and fire Professors. I can think of a number of Professors who should be fired for a lack of either teaching prowess, or a shoddy curriculum. And yet, he doesn't fire anybody -- even the DADA Professors who last one year don't get fired. Resignation is the least of their fates! I won't even get started on his behavior toward bullies.”

  “And how many of those bullies are in your House?” Eli asked, raising an eyebrow.

  “I never said there weren't any bullies in Slytherin, Black,” Tracey said; “I admit they're the worst ones of the bunch, because Dumbledore's constant slap-on-the-wrist, 'I am disappointed in you, but I'm willing to give you another chance.' behavior goes absolutely bloody nowhere! 'Another chance' paves way to another, and they are seemingly infinite! So the bullies know they can probably get away with it, because -- frankly -- Dumbledore has never expelled anybody.”

  “The Wizengamot,” Daphne said, “as Chief Warlock, Dumbledore's influence and 'Leader of the Light' title, gives him a lot of respect inside the Wizengamot Council. His opinion counts amongst those who respect him. He has a lot of influence in laws being made.”

  “Supreme Mugwump in the ICW,” Dora said, “He is Britain's sole representative inside the ICW. Not the Minister of Magic. Albus Dumbledore. Which means anyone who wants something said to the ICW must go through him. What do you think Dumbledore would do, Hermione, if he didn't like the proposals or suggestions being given to him to pass to the ICW?”

  Hermione frowned. “He wouldn't even voice those proposals or suggestions!”

  “Correct,” Dora said, “Therefore...”

  “It is only his voice and his decisions and suggestions that represent Britain in the ICW!” Hermione concluded.”

  “Precisely,” Tracey snorted. “Three positions of power. At least two of which he needs to resign from because he has way too much power and influence for one man to hold.”

  “What was that Muggle phrase, Hermione?” Daphne asked. “Absolute power...”

  “... corrupts absolutely,” Hermione finished. “Yeah, I can see what you all mean. I just suppose, before now, I believed his mistakes were minimal and far in between. But all I've heard today concerning the Tournament -- he wants students to be hostages?! Students he is supposed to protect?!”

  “Don't forget they'd likely be kidnapped in the middle of the night,” Rose said, “and wouldn't know what was going on until after the task was over.”

  “Yep,” Susan said, “And then my Auntie would swoop in and arrest the old man for kidnapping.”

  “Except he'd likely get away with a slap on the wrist,” Tracey said, “Because he's so powerful and popular. His defense? Simple. 'I made a simple mistake that I'm sure all of you would make... oh, and let's not forget, I am the Leader of the Light. I'm allowed to make mistakes because I'm so important in my duties.' He would get a simple hearing with the minimal eleven Wizengamot members to judge him. He'll work his magic, and the majority of those who will be representing his hearing will be people who either owe favors to him, or are friendly to the old man. Result? Wrist slapped, he's back on his throne in the Great Hall for breakfast the morning after the second task.”
