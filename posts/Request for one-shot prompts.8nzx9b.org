I've been having a lot of trouble with my long fanfic project. I think part of this is just that I went away from writing for a while and I just need to do more, even if it isn't my main project. Does anyone have little prompts that they'd like to see written (they can be funny, cute, scary, I am not too fussed) that can be suggested for the community to play around with?


** This is the real story behind Mrs. Norris and her tireless devotion to Filch.

Death comes to us all, true, but Seamus Finnegan's drunken debacle was truly a story for the ages.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Someone should have told Lily before she'd attempted cosmetic surgery on her childhood friend, Severus Snape.

Yet another crowning moment of awesome for Action Hero Dobby: This time, his mission is to prevent The Great Harry Potter from being trapped with a fellow student in the haunted broom closet on the 4th floor, the one from which the other House Elves say very scary moans can often be heard.

Hermione notices a second knob on her Time Turner. Curious, she gives it a quarter turn.

Crabbe and Goyle aren't as loyal of henchmen as they might seem. In fact, they've been playing a running joke on Malfoy for the past six years.

The world will rue the day when Susan Bones, bitter over her Aunt's murder, thought to weaponize Unicorn blood against the Death Eaters.

** It started with the head of the DMLE received a dosage of poly-juice by owl one day with a note that she needed to look into it most urgently.

2 brothel owners obtain some of harry's hair soon after he joins Hogwarts.\\
They were looking forward to making lots of galleons with this venture. But they are shocked that Harry body is so physically damaged and mistreated they anonymously tip off DMLE so he can get help.
