I'm getting tired of fics showing Hermione (at least at first) as having adults in authority and things written in a book being more or less the word of God. There has to be some stories where she's not a wallflower and just OWNS the fact that she's smart as hell but won't take anyone's grief about it. Basically I'm looking for a Hermione with a backbone to not be afraid of speaking her mind and lots of street smarts to compliment her book smarts.


** [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] almost has your desired Hermione. She still had her authority-worshipping phase, and almost paid with her life in Year 2. The story is a canon rewrite in a non-magical, sci-fi AU. The writing quality is high, the characters are nicely developed, and the plot is excellent.

Riddle was a genius scientist bent on aristocratic totalitarianism. He inherited large amount of resources as Lord Gaunt and enjoyed great support in the Ministry. He also developed several technologies that gave him huge advantages over his enemies, such as cloning, memory capsules (horcruxes), energy rifle (killing and torture curses), and mind control discs (imperius curse).

Dumbledore was a brilliant, manipulative, and ruthless strategist despised by many Ministry bureaucrats and marginalized due to his sexual orientation (remember [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing][Alan Turin]]). He dumped Harry at the Dursleys so he would not enjoy a comfortable childhood and could become a far more ruthless adult. He groomed the Boy-Who-Lived myth so that Harry could get away with lots of things in the future. He also setup Hermione and Euterpe Spinks (an OC with excellent abilities and connections) to be in Harry's House.

Weasleys (Wellesleys) were not that poor and all-loving big family. In fact, Ron's grandpa was the Duke of Wellington, and his grandma was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Wellesley,_Duchess_of_Wellington][Diane Wellesley]], Duchess of Wellington and a British intelligence officer, who foiled a bombing of her own wedding in 1944. Her portrayal in this story was rather negative. The change in Weasleys' background had a significant impact on Ron/Hermione relationship.

There was no prophecy. The 007 of that time, James Potter, got his hands on crucial Riddle technologies and was hunted down as a result. Pettigrew's treason led Riddle to their hideouts, and they were outgunned by Riddle's energy rifle. James, however, obtained a serum that gave its user immunity against energy rifle. Lily injected this serum into Harry, turned him into a carrier for Riddle's memory capsule, and also caused the energy beam to reflect on Riddle himself. The severely injured Riddle escaped and had to spend the next 13 years in a tank.

The kids in this story were far more intelligent and ruthless, having been trained in spy business from day one. For example, [[/spoiler][when the tournament took place in Year 4, they took precaution, rescued Harry from a tight spot (although Harry himself contributed a great deal too), and left behind a significant body count. In Year 5, Hermione played Umbridge for fool, lured her into septic tank twice, and got the toad chucked out of Hogwarts half way through the school year. In year 6, they figured out what the deal was between Dumbledore and Snape (the old KGB 'shoot your own spy, gain enemy's trust' trick), and pretty much wiped out the Death Eater invasion force. In year 7, they went on multiple ops, blew up multiple Riddle bases, and finally lured him into a death trap using Harry as the bait.]]

This fic has a total of 200 chapters, with only 58 devoted to first three years, but 97 to last two years. Year 7, which lasted in fact only 5 months, occupies a third of total chapters.

If you drop the requirement that HP fanfics must always involve magic, this is an excellent read.

"Cross-Purposes" has several short stories where the survivors of that cross-Dimension force track down the counterparts of their allies in their own universe, to recruit them.

The non-magical trio is set in the verse of "The Secret Return of Alex Mack", which is the largest story of the series.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** Hermione is a major character in all my HP stories, and generally strong and smart. A few stories might fit your request well. All are AUs.

"Harry Potter and the Spygirl" - Different background for Hermione's parents.

"Divided and Entwined" - Ongoing. Hermione founds a Muggleborn Resistance and starts a guerilla war.

"The Dark Lord Never Died" - Lucius Malfoy took over Britain after Halloween 1981, and molded it in his image. Hermione and the other muggleborns of her generation were raised as his loyal enforcers, to prepare for the return of Voldemort, whom Lucius betrayed. Things do not go as planned, though, when Ron is sent to Britain as an agent of Dumbledore.

"Uncle Quentin's Spy" - Hermione's great-uncle is the leader of the Watchers Council, from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer". And he is recruiting. Set before the TV series.
