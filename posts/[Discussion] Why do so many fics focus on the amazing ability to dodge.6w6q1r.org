I'm unsure as to whether people accept the movies as canon, but as far as I can tell the spells we see throughout the series move very quickly. For example, the scene in OotP where the Order of the Phoenix apparate in and start dueling the Death Eaters. All the spells appear to move very very quickly, and some of them don't even appear visible at all! I understand that a lot of people might like to disregard the movies, but a sheer volume of fics claim that dodging is the be all and end all. I just don't see it.

I'm assuming the memory charm can be detected and (in minor cases) undone. If so, then Veritassium should be the standard for all trials.

You first make sure no one's under a memory charm. If they are try and break it (unless it would harm them). Then you have multiple people give Veritasium testimony. If their stories don't match up then there might be something going on. Either way, you combine Veritassium with other corroborating evidence to make a case.

With a case as high profiles as Sirius Blacks, it should have triggered major alarm bells why James Potter's ex-best friend considered it the truth that (1) Peter Pettigrew was alive and an animagus and (2) Peter pettigrew was the rea secret keeper.

** When Harry is running away from the Death Eaters in the graveyard (book 4), he dodges a bunch of spells and/or takes cover behind the headstones. So being able to dodge spells is canon, although I'm not a fan of making it the focus of the story (such as Harry learning martial arts and whatnot).

** Because most people imagine spells (visually) as jets of light which move slow enough to be seen (like the "Laser" shots in any SiFi movie). Spells need to be aimed (otherwise you could point your wand in the air and still curse someone in front of you). Therefore they are a relatively slow moving projectile that can be dodged.

Now from what we know of the magical world, the pureblood elite does not sound like people who have ever done a day of physical labour in their lives (with the exception of McNair). They are lazy and probably use the "brute force" approach to defeat their opponent, relying heavily on the offence.

Meanwhile, Harry has years of experience with hand to hand fighting (being on the receiving end) and dodging thanks to his cousin and Harry hunting. The conclusion is that Harry plays to his strength and uses his mobility and small size (years of malnutrition do that to somebody) to get into an advantageous position to win because he has no hope of winning a head-on duel against people who have been practicing the dark arts for longer than he lived or are at least proficient at killing. Unless you want to make Harry overpowered or stab people from behind his invisibility cloak there are few options how an author can make Harry strong enough to win. These tactics might not work against people like Bellatrix Lestrange but are enough for your average Death Eater.

I would agree with the idea of a lot of purebloods being lazy about physical exercise, but I'd also like to point out that the only overweight wizard we really get told about in the books is Professor Slughorn. It's a bit of an assumption but I'd imagine there's some small magical health benefits that might prevent weight gain. In any case we can't really say that purebloods are hugely unhealthy or not, as there are several sports in the wizarding world, and the books don't really imply that they are.

Also I'm not too sure about hand to hand fighting in regards to Harry. In the Philsophers Stone it's said that Harry mostly manages to run away from Dudley, so I'd agree with the agile part, but in all likelihood he probably got punched in the nose a few times. Doubtful that he'd be great in close combat. And I don't think he's severely malnourished? (Don't know whether that's canon confirmed off the top of my head) But if he was malnourished he definitely wouldn't have the strength required to really do anything to a large, fully developed adult.

I can definitely understand your points though, and I've read plenty of fics that try to make use of the same ideas drawing from Harry's upbringing. In all seriousness Harry's an average wizard who might be able to hold his own against some of the weaker death eaters for sure.

** I always thought that magic was all encompassing. You ask yourself what that has to do with anything?

If magic is all encompassing, then it empowers movement as well as everything else. this is proven in canon actually. A fall from 10 feet up as a slightly overweight 11 year old, would do more than break a wrist. A bludger, an iron ball moving at high speed, would SHATTER a bat, and the arm that tryed to hit it, and should kill those who it hits. Yet, we do not see it.

I mention this because in the comments below we are seeing human physiology being used to dictate if it is possible to move out of the way. While for a normal human, thats up in the air, we have many instances of humans dodging paintballs and such. I doubt a spell is moving as fast as a bullet, except maybe the messager patronus.

But that is moot. It doesn't matter if a human can, because we dont know if magic impacts human physiology when it moves. If magic boosts reflexes? Dodging suddenly makes so much more sense. If it has no impact I agree with the OP.

The thing is, canon is so contradictory here. We have Dumbledore, a person who openingly admits to being slower than he used to be, but pulling off moves that shouldn't be possible for a person in their prime. Not to mention we KNOW that magic helps sustain a human being because Dumbledore is over 100 years old. In fact he is over 110, and is capable of easily moving around a stone castle.

There is also the fact that Dodging is EASILY taught. Reflexes are trainable. In fact, in the israel millitary, they are trained to improve reflexes. Sports do it all the time. If we humans can do it, so can witches and wizards. If that result is magnified by magical power, then dodging just became a revolutionary concept.

There is also the dueling culture we see a glimpse of in the Chamber of Secrets book. It seems fairly stationary, and even the "duel" between Dumbledore and Voldemort supports this. It was fairly stationary, with movement only to the sides, and rarely into the others personal space. If we take that as an aspect of ALL duels, learning to move is vital to survival.

*** I think it was 20 feet for Neville, which emphasizes the whole wizards being sturdier than muggles concept (I think you're right, that is canon). However with the Beaters, I'd imagine either the bats or the bludger, or both, are enchanted in some manner to be more durable.

I have no idea if magic could boost a wizards reflexes, and I don't think the books make any mention to it, but I agree that it would be quite plausible, especially if there was a spell for it.

Maybe its to do with the witch or wizards knowledge and magical skill, as you say Dumbledore might support himself consciously or unconsciously with magic to help him out in a fight - we just don't know.

I think a lot of the problem has to lie within the definition of magical skill and power. If you're highly proficient at a shield charm, enough to bring one up and deflect major hexes and curses, then there isn't much need at all to dodge, but rather come up with clever ways to slip past your opponents defense. As far as we can tell from the books, familiarity with a spell makes it stronger overtime, as showcased by Harry's protego which is canonically shown to improve. The fact of the matter is we haven't really got enough information to ascertain what the best dueling methodology really is.

And yet, they have time to shield. Learning to dodge as well seems only reasonable, especially when there are things like the unforgivables that you can't stop.

I think dodging would be a common tactic when fighting.

Also, if spells are too fast to react to them, then a magical duel should look like a gun duel and the first to shoot should win. It means Voldemort or Dumbledore wouldn't be so scary, they would go down the first time they're outnumbered, regardless of their power level or skill.

** "Dodging" usually means moving so you're a harder target to hit. That works against firearms as well. You're not actually evading bullets - you're causing the shooter to miss you.

** Well, /some/ dodging ability is canon as there are scenes in the books where spells are avoided by moving. That said, in those scenes the characters didn't as much “dodge” as “moved all over the place”, which can interfere with casting accuracy even if we assume that spells are hit-scan because it's a tad hard to hit something moving erratically.

But some people don't pay attention to the details, and so “spells were dodged” and thus “dodging is uber-awesome protection technique”. It doesn't help that enough people's main exposure to the series are the movies and those don't do justice to a lot of stuff, including mechanics of how magic works. And, on the topic of movies, heroes dodge automatic weapon fire in action flicks via dodging so ... yeah, it may be a bit of a stretch but I say it is likely enough for people who've seen the movies but not the books to have watched action flicks and internalised that kind of nonsense.

Dodging is good for disturbing your opponent's aim, but in that case your dodging would have to consist of moving all over the place like a deranged squirrel. Just moving your body a feet or so and dodging a spell in a ballerina whirl does not constitute adequate dodging when it comes to spellfire, unless your opponent simply does not expect you to move at all and does not really pay attention to you and you move much more than that foot in the time it takes them to cast the spell and then notice you are a few metres away from where they are aiming (which takes us back to the deranged squirrel thing).

**** That is your opinion. We actually don't know whether the spells are projectiles that move at some speed or if they are basically hit-scan, nor do we know if aiming the spell requires the wizard/witch to angle the wand exactly where the target is/would be or if “more or less the right direction” is enough. And I will point out that, outside of what the movies did, we never got proof of either of those being correct or incorrect, but we also never got to see anyone use normal -issue dodging as a viable duelling technique which could be taken as somewhat telling.

Since I wrote that comment with the assumption that spells indeed are hit-scan, which I noted in the comment itself, and your reply seems to assume it not being hit-scan, I don't think there's any point in this because operating on completely different assumptions tends to make any attempts at discussing the details useless. And if you have grievances with the assumption that spells are hit-scan then take it to Taure, he is the original proponent.

PS. No, I am not trying to be hostile. But I really don't want to waste time on a useless back-and-forth which could happen if we tried to discuss this when our fundamental assumptions are different.

It's not a smooth dance-like movement that oh-so-many-people think is tantamount to dodging and oh-so-many-writers write as dodging when it comes to fights with spells. It is an abrupt move that changed quite significantly where he was, and it is executed basically at the same time that the spell is cast.

There is nothing whatsoever in this bit that proves that “dodging”, as interpreted by the person who'd asked the question in the post we are commenting on, is involved here, nor that is works.

** It's mostly an efficiency thing. You can take the time to cast a shield spell, or you can take a step to the side and cast a stunner instead. You can put up a shield that might not work against a strong curse, or you can take a step to the side and cast a stunner instead. Then there's the Killing curse which necessitates dodging or blocking it with a solid object, and guess what blocking it with a solid object entails? You got it, casting a spell. Much easier to take a step to the side.

Of course, people take this out of proportion. It's simply one asset among many in a wizard's arsenal. There will be times when you don't have room to move, or get grounded to a single spot by an opponent's spell. There are also spells which can be animated to seek you out, I'm sure. There are dozens of things which can counter simple dodging, but simple dodging can counter dozens of things, so it evens out.

There's also the idea that, if spells really are as fast as they are in the movies, your bodily reflexes can be just as fast as putting up a shield spell. It really depends on the wizard. Younger wizards would not have the knowledge and experience to make a shield spell viable in a high pressure combat scenario. Much MUCH easier to just train them to keep moving instead, until they've learned to cast a shield charm without having to think about it.

EDIT: One thing that just struck me about HP magic is that the combat magic that is shown in detail to the readers is very... Stilted. Point and shoot. It's single target impact spells. Making spells work together is a big deal, and making more spells work together is a bigger deal. The hallmark of a master is being able to do more with a single spell, so young wizards can only really use one spell at a time, much like revolver will only fire one bullet. Because of this it is very easy for curse heavy duels to turn into Wild West shootouts.

**** Maybe, Avada Kedavra definitely seems to just be a flash of light. Another interesting example is that spell that Dumbledore uses against Voldemort in the duel in the Ministry, the one Voldemort has to use a shield to block - described as very slow.

** From the duel in the graveyard (Goblet of Fire):

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort raised his wand, but this time, Harry was ready; with the reflexes born of his Quidditch training, he flung himself sideways onto the ground; he rolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort's father, and he heard it crack as the curse missed him.
#+end_quote

So, canon says that being a moving target will work, even against Voldemort himself.

** I always viewed it as a cultural thing. Wizards will think less of people who dodge spells physically. Sure you can dodge but the wizard world in general thinks it makes you look stupid and cowardly.

** But in movies, some other mundane character who evades/caught bullet do so by calculating the angle of the muzzle. If a spell is shot with direction identical to the angle of the wand, can't it be dodged?

*** If a spell is shot with direction identical to the angle of the wand then there is no need to dodge because no spell ever would hit its intended target.

You /do/ remember that moving your wand in various obscure motions, not aiming, is part of the spellcasting process, don't you?

** The conclusion isn't that far off. Whatever you dodge you don't have to block.

But I agree that the ability to doge cannot be the end-all solution as many fics suggest. A good mix between spellwork and physical movement makes for good fighting scenes.

**** That's probably why people say dodging is important, because they make up their own spell speeds and all that. I'd say learning to dodge is important, if only to be ready to dodge any possible unforgivables. But seeing as there's no magical cores or exhaustion in canon, throwing up a shield should honestly be much easier. It would just a flick of the wrist, wouldn't it?

***** I would've thought so for the shielding idea. You see that a lot in the movies as well, almost every time a spell is blocked you see them throw out a shield. I'm pretty sure Harry dodges the killing curse in the graveyard against Voldemort in the books right? So I guess it's definitely doable, at least with some spells.

****** Yeah, he dodges it by diving behind a tombstone. You could also throw up stuff in front of you to intercept killing curses, but I feel like that kind of accuracy would be tougher to do than to simply dive out of the way.

I've always assumed some spells were faster than others. Some are colored differently, some have no color, some are faster, some slower, maybe some zigzag to confuse the enemy. I dunno, I just like to think there's all kinds of ways spells act.

******* I think Rowling gave that impression in the books, I don't think many of the spells at all are even described as projectiles or jets of light. Like transfiguration, it just seems to happen without any visible exchange between a wand and the object.

I don't think they're dodge-able either but action movies often portray them to be. In fanfiction, authors seem to depict it similar to something like the energy blasts in star wars which are slow enough to duck and dodge.

***** Ah I see what you mean. I think a lot of it must be a product of slapping limits on how much magic the characters can have, like magical cores and the like. If students don't have 'enough magic' then shielding would be pretty costly to do all the time, whereas if dodging works then it's a lot more 'magic efficient'.
