Hi guys/girls. I started reading another fanfiction of HP (as always) and after the beginning of the first year explanation it comes up again and again. “James tried to hold up Voldemort, Lily died in front of Harry's crib & Voldemort died after sending an Avada Kadavra to Harry backfiring perfectly and destroying his body” the question here is. How did Dumbledore know what happened? That Voldemort cast the killing curse on Harry and it backfired? That he was a survivor of the killing curse and that nothing else intruded into that moment which resulted in Voldemort's body being destroyed?

No matter how many different outcomes we use as fanfictions there's still this lingering question.


** Given what we are told of the killing curse (it leaves no mark, other than people dying), it is simple to figure out that James got hit with it. Also the fact that he's downstairs means he most likely got hit 1st. Then there's Lily, dead in front of Harry's crib. That's two curses. Harry has a scar, and possibly magical residue on him. He also has that protection from Lily, Dumbledore had an entire day to figure out what it was, and how it is triggered. How Dumbledore knows the bodies' placements? Hagrid.

** Because he knew the prophecy, he knew what Snape had asked for, and knew both Lily and Voldemort well enough to know Snape wouldn't get his way.

** Dumbledore can recognize the traces magic leaves, he mentioned it in HBP

  "Oho," said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could not see. Dumbledore moved closer to the water; Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledore's buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point.

  Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledore's clenched hand. Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water. Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood.

  "How did you know that was there?" Harry asked in astonishment.

  *"Magic always leaves traces," said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, "sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style."*

** Or that there is some sort of spell residue left behind that can be detected eg magical forensics.

From canon we are told that AK victims look perfectly healthy showing no signs for why they are dead. Of course unless the AK was the only curse thrown there is a good chance that the victim would have other curse injuries. So we are back to the idea of detectable spell signatures.

Also we know that the ministry of magic can detect spells. Is it possible that they are able to detect AK's and that's how Dumbledore knows. Or if Dumbledore helped with the protective charms on Godrics Hollow did one of those charms record those battle spells? And then by checking Lily and James wand could they eliminate the spells they threw?

That's my best guess for how Dumbledore could know what happened.

** Well, he has a pensieve. Maybe Dumbledore grabbed a copy of baby Harry's memories of the event? They'd be from a baby's perspective, but the magic seems to capture more then the first person perspective of the observer. As seen in Snape's memory in OOTP.

** And how did he know that anything had happened at all, to send Hagrid?
