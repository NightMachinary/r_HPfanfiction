** I don't know what this fic is, but all the plot points you've described make me hate it.

** There's one fic where Hermione leaves Britain after a one night stand with Harry, travels to Australia where her mother recognizes her because her father is dead, and Hermione bears a child (or twins, I don't remember). They accidentally meet at a conference in the US. Divorce was impossible for magic reasons, but Harry managed to annul the marriage with Ginny because they never had children. I'll see if I can find it.

** Sounds like linkffn(semper fidelis by untold harmony) I think anyway. I quit reading mostly because I find the premise to be silly. Hermione just seems rather unintelligent.
