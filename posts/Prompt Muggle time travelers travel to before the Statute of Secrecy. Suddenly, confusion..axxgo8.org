** It'd be funny if they came back to their time thinking the witch trials/crusades successfully eradicated all witchcraft and they continued living in ignorance of the wizarding world.

*** Conservationists would want to bring back specimens of magical creatures they /think/ are extinct in the present, which would lead to some very confused interactions with wizards on their return. In fact, with the Diricawl/Dodo, they would do this even if they didn't find out about magic.

** That actually reminds me of the book Off To Be A Wizard by Scott Meyer. Magic is done by computer hacking and the main character travels to Merlin's time and finds a bunch of other computer hackers there. It's quite funny and a good read.

Also it's free if you have prime, well it at least used to be if that's changed

*** They inadvertently cause it by telling the Witches and Wizards that they'd never seen one in their time.
