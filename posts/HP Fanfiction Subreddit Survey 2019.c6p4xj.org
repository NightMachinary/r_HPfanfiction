**** I mean, it definitely helps, but I always thought it was rooted in the fact that Voldemort is not in any way realistic. It's like hating Sauron. Sure, they're both unquestionably evil and the sooner they kick the bucket the better, but it's hard to muster any real /hatred/ for them.

Umbridge (to name the clear runaway winner in that particular un-popularity contest) is /real./ Not in the sense that Dolores Jane Umbridge is walking around London (or cooling her heels in prison), but in the sense that the specific flavor of petty evil that she embodies is alive and well in the world today. We've /all/ known, met, or heard stories of an Umbridge-esque person who abuses the rules to get their way. That she hides under a saccharine-sweet veneer just makes it worse.

Compare that to characters like Umbrdige who spend an entire book being realistically vile.

** One of the difficult things for me was the “how often do you read HP fanfiction”. I kind of go through phases of fandoms. I've been on a Harry Potter phase for the past couple of weeks, where I read HP fanfics daily. Before that it was ASOIAF fanfics for a few months, and before that it was Star Wars. During these phases I'll pretty much be exclusively reading fics from that fandom daily, until I move on.

*** I only stopped reading Daily because I've run out of decent completed fics. I've moved on to things I wouldn't normally read because they are poorly written, include slash, or relationships I'd normally avoid... but those are much easier to put down.

My other fandoms are Naruto, and Buffy mainly...both of which I've run out of as well... moved into One Piece, Bleach and DC/Marvel stuff too... but even with Crossovers I'm running dry.

I'm much less likely to re-read a list of tropes in a fic from any fandom but HP or Naruto. There are several standout fics in other bubbles (mostly Anime...)

The only incomplete stuff I read on a regular basis is Dogbertcarrol's never ending Yet Again More series of one-shots and plot bunnies. He ranges ALL over the place but mostly Buffyverse.

** Great survey. A good length with some interesting questions. I think the wording of a few of the tropes revealed the author's biases (e.g. the definitions of 'small', 'medium' and 'large' wizarding populations) but overall, this could give us some really interesting data.

Some curious results so far:

- At least 40% of the people who gave a 'favourite slash pairing' don't actually read slash.

  - I wonder who they voted for. Ron's share of the vote seems way too high. So does Other, although there were a bunch of pairings missed.
  - For comparison, in most surveys of slash communities, Drarry is /the/ slash pairing, distantly followed by SS/HP and LV/HP.
  - That's SS for Severus Snape by the way, not Salazar Slytherin. His inclusion cracked me up.

- Only 12% refuse to read non-Harry-centric fics. As someone who /prefers/ these fics, that's heartening to see.

- The canonicity of the FB movies is falling off a cliff. I was also a little surprised that Pottermore ranked as highly as the side books (since the latter having been around for longer).

- The subreddit likes "pureblood culture", is mixed on "pureblood nobility" but really doesn't like Harry to inherit political power. Interesting, given the ubiquity of fics where all three are true.

- Evil!Harry was by /far/ the most polarising trope.

- Bashing of all forms is disliked. But people disapprove as much of Ron-bashing as Hermione-bashing! Feels like a turnaround from the state of the fandom a few years ago.

**** There used to be a huge community on livejournal of this ship in the mid 2000s. Post-DH book and the movies, it's sort of died. Rupert Grint growing up to be the least attractive member of the main cast definitely didn't help. Adult Ron in these fics was a tall, hot hunk of ginger, often a quidditch player or something. He often had divination powers for some reason. Then the last book came out and the movies followed, and what we got was not that Ron.

Things seem to have changed over the last 8 or so hours. 20.3% are for bashing Ron compared to the 10.1% who approve of bashing Hermione. It seems there was just an influx of pro-Ron and/or anti-Hermione folks at the start of polling.

*** I generally prefer having the questions optional to N/A options. The problem with an "N/A" option is that it messes up the results of the people who do have opinions on the topic. If you have no opinion on a question, best to skip it unless it is compulsory. I think on all the compulsory ones, there is an "Other" option, or some kind of neutral position, such as the "3" on the Trope Alert questions.

For example, with specific reference to the slash pairing question, this is just a question for people who actually have a favourite slash pairing. If you do not read slash, then this information will have already been captured by the "Do you read stories with a gay male protagonist?" question.

My experience: Since there wasn't an "N/A" choice I picked "Other" for favorite het pairing before noticing that the question was optional. After picking an answer there was no way to un-answer the question, so I had to stick with "Other."

I mention this because the "optional" tag isn't very prominent. Other respondents might make a similar mistake with the "optional" questions and thus "other" may end up skewing your data the same way an "N/A" choice would have.

** Fascinating survey! Some of those questions at the end really hit home how much of the fandom (now) is American and influenced by American (actually outlier within the world at large, although probably quite commonplace within the US) attitudes e.g. twisting the world of Harry Potter that shows no signs of being so into a Puritan-esque traditionalist paradise, and the idea of the US as a much better setting than that awful UK!

Other notes based on previous years: the age of everyone is starting to seriously trend up year on year now eh! I think that's probably healthy tho. Less male dominated than some threads would suggest (!) suggesting perhaps there are just a large number of female readers who stay out of certain shall we say /heated/ discussions!

In terms of how the results are shaping up, will this be the year where Hermione overtakes Ginny as the favourite pairing for Harry?! Favourite character overall result seems a little different to previous years too although we have our usual front-runners - Harry really is pulling away this year tho eh?

One thing I've noticed site-wide is that men seem to be significantly more ‘active' in general on most subreddits, making most places seem even more male-dominated than they are. I think it's probably a result of the past when Reddit was extremely male-dominated, so subreddit cultures formed based on those demographics and continue to persist even after things have balanced out a bit. This subreddit also has a sizeable presence of DLP writers who tend to be men.

*** It's not too surprising that that was the most popular opinion. Dumbledore self-admittedly screwed Harry over, he could have probably left him with a wide range of people who could have kept him safe and granted him a happy childhood without really changing all that much about the overall plot of the series.

Now the Wizarding World would have been fucked if Dumbledore didn't try and stop Voldemort, imagine a fifth year where Dumbledore agrees with the ministry that Voldemort isn't back and Harry is full of shit, chances are it wouldn't be known that Voldemort is back until it was far too late.

Also I feel like the latter situation I described has amazing story potential, a world where Dumbledore assumes the prophecy was fulfilled when Harry was a Baby and that Voldemort is vanquished leaving Harry to fend for himself against Voldemort. Book 1 would probably need to go fairly differently, but the rest could stay mostly the same until the end of 4.

Changing Harry's name seems to be a divisive subject, so it might be interesting to see what percentage of the sub feels strongly for and against.

It might also be neat to see what the most popular preferences are for alternate sortings (Harry going into Slytherin, Ravenclaw, etc.)

I've seen the "Dark Magic addiction" trope pop up frequently in Dark! or Indie!Harry fics, so that might also make a good topic.

** Great survey. Always interesting to see data, even if it confirms what we already know as is the case with the demographic data for this sub (active Reddit users who read HP fanfic).

I would suggest changing how you present the “choose 1 character questions” since the pie charts are hard to read. A ranked table or an ordered bar graph would both work well.

For the trope questions I would keep the bars but would also extract the mean and standard deviation for analysis purposes. From an interpretation point of view, it should also be important that people's responses may not be as much their view on a trope as they may be their view on an issue at large (especially if it parallels with today's world).

Tropes are great the first one or two times you read them, because to you they are not tropes yet.

Then you see it EVERY-FREAKING-Where and it gets annoying, so you start avoiding it.

Then you either run out of things to read, or you want "comfort food". Tropes are easy to slip into, make you feel like you know what is happening in the story, and where it is going. Sometimes you just want simple reading, not something that makes you think.

As a fanfic author, I find that I can quote brand new TV episodes and movies as the characters are saying it. I recognize the trope, examine the characters and motivations, and write the lines as I'm watching. It is both fun and annoying, and surprise twists that are ACTUALLY surprises are amazing... and very far between.

*** My opinion: An unabashedly evil character can be likeable, a favorite villain. Whereas someone who did a lot of bad things but is supposed to be good gets a lot more hate.

Snape helped win the war, he was a double/triple agent, and protected Harry several times without him knowing it. But he was also (apparently) an incel obsessed with Lily who seems to only regret that she died and didn't end up with him after he accidentally got her husband killed. He treated everyone not in Slytherin like complete crap, especially the main Trio. Not to mention the things he likely had to do AS a Death Eater that he was never punished for (other than his own personal internal torture).

To have a man like that be lauded as a hero turns a lot of peoples stomachs. Even if it is correct, it doesn't mean you can't hate him.

I chose Snape over Umbridge... partly because I didn't see Umbridge, but that was because I saw Snape and made a snap decision and moved on. Delores was just as awful, but she only really directly affected the main trio for one book.

The two are a toss-up to me... I'd much rather read a redeemed Snape story than a redeemed Umbridge story...so I probably voted wrong.

Additionally, the power dynamic between wizard and house elf is so lopsided that a house elf's opinion doesn't appear to matter much at all. Even if they think they are deciding for themselves, after living in slavery for so long they don't know of anything else.

I've heard it said that house elves were based on brownies from Scottish folklore, but in most accounts those creatures aren't slaves at all. They appear to work for an offering of some sort, and could leave if mistreated. If house elves used to be that way and somehow over time became slaves to wizards, they could work that way again after they gain freedom.

** I don't understand what people have against the bashing of Hermione... I know bashing just like that isn't really good, but having her be disliked is what I really like. There is probably no character in the books that I hate as much as her.... and it has nothing to do with her being a smart female. I just don't like her as a person

*** I think there's a difference between bashing and portraying a character in a negative light, however.

I'm not a huge fan of Hermione in fanfiction (though I like her fine in canon). But even though I'm fine reading Hermione as an antagonist, I'd much prefer to read about the protagonist being at odds with a Hermione who has her canonical talents (neither exaggerated nor diminished) and who is capable of learning and growth. Not only is such a character much more believable, she's also just a better antagonist that way. Stupid antagonists result in stories with no conflict.

I've no interest in reading about a cartoonish Hermione whose magical talent has been downgraded and who just performs the same pointless actions again and again while expecting a different result (usually with completely opaque motivations).

**** Yea but the thing is people often have a different understanding of Hermione's talents. Like only learning everything by heart vs. as smart as Dumbledore. I think she's the former because I know a person that fits her really well, but just learns by heart. (Like correcting everyone and having straight A's)
