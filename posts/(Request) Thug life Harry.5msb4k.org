I read what seemed like a good Thug life Harry at first. He ran away from the Dursley's and grew up on the streets, he had tats and smoked, cool dude.

Then he made Hagrid cry on purpose and was dead to me forever.

Anyone know a good Thug life Harry who's hard on the outside but a big softy deep down?

*** Harry as raised by Ghostface Killah? That's oddly specific, and makes me wonder what Harry raised by other rappers would be like.

**** Well ghostface is his (foster/step?)dad married to his OC aunt Rose. The whole of wu-tang is kind of an extended family to him.

Ghostface was chosen due to wanting the iron man influence for the story over other marvel charas.
