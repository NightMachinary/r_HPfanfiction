**** Sorry, the bot can't respond to edits. Background: back when the bot was in creation, the parsing system was still messy and error-prone. Sometimes, the loss of a connection would crash it. Other times, special characters would crash it.

What happened here was that the bot got a connection error when making a reply, it seems. Unable to make the reply, the bot decided to continue parsing comments.

The next major update should make it so the bot replies to comments it's missed. For now, you can deal with the problem by replying with ffnbot!parent.

** One I read recently, but I can't remember the name of. In the first chapter harry kills himself by jumping off the astronomy tower. The rest of the story isn't very sad but that first chapter was horrible. The Wraith? Or The Revenant? Something like that, he becomes an unspeakable.

** linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty) is chock-full of well-written angst; it plays up your expectations, but then the realistic consequences kick in, and the last chapter has the single most actually-tragic scene I've ever read in fanfiction.

This is, of course, excluding the happy-ending sequels.
