The fic was fairly short overall, and I'm not sure if I'm combining two different fics into one, but the scenes I remember are that Harry goes back in time to Voldemort's era, but she's a girl and used to getting her way, and becomes extremely determined to get close to him because he ignores/hates her at first. The other scene is Harry back in the present time but Voldemort finds her way to his time and is angry because he left her behind so Harry hides under the table in the Great Hall and he crawls the length of the table until Voldemort tells him that she could see him the whole time and then Harry finally faces the music but Voldemort kisses him instead while berating him for leaving her behind.


** The first one sounds like Datura on AO3. It's kinda crap though.
