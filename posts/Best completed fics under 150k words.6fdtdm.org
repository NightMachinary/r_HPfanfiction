** You can "quickly read before bed" a 150k story? Impressive. I usually end up spending the night reading and regretting it in the morning.

Linkffn(the substitute by BajaB) is the first that comes to mind. Not a recipe for sweet dreams, very angsty.

  "People change, you know, and then you find you have less in common with old friends and more in common with the strangest people." Percy had built a tall wall around himself - a stronghold - and the only way it was going to come down was by crashing into someone else's soaring fortress. Perhaps, a collision was exactly what they both needed. Percy/Audrey.
