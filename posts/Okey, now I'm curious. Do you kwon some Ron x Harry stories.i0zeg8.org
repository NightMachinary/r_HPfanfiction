Originally I was searching for stories where people confuse Harry and Ron relationship. But now I'm really curious.


** I read a one shot once where molly thought harry and Ginny were together and hermione anderton were but they were hiding it and told them she was fully supportive of their relationships only to find put it was harry/ron and hermione/ginny. Cant remember the name though

  Goblet of Fire AU: The change in their relationship happened during fourth year, when an exhausted and dateless Harry groaned out the important question of, “Why can't we just go together?”Pure fluff for the 5+ AU Headcanons game.

  It took over an hour, from the time Harry arrived at work, for him to realise just how different today actually was.

  Dating's tough when you're Harry Potter. Ron watches his best friend go through some very bad dating experiences, while going through some awkward ones of his own. H/R slash. Please note the rating and warnings inside.
