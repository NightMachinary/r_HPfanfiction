:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been looking for this story for I don't know how long and hoped at least one other person had read it and knows the name of it.

Sorry is set in fourth year before the Yule Ball, Harry goes with Lavender and Hermione gets jealous, Harry is wandering the halls after the ball and comes across viktor and Hermione in a classroom with Hermione blindfolded and viktor standing over her, he stuns Krum and pretends to be him so he can have sex with Hermione without her knowing.

It's similar to harry the playboy but it's not that story.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks


** Just be aware, anyone who knows the name of this fanfic can share the name of it, but cannot link it because linking it would violate rule 8
