I'm looking for stories in the style of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games][Number Games]] by jbern. I like the introspective recounting of life after Hogwarts which goes in many directions. A story with a similar style is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6862426/1/The-Quidditch-World-Cup][The Quidditch World Cup]] by TheEndless7.
