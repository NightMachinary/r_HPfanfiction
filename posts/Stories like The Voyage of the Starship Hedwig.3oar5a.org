** On my harddrive, split up into several small chapters that are in dire need of becoming an actual story.

But that aside, the only thing I know that comes close would be star wars crossovers.

Maybe that helps.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

** Depending on which part of Hedwig you're looking for more of, D.S.S. Requirement by esama might fit the bill. Harry and the D.A. discover that the Room of Requirement can give them a spaceship, so they spend time experimenting and working out how to use it. (It's an Asgardian ship from the Stargate franchise, for reference, but so far there's no actual interaction with anyone from Stargate.) The story itself is completed, but there's definite room for a sequel.
