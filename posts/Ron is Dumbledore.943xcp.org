I know everyone talks about them, but I have never read a fic where Ronald Weasley is Professor Dumbledore (or the other way) and I'd really like to read one. So if you know one I'd apprecuate it if you could link it here.

Thanks in Advance


** That was a popular theory back before the books were finished. I don't know if any personally, but I'd say go looking for stories published around 2004-2005 or so.

*** I think Deathly Hallows killed that theory. Now no one can imagine Dumbledore without Aberforth and Ariana

** I never have either, but I think it'd be even better if McGonagall were Hermione. Perhaps the time travel messes up, and they got sent to different times. Would explain how close they are...
