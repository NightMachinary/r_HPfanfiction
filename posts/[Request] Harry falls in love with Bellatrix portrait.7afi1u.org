I once read story set after the war. In which Harry finds a portrait of young Bellatrix in the basement of Grimmauld Place. They discuss some things, and at some point in time, Harry finds Bellatrix's diary. Harry tries to understand her[[/spoiler][and in the end, breaks relationships with Ginny to be with Bellatrix.]]

I found this story on fanfiction net. After the first read, I thought that it's not so good and haven't saved the story.\\
But I want to reread it, I tried to find this story several times with different google requests and using fanfiction search, but haven't succeeded. Maybe somebody knows this story?


** Waaaaaait a minute, does he break up with Ginny to be with Bella's *portrait*? Because if so, we have to find this story and preserve it in amber at the museum of modern lulz.

** I could see a setup similar to "The Picture of Dorian Gray". Bellatrix pushes all the excess qualities of herself that are not valued by Voldemort into a portrait. Her portrait self becomes nearly her exact opposite. Queue plot by Harry to switch them out so that Portrait bella becomes real bella and vice versa.

**** I will try again too. But I think there is a chance that this story doesn't have Bellatrix in characters tags. Or I would found it already.

** Interesting idea, considering how many poor-traits Bellatrix has.
