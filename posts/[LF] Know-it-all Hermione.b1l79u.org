Similar to Realizations by sbmcneil and The Mind Arts by Wu Gang. Where she takes an extremely rigid view and assumes she always knows best. No slash for pairings and a competent Harry would be appreciated.


** Canon

Just kidding

No I'm not

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; A fine Spot of Trouble; Trapped in a broomcloset; The Legacy)

Though in the Legacy, she isn't as rigid, mostly she has an actual sense of moral that impairs somewhat the war effort for Harry. In none of these there is bashing. Just pointing out character flaws from in each character from each fic. And in most, she isn't an antagonist.

Also linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) which is a series, at the moment in year 5. Actually pretty close to canonHermione. Like, REALLY close, but with better friends than Ron and Harry (cuz lets be honest, they were shit friends. If i was Hermione and they did the shit that the boys used to do, I'd drop them in a heartbeat. Poor Hermione. Doesn't even own a hairbrush)

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

*** I disagree with them being shit friends (barring third year, although Hermione was slightly at fault). They weren't similar friends. My issue with competent Harry fanfiction is that either Hermione is either super Hermione or being paid by Dumbledore. I love the character in canon, but sometimes I feel Harry would have been better off without the close friendship or at least more assertive.
