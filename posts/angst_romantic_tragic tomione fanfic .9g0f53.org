I read a lot of tomione fanfics and i love one's filled with emotion from Hermione and tom riddles as either his younger self or present voldemort where its a bitter sweet but beautiful ending such as :patient x" or "tied for last" both amazing fanfics by two different amazing writers!

Hermione is always brave and smart amd resourceful when it comes to protecting her loved ones even if it costs her lots of scars and also has a big heart.And tom riddles story that you just cant help but want to know perhaps and his character is a masterpiece when done well. If you know any fanfics tht involve anything like that. Thanks
