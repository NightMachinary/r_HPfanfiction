** I wholeheartedly recommend Face Death in the Hope by LullabyKnell, especially if you like time travel/dimensional travel. The relationships do list a Harry/Regulus, but if that's a concern we are 43 chapters in with there being no sign of anything other than friendship there so far

I'd also recommend Whispers in Corners by esama. I realize that the Harry/Mycroft will probably turn some people away, but I urge you to give it a shot regardless. It's very much a great fic where those two happen to be romantic by the end, not a great fic centered on that romance.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

** What types of fics do you like? Any pairing preference or avoidance?

Default recommendation is to sort by kudos then filter out fics you don't want to see

** This is a darkfic that was just put up recently. It's on a hiatus right now but when it's updating it updates regularly. It's an AU that focuses on Tom Riddle having a job in the Department of Mysteries and Pandora Lovegood being his intern. It has ten chapters and I'm not really sure what's going on in it yet but I'm intrigued. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17708705/chapters/41776079]]

** I'll give you fics that are exclusive to ao3, as I think this is what you meant.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8125531][Hogwarts, to welcome you home]] is a sweet little short story about rebuilding.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5924716/chapters/13626331][The Many Faces of Harry Potter]] is where Harry meets other dimensional selves. This has a rather interesting moral discussion partway through. Either way the hijinks make it worth the read.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/924488][Reclamation]], a one shot where Tom Riddle and Severus Snape make different choices.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5265569/chapters/12150143][Seven Names]] is where "justice" in the aftermath of the Wizarding War presents a conundrum for Hermione Granger.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12608820/chapters/28722276][Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes]] is like HP and Prince of Slytherin but much more condensed without side arcs.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1171672][*/Professor C. Binns: A Personal History/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/PurpleFluffyCat/pseuds/PurpleFluffyCat][/PurpleFluffyCat/]]

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.
