There are also a few Black Butler crossovers in this genre that I like (or don't like). A lot of Avengers crossovers have MoD Harry as well.

**** I think it's the character's attitude and the fact quite a few fics try to make her supreme authority on societal issues. She's 14 and really tactless. Or when an author writes an AU about a specific change in a canon event, then Hermione is like a female Dumbledore and magically beautiful and Harry doesn't know why he didn't notice before.

***** I don't think many fics seriously explore the idea of Hermione as female Dumbledore, and more should, because whereas OP!Harry is boring, OP!Hermione's tactless idealism backed by phenomenal cosmic power creates lot of potential for tasty, tasty conflict.

Say, if OP!Hermione doesn't like how house-elves are treated, she doesn't form a society or knit little hats. Instead, she just invents a spell that snaps the house-elf bonds and publishes the instructions in a leaflet. So now there are lots of angry wizards and witches and lots of homeless elves.

Or, imagine that you're a pureblood who sympathises with Voldemort's goals, but you feel that his means are rather uncouth, so you would rather just wait for that do-gooder Dumbledore to keel over from old age, so that you and your friends could purge his fellow do-gooders like Aurthur Weasley from the Ministry and things will go back to the way they were---back before Dumbledore had endorsed that mudblood Nobby Leach for Minister. If Voldemort comes back, you'd be content to sit the war out, maybe take a long vacation to your French estate. But then, you hear that the next Dumbledore has arrived, and she's a bossy mudblood. Suddenly, time is not on your side anymore. What will you do?

****** None of this is too much different from OP Harry.

Realistically the house elves would probably team up with their masters/mistresses and kill her. The thing this fandom forgets is that house elves wanted to work for wizardkind and very loyal. What they needed was respect and destroying the bonds they have with the families also demonstrates a lack of respect.

For the second, you actually have to have her do something incredible for anyone to be concerned about a bossy mudblood, Dumbledore's power or no. Tom Riddle would have had to work his way up albeit with fewer words because he was friends with Slughorn, Lestrange, and Malfoy. Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald (and worked with the Wizengamot as a teen). The Boy Who Lived, canon and fanon, needs far fewer words as he has people bowing to him in the streets at eleven.

Regardless if it's Harry, Hermione, Dumbledore, or TMR no one should take them seriously if they're younger than 25 (and that's a stretch).

Nah. Harry wouldn't know what to do with that power, unless you tossed out his canon personality and rewrote it from scratch until he might as well be named "Bob". Which is what most OP!Harry writers do---and that's telling.

They would try; but that's exactly my point: the adventure practically writes itself, and there is more than enough adversity to justify the protagonist's power.

Given how a Dumbledore/Riddle/Grindelwald-grade wizard can defeat almost any number of lesser opponents and radically alter the balance of power in the society for generations, watching for students at Hogwarts who show that level of talent seems only prudent.

But even if not, and even if the House-Elf Incident wouldn't be enough, I am sure that OP!Hermione could find some other way to Make the World a Better Place Whether it Wants it or Not (TM) that would stir things up even more.

You do know Hermione's canon personality is tossed out in damn near every story she's featured in, OP or no, right? And, from what we know, canon Hermione and young Dumbledore are very different.

And, if not her personality, everyone else's is altered. Like even in the cultural anthropology fic TMR delays coming to life because he just enjoys conversation with a mudblood. Dude chopped off his helper's arm and killed one of 'his' best lieutenants in canon, but wants to keep Hermione alive.

So, you want Hermione to be a villain akin to Voldemort and Grindelwald? Because TMR, Dumbledore, Umbridge, Crouch, and Lucius understood there was more to power than magical might. Crouch was a stiff and gained /political/ power through his ability to fight, which canon Hermione can't do to well. The other three were cunning, knew how to smile in people's faces, and make friends in high places. Canon Hermione didn't know how to 2/3.

Which brings me to my last point. No one should take them seriously in the /political/ arena. Because a) why would 50+ year olds do that and b) canon Hermione and Harry are very easily used.

Not a good comparison for two reasons. Firstly, vast majority of fics that toss out Hermione's personality make her nicer, more flighty, and less driven; whereas vast majority of fics that toss out Harry's make him more prudent, strategic, and driven. So, authors have to rewrite Harry's personality just to give him the ability to do something with great power, but they have to rewrite Hermione to take it away from her. Secondly, even if we only take the readable ones, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of OP!Harry stories at this point, and since almost none of them preserve Harry's personality, that's indicative of something; but there are very few actual OP!Hermione stories, too few to indicate anything.

#+end_quote

I have no idea where this tangent came from, but do keep in mind that we don't actually know what his real plans for Hermione were---and the most probable one was to set her up as a foil for himself, then crush her at the right time to demoralise any remaining opposition.

#+end_quote

Ministry's motto under Voldemort was, literally, "Magic is Might", you know. Diplomacy is useful, but ultimately, power in the wizarding world flows from the tip of the wand, and the side that has the uberwizard generally gets to do what they want. Whatever Hermione does or doesn't do, a pureblood supermacist of the sort that I had described several posts up would think exactly like that.

Anyway, yes, of course, OP!Hermione would screw up politically and gain powerful enemies, and that's a /good thing/, because the last thing you want with an OP protagonist is lack of meaningful adversity. In fact, you want precisely the kind of adversity that the protagonist can't just power through. You are making my case for me here.

Because in ten years, they'll be able to beat ten aurors. In twenty, the whole Ministry. They will probably choose not to, but it's prudent to start paying attention now.

Canon Harry is easily used, I agree, though even he has his limits as Scrimegour discovered. For Hermione, care to provide some actual evidence to back up that claim?

*** What OP!Hermione fics would you recommend?

My sense is that writers of Hermione-centric fic tend to be more sensitive to over-powering her than writers of Harry-centric fic are to over-powering Harry, so even fics in which she is set up to be very powerful, like /The Arithmancer/, the authors tend to limit her advancement and not give her the power that the premise suggests she should have.

I can count those who just make Hermione is a Dumbledore-grade prodigy and play it straight on one hand.

- Post-Hogwarts Harry/Ron are fresh Auror recruits and struggle to take it seriously because after Voldemort everything else sort of pales in comparison (I haven't actually seen a fic like this yet but I want to)

** The Dursley's being arrested for neglect because someone accidentally discovered it, usually leading to Dumbledore being completely discredited. Dark Harry is also a favourite even though it's usually done badly. And for some reason, those scenes where Harry buys a suitcase that doubles as a penthouse apartment and library, several pets such as snakes which aren't in the letter, and other useless stuff which is never mentioned after the first chapter are for some reason entertaining to me

*** The Dursley's being arrested for neglect is a guilty pleasure of mine, but I'd rather have a Dumbledore be put under scrutiny for his decisions after that.

** When Harry funnily outsmarts people with the simplest of moves. It just shows how little logic some pureblood wizards have. Take Goyle, for an example. Malfoy wasn't too bright either to barge into a compartment and insult Harry's freind, and then demand to be his.

** I have a huge love of villainous characters corrupting the heroes, especially if there's also a side of mildly fucked up romance with it. I've enjoyed several Harry/Voldemort fics since they usually fulfill this (at least when I can find ones that aren't M/M slash)

** Mentor/ Father figure Voldemort.

Most fics with this trop are pretty bad (and full of cliche like "Wizarding nobility" or "Death Eaters are the good guys"), but I really like to see more interactions between Harry and Voldemort. Bonus point if Voldemort at least keep some elements of canon and is an unrepentant bastard who is not "too" close of Harry, not an helicopter parent.

** Oh the one thing i consider a guilty pleasure is mpreg. Yes, i read slash fics. Yes. I read het fics. I normally read h/hr, but at random i will read crack pairings with mpreg and have fun with it, the more pwp the better. Heck, i just skip straight towards the mpreg and read . Het preg is so boring in fanfic that i rarely read it. But yeah im pansexual so any pwp will work. Yes, even intersex/harem/tgtf fics are likeable, regardless of who does who with what parts. I read sfw fanfic more often though. Partly for my own sanity. That doesn't mean i stick to lower ratings. It just means i go for fics that are ffn compliant and reasonably r rated instead of nc17 because r rated material is less of a guilty pleasure. What this means is Essentially that if a fic is just crazy pwp fanwank i read it with discretion and on a very rare basis considering how some kinda go too far for even my weird tastes, but if a story is on ffn and is not set like an insanely bizarro nsfw wet dream, i read it even if it has an m or high rating, crack pairing, reasonable cliche overload, and even lemons and/or limes depending on how they are done and given out.
