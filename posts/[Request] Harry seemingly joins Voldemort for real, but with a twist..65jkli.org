Harry joins Voldemort, and everyone thinks he has defected for real. but it's not true, he's actually joined the Dark side to protect his friends and the people he cherishes. and Dumbledore as well as Snape have been in the know all along.


** I remember reading a fic where Daphne was his lawyer, he fucked Bellatrix, and Dumbledore and Moody knew.

** I remember a fic where Harry kidnaps Hermione and tortures her with a skin branding spell to make Voldemort trust him, but later heals her with his Phoenix tears. Does that ring any bells for anyone?

*** I know exactly which fic you mean, but I think he doesn't torture Hermione but another girl, not sure though.

However, I know that he's a phoenix animagus in that fic, and strongly believe that the deatheaters stay in Buckingham Palace, he hurts deatheaters with some muggle explosives in a forest, and that you can vary the pain of the Egypt (?) branding spell.
