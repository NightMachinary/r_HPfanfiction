I am an avid Harry Potter fanfic reader and I am doing a project for my Film Genres class about fanfiction, the class is based on Star Wars and the extended franchise and fandom. I would love to find some amazing crossovers, especially since most scholarly works about fanfiction cite the enormity of the Harry Potter fanfic fandom.


** IMO the best HP/SW crossover you can hope to find is 'The Havoc Side of the Force' by Tsu Doh Nimh - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force]] and its companion 'The Unsuspecting side of the Force'...[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8594589/1/The-Unsuspecting-side-of-the-Force]]

Especially crucial to an HP/SW crossover is the way Magic and the Force is reconciled. Here, Magic is a seperate power and an anathema to the Force - which make Jedi and Sith for that matter, rather annoyed with Harry.

** The best is probably Havoc Side Of the Force, which is already mentioned, though that's mostly due to HK-47. I would say my next favorite is Discordant - linkffn(10016768) and then Equillibrium - linkffn(11417036). Neither one of those two are likely to ever get updated though, so they're unfinished before they really get going. There's also linkffn(11675231) which has a really interesting first chapter but mostly fails afterwards.

*** To be fair, HK-47 makes everything better.

** Havoc side of the Force is a must, and you might want to take a look at linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For) where magic is the Force unrestricted by anything.

** The aforementioned Darth Marrs is tops, but special consideration must be given for their masterwork titled 'The Katarn Side' Its glorious and made me cry simply with its misquoted chuck norris facts.

Sad Things Made Bright by Virodeil is also... Interesting. It's unfinished, and never really went anywhere but had a very interesting interpretation of Jango Fett.

Best of luck wading through the trash compactor of the internet to find more.

** I agree about Havoc Side of the Force. It's excellent. A few other fics are:

Force sensitive linkffn(7104491) is an excellent fic where a young Harry sees himself as just like Luke Skywalker and Wizards as Jedi gone down the wrong path.

Finishing the Hat by The Carnivorous Muffin linkffn(12322855) in which a very OC interpretation of female Master of Death Harry Potter (aka Eru Lee) awakens the Force to sentience.

Darth Marrs has quite a number of HP/Star Wars fics. My favorite is Revenge of the Wizard linkffn(10912355) and the Broken Chains series linkffn(7718942), linkffn(12040341)

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

*** Finishing the Hat is great, but it's pretty deep into Carnivorous Muffin metaspace, I'm not sure it can really be recommended for OP's purposes. I mean, it's a spinoff of a spinoff of The Art of Being Sisyphus, and the only HP character is not only essentially an OC but also grew up outside of the HP universe.
