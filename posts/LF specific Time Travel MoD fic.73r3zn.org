Looking for something in which I think Harry was granted the memories of three different dark wizards by Death (maybe Fate?) as he time traveled back a number of years. One of them was named Ezekiel (I think), the founder of Azkaban. Last I recall Voldemort had called a parlay with Dumbledore and congratulated him on how he made Harry into the perfect weapon, but Dumbledore was confused since he didn't realize that Harry was super dark like this.

Think the fic was abandoned, but hoping it's not and to add a follow on it.

One of my favorite fics. Sadly, hasn't been updated since 2015.
