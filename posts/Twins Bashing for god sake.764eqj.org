**** Do it! Ron's character is actually really nicely handled. He's an insecure kid who's parents favored his younger sister and didn't notice when his brothers picked on him growing up, who idolizes Gryffindor and hates Slytherin.

He also grows up a lot during the second and third years (so he does change).

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** Genuinely curious what would lead to authors wanting to bash the Weasley Twins. As far as I remember, they were one of the few who didn't believe Harry was the Heir of Slytherin and didn't seem to dislike him after he got into the Triwizard Tournament. On top of that they do seem talented and creative for their innovative pranks and developing a good business.

***** as far as i remember, this is Wrong. Its stated that the Gryffindor Quidditch Team (or Gryffindor at all) are calling him that. Its not explicit named that even the twins would do that and honestly, i think, they saw their loss with Humour. Surely, the whole Mass is named. But how did a teacher once in school told us: If there is a group of Troublemaker who disturb the Lesson, they dont say "x,y,z, disturbed the Class" they say "My class was stupid today", so ALL are blamed.

Incompetence. Inability to perceive and write the characters' less favourable and nastier facets as mere elements in the greater whole of the characters instead of defining the characters solely by such a single element.

** I wouldn't say they're bashed in linkffn(Accountable by Dyce) but they play a prank and /finally/ get told off properly by, like, /everyone/. And kneed in the balls.

It's a very cool fic, lighthearted and fun despite dealing with some serious issues, and there's a scene between Colin Creevy and Snape that made my heart grow like, six sizes.
