Hey guys! I am trying to find two Hermione time turner fics, but I have so many Hermione fics bookmarked that I'm failing at finding the ones I'm thinking of. (Though if you have any suggestions that aren't the two I'm thinking of, I'd be happy to read them, so long as they're not abandoned.) So the only part I remember from each fic is the actual time travel bit.

In one, Hermione is at the final battle (I think) and they're loosing (I think) and a spell hits her time turner (I think). Then, suddenly, her bloody mangled half dead body ends up falling out of the sky and landing on one of the house tables in the great hall (I wanna say it was Ravenclaw's table) during dinner (or breakfast, point is the table was packed with students). That's the part I remember clearly.

In the other, it starts out at the end of fifth year, right when Umbridge find the RoR. Hermione is running up one of the staircases in the castle, trying to use her time turner to go back a few hours to warn Dumbledore or her friends or whoever that the whole mess is going to happen, to try to keep Dumbledore from being almost arrested or something like that. Anyways, she trips up the stairs, the time turner cracks and the world goes sideways, and she wake up back in time.

I hope someone will know which ones I'm talking about... I don't remember pairings, though I think one of them was HG/SB? Or maybe HG/SS... I'm really not sure. The first one I'm almost positive was a marauder's era, and I feel like the second one was as well, or it might have been a Riddle era. I really don't know.

Like I said, even if you don't know these ones, if you have any other Hermione time-travel fics that are good, let me know. I'm not picky about pairings, so SS, SB, TR, RW, RL, LL, GW, others I'm not thinking of, or no pairing at all is good.

Thanks in advance!

** I have no idea what either of those are.

But... I am reading this Hermione/James Potter time-travel story. It starts off midway through Deathly Hallows, but pretty AU from the beginning. She accidentally is taken back to that Halloween night in 1981.

  Hunted by Voldemort, Hermione and Harry make a last stand in Godric's Hollow. When the Boy-Who-Lived lives no more, Hermione is thrown back in time into another battle where she has a chance to save not only Harry, but another Potter. --- Begins Mid Deathly Hallows, AU going forward.

** If you don't mind WIPs, I'm working on a story that's similar to your first one (definitely isn't the same one though). It's a HG/SB time turner fic.
