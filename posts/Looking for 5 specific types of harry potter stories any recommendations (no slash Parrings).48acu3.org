1 Lily and James Hogwarts years goes from year 1 to 7 and beyond (If there are any like that but they survive Halloween plz tell me) I can't find any good one's. 2 Lily and James come back to life during the graveyard scene in 4th year and continues from their mostly follows cannon event's 3 Harry and Ginny get together in 3rd 4th or 5th year and continues from their Canon event's mostly 4harry Ron and hermione stay at Hogwarts during 7th year instead of going to the countryside to look for horrcrux s cannon event's 5 Dumbledore surviving 6th year follows cannon event's past that


** I know a few stories that might fit, but none of them follow canon events after the various points of divergence you mentioned. For example, I honestly do not see how Dumbledore can survive year 6, and still let the events of year 7 happen like they happened in canon (well, I can, with him in a coma or such - but what's the point of creating a massive divergence, only to ignore it right away and follow the canon plot?).

**** "The Last Casualties" - Lily and James were placed in stasis and return during Harry's 4th year.

"Growing up Kneazle" - Harry and Ginny get together earlier than in canon. Since Harry is an animagus though, canon isn't followed up to that point anyway.

***** I like 'The Last Casualties' quite a bit. He writes about Hermione having a crisis of faith when Harry is badly injured that I think is really well done, a call and response sort of thing.

  "Lily, it's him! Take Harry and run!" It began the same way, but ended in a very different way. This change caused life instead of death for many. Life altering changes provide the Power The Dark Lord Knows Not. J/L, H/Hr

** If Lily and James came back after 4th year, it wouldn't make any sense for canon events to continue. Do you think Harry would be stuck at Privet Drive? Or do you think Harry would still have his confrontation with the dementors? Or do you think Sirius would still have to be on the run? The story would be completely AU from the moment they returned.

*** he probably means that it follows the ideas of prophecy, horcruxes and deathly hallows and doesnt make its own theory on how voldemort survived and how he is defeated

*** Are you on ff.net because I am in need of a beta for my stories plus you could help flesh out the stories a bit more.Though you'd have to be on pretty regularly as I like to update often?

As for what I mean I'll use Dumbledore surviving 6th year.

Imagine if he never got cursed but the duel with voldamort had seriously weakened him. He steps down as headmaster knowing he can't oppose voldamort directly so he allows snape to be put in place. He can't really stop the ministry takeover either but helps smuggle muggle born s out from number 12 while helping harry with the horrcrux hunt . He would then show up at Hogwarts for the battle knowing he will die

Or take Lily and James returning from the dead . No he wouldn't be locked at the durslys but be moved to number 12 from the start. True everyone would know there back but Hogwarts would still play out the same . Sirius would still die at the ministry since no one was at number 12 at the time in Canon I think the only major change would be occulamancy lessons since James wouldn't stand for snape doing what he did
