** There's Harry is a Dragon, and That's Okay linkffn(13230340) where Harry is crazily OP, but /not/ going around trumping everyone.

Legilimens? Imperius? Just blink. Bludgers don't pose any real problem, so Harry can just wait for the signal to catch the Snitch, which he also can do in seconds from the game start thanks to his eyes. Poisoning attempts all fall flat to the point that a friendly character just gives him a poisonous cake to dispose of it. His circle of friends is OP enough they could have just walk to Death Eater's base and clean it up without breaking a sweat (maybe even before reaching the lawn, seeing some of them are dragons, and one of them have the most OP attack weapon), but for most of the time, they're having a good time with responsible adults taking charge.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
