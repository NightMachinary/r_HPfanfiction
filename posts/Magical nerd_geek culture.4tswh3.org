What sort of music do you imagine the stereotypical nineties pureblood nerd listens to? What's the equivalent to sensations like Dungeons & Dragons? What sort of books do they write fanfiction of?

Too many fics use Muggle stuff for everything, and I thought it'd be interesting to make up a subculture.


** Personally I picture a fiercely competitive trading card game in the style of Yu-Gi-Oh or Magic: The Gathering building up around Chocolate Frog Cards for some reason

** Didn't JKR introduce Chocolate Frog Cards as an analogy for baseball cards/basketball cards back in the 90s? You could stretch those as having a system like M:TG.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

** I can't remember what fic it was, but they played a dungeons & dragons type game that was muggle based. So one character was a helicopter pilot and another was good at karate. The author called it Muggles & Somethingorother. The interesting aspect of it was that it was being used as an introduction of witches/wizards to the muggle world. And now I wish I could remember the name of the fic...

** Chamber of Secrets mentions "The Misadventures of Martin The Mad Muggle" A comic book that Ron reads. So they have Comic Book Culture. But it seems like Superheroes aren't their popular fare, it seems that they like comedy books more.

** There are 10k wizards (at best) all over Britain. I don't think any subculture can survive with such a spread out population. Also, purebloods haven't evolved further than XVIII century, so go Google their court entertainments.
