** I'll show AO3 a bit of love here:

"A Natural History" linkao3(214909) is a wonderful little Luna-centered story. It's relatively short and not much happens plotwise, though you get lot of character insight. There's implied Neville/Luna there, though one presumes that it will develop after the events.

"Spell It Out" linkao3(876098) is a really great little Harry/Hermione one shot. It takes place in an AU with a interesting (although perhaps often used in other fandoms) premise that's explained very early in the story. It's emotionally satisfying though perhaps involves a touch too much "why can't the main characters see the obvious?", though of course if they did the story would have ended almost immediately.

And just to add a third, "The Portrait" linkao3(496811), a quiet/minimalist H/Hr one shot in which both very little and quite a lot happens.

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

  "Mother's fulfilled her promise at last," Tom Riddle said, grinning widely as he struggled to get onto his feet. The blood pouring down over his broken nose and dripping over his teeth made his smile significantly more sinister than it would have otherwise been. "Does it hurt?" "What, falling five-hundred feet from the sky?" Harry started, with a voice as sweet as burnt sugar. His broom was smoking in a pile next to him. "Why don't you try it and then come back and tell me?" he said, flat-toned, and then - "Gosh, why aren't you dead, I landed on you from five-hundred feet!"
