Thinking a snarky harry who is on some level aware of the common tropes in fics. So he sets out speciffically to exploit any he comes across. The tropier the better.

Obviously a crack fic.


** Harry cleared his throat.\\
"Inventory. Character. Menu. Options. Equipment. Statistics."\\
No heads-up-display popped up in front of his eyes. Gamer fic was out.\\
"As slayer of the dark lord Voldemort, I claim Right of Conquest over the line of Slytherin!"\\
He waited. No surge of magical power, no swarm of owls to tell him of his inheritances.\\
Harry wobbled his jaw and started to cry, "Woe is me, I'm so abused. I wish I had a family...~sniffle~"\\
No cars pulling up with foster parents, no accidental magic warping him to another dimension.

Harry frowned. This fic might be tricky to work out.

*** "I no longer consider Privet Drive home!"

No flash and no Dumbledore, so it mustn't be a bashing fic.

Harry thrust his hand out, imagining a knight bus appearing. Nothing happened. No wandless magic instead of wands.

Harry focused internally, no glowing ball of energy inside. This was going from tricky to concerning. It never took this long to figure it out. Well, it looks like it was time to break out the nuclear option.

"I wonder where Voldemort is?"
