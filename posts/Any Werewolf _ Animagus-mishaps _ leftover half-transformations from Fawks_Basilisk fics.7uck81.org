Im basicly looking for fics that have the mc in a sort of half-beast state or atleast embraced their inner animal and thus shows in character traits/some marks on the body or whatnot.

My easiest comparison would be Naruto's teeth/whisker marks etc.

So im looking for a fic that has something similar? The only ones ive found where utterly horrible.

If it has a romantic plot too.... id be delighted.


** lnkffn(9406877) is the only one I can think of. It's HP/Avengers crossover, but I know that [[/spoiler][Logan]] is in the story as well as an OC. It's been a very long time since I started reading it, and I haven't caught up, but I wouldn't be surprised if other characters from the Marvel universe showed up. I do remember liking it a lot, though, and I've seen it recommended a few times before, so I definitely feel comfortable recommending it.

  Harry messes up the animagus process and begins a new journey. New friends and old share his discovery of life. What is in store for The-Boy-Who-Lived? What dangers will he face? Find out inside! WARNINGS: Begins entirely in HP world, crossover starts later. Harry is bisexual. Rated M to be safe.

*** seconding it! it's well into its marvel crossover at this point and i believe asgard had just become a major factor in the section i left it at.

Small warning that the ship may end up being a slash one at the end; last i checked it hadn't been definitely decided and harry was solidly in the 'still deciding' phase, but i know there were strong undercurrents being set up in case the plot went that way.

This one has Harry being turned into a basilisk...and being turned back into a human, and flipping back and forth every sunrise and sunset. Unfortunately it never got very far, but it's cheery enough while it lasts.

  Thanks to a healing gone wrong in the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is now a Basilisk. Able to turn into a "Human Harry shaped" Basilisk from sunrise to sunset, he tries to keep this a secret. How long until his secret gets out and the panic begins?

** Are you familiar with the Anita Blake series of novels? I recently read a crossover with HP. Harry is in St. Louis and gets attacked by a werewolf. There's a lot of plot happening in the werewolf and vampire worlds.

I think the story explains Anita Blake well enough that you shouldn't be lost if you're not familiar with the series.

*** So I'm guessing he's a werewolf here, right?

I'm not familiar with Anita Blake, so could you tell me, does he have control over his transformation, and keeps his mind in his altered state (like in "Underworld", or "Were's Harry") or is he like canon HP werewolves?

**** It's not that cut and dry. He is infected but it doesn't affect him like normal people. In AB werewolves are mostly in control when in werewolf form (except for the new ones). If startled they may attack or something, but otherwise mostly keep their minds intact.

***** Ok, two more questions.

Where does it take place? In the USA or in the UK, and if they travel, where do they spend more time?

From whose point of view it is? Harry's or Anita? Because synopsis suggests it's from hers.

****** It starts during summer and Harry is in St. Louis USA. It stays there for most of the story but Harry does go back to Hogwarts for a good chunk of the story.

The POV mostly switches back and fourth from Anita to Harry. There's a couple times a minor character gets a short POV but it's not often.

I won't spoil anything, but you can guess what he'll get from the first chapter. Bigger, physical, changes won't occur in him until couple chapters in, unfortunately.
