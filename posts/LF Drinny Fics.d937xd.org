I'm looking for suggestions on good Draco/Ginny fics. Only requirements are completed, a somewhat happy ending and main pairing only.

Preferences include: -longish -minimal OC insert characters. I don't mind OC but when it's an obvious author ego boner that drives all plot I struggle to stay engaged. -late or post Hogwarts

And honestly even most of that is negotiable.

Thanks!


** Check the [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/search][old portkey archive]], It was semi-curated, and Draco/Ginny was one of the focused on ships even if it was mainly a Harmony site.

  Treasure. Secrets and espionage. A mysterious oil painting. Draco Malfoy has gone missing, and Ginny Weasley has been hired to find him. It's the perfect storm for adventure---one with a dangerous outcome that no one, not even Ginny, could have predicted.
