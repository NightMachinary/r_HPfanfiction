Do you think it makes sense for wizards to have different names for things if they discovered them before muggles did?

For example, Uranus was discovered by Herschel in 1781, but if wizards discovered it earlier it's possible that they named it something else.

It's also perfectly possible that alchemists have their own confusing terminology for protons, neutrons, electrons, radioactivity and related things if they came across them earlier.


** It does make sense. I can see wizards being way ahead of the curve within astronomy, physics and astronomy. Sure they can't tell you a lot about muggle physics, but they managed to bend space to enlarge it. Magical researchers must have a good understanding of physics to start such spell crafting. They can regrow the bones in an entire arm and live way longer than the average muggle. We've got Professor Marchbank working as an examinator for over 100 years. Grindlewald got old for someone in captivity (and didn't die a natural death) and his aunt was still alive in 1997 (and didn't die a natural death). Dumbledore was very fit for someone his age. Wizards aren't dying of muggle diseases, perhaps because they've cured many of them. So their understanding of the human body should be way ahead of muggle biology.

The average student might not understand why certain spells have certain effects. But the people who created these spells did, so the knowledge must be somewhere out there. So it would make sense that the knowledge was named by the people who discovered it.
