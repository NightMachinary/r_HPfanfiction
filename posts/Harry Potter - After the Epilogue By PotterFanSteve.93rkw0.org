** Respectfully,

You have this tagged as discussion, yet what precisely did you want to discuss? Its length?

Also, I believe the Dangerverse exceeds this in length, with 1.9 million in the main series, but over 500,000 words in omakes, spinoffs, and AU whatifs. True it isn't just in one single FFN story entry, but it is one story.

*** The story is about 2 million words but it is the sequel to another 600k fic called after the war. Moreover, I think it is not complete, it only up to fifth year now and there are two more years left.

** It may be the longest single story but as to its quality? Ehhhh.

Furthermore the longest series that I'm aware of is the Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave at 3 million words. As if the sheer length isn't enough it is also well written and the plot moves at a reasonable pace. I continue to rec this fic even though it is Slash and I don't read Slash, which speaks volumes to its quality.
