**** The Dark Lord Potter forums, its pretty much the best place on the internet to find quality fanfiction, both through the DLP Library where you find a large amoubt of stories which have been highly rated and reviewed by members, but also because it includes the Scryer which is a fanfic search engine, it helps enormously to find fanfics fanfics which fulfill specific criterias.

This is DLP [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net]]

And this is Scryer [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]]

*** DLP is fantastic, but that's not what I'm thinking of. This website was dedicated solely to posting completed HP stories.

I remember the stories were categorized by pairing, too.
