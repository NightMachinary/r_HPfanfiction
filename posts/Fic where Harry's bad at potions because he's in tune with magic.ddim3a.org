:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
First time posting so I hope I titled and flaired properly. Sorry if I didn't.

I'm trying to find a fic that I think was Severitus. The major plot point I remember is that Snape realizes that Harry is terrible at potions because Harry keeps trying to make potions 'in tune' or something like that, and that he gets the timing wrong because he's trying to make potions at a more advanced level than his classmates.

Thanks :)

  When Severus Snape is left in charge of Hogwarts over the christmas break, he is less than pleased to discover Harry will be one of his charges. Events force him to face that Mr Potter may not be quite what he has assumed all these years. Year 6

**** You're welcome, I'm not really a severity's fan but this one stuck with me. I think it's because it's not year 1/ childhood Harry who ends up a completely different person. Also I'm a sucker for fics with interhouse friendships.
