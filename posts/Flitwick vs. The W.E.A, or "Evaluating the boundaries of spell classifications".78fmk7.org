So I spend an inordinate amount of time mulling over the canon magic system, mostly for worldbuilding purposes, and the indistinctions between Charms and Transfiguration (largely perceived on my part) often leave me in a bind.

We're informed in OoTP by Professor McGonagall that Conjuring Spells are typically learned at N.E.W.T level. She doesn't specify precisely in /which/ class they're studied, but given that they produce decidedly physical constructs and the fact that she mentions them in the first place, it can be reasonably inferred that Conjuration is a branch of Transfiguration. The Fire- and Water-Making Spells, however, are taught in Charms. Their behaviours are pretty much identical to non-magical fire and water, but the classification stands. /Wonderbook/ obfuscates matters even further by defining /Avis/ as the "Bird-Conjuring Charm". I might be overlooking things here, but doesn't that directly contradict JK's earlier comments on the distinctions between spell branches?

I can understand spells such the Engorgement Charm and Silencing Charm being classified as they are - to a certain extent. But it does provoke me to question how discrete the spell types actually are.


** Fire, water and unmentioned by you air charms can be probably explained by their elemental nature.

Avis is almost certainly an error, considering that we see that Harry's class was learning in that spell during transfiguration in the sixth year.

*** Completely forgot about that lesson! I'm a little puzzled by the elemental nature thing, though. Given how they roughly correspond to the states of matter, wouldn't they be better suited as Transfiguration concepts? Especially considering that they're covered in Alchemy... though I'm not sure if it's an entirely unrelated discipline in canon.

Considering that western esoterical thought (which includes alchemy) is deeply rooted in Greek philosophical thought, especially Platonic philosophy it makes a lot of sense for Potterverse magic to be inspired by it if JKR did this research.

And to not split into million posts:

Maybe transfiguration bothers with purely physical change, whereas messing with elements work on a more conceptual level? I'm heavily theorising there, of course.

In the Transfiguration section:

#+begin_quote
  [Conclusion] 1: Transfiguration works in a different way to Charms because it fundamentally alters the properties of the object of the spell (from [Observation] 1).
#+end_quote

Conclusions 41, 42, and 43 specifically deal with the crossover between Charms and Transfiguration.

In short, charms can create potable water and transfiguration cannot (because that would make it /not/ an exception to Gamp's Law).

I /believe/ the flame whip is a transfiguration (Taure is also unsure on this), and Incendio is a charm. I've always visualized Incendio as a standard spell-projectile-thing that lit whatever it hit on fire, not something that changed whatever it hit into fire nor something that acted like a flamethrower. (Anyone know which is canon?)

I recommend reading the whole document if you're going to think about HP magic.

** My view on things is that spell names are very largely vernacular. Wizards just /use/ them in a way that sorta-kinda-makes-sense, and then Ministry-sanctioned scholars /try/ to make up arbitrary, somewhat pedantic classifications based on the vernacular terms but they don't really /mean/ anything. Conjuration is only part of Transfiguration as a shorthand so that it can be taught as part of the Hogwarts Transfiguration curriculum, and because it looked close enough to transfiguration for the likes of Percy to give it a go-ahead. The Bird-Conjuring Charm is called that because that's how the man who created it started calling it, even if it doesn't make any sense. Even the Patronus Charm doesn't really fit the 'official' description of a Charm (it doesn't change anything's properties, it /creates/ something; if anything it's Conjuration), but "Patronus Charm" had a nice ring to it and that's how people started calling it.

** Transfiguration is the branch of magic that changes the nature and appearance of the object. Ie a ant into a lion, or conjuring.

Charms seems to be a class that teaches most every form of magic, with a lean towards utility.

I know this wont go over well. Stop listening to Rowling. Unless its published, its at best minor canon, at least when it comes to magic itself.

Rowling stated in the books that second years learn the incedio charm. Yet we see harry and co learn the aquamenti charm in 6th year. (obviously for plot but) In my mind, the incendio charm doesnt shoot flames so much as it set things alight.\\
The aquamenti charm creates water.

The reason these two charms are taught in charms and not transfiguration is complexity. You arent conjuring a lion. You are conjuring a stream of water. Flitwick is better suited to that than Minerva.

The speed and quantity can be altered, to be fair, though that might have been more to do with Seamus' poor casting than anything else.

** I think it's clear that there are two forms of animation, one within the school of Charms and one within Transfiguration. We've seen students make objects move under their own power in Charms (e.g. making a pineapple dance) but we've also seen Transfiguration used to give inanimate objects life (e.g. McGonagall's chess set).

With animation I think the distinction is in magical nature, not appearance. When you use Transfiguration to animate, you're giving the object the power of movement - from that moment on, the object has that power intrinsically. It is no longer an inanimate object but an animate one. In Charms, however, you're overlaying a fairly narrowly defined behaviour onto the object which remains reliant on the wizard for continual maintenance and direction. It remains an inanimate object in nature, albeit an enchanted one. While the functional result might be similar in most situations, I imagine there will be times where the difference in magical nature leads to different results when interacting with other magic.

I think the same can be applied to Conjuration by analogy. It's possible in both Charms and Transfiguration, but they are different in nature. Transfiguration conjuration would make objects that are physically identical to the real thing, but not magically identical (being composed of non-being and therefore ultimately disappearing). Charms Conjuration, on the other hand, would make a magical construct of the object, a kind of tactile illusion.

** Charms have an effect upon appearance and behaviour, while transfiguration have an effect upon nature.\\
Conjuration is changing "nothing" into "something", thus making it transfiguration.\\
The aguamenti spell is (incorrectly) classified as a charm because most others water-making spells use the ambient humidity, and because fire-making spells change the behaviour of something from "I'm not burning" to "finally I'm burning". Aguamenti is in fact a conjuration, but it was classified as a charm more than 2 thousand years ago and no one has performed to change this since.\\
Why, you tell me? Because there is an ancient debate regarding the nature of banishment : is it a transfiguration from "something" to "nothing" or a charm between "here" and "not here"? As long as masters of transfiguration will affirm banishment is a transfiguration, masters of charms will keep water-conjuring spells as charms.\\
It's the same (if quite more heated) as the debate between centaurs and humans : is astronomy a part of divination, or divination a part of astronomy?

** My headcanon is that:

- transfiguration involves infusing magic into things to create a gestalt object with different properties. The higher levels involve direct application of will and magic, specific spells that do exactly one type of thing to exactly one other type of thing are extremely limited and only really useful as learning tools to achieve that level.

- alchemy is using magic to rearrange matter (rearrange water into hydrogen and oxygen as a simple example)

- charms is a catch-all class term for castable magics.

- The various categories of spells (for example, jinx, curse, hex) are arbitrary, based on [public/Ministry] opinion and are not rigorous.

*** My headcanon about the last point:

- Jinxes, hexes, and curses are classified by effect.

- Jinxes are minor annoyances, and easily undone.

- Hexes have a more debilitating effect, and require specific counter-hexes.

- Curses are the dark magic that scars and kills, requiring very specific counter-curses to cancel their effects, with additional treatment required afterward, if the curse doesn't kill outright. (See Septumsempra)
