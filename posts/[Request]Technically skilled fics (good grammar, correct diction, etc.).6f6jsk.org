I've been reading entirely too many fics ranging from the simply unproofed to the painfully badly written. I'm starting to really loathe all the bizarrely common issues that crop up -- like pluralizing things by adding an apostrophe and S or mixing up "their," "they're," and "there" every single time they're used or misspelling a character's name over and over again. (That's not to say I don't understand /why/ these things happen in the less-than-professional world of fanfiction, of course.) Does anyone have any recommendations for fics that are technically excellent? I want some fics where the author has a clear mastery of the language, where the prose is excellent but not purple, where I don't feel the need to gouge my eyeballs out with a red pen at the end of every chapter.

Please note that I'm not necessarily asking for the "best" fics you have. And any type of fic is fine.

What are you talking about. Just because Voldemort is dead doesn't mean there's no conflict. That story has more conflict than 99% of FanFics where Voldemort is alive but never does anything: Fighting a shade of Voldemort, Hermione almost blowing herself up with her own magic, Hermione's constant lack of self esteem and confidence, Luna almost getting raped and sacrificed and finally Harry being more or less *dead* and Hermione using a necromantic ritual to pull him back.

***** No, it really does not. Simply because it has a soulmate bond and because of how ridiculously powerful Harry is as written, you /know/ from the beginning of the story that there can't be anything "bad" happening, or otherwise Harry wouldn't be able to continue acting as arrogant and powerful as he does. It's basically the storyline of Twilight; super rich powerful famous dude comes in and falls in love with smart but bullied girl. Throw in jealous lover for good measure. It's a soul bond so there's certainly no question of conflict in the romance itself, and also it means that if one of the main characters die, both of them will die which is /absolutely/ unbelievable.

In the Harry Potter books...sure, you never thought Voldemort would win...but everyone was wondering, right till the last few chapters. Who dies? Harry himself? Ron or Hermione? Oh god, Tonks and Lupin died? How many more? /That's/ conflict, even if you have a happy ending. In fics like Soulmate Bond, it's completely and utterly feel-good from the start to the end. Nothing permanently bad happens to the protagonists.

******** You said there's literally no conflict... now you say that you didn't find the conflict believable. You're shifting the goalposts, I have no idea what you find believable. When I read the story I was certainly worried about Luna in that situation and wasn't sure that she'd survive.

The notion that there can only be conflict if the protagonist could die is blatantly false anyway, there's even a whole genre of stories (prequels) where you know for sure who's going to live and who will die. As shitty as the Star Wars Prequels were, they certainly had plenty of conflict.

And I'm even willing to admit that a story like this with a super strong _ and_ competent Harry (you complained about Hermione being Mary Sue, I'd have mentioned the even more perfect Gary Stu protagonist first, but okay) certainly makes it harder to evoke believable conflict.

You seem to have pretty high standards in regards to conflict (there's barely any in most fanfics), which Fanfics would you say are exemplary in that they have believable conflict?
