** Most Harry soul bond fics have Ginny as the target, and generally as a result of the CoS incident. These stories usually emphasize how much they are in love and how great the bond is for their lives, but things really get repetitive after a few times.

*The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond*, linkffn(9818387), offers a new take on the soul bond, and it's a really fun read, especially when the girl was having her period.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

**** Great fic. Vance McGill writes good stuff. My only complaint is just the long waits for updates and beginning of a potentially great story that gets backburnered in favor of another story. But I digress

**** Know one without Ginny, /or/ Hermione? I always disliked the out of nowhere fangirl Ginny pairing, but after getting into FanFiction I read entirely too much H/Hermione. Now I'm sick of both pairings, now I'm a fan of more fresh and esoteric pairings, like Harry/OC or Fluer/Tonks/Daphne. And no gay Harry lol.
