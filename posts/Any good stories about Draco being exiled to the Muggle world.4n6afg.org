Hello! I'm looking for any stories where Draco is banished to the Muggle world for any reason. Any thing from time travel or punishment work, but please no non-magical AUs. I love some awkward fish out of water stories especially when that fish really really hates land :-)

Update: Wow...thank you all so much! My reading list is now full for the next month!

He's not banished, more like forced to flee. But it certainly matches what you're looking for.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

*** This is completely different than what I normally read...but I enjoyed it and I think it was last updated in May. So that is good. I really like how reflective Draco is, to the point where he can accept he is only an average wizard. He does seem to try hard to live up to the muggle expectations especially the librarian, which is a good thing. And I would almost say completely opposite of how he is in cannon EXCEPT he was trying to live up to expectations there too, just the really horribly warped ones of his parents.

  "For crimes committed against the wizarding and Muggle world while underage, I hereby sentence you to one year without magic." Draco stood stiffly, his knees locked to help keep him upright. So many spectators. Potter and Granger were there, Weasel-less. His knees finally buckled and he crumpled to the floor in a faint. Chapter 44 posted.

**** I just read another Harry/Draco that I LOVED where Draco goes into exile in the muggle world to escape the war. It is part of a series by pir8fancier that starts with linkao3(192712). This series is first person Draco that relies heavily on letters he writes to Harry. The character development is great though!

What specifically did you like about the characters in "Heres the Pencil?" - I have read so much fic (especially slash but all pairings) that I could probably recommend something similar.

***** I already read this one. It was really good. I guess what I liked best about it was that (a) it was one of the first few I read, and (b) the character development of both Harry and Draco was very believable. Harry is not sure he wants to join the aurors and Draco is tired of being stupid and goes out to try and remedy that. I thought their interaction was also more believable than I've read elsewhere (They are not hostile or fawning, but interact in a way that makes sense, given their history). Are you the writer of "Here's the pencil, make it work" by any chance?

****** Haha I am (weirdly) flattered because I love that fic but no I'm not the author. My ao3 profile is katelawyer86 and I have bookmarked and rec'd a lot there - [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks]] - but I've never written anything. Probably because I don't have any great ideas and to write a fic I would be proud of would be a huge undertaking...

For my fav fics with the most believable characters with depth and flaws, I love the authors Soupy__george and sarasgirl. Big shout outs to The Printed Press (linkao3(1124273) and One Hundred and Sixty Nine (linkao3(1124404) from Soupy_george and pretty much everything by Sarasgirl is amazing but one of my favorites for character development is Helix. Linkao3(3114812).

I also recently loved the Draco in the Gentlewizards Club and the sequel (linkao3(2106744)) - it felt like a very similar Draco to Here's the Pencil. Also Draco in There's Always The Moon is so beautifully written. Linkao3(6264406)

Anyway I'm always up for sharing recs as I read WAY too much fic - you should definitely message me if need or have a good rec!

  Draco's life after the war is everything he wanted it to be: it's simple, and quiet, and predictable, and safe. But when a mysterious curse shatters the peace he'd worked so hard to build, there's only one person he can trust to help him. After all, Harry Potter has saved his life before. Now Draco has to believe that Potter will be able to do it one more time. (A remix of If the Sun Goes Black by pasdexcuses)

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts.
