-Hides behind chair- Now, before you attack my choice of OTP (actually I have a lot of OTP'S and these two are my latest) please keep in mind that... I couldn't think of anything witty.

Oh, well.

So, Snamione fics? Any recs? I've read the wonder work of Loten of course, so I'm looking from something she hasn't written.


** I give you these in the hope that you never use the word Snamione ever again. As bad ship names go, that's truly awful.

  A Hermione/Severus body-swap fic.

/That's really all the summary that's given. I can't compare it to others of the genre, because I've never read any others, but as far as body-swap goes it seemed like a pretty decent story to me./

** Dont apologise for having Snape/Granger as an OTP. I love the pairing and folks who don't can keep their squicks to themselves.

Seeing as you've read the epic works of Loten allow me to recommend the below:

The Art of Brewing by Note-A-Flat

Self Slain Gods on Strange Altars (Dark, bleak, brutal but also beautiful and unique in my experience of SSHG)

The Savage

The Unspeakable Files

Hope Reawakened

** Found my last rec thread; reposting the whole thing here and saving this new thread because there're stories here I haven't read yet, omg. :D

- [[http://www.witchfics.org/fr/][Fire and the Rose by Abby and Anne]] -- The one that got me into liking the 'ship. :) I frequently rec this one to people to introduce them to HG/SS in general.
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=2981][Somewhere I Have Never Travelled by Strangeland]] -- Time Travel, but not the usual way
- The Phoenix Trilogy by grangerous ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4763572/1/Phoenix-Song-or-Hermione-Granger-and-the-HB-P][Phoenix Song]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5129305/1/Phoenix-Tears-or-Hermione-Granger-and-the-DH][Phoenix Tears]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7600629/1/Phoenix-Fire-or-Hermione-Granger-and-the-EW][Phoenix Fire]]) -- companion 'fic to HBP, DH, and replaces the epilogue. All three are epics and wonderful.
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=1574][Cloak of Courage by WendyNat]] -- Written pre-HBP; features lots of interesting Dark Arts theory.
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=12541][Vanity by Wartcap]] -- companion 'fic to HBP; time travel; very funny in places
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=2665][Unfinished Business by Ramos]] -- Ghosts!
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=2002][Soul Searching by Quillusion]] -- somewhat older 'fic, but kind of classic, imo
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=20534][The Problem with Purity by Silver Birch]] -- Epic length, innovative magic ideas. Also involves H/D (ancillary pairing)
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=250][Time Does Not Heal All Wounds by WendyNat]] -- This is in my to-reread pile; it's been a while and literally the only thing I remember is loving it, LOL. It also has a sequel, [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=646][Some Scars Never Fade]].
- [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=1480][In Annulo by ladyofthemasque]] -- post HBP; replaces DH
- [[http://restrictedsection.org/story.php?story=1284][For Someone Special by ladyofthemasque]] -- VERY long (575,984 words), very explicit, but very well written. Involves one of those psychic mental/emotional/telepathic bond things.

** Nothing wrong with looking Snape/Hermione. From what I've found, a lot of the longer stories, and the often recommended ones, there's such a strong divergence from canon anyway, either in background or personality.

I've looked over the recommendations here, so here's a couple more that I didn't see listed (sorry for any repeats)

linkffn(10984969) Swallows & Stars. Surprisingly sweet, a second chance sort of story. A bit OOC, but forgiveable.

linkffn(all I have to do by mymadness). I personally didn't like this one, but I can see the appeal.

linkffn(the problem with Purity by Phoenix.writing) kinda tropey but it was also written like six years ago. At the very least I found it entertaining.

linkffn(heart over mind by regann) is on my list, but I honestly don't remember much other than the first chapter Lol.

Oh! Big AU, but there's [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=5882][Phantom of Hogwarts]]. Link is ashwinder, but I'm sure it's hosted elsewhere if you didn't want to make an account. I can't remember if it's on FFN but I know I didn't find it on FFN originally.

** Seeing as most I've read have already been recommended, I'll go with some off the wall ones:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2155671][Slightly Less Sinister]] - "Hermione receives an offer from Lucius Malfoy to switch sides, and decides to take him up on it as an opportunity to get information. She convinces Snape to help her "prepare" for what's coming, and receives quite an education at his hands. This fic gets quite dark in deliberately exploring the dynamics of abuse."

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3317231][Miles Away From Any Warm Feeling]] - WARNING, this involves many threesomes with Severus+Hermione+Lucius, so if you're opposed to that, don't go anywhere near this. However, it's hilarious at times and I loved it despite its obvious OOC-ness.

Lastly, when I'm in need of smut and don't care about OOC-ness or high quality, my guilty pleasure is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1317626/Ms-Figg][Ms-Figg]] on FFNet. She has literally written DOZENS of Snamione fics of varying quality, many of them funny, some of them incredibly long (and surprisingly, completed).

Hope this helped a bit!

** My favorite fic of all time is a SS/HG called the Lioness Prophecies. It's been removed from the net but I'm happy to send the epub out if you PM me your email address. Since there is no link bot to help out, I'll provide a description for The Lioness Propechies. It's a Snape/Hermione story written pre-HBP so no horcruxes, Snape is a pureblood. The relationship takes place after Hermione is 18.

** Ashwinder is a good source! Old, though - it hit its heyday pre-HBP. But this means there's LOTS of stories that handwave the war as 'being won, good job Harry', and now Hermione and Snape can meet on equal adult terms. (Epilogue, what epilogue?) Start with Shiv5468, who OWNS this pairing in many ways, in my opinion: [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=1824]]

Also want to bump Pet Project by Caeria (I'm rereading it right now) and Unfinished Business by Ramos. I recently recced these two to a friend - they cannot be beat for complex, engaging plot and great characterisations (and perfectly written, lip-biting UST).

** WOOOOO. My favourite, favourite WIP that I've been waiting for TEN YEARS for an update on... Is FINALLY DONE. It's being posted one chapter a day until everything is up; it'll take a couple months.

If you like Snape and Hermione, definitely take a look. First couple chapters are slightly rougher than later chapters; she's posting one chapter a day right now to AO3 (I think the first ~53 are up on Ashwinder, though).

  Answer to the WIKTT "I'm Just a Gigolo" challenge. Harry asks Hermione a favor, but it will lead her to question her own marriage to Ron. Can Hermione continue to find contentment in a mediocre marriage and a completely unfulfilling sex life? When Hermione begins to see a gigolo for conversation and companionship, the foundation of her life is shaken to the core from revelations concerning every aspect of her life.This story was started in 2004 and is now AU, ignoring all new HBP and DH canon. Winner of Round Three Multifaceted's Endurance category (best challenge fic).

  #+begin_example
      Chapter 1 A/N: First of all, thanks to my beta Siren for improving on my sentence structure\.  I was a bit rusty when I started writing this\.The second thing is I've broken one of my rules for the WIKTT "I'm Just a Gigolo" challenge and that is the Virgin\!Hermione factor\.  I wanted to go dark and this seemed the best way to make it depressing\.  There is another rule I'm going to break, but you'll have to wait until that chapter is posted before I tell you\.  Don't worry, tons 'o smut on the way, must build the story first\.For those of you who are writing or are contemplating answering my Gigolo challenge, if you need to break a rule to make the story more interesting…sure, go ahead\.  As Capt\. Barbosa once said, "It's more what you call guidelines than actual rules\."Here are the rules for the 2004 WIKTT "I'm Just a Gigolo" challenge:1\) You must give a reason why Snape is a gigolo\. Did he fall into it by accident \(think of the movie 'Loverboy'\), did he do it on purpose \(to get more info out of the wives of Death Eaters or supplement his income\) or some other combination of events\. I want to know "WHY" and why he continues to do it\.2\) Snape has kept his identity secret so far\. Somehow, someway, his clients never know that it's him: blindfold, potion, spell, hood, dark rooms, mask, etc\. Until\.\.\.\.\. You can have Hermione find out or never know it's him\. You can have it where only Hermione knows or blows his identity wide open to the wizarding world or somewhere along the spectrum\. It's up to you whether his "hobby" remains a secret or not\.3\) Snape is very, VERY good at what he does\. Why is he good? Legilimens? Those hands, that voice, his knowledge of anatomy? Why? \(Hint: This is your cue for lots of lemons and tons 'O smut\) You can use instances with current clients or flashbacks, his first trick, and how he learned\.4\) Hermione is a virgin\. Why is she going visit a gigolo? How does she stumble upon Snape? Through the reference of a good friend, by accident and where?5\) There must be multiple visits between Snape and Hermione\. \(They can't fall in love with each other just because of one trick, can they? Let's be reasonable and have a reason for more smut\.\)6\) You must list why they fall in love\. \(Is one of them reluctant to do so?\)7\) There must be some anticipation with the smut\. I know that some of the best erotica I've read had a long lead up time with lots of anticipation, so let's make that a rule that there must be some, the longer, the better\. Remember that foreplay is not just for the body, but for the mind as well\.By the way, if you do respond to this challenge, please post on WIKTT so that 1\) I know that it is a response to the challenge and 2\) I'll know that I have something to read that day\.Options:1\) Happy or sad ending, you pick\. Do they have a "happily ever after" or does one leave the other \(or have a preexisting reason why it could never work out?\)\.2\) Angst, dark, drama, romance, fluff, humor, PWP, your pick\. What ever inspires you\.3\) Length: one\-shot or epic length welcome\. Any length, we just want to read a story\.4\) How does the wizarding world deal with Sexually Transmitted Diseases \(STD's\)? Is there a potion to block AIDS? Or are wizards and witches naturally immune? Or are there other STD that are unique to the wizarding world? \(I've always wished this one aspect was covered in some of these stories\.\)
