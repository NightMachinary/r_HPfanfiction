I am looking for adventure and world building fan fictions, where they travel to either different time periods, different countries or interact with different cultures or discover new magic or creatures,or include curse breaking etc. preferably with either Harry or Hermione as main character but I am willing to read about other characters as well. Fics where the main character has special power, talent or interest. maybe they can talk to animals, enchant objects. I am looking for adventure and travel mostly instead of political type fics.

I read a fic where harry could see the history of anyone or anything he touched and one where he becomes the God of luck due to people praying to him as a joke because he is lucky which made him a god( can't remember the name of fic, post link if anyone knows)similar fics.


** For different countries I don't think you'll find a better option than linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) you get very in-depth on Britain and France with a decent look at Germany and a cursorily view of Italy and a few others. There's also all the shit with the fae but like that storyline was never finished.

The story's biggest selling point is the world building followed by the friendship between Harry and Voldemort so if that's your thing give it a try.

**** Seconding Of a Linear Circle for this. It has the best world building I've seen for the founders era, plus the few later stories that follow a particular character living through the thousand years between then and Harry's time. Most of the founders era fics I've read only focus on Hogwarts, so I really loved reading about Moray and Castile and all the different countries and cultures in this series.

** HP and the Secret of Atlantis is kind of like this. They get on the trail of some Atlantean artifacts and end up chasing / getting chased around the world, discovering ancient magic, etc. (no time travel per se though). linkffn(13111277). The author has written a completely insane amount, like several 500k+ word fics. Atlantis (242k) is the only one I have read, but it wouldn't surprise me if the others have similarities.
