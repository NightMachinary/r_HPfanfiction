Since I find the entire trope just as repugnant as the man, are there any stories where Snape deludes himself into thinking that he is Harry's biological father and it blows up in his face? Preferably with him getting punished for rape or whatever other crimes he committed in the process of getting that idea.

Please, no slash or Death Eater revisionism.


** Don't know any story that fits that. The closest story I know is a story where Snape is Harry's father (but doesn't know it), and where, after it's revealed, the two still loathe each other.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
