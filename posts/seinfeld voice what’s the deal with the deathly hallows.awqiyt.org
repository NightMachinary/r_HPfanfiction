Why do fics (where relevant) always make the story of the three brothers literal? That Death exists and made them, and gathering them actually grants someone (Harry) power over death? Especially when canon states the peverells were just crafters who made them by themselves.

Because it's magic!!! /waves hands mysteriously/

The serious answer is that fanfiction writers want to "correct" the flaws and gaps they saw in canon. Over the last few books, Harry had gone from best DADA student in their year, who mastered the Patronus at age 13, to a brooding hobo living in a tent by Book 7, who spammed Expelliarmus and let his friends pull the weight. Fanfiction is a means to make Harry powerful, letting him win by magical strength and feats, instead of beating Voldemort with pure luck in DH, which is less symbolic (what JKR wanted the ending to be, with all her railroading and weird choices, eg, Molly killing Bellatrix as symbol of true love conquering) and more satisfying and cathartic (which is what the readers wanted the ending to be.)

Voldemort has 50 years of training over Harry, so the best way to make it up their difference is to give Harry a straight powerup via plot device. And it's not always the Hallows. Sometimes it's Harry unlocking a creature inheritance, or becoming a phoenix animagus, or forming a soul bond or something.

IIRC it seemed to be pretty clearly expressed that he was simply more talented as well.

** Simply, I think people make them literal because the items are shown to be literally real. It's amusing that there are so many stories that do this because it's actually a subversion of the idea of a mythical story. The fact that it's real is usually a clever twist!

**** Canon doesn't 'basically state that they were crafted by the Peverells'.

Dumbledore implies it or says that it might be the case. These were basically oral legends turned into children's stories.
