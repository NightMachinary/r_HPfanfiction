Any ship is fine. Any genre is fine, must be well written. Ideally I'd like a narrator even more unreliable than Harrymort in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horocrux]], closer to the narrator in say /Fight Club/ but I'll take what I can get as these kinds of works aren't as common.

Thanks in advance! :)


** My narrator is moderately unreliable here:

I'm trying to remember the name of one narrated by Draco, who's in a mental hospital, but I can't, sorry.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** Definition of unreliable narrator, summary seems silly, but it's actually quite good linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10868642/1/Blurring-Reality]])

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.
