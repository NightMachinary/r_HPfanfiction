** It was my first full-length novel in English, quite a bit above my English proficiency at the time, but I really didn't want to wait the several months it would take for the book to come out in French.

By the time I reached the scene of Dumbledore's death, I was kind of used to deducing the meaning of many words and sentences and just carry on if I really couldn't get it from the context. I barely used the dictionary because it took to long. It worked rather well, until Dumbledore died. Cause I didn't know the words dead/to die (yes, my English was wobbly). And I understood he had fallen, but not that he had fallen FROM the tower. After maybe a dozen pages not understanding what Harry and everyone else was making such a big fuss of, I finally resolved to pick up the dictionary.

I looked up "dead". I checked the spelling in the book. Double-checked the dictionary for some secondary meaning I might have missed. Re-read the page where he dies. Established that yes, I had understood properly this time. Put the book down and cried.

Bottom line: don't read books about characters you love when your grasp of the language is too weak to detect a murder in plain sight...

** My little cousin had a sheet in her bedside drawer where she had a list of points on why Snape would turn out evil in Book 7. She cried if you argued with her.

Everyone was unsure about Snape after Book 6.

**** She was 16. I know, pretty old but she prides herself on being the same age as Harry for every book.

I was older so I was not into HP then (as I am now) and used to laugh at her. Our other cousins would troll her saying Snape was definitely good==hence the sheet of paper, to argue her points with notes.

In all of this, I can't remember her points. I'll ask her.

One point I remember is that since in the first book Harry thought Snape was bad and turned out not yo be, in the last it would be opposite. We were all expencting Snape to be good, so it would turn out to be opposite. She was suspicious of Snape in every book.

She was also convinced Harry would die. She took the Prophecy very seriously.

Actually, I borrowed her books when I read the series for myself and I remember calling her after book 4 to ask whether Hermione/Ron are going to date and when. I thought it would be by book 5 as it was so obvious. She laughed and wouldn't tell me. I thumped her after I read book 7==although in all the other dismal events, I looked forward to their getting together.

She always said she was jealous I still had Harry Potter left to read while the excitement of not knowing what would happen was over for her.

** Ah, yes. Saturday 16 July 2005. Sent my dad to buy the book at midnight because I didn't want to be spoiled.

Started reading immediately, sitting on my bed.

Got to Dumbledore's death around 6am. The world was quiet. The sun was coming up.

Put the book down. Stared up at the ceiling, numb. Took a minute or two.

And then I picked the book back up and kept going.

Even though Snape's betrayal and a plot to kill Dumbledore had been teased throughout the book, with the unbreakable vow happening right at the start, the ending was still a shock.

**** In DH? I think everyone recognised that Snape's true loyalties remained unclear even after he killed Dumbledore, with the conversation between Snape and Dumbledore in the forest which Harry overhears from his broom being the major clue that it wasn't so clear cut that Snape = evil. But I was personally 50/50 on which way it would go.

** No idea.

I remember six things about the first time I read the books.

1. I would have to read them (well, the first one) before I was allowed to watch the film (I would assume this happened but we ended up watching it at the home of some family friends so possibly not).
2. For some reason we were wandering around a hospital when I was reading Chamber of Secrets in the "adult edition" (read: small paperback with a muted, non childish cover) copy I had of the book. I was literally following my mother whilst reading it.
3. My mother stuck the dust jacket of HBP over OOTP and gave it to me. For whatever reason, I did not read any of the cover pages and just flicked straight to the opening lines of Dudley Demented. I was not amused.
4. I was meant to wait until my birthday (which is in late July) to read DH but my mother let me read it earlier than that.
5. Someone at school was talking about how fast they read DH and while I don't know if I interjected or not but I do remember thinking "Ha! I read it faster". (Reading things fastest was a Thing at school in 2005. I assume we hadn't grown out of it by 2007.)
6. I remember flicking through one of those I guess you'd call it prediction books prior to the release of DH. And I think I also found Mugglenet but I didn't really do anything with that.

I also wrote my name in my copy of OOTP in gel pen so I probably read that in 2004 since that was when we had the gel pen craze. Ha! I just checked. I actually wrote 2004 as well. But I do not remember doing this.

So... I do not remember my reaction. At all.

I think I was initially not impressed by HBP but these days I'd probably call it my favourite.

** I cried a lot, especially since the both of them were amongst my favourite characters. I never believed in Snape betraying Dumbledore though since his actions were foreshadowed. But Jesus, it made me cry so hard.

** I immediately thought that Snape and Dumbledore had been communicating through legilimency, and that "Severus, please" meant "please kill me."

I also thought that Dumbledore was a dick for petrifying Harry and making him watch helplessly.

And that there was some strange issue with the spell because AK is supposed to make you just drop in your tracks, not throw you over the balustrade.

I always thought Snape was doing it on Dumbledore's orders, and that he---while not being a nice man---was at least on the "right side" of the war.

** I sort of saw it happening from the moment Hagrid mentions their argument in the forest and it remained my headcanon that this was Dumbledore's plan until it was proven so at the end of DH. Whether it was my brain refusing to believe that Dumbledore could be so painfully wrong or because of the ease with which Dumbledore spoke of death made me think he'd always arrange it to die on his own terms, I don't know. However I did find the emotions Harry feels during the song of the Phoenix and Hagrid's cheerful denial followed by sadness quite heartbreaking.

** Honestly, I guessed that Dumbledore was going to die by the end of HBP about 1/3 of the way through the book. So the death itself wasn't all that surprising. The surprise was that it was Snape that killed him. I vaguely remember having a "huh. that's weird" moment because I really thought Rowling was going to have Draco do it.

That said, I never thought that he killed Dumbledore as a betrayal. It was too much of a red herring to make it seems like Snape was pure evil. Rowling was all about trying to subverting expectations about Snape, especially given his unbreakable vow with Narcissa early in the book. So I never believed that Rowling would validate Harry's negative view of Snape - especially so close to the end of the series.

Cedric's death gave me much more by a WTF moment, really.

** From what I recall I didn't have any strong reaction to it. I didn't care about Snape or Dumbledore one way or another and I remember not really seeing it as anything but a plot point. It was also fairly obvious that something else was going on. It was Harry's pov and there was a recurring pattern of Harry jumping into (wrong) conclusion when it came to Snape. It was also obvious JKR was building Snape up to be a ‘mysterious' more than meets the eye kind of character, so there /had/ to be some unexpected explanation.

** "Oh wow." *continues reading

I don't know, that scene in the books just didn't spark anything in me. Maybe it's because I read through the series very quickly, but I just wasn't that attached to any Harry Potter character. Except maybe Lupin. Lupin was a decent guy. I probably would'v been more emotional if it was the movies, but Dumbledore's death didn't really move me.

** I was told Snape killed Dumbledore. (By my own request, as I'd abandoned the series back then and didn't think I was ever going to re-enter the fandom. Welp.) I don't really remember my reaction, but I think it was somewhere along the lines of, "Oh, really? Well, I guess that makes sense." I was more upset when I learned that Fred died, tbh.

It's too bad I'll never know what my full reaction would have been, though.

** I cried the first time cause I was 8 and now I'm like- Wow. Yeah, moving oooonnnnn! because it was shocking the first time becuase I was in love with 'light is all good and voldy is bad' also, I hadn't discovered fanfiction, or any sort of opposing pov's. Now, I can understand killing Dumbledore was nessacary both for his plans, and for the plot, even if the plan didn't work anyways.
