Hey guys, I'm gonna be spending upwards of sixty hours in trains and planes over the next few weeks and am looking for some long fics.

Not really picky about content as long as they're long, well written and not harem fics. I'm hoping to get several that are at least 300k+ words each to keep myself occupied.

In-progress, completed, or abandoned, what are your favorite long fics?

  It was still called the "Noble and Most Ancient House of Black", though it had been years since any of the Blacks that approved of that name had lived there. Sirius Black would be a disappointment to his parents, but Harry Potter - the home's other resident - was a credit to his. Both were proud of that. Sequel to "Innocent", "Initiate" and "Identity".

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
