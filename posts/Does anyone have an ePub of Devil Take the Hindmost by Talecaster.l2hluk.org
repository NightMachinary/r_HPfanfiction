With ffnet being dumb and not letting sites like ff2ebook access them, I am having a hard time finding ebooks of ffnet exclusives. I only really have time to read fanfic when driving, so I download them as ePub files and play them with Voice Dream. Thanks for your help.


** [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webtoepub-for-baka-tsuki/]] but the generated EPub is much lower quality than FanFicFare (in terms of metadata and formatting, of course, all words are included).
