Had a Harry that managed to avoid the capture by the magical world until he was recently found by Amelia Bones. Is sent to Hogwarts before the 5th year. Harry and Draco are good friends and have known each other for a while, without Lucius Malfoy knowing. He tries to use Draco to see what Harry knows but it doesn't work since they are already friends. Harry is friends with other magical creatures as well.
