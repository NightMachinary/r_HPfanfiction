Hello,

So I really love all of these fics so any you want to throw me would be great, but really importantly I have found someone who is interested in joining the community, but they need a fic that ticks basically every single box for them, but they fall in love enough with fanfiction to join the community for real, you get me?

Sadly, none of her fic needs are for what I typically read so I really need help finding at least one if not more fics that fit

Evil Harry, he hides it at first and then he turns on his friends. The relationships should be canon or just no relationships. Lastly there needs to be a fight. Against the ministry, Dumbledore, or Voldemort, there needs to be a real fight not a social based fic. 

Please help!!!
