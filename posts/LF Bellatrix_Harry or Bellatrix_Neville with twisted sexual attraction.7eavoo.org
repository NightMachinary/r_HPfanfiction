Harry and Neville are happily married with their Partners (Book Partner for Neville, not Luna), but at some Point they are encountered with Bellatrix again, like she somehow survived the Battle or it wasnt "her" but a double or whatever. Actually happy married, they grow attracted to her, because she can "sense and fulfill all of their hidden affections". A imaginary Bellatrix who mess up with their minds would also be good, so that they imagine that instead of their Partner, its Bellatrix they are having sex with. Both have a reason to kill her, but cant, because subconciouscly they are attracted to her. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1926924/chapters/4159980]] (He meant to Kill her) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6927447/1/]] (Ouroboros) are going in that way, but whiile in the first Bella is to kind, there is to much brutality in the second. I would like to have the more calm and seductive one.


** I don't think I've ever seen Neville/Bellatrix, and now I have a strange desire to find out how that plays out. There have been a couple where she 'fixes' Frank & Alice, but... huh.

*** Harry Potter and the Sisters Black (PWP, very long, not great) contains a Neville/Bellatrix/Ginny scene in [[http://ficwad.com/story/12613][ch 25]] by the Ficwad reckoning (censorship resistant), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5218660/33/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sisters-Black][ch 33]] on the FFN repost (IDK if there are any additions).

I don't remember if there are any other Neville/Bella scenes, but it's 100k+ words and nearly 100% porn, so I wouldn't doubt it.

** The one I remember with something close to Neville x Bellatrix was a crack fic where Luna and Harry go to Azkaban. Neville somehow wins Bellatrix and the Lestrange Brothers in a poker game and they become his house elves.

  AU PoA: When Luna Lovegood is condemned to Azkaban prison for her part in opening the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is the first to protest. Minister Fudge is reluctant to comply, but then again he never really had a choice in the first place. Oneshot.
