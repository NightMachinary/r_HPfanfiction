I cannot remember exactly how many fics I have seen which somehow get names wrong that are otherwise great.

Like, exactly why do you people call:

Dolores Umbridge: Delores, Doloris, Delares

Alastor Moody: Alaster, Alastair, Alister

Etc. ad nauseum.

If you are a writer and can upload your fics, you can definitely search the names of the god damn characters you are writing about. Get a beta or something, I don't know. Just please try.

******* ~scribbles down some ideas~

Let's see, the beautiful Princess Daphne Greengrass who-was-never-characterised-in-canon has her wedding to the boring Prince Gregory Goyle arranged, but she ends up running out on the wedding right at the altar.

On her way out of Hogwarts, however, she and her house-elf are ambushed by Blonde Hairdo and taken captive; with little other choice, King Greengrass calls upon Harry Potter and his snarky sidekick Crookshanks (borrowed from Hermione, natch) to rescue her.

A globe-trotting adventure ensues, Griphook shows Harry how to use some fancy-schmancy secret goblin magic, Blonde Hairdo threatens Daphne ("her /old/ nose!") to get the King to lower his estate wards and let the Wizzballs take all of his lush green turf.

Harry saves the day, discovers from Griphook that he has a lovely big inheritance (most of magical Britain) and is a fancy prince and everything, so he bursts in to halt the wedding and marries Greengrass and they all live happily ever after.

**** Not at all. Well, definitely not always. I have to /constantly/ go back and take the r out of Voldemort because 'lder' is a common (enough) combination in English and 'ldem' is not. Fingers just automatically go there. And sometimes I don't even see I've done it.

American writers definitely would not do it by sound because they have a rhotic r, so 'Voldemort' and 'Voldermort' sound different. (Nor would those from Cornwall and Devon I expect.)

** I don't often encounter this problem with characters that come up often like the two you named, probably because if I did see that happen, I'd just drop the story in question.

I do think that for some characters it could be forgiven though, for instance, Professor Babblings first name is Bathsheda, which isn't a real name and also looks a lot like the real name Bathsheba. Or Rabastan, which again is not real and very similar to Rastaban, which is a star in the Draco constellation.

So yeah, my advice is if a story can't get some common characters' name right, drop the story. Trying to hold fanfic writers of all people to a higher standard is only going to frustrate you as they likely don't care.

******* Tom Riddle wasn't French, so it seems to me that the way he pronounced his made up name is how it ought to be pronounced.

Similarly, some American cities have historically French names, but the people living there now don't pronounce it the same as someone from France would read it.

Example - Gautier is pronounced "Go-Shay" and if a French speaker asked a local for directions to "Gah-tee-ay" they'd be laughed at.

******** The way Rowling pronounces it is the French way, and it sounds a lot more menacing and "better" that way. My headcanon is that Riddle knew the correct pronunciation and got so frustrated with all his fellow countrymen pronouncing it wrong and making him look like a weenie, that the "He-who-must-not-be-named" effect came into play due to his not wanting to hear it any more.

******* So in high school, I had an American Humanities teacher who fancied himself a bit of a comedian. On the first day of school, one of the students had a French student with her--she'd been on some sort of exchange program over the summer. This was the front-and-center girl, so they're both right up there in front of the teacher. The conversation as I remember it, went like this:

"Oh you're from France? I can't speak French, but I can laugh in French." The teacher proceeds to lean over and get in this poor girl's face and loudly do the dumbest parody of the stereotypical "French laugh". I just sank down in my seat.

Ove twenty years have passed since that mortifying moment, but every time someone mentions French and laughing, that is what I think of.

***** Jim Dale gets it right for the first 3. He changed after the first movie came out.

I remember when I was a kid and there was some controversy between my sister and me about the right way to pronounce Voldemort. We found a Harry Potter site online (this was back in the days of dial-up internet and the original iMac) where you could click on different words and someone would pronounce them. We scrolled down to Voldemort, clicked on it, and the audio said, "We do not speak the name." That was the best anyone has ever trolled me.

** Not that I've uploased anything yet, but I keep getting names wrong because Rowling uses uncommon spellings of real names and comes up with things like Karkaroff (which if it were a real name, would be Karkarov) or Rabastan (the most irritating) and because McGonagall is just a swine of a surname.

Even with editing passes, I know I will miss some. Bathsheda Babbling got pointed out down thread and it never occurred to me that Bathsheba Babbling might be wrong. And, when you google 'Bathsheba Babbling' the Bathsheda Babbling wiki page comes up and google does not ask 'did you mean...'

I /do/ try, but honestly, Rowling does actually make it hard.

** I try to be as accurate as possible with my names and rarely get them wrong, but there have been a couple of incidents in my fic /Have You Ever Seen the Rain/, where I misspelled Roger Davies' name as Roger Davis.

However, subtle differences like these actually worked in my favour because I was having the fic take place in a massively AU-setting that wasn't technically real, just a copy of another reality - the canon HP Universe - so these in hindsight actually worked as a way of foreshadowing what was to come.
