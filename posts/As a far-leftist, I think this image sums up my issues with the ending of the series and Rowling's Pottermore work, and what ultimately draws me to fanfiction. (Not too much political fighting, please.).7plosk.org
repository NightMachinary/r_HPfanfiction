** So let me breakdown your issues one by one, and see if I can understand them:

- Harry should have done more for muggleborns: This, in my mind, gets blown out of proportion. Muggleborns aren't really persecuted until Voldemort's coup. There already existed a muggleborn minister, several muggleborn department heads (Dirk Cresswell). Not to mention, the only /real/ hate speech we hear, are from the Malfoys, who are extremists. Here's the thing, if muggleborns were persecuted, /there wouldn't be motivation for Death Eaters/. They'd be satisfied with the status quo. It was in fact, the rise of prominent muggleborns, and overall idea that muggleborns were equal as any of them, that spurred them into action.
- House-elves: I agree with you there. Dobby and friends get the short end of the stick.
- Harry didn't form his own group: But he did, the DA. He was kept out of the fight, and so he taught his own group. They called it Dumbledore's Army because of Fudge's paranoia. At the end, it's Dumbledore's Army who are fighting alongside the Order.
- The Aurors: The Auror's aren't like the FBI as much as they are the FBI counter-terrorism unit. They work on catching dark wizards. For Harry, who lost his parents to a dark wizard, I can see how it's appealing to join the group whose job it is to catch Voldemort and those like him, and maybe, stop another child from getting orphaned.

Harry is the opposite of Voldemort. He's a talented wizard, but a great man who's willing to do what's right over what's easy, especially for those around him. Say what you will about his passiveness, but at the end of the day, he walked to his death, something so much of the fandom writes off.

*** Alright, lets talk about Harry's sacrifice for a moment. First things first, I acknowledge that people die in wars and the death of a select few can save many more. As Bismarck said, Iron and Blood drive change, not grand speeches. My issue is not that Harry was willing to sacrifice himself. My issue is that he was very stupid about it.

He did not try to find an alternative to remove the Horcrux (surgery, cursebeaking, basilisk venom + phoenix tears). But for arguments sake lets say that Harry had to take a killing curse for the team. He is walking up to the Death Eater camp and then just surrenders himself. Just think how many lives could have been saved if he used his clock and Gryffindor's sword to take a few Death Eaters like Bellatrix with himself. He knew that others would have to finish the fight. He's doomed to die that night. So why not make it easier for his friends?

You don't win a war with non lethal weapons. The Soviets did not win the Eastern front with stun batons. The Battle of Britain was not won with tear gas. Rowling turned Harry Potter into a war story where the protagonist is fighting magical Nazis but forgot how National Socialism was defeated. When the Allies were done with my country there was nothing left standing. But in Rowling's utopia a war is pretty much inconsequential and war criminals are left walking free.

**** This issue is pretty much my main gripe with the Series:

The stake against Voldemort was extremely high. Voldemort winning and consolidating his power in Magical Britain would lead to deaths of thousands or even millions. They were fighting against a monstrous enemy who was a combination of medieval barbarism/sadism and Nazi nihilism (or in other words, an enemy even worse than the Nazis or ISIS), and yet JK Rowling wouldn't even let them use lethal force during the Final Battle.

For example, the Trio knocked out Fenrir Greyback after he had already mutilated Lavender Brown. Why didn't they follow up with a lethal strike to put that sadistic serial killer permanently out of business? We saw Greyback getting back up later, ready to torture, mutilate, and murder again.

Fuck that!

--------------

I totally hate the argument "killing will make you as bad as them".

No Stacy, killing the psychotic inbred cannibal isn't going to make you as bad as a psychotic inbred cannibal. Everyone who dies from here on out is all your fault. Fuckin' idiot.

And even if it does make me just as bad, one man's soul, one man's conscience, is not worth more than the lives of thousands! Yes, I will stoop to the bad guy's level and it will be worth it.

**** First, Harry didn't have possession of Gryffindor's sword. They lost it in the vault, and Neville recovered it in the scrum after Harry's death.

Second, Harry's death was an act of self-sacrifice. It needed to be. His death cast self protection on all of Hogwarts after. No one died after Harry died. So he actually saved more lived than he would have of he had "taken Bellatrix with him"

Lastly, what happened in the WW wasn't quite a war. The first was closer to how the KKK acted in the 50s and 60s. Many KKK members were prominent leaders in society, and weren't prosecuted. But, remember only Malfoy, Nott, Crabbe/Goyle and McNair walked free. Barty Crouch allowed the aurors to kill, and several were killed like Rosier.

The fact is, there just aren't that many Death Eaters, and the movie increases the scale more than it should.

***** The sword appears in a time of need. There ought to be a way to get it back since Neville managed just that. The KKK did not build concentration camps. But the Muggleborn commission used Azkaban as Muggleborn KZ. They were executing their own Final Solution. That is not just some pissed clansmen trying to kill a few Black guys for the fun of it. As a German, I can tell you that Voldemort was basically using Hitler's playbook. Voldemort was using Pureblood supremacy for his own goals of power, not out of conviction like the KKK. Voldemort was not a pureblood. The KKK comparison falls apart in that aspect.

****** The two times the sword /has/ appeared, it's been when necessary for self-defense, not aggression. Also, you need the Sorting Hat, can't pull it out of thin air. Additionally, Godric prided himself on nobility, so a sneak attack/kamikaze might not have qualified. Also, why the sword? If he /was/ going to take people with him, why not use his want. A severing charm to the neck from behind is just as effective. Also, as I said before, doing this would be counterproductive. By sacrificing himself when he had a chance to walk away, Harry creates a similar protection for those at Hogwarts like his mother created for him. That saves more lives than a suicide run at several death eaters.

Azkaban actually wasn't quite a muggleborn kz. In /Deathly Hallows/, there are plenty of the wandless that are wandering around, begging people. The only muggleborn we know that go to Azkaban are high profile prisoners. Other non-muggleborn high profile prisoners /also/ went to Azkaban.

Your counterpoint to why Death Eaters weren't the KKK is rather weak. The Nazis systematically exterminated Jewish people on a large scale. The KKK worked on a far smaller scale, were organized, and led double lives. Until Deathly Hallows, most of the Death Eaters led a "normal" life in society, "hiding" their identity as Death Eaters. Add in the fact that there are only 28 death eaters? It wasn't a war, it was a power struggle.

******** Well, several reasons I think. All of the Death Eaters are very talented wizards/witches, maybe Crabbe and Goyle aside. Also, Voldemort used to have armies filled with half-humans/magical beings. He also used to raise armies of inferius.

I also think there really aren't a lot of Aurors. Umbridge says the Aurors haven't taken anyone in 3 years. That suggests they're a pretty elite group, not unlike a special ops in the military. Remember, their training takes place over 3 years.

Lastly, Voldemort's fucking powerful. They used hit and run tactics to overpower muggles and wizards. Add in that all the Death Eaters were prominent members of society who were probably helping keep the ministry off of their tail helps.

Fact is, it their size, or really lack of, helped them since they knew how to take advantage of it.

****** It doesn't quite work like that. If you remember Hermione's instructions in /Deathly Hallows/, the container has to be irreparably damaged. That means, not coming back from, or the soul itself has to be exorcised.

My theory is that Avada Kedavra separates your soul from your body, which is why it leaves bodies in such perfect shape. If you're not going to extract the soul, you have to destroy the container. As soon as you apply the phoenix tears, the container isn't gone.

Also, you think Dumbledore didn't think of all this stuff. He was literally the greatest wizard of his time. In his mind, Harry's best chance was to sacrifice himself, and let Voldemort's blood tie him to the mortal plane.

Constantly insulted and derided as backwards and foolish by people who just entered their society(muggleborns).

Whilst the Ministry is filled with corrupt incompetents and then you have Dumbledore and his cohorts of Teachers controlling the Children's education.

And harry is molded into the path of a hero by the liberal academia and because of the fact that his parents were killed in a war, Obviously i cannot stand here and defend Voldemort he is literally a Dark lord,

But Rowling is deeply biased in her view of the World, Seriously who would ever follow the Cartoonish insane form of Voldemort?

There is not even a attempt to make him reasonable or at least coherent. There would be far more depth in the series if both sides were shown more Realistically and not so one-sided, But i also like the themes of GoodVSEvil.

No thought about how Draco's the only DE that wasn't locked up for life this time, or how Hermione is the Minister and freed the slaves. Just some banal "let's get the kids to school" scene. But I wouldn't call that liberal - it's arch-conservative.

Heck, in many of my stories, the system is as much an enemy as the Death Eaters, and it gets changed in my happy endings. If so many good guys die, it should have been worth it - and preserving or restoring the status quo isn't worth it. Not in HP-

Also, the liberal title comes mainly from non-US usage, I think, as the general population of the US has a fairly warped view of world politics and ideology (I think radical vs. reactionary would be a better fit, as the average democrat politician and the average republican politicians views on economics aren't that far off if you look at wider policies, although their social views do differ a bit more, although not nearly as much as people claim them to be)

Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.
