:END:
I cannot, for the life of me, find this story. It was very popular and it was fairly long. Please help?

--

In the story, Harry Potter lost it all after the war. He wandered the ruined halls of Hogwarts and decided that he had nothing left to live for. After speaking to Dumbledore's portrait in the Headmaster's office, he found a magic that could send his soul back to his younger self. The thing was, in order to do the magic, he had to send his soul through a force field that would shatter if any matter touched it.

He Avada Kedavra'd himself and his soul was sent through the field. A moment later, his wand touched the field and shattered it.

Back in the past, his soul came to his younger self (10 years old) in a dream. His younger self consented to be merged, and his younger and older selves merged into one.

The story is his journey through Hogwarts. He mentors his friends and carefully conceals his true identity, but he slips every so often. Eventually, his friends discover his true identity and still accept him. The love amongst his friends was amazing.


** Harry Potter and the nightmares of future past maybe?

**** Yes, this is exactly it. No wonder I couldn't find it - it was deleted off of ff net recently. Wow. At least it's elsewhere online.

Many thanks!

****** It's back up on a blog, but it's still deleted off of ff net.

What a damn shame that ff net deletes these things. I wonder how many other great fics have been quietly deleted all these years.
