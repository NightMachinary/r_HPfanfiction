** I see this story is as soporific as ever.

The latest chapter has a riveting description of an OC being nervous, then Fleur walking around an apothecary followed by a group of people talking about the design of a hotel. I read that far and then must have passed out.

There is *nothing* good about this story.

Wikipedia describes Novocaine as being "...most commonly used in dental procedures to numb the area around a tooth..." and I can honestly see its uses there: have a patient read a bit of this and they'll be out like a light so the dentist can do whatever they need to do.

*** Preach, dude. This story is terrible. It's largely a story about real estate development with little to no magic.

** linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13022013/1/]])

Its not a overpowered harry. Haphne, but without the clich√©s. It talks about politics a lot and doesn't become boring later in the story
