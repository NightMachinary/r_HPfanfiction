Tonks is the main character, unlike a lot of fics which seem to centre on Remus. She is depressed and addicted to sleeping potions. Charlie is in the fic, but not as a romantic partner. I remember that she ODs on sleeping potions by accident and Madam Pomfrey is there (at an Order safehouse?) to save her life.

I've been trying to track this one down for a while now, and haven't had any luck. I don't remember where I first read it.

Edit: also, I think there's a recurring thing where Remus reads to her when she can't sleep.
