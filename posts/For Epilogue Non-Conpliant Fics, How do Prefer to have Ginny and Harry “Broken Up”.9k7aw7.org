For me, how this is handled is a litmus test for the rest of the fic. If handled well, and without bashing, I've found it can be an indicator of a story's quality. My question for all of you however is as follows; How do you prefer for it to go down? Personally I'm a fan of it being addressed in passing naturally or perhaps not even mentioned at all, implied within the text or otherwise.


** I like the completely realistic "We were together for a year, but figured out that we are just not a good fit. It was awkward at firsf, now we cool."-scenario the most. Nothing horrible, just two young people figuring out that there are more options than marrying your highschool sweetheart.

Agreed.

They just break up. There's no need to make it some kind of earth shattering event - unless you're already deeply invested in the Rowling fantasy that they are some kind of perfect couple that are destined to be together.

Making a big deal out of it (same goes for Ron/Hermione, where it's even more ridiculous) tells me a lot about the author. Harry having to go through some kind of mental anguish and deeply personal journey of self-discovery because of his 2 month relationship with a dot on a map is kinda laughable.

Another option is to simply have Harry and Ginny separating on amicable terms because both of them have changed too much, for example in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11858167;11697407).

Otherwise, the next best way is Harry simply fails to prioritize Ginny over his career or Ron and Hermione, or whatever. Harry doesn't have a lot of experience as a good boyfriend, he tends to be self-centered, and he has been known to not take Ginny's desires into account enough.

Harry, due to his life circumstances, hasn't had time to find out who he wants to be (not what other people expect him to be - bad egg, hero, etc). Considering magicals seem to have longer lifespans, Harry can afford to wait a decade or two before looking to settle down. As for the Oedipal thing, it's just weird that Harry latched on to the one red-haired Gryffindor girl.

***** Literally all they shared was red hair, and even then it wasn't the same shade. And red heads aren't some exceedingly rare thing in the UK. The whole Oedipal argument against the ship is one of the weakest arguments.

I can respect the need to find oneself, but on the other hand there are plenty of people who marry their high school partner and still find themselves, however one defines it, while also in a relationship. I think in Harry and Ginny's case, they dated, discovered they were incredibly compatible and connected, and grew as people while still being together. Typically, the reason why high school romances don't last are circumstance (i.e.moving away for college) or growing into completely different people. But if circumstances aren't an issue, then two people can grow but still find themselves very much into their partner through that growth.

I also think the soulmate thing doesn't exist, but if it did, it wouldn't be necessitated by finding yourself first. It kind of implies the opposite of soulmates, which is actually a magical construct. Your soulmate is your soulmate, regardless of when you find yourself. Also, within the wizarding world, Rowling has said Harry and Ginny are soulmates.

****** So, first, I'm actually enjoying this conversation so don't take it as me being argumentative or anything. I'm writing something right now and Ginny hasn't entered the story yet, so talking this through will help me decide how to write her.

Second, my point about soulmates is just more about Harry having spent most of his pre-Ginny life being dictated to by other people. He's the good for nothing freak nephew taken in out of charity, then he's miracle baby, then it's back and forth between attention seeking trouble maker and prophecized saviour. Taking time to himself to figure out who he is and what he wants just makes more sense than tying himself to Ginny who already pretty much knows what she wants - Quidditch.

As for the similarities between Ginny and Lily, they're both under-developed characters, but what we do know about them makes them sound very similar. It's just weird that he looks so much like his dad and he found a girl that immediately reminded a lot of readers of Lily.

In terms of the Hinny pairing in general, I think it ties Harry down a bit too early. The thing with Harry is it was very easy for him to peak during the events of the war. I don't like the cursed child partly because it kind paints Harry as someone who's more known for what he did as a 17 year old than what he did later on. If he had taken a decade to get out of the UK, gone places where he wasn't as well known and so could build an identity beyond Voldie killing machine, and then come back and gotten to know Ginny as an adult their relationship would have made more sense to me. But as it is, 19 years after Voldie dies their son James is at least a second year, which means they got married a few years after Hogwarts.

I see your point but I'd argue being with Ginny /is/ Harry making his own choices for once. She represents a normal life. When he breaks it off, he comments on how being with her was like living another life. It's really sad actually. If he had complete freedom, he would never have broken up with her. So once he gets his freedom back, it would make perfect sense to want to immediate be with her again.

Also, they just spent a year apart. He pined for her and she was his last thought. Personally, I don't see Harry up and leaving her for years while he finds himself.

See, I think aside from both having red hair, which is not unique from other characters, they are not really the same. We don't know much about Lily, but she seems to not enjoy pranks like Ginny does, she seems rather more tempered, and i believe she is taller and lither. Sure, they are both brave and stick up for others, but the same could be said about a lot of people. It actually can be argued that Ginny is more like James in personality.

You have to remember the context. In the wizarding world, there is no college and wizards and witches seem to mature faster. They go right into the workforce upon graduation. Also, it seems that the idea of marrying your Hogwarts is rather common. I think we make the mistake of imposing our real world values and customs on the wizarding world.

Truth is, Harry will always be known for what he did at 17. It's hard for him to ever achieve something more noteworthy. I think Ginny works for him not just in general but in that moment because she is one of the few people who truly knows him as something other than the hero. His identity with her is far different than others. Harry would find himself by being with his friends who truly know him rather than alone. I agree that what you proposed would work for a lot of people who would be in similar situations, but I don't think it would work for Harry. But that's just a different perspective.

Granted Rowling already told us what happens (Harry becomes an Auror right away) but I think if Ginny went back to school, Harry could still travel. And being an Auror could still allow him to travel or at least maintain a purpose in his life. The thing is I don't know if Harry could handle having nothing to do except travel and see the sights. I think he needs the action. A lot of what Harry got up to at school was not required of him. Pursuing the stone? Trying to save Ginny? These had nothing to do with Voldemort (at the time Harry did them) and he had no obligations to do these things, yet he did. I think joining the Aurors was exactly what Harry wanted to do. Pursuing bad guys, solving mysteries, this is the stuff that is innate in Harry. Sometimes I wonder if Harry was able to do what he did in fighting Voldemort because he actually knew /exactly/ who he was at an early age.

In GoF, he had grand ideas of being a tri-wizard champion and being celebrated as a hero. He also never seemed to mind getting attention for Quidditch.

#+begin_quote
  Epilogue non-compliant
#+end_quote

That is a pretty loose term. A story where Harry builds his own harem in his first year is not compliant to the epilogue after all...

For the sake of discussion, I will assume that you mean generally DH compliant but diverge afterwards.

The obvious way would be for them to simply not get together again. War changes people, near-death experiences change people, and the whole "only Harry and Hermione against the rest of the world" part of the hunt undoubtedly left its marks as well. I'm not saying that Harry and Hermione are in love afterwards (although a certain degree of physical intimacy would be expected of two hormonal young adults walking the edge of death by magical Nazis for months). But Harry would have a boatload of psychological issues to work through before he could begin with a relationship and I don't see Ginny "let's do this very obvious ruse, you run off and save the world, I'll be here" Weasley being the one who could understand that. If you want a believable Harry/Ginny relationship, you have to rewrite HBP and DH under that aspect (same applies to Ron/Hermione).

The next way you could break them up would be that Harry is overwhelmed by the Weasley family. He doesn't just see them a few weeks each summer, he is now part of a huge (30+ people) extended family with no prior experience in that regard. It would be like having a harem. It may fulfil your deepest fantasy at first, but after a few weeks the amount of people starts to wear you down and all you want is a quiet hour to play Starlancer (or whatever other video game was around in 2000).

If you want to go into shipping wars, Harry and Hermione fell in love during the hunt and he simply has no romantic interest in Ginny anymore. So pretty much scenario 1.

Another way would be for them to not get together because Harry has no clue how to deal with a grieving Ginny. Maybe he wants to go with Hermione to Australia because he is worried that her spells might not be reversible and Ron is in no state to go with her due to the same reason.

Throw in Teddy and Andromeda if you like. Maybe Harry pays "too much" attention to the baby and his grieving grandmother for Ginny's tastes. Maybe he kinda ignores her because he is overwhelmed with the situation. Maybe Andromeda decided that seducing an 18-year-old man is the best way to deal with her grief and they end up in an unbalanced, borderline unhealthy relationship for a few weeks/month/years/decades.

Ron would throw hissy fits if she starts getting on her high horse and would fight her off, but Harry would bottle things up until he'd blow up and end the relationship and any chance of them staying friends.

I can see Ron and Hermione lasting if they meet at 20, but not after their shared time at Hogwarts (as well as the mess called sixth year and Ron's fuck-ups like the Yule Ball).

I'm not saying that Harry and Hermione would end up married, but I don't see the founder of SPEW in a long time relationship with someone who grew up with magic. Hermione thinks too much like a Muggle and she does not change in that regard as far as canon goes. Hell, she'd probably dump Ron if she found out about the driving instructor, even if that'd be a tad hypocritical.

Edit: And while Hermione sometimes has the social grace of a dreadnought, she is the only one who stayed with Harry when shit hit the fan. She was his most loyal friend. This does not necessarily translate into a relationship, but she is definitely not just a mixup of the worst qualities of some of the worst people in the series.

I think you are mixing two people up here. Molly was not academic, nor was she particularly loyal to Harry after just expressing her concerns about the Dursleys. She claims that she is worried (CoS), basically forgets him over the summer (PoA), then does nothing but send food to a starving child (GoF), lets him be alone after a traumatic event the next summer and then has the gall to be his mother figure (OotP).

And with one exception (HBP), she is always right with her concerns. Harry honestly needed a boot to the arse occasionally, and Hermione was the one to deliver.

Also, any realistic depiction of a civil war would have played out a lot differently. Hermione had no qualms about disfiguring traitors, she'd go to town on any Death Eater (Malfoy would get a Veritasserum interrogation, not be ignored).

She also has Petunia's love of structure and competitiveness (they both like being the best and put effort into being seen as that, though Petunia is more about surface appearances). Harry spent his early life lacking autonomy, his Hogwarts years carrying a whole lot of high expectations, and I think he would enjoy having a quite life without anyone pushing him to do this or that. Or he would travel and try to 'find himself' or something. Either way, he and Hermione would not work out. Honestly, I just find Hermione annoying - I've met people like that IRL and while I'm sure they're good people, I always made sure to spend as little time as possible around them. Ron has ambition, he's just lazy. Hermione would push him to achieve his potential which would in the end make him happy I think.

I'm not sure if the point of this thread is to argue what canonically works as a way to break them up, so forgive me if I'm arguing something you are not. But I don't think canon supports in any way the idea they even could've fallen in love during the hunt, so I'd disagree that this would be a good way to break them up and ship Harry with Hermione.

I agree and disagree. You're absolutely right that Harry would have issues, and realistically he may or may not be emotionally ready for any relationship. But if anyone could make it work, it'd be Ginny. I think part of the appeal with Ginny is she is exactly the type to understand Harry and what his needs would be. Ultimately, you are correct that Harry'd have some serious issues to work through, but Ginny has already shown she would wait for him, and I think she would understand what he's going through and more importantly, have the patience to help Harry deal with his shit. I think both of them realize what it feels like to think someone you love is dead, and the gift they are given having survived. Also, Ginny is normalcy for Harry, something I think he always craved. She would be an anchor for him.

She was there, except it was really Ron who was the rock of the group. When he left, it all fell the crap and Harry had no idea how to react to Hermione's crying.

Regarding OOTP, you are right that when Hermione comes during Christmas, Harry opens the door for her and that allows Ron and Ginny to also get to Harry. But it was Ginny's reminder about being possessed that actually got through to Harry and snapped him out of his funk. And later, in the library at school it's Ginny who gets Harry to feel better when she gives him hope about talking to Sirius.

That doesn't mean much from someone with no experience whatsoever when it comes to family. You don't know what having siblings is like unless you actually experience it on your own.
