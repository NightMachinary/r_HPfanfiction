Hi! I'm looking for any fanfics that involve going to University. Especially interested in magical universities --for example, it makes sense to me that oxford/Cambridge would have a magical college hidden among the muggle ones. Can be any character or OC.


** linkffn(2870133) ... it is post-War Ginny in Oxford, not dating Harry ... yet

  Years have passed since Ginny graduated from Hogwarts and last saw Harry Potter, but when she runs into him one morning in Oxford, how will their newfound relationship bloom, and how will her family take it?

** honestly I think doing Muggle university could be possible, if Ron could Confund his driving examiner than I'm sure forged transcripts/UCAS info could be done

They gave a freaking Time-Turner to a 13-14 year old, I really don't think Minerva would be opposed to a little finagling

** Not sure if the magical world is large enough to run universities. There's only about 4000 in Europe so the entire magical population of the continent would just barely be large enough for one small magical university which wouldn't be practical due to language barriers. One-on-one apprenticeships probably make more sense when you don't have enough people interested your topic to fill a lecture hall. Doing muggle university is probably not possible.

** This one is quite cute and very heavily focused on academic environments and student life.
