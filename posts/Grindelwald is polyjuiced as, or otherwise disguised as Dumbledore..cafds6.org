** I feel like I read a story like this years ago. Part of it that I remember is grindelwald switched places with dumbledore and made the potters treat their daughter badly. Pretty sure it was an avengers crossover of sorts where the girl can travel to Asgard or something like that. Maybe someone will find it.

  Wrong BWL. FEM Potter. James and Lily Potter has given birth to twins. On that Halloween night, they mistake the real prophecy child, leading to years of abandonment; which ends up being the biggest mistake the light side have ever made. There will be crossovers with many different worlds. Dark FEM Potter. Powerful & Genius FEM Potter. MOD Potter. Warning: Very Extreme M rated.

** There's a fic I read five-ish years ago on ff.net where Grindelwald made the elder wand a horcrux and it possessed Dumbledore. Pretty sure Harry and Tracey were tagged, so it shouldn't be too hard to find, if you're interested.
