I've found a few stories throughout the years where Harry is a metamorphmagus or quasi-metamorphmagus, but never one where it was a central part of the story. So lately I've been looking for stories like that and have found only a few. The ones I've found are either so short they're not worth mentioning, or are just plain awful.

So does anyone know any good length, good-quality, metamorphmagus fics out there? If not I might just have to make an attempt myself.


** I wouldn't say that it was an important part of the story in linkffn(The Riddle of Jim Lillian), but it is a fairly important plot point. So there is that. It's pretty good, as well.

Most of the Metamorphagus!Harry fics tend to, naturally, ship him with Tonks, so check out that particular genre.
