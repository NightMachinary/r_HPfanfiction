I remember that -harry travels to the mcu universe -he joins shield and later the avengers -he calls fawkes and he actually appears.

I know it's not much but I really want to read it again

  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, but only after the world has been destroyed. Harry has his vengeance, but gets pulled into Voldemort's ritual and is dragged with his body to an alternate universe. First Chapter sets up the first scene. You can skip it reasonably safely. - Complete - Now up on webnovel under my original author name, burnable.

*** Yep, thats the one that came to mind for me too.

To OP: The scene where Fawkes makes it to the other dimension happens inside Harry's trunk where he also has a kind of picture of Hogwarts, Fawkes looks at it sadly and Harry says something like "Yea, I miss it too."

Maybe that will give you a better idea if it is the one you are looking for.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.
