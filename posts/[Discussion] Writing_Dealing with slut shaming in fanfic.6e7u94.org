Hi all - looking for help/suggestions on how to write and/or deal with slut shaming in the magical world.

I'm writing a fanfic that does have a storyline centered around this, and I want the character to come across as douchey but not trip the line into Azkaban, if you know what I mean? I know there is latent shaming in the books (centered around Ron and his omg!girls! moments), but I'm hoping to integrate more than just gossip and frame of mind.

So grey areas of love potions, Imperius, things like that (unless helpfully explained) are a bit beyond what I need to facilitate the objectification.


** You need first to decide what exactly Wizarding Britain's Society would consider "expectations for sexual behaviors". Are there different expectations for wizards and for witches? Is asking for birth control frowned upon? Having pre-marital sex? Having sex for fun instead of procreation? having sex before 17? Having more than one sexual partner? In their life? In a year? In a month?

We don't know much if anything about how canon treats that. (Some authors do not even seem to know that muggle Britain's not the USA, and not quite as prude, nor that the age of consent is not 18.)

*** I think the only thing that might need adding onto this is that most British witches and Wizards go to Hogwarts. As a result their future spouses are very likely going to be at school at the same time as them due to the very low population of the wizarding world and assuming they're not marrying a muggle. It might well have an impact when everyone in your community knows what you've done and who with. There isn't that much going on at any given time so rumours will spread and most importantly be remembered. Culturally this is similar to when people lived their whole lives in the same village or one over. It was only with motorised transport that someone could leave their past behind and attitudes loosened up.

**** That depends on whether or not that spreads past Hogwarts, or if those who already graduated don't really care about such gossip. (That might be different if it involves a celebrity like Harry.)

And if sexual rumours spread, other rumours might spread as well - like unsporty behaviour in Quidditch, bullying, etc. It might very well be that there's an "what happens at Hogwarts stays at Hogwarts" attitude.

***** I definitely think the "what happens" mentality is there - because you don't hear much of problematic House rivalries once people are in their jobs (or Slytherins wouldn't end up in positions like Head Auror, or Minister for example).

For context:

Post-gen; set about present time. Slow integration of Muggle technology - but adapted for magical use, like charmed mirrors to mimic FaceTime.

My plan was to use gossip, which is at least considered canon, but a lot depends on the culture of Hogwarts and the ideas you've both mentioned above.

I definitely appreciate your comments! It gives me a lot to think about.

***** I agree with you, it also depends how common marriage outside of Britain is. Assuming international magical travel to mainland Europe is fast and easy, it could very well be that you meet your future partner somewhere else.

I assume the yule-ball would be an interesting event for stuff like that, in the upper years.

Points: Bill and Charlie Weasley both left Britain for the world, and Bill married a french girl. Counter-Points: A lot of other people.

**** The parent mentioned [[http://legaliq.com/Definition/Age_Of_Consent][*Age Of Consent*]]. Many people, including non-native speakers, may be unfamiliar with this word. *Here is the definition:*^{(In} ^{beta,} ^{be} ^{kind)}

--------------

The age of consent is the age at which a person is considered to be legally competent to consent to sexual acts, and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity. The distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim, and their sex partner as the offender. The term age of consent rarely appears in legal statutes. Generally, a law will instead establish the age below which it is illegal to engage in sexual activity ...

**** No, that would not be pedophilia. It wouldn't even be statutory rape (i.e. illegal sex by age, though otherwise consensual). Age of consent means 'anything above this is cool with the law'. If the age of consent is 16, a couple who are 16 & 89 are just as valid as a couple who are 16 & 17. Age of Consent in European countries tends to be younger than in the United States. For example, the age of consent in Germany and Italy is 14.

Pedophilia is attraction to PRE-pubescent children, meaning being attracted to those who haven't even displayed sexual development. Those who are attracted to young, sexually developed teens are not considered potential criminals. From a psychological perspective, they are perfectly healthy. From a legal perspective, they can look but not touch until they're certain that the object of their attraction is old enough.

What should be done is educating them and, if you must, making sure that they keep their activities to themselves (i.e. masturbate) rather than go for other people which many of them do only because they don't know better. Going “they shouldn't be thinking about sex at all”, when they are going through puberty and start getting sexual thoughts out of the blue that they have no idea what to do with, is one of the worst things you can do. And people will conflate saying that teenagers shouldn't think about sex with just that kind of attitude.

*** There were other instances -

- Hermione being derisive of Lavender for being 'too girly' (girls shaming other girls);
- Ron being upset at Ginny dating and about to call her a slut (so, definitely shaming her for being what he considered promiscuous);
- and the incident you mention regarding Molly believing Skeeter's gossip rag against Hermione for being sexually interested in two men and leading them on (again, women shaming other women).

Those are considering, by definition, slut shaming. I guess they all centre around idle gossip and cultural and societal ideologies, which I can work into my fic, since they're considered "canon" situations of shaming.

**** While the incidences you describe all happened, I think it is important to put them in context.

Hermione's problem wasn't Lavender being 'too girly' but her dating Ron, the boy Hermione was interested in herself. She lashed out, because she felt hurt.

Ron was confronted with his little sister growing up, and her kissing a boy before he kissed a girl.

Skeeter did not attack Hermione because she really believed that Hermione was interested in two guys, but because of the altercation between herself and Hermione that happened shortly before the article was printed.

I don't think that the behaviour was right, but I also want to point out that it isn't the standard behaviour for these characters, but a way of acting out when they felt threatened or hurt, and I think it wouldn't do the characters justice to take one of their worst moments (in Hermione's, Ron's, or Molly's case) and say: well, look at them slut-shaming other characters, as if that were normal for them, or for their social surroundings.

Edit: Teen pregnancy at Hogwarts: It's a children's book about fantasy and adventure, a teen pregnancy storyline doesn't really fit the genre or further the plot. If you want an in-story reason: Teenagers who are informed about sex and contraceptive methods have a lower risk of getting pregnant unintentionally. So maybe the wizarding world is very progressive in that area.

****** I was curious what exactly Hermione said that was so nasty, but I couldn't find a single quote where she says anything resembling "slut shaming" to or about Lavender.

Similarly, Molly never said anything to or about Hermione that we know of. She acted coldly towards her because she believed that Hermione cheated on Harry. I don't think simply being more cold towards someone for cheating on someone you hold dear is slut shaming them.

Slut Shaming is when girls or women are attacked for deviating from 'socially acceptable sexual behaviour'. I think attaching that label to carelessly, even when it doesn't fit, trivialises the meaning of the word.

You are of course right that people who lash out can do so by slut shaming people, and I agree that this is exactly what Rita Skeeter does, and maybe what Ron does too, but Hermione being dismissive about/ ignoring Lavender... Molly being rude to Fleur or colder towards Hermione... I just don't see it. Am I overlooking certain things they said?

******* I'm honestly conflicted about classifying Molly's and Hermione's behaviour at all, which I realise I probably should have pointed out in the previous comment.

Molly has a specific character while at the same time taking rubbish like Skeeter's articles seriously, something you'd expect to go against the behaviour of someone like her, making it hard to classify her ... moments, as anything but a weird Molly thing, but at the same time still leaving the possibility of her genuinely being like that because Ron has to have gotten his attitude from somewhere and it's a “maybe” so it may or may not have been from her. The very fact that she thinks Hermione is cheating on Harry, when there's never actually been signs /that she's seen/ that they are in any way together or even considering it, it adds to the specific of her character.

And Hermione, well, over the series she's expressed disapproval of many things, some of them in ways that were ... rather out of it, so we really can't say why exactly she disapproves of Lavender (for all we know, it may be that she thinks she is using up time she could have instead spent on making her essays longer); of course now, after getting through it, we do know it is because she has feelings for Ron, but all in all her social ineptitude can make it look as ... pretty much anything, really. And while that means that what she is doing probably is lashing out in one way or another, I'm not sure if it counts as anything but just that.

******** See, this is what I'm having trouble with contextually in the story - do I use Ron and Molly (by extension) as examples of wizarding society that indicates that women who are not 'loyal' to their partners (or potentially toys with their feelings) should be held in a lower standard? Does that imply someone who flirts too much is therefore able to incite behaviours considered promiscuous? That could then, along the way, be labelled as slut shaming?

Hermione herself -- at least, in the article I read, not sure how I feel about it yet tbh -- looks down on Lavender for her girly actions and for the fact that she wants Ron as a boyfriend. Okay, yes, we know that Hermione's jealous... but one of the considerations of slut shaming is women looking down on other women for their behaviour that runs contradictory to what they consider socially acceptable (or, in other words, women just putting other women down).

Like [[/u/cheo_][u/cheo_]] said, context is important to those instances, but I'm looking more to the reasons behind why they said or did those actions, and whether or not it can indicate a culturally-wide trend? To establish either certain comments, gossip, behaviour as shaming or not.

********* It's ... hard to say. If you do not mind your story being AU and you need it for whatever reason then go ahead and do write it in. That said, well ...

Molly is, as we already know, a specific kind of person, with many a bias and some behaviours that are quite ... pushy, let's say. Remember the Howler in the second book? Yeah, that kind of stuff, she is vocal about anything she is against without actually checking her facts and letting anyone tell her what is happening. But, at the same time, she takes what Skeeter writes as truth, which goes against that attitude because she is letting someone she doesn't actually know dictate her what to think. Since a lot of what Molly does is /stuff that Molly does/, it's hard to use her as an example of anything as far as stuff of this kind goes unless you go “people are sheeple” which ... may not be far from the truth, actually, but that's still /guessing/.

With Ron, it probably counts, but if you think about it Ron has quite a lot of pent-up jealousy for Ginevra which doesn't /excuse/ him having a verbal go at her due to her dating Dean, but certainly does /justify/ it, one way or another. As his motivation for that seems to be rooted in the specific situation he is in, we could use the fact that he does it as proof that this kind of behaviour does happen at all, but we cannot really use him as an example of what is normal because of the specific circumstances. That one, of all the ones we've seen, I would tentatively count as slut shaming, but yeah, no cultural trends from it.

And as for Hermione, her behaviour towards Lavender during the sixth year, though you could count it as slut shaming if you really wanted (I personally don't) because there is more to it than just words, is quite similar to her behaviour during the third year cat/rat debacle. She disapproves /of something/, certainly, and in hindsight we do know what it is, but looking at the whole thing with only the knowledge one would have at the time it's hard to see anything but disapproval there. Certainly, we do know why that disapproval is there, but, again, with limited knowledge it's hard to say what it is other than just that, so I do not think what she did was explicit enough in its meaning to call it slut shaming.

That said, Britain, just as the rest of Europe, tends to treat sex as something a bit less taboo than USA does. As such, while slut shaming does exist, I don't think it's a normal thing as much as simply a chosen way of being cruel towards someone (or something like that).

It's actually a Riverdale fic set in the HP 'verse, but when I was considering a particular scene regarding Veronica Lodge & Betty Cooper, I ended up getting into a huge discussion with my husband about slut shaming in the magical world and how it could conceivably (or not) happen, and now I'm trying to prove him right by actually writing it in and dealing with realistic repercussions.

***** I'm working on the chapter now regarding this topic, but 9 other chapters are up -- I've begun to distance myself from posting on FFnet (have you seen /Riverdale/? It would/might help regarding some context other than, hey, modern Archie comics): [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/10797984/chapters/23953185][The Darkest of Times]]

***** Oh, I hope you enjoy it then. I've had great response on Ao3 and the fandom has been very welcoming. I'm at the point of canon divergence now, but if you're a Bughead fan, you'll enjoy the story, I think. It's Betty-centric.

** Any slut shaming in Harry Potter only exists in your head. Lavender was a bit of a ditz, that has absolutely nothing to do with slut shaming.

*** Well, given it's a post-gen fic and Lavender isn't in it... this seems moot point.

** There can be an ugly woman and be a slut- you can't be an ugly guy and be a stud. That's why people don't think highly of really promiscuous women. It's a result of it being easy to be a slut, and hard to be a stud.

Anyway, you wanted help, here you are lol!
