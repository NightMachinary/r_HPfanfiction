Does anybody ever find it weird that Remus never notices that Ron has a rat that looks exactly like his ex friend in his animagus form. Like lupin spends an entire year in the castle with them and at one point even has the map but doesn't see pettigrew?

I'm reading a story where lupin actually holds scanners but never puts two and two together. I just don't understand how no one ever realizes this.


** I'm sure Scabbers worked hard to avoid him. Remus never entered Gryffindor tower, where Scabbers spent most of his time. Why would a professor see his students' pets, anyway?

As soon as he got the map, he saw Pettigrew. (Best explanation I've seen for why no one else did: the map reveals the true names of animagi only to people who've seen them transform. )

*** The twins probably never saw him because scabbers was always next to Ron. Theres a passage in DH where Harry is watching the map and looking at Ginny until she gets lost in the crowds.

*** But that does not even make sense at all, because Harry saw Peter's true name and he never even knew he was alive. No that is NOT the best explanation, it is the worst.

**** That's from the movie, which made no sense, since the twins would have noticed their brother sleeping with some dude named Peter. Book Harry never saw Peter on the Map.
