I don't want to offend in any way the Wiccan or any other real Neo-pagan and/or witchcraft community, but the other day I read an article of sort somewhat dating talking about some drama between a Wiccan Wandmaker and Potterheads and just now I thought that if I was a Muggle-born and a teacher came to my house telling me so how I would be 'I told you I could do magic' to my brother and one thing led to another I begun to think about if two Wiccan parents had a Muggle-born as a child? Would they bring him to a Wiccan wand shop? Would they try to make their child manifest their gift and train it? I know Wiccan wands wouldn't really be able to allow a Harry Potter witch or wizard to cast spells, but I just can't stop thinking about little Timmy controlling his accidental magic a bit like how Tom Riddle Jr did and his waving his wand around (or whatever Wiccan do with their wands, even pre-Harry Potter pop culture has wand act up by waving them or such).

Imagine Professor McGonagall going to Muggle-borns' houses and telling them about magic and then there's this child who simply tells her "I know" when she tells them they're a witch/wizard, and their parents nod along with their child like "yeah, Emily's been doing magic since she's five year-old. She thinks that the Statute of Secrecy had been broken somehow but then she remembers hearing about Neo-pagans in the Muggle world from when she still didn't know she was a witch.

Continuing on that tangent, how would the community feel about a Wiccans appearing in stories. I know J.K. said wizards aren't Wiccans, but just like a Muggle-born could be born in the British aristocracy, they could be born in a Wiccan family. Thoughts?


** the Wiccan-muggleborn trope bothers me a lot, tbh.

i'm biased because i have a deep and unyielding hatred for Crowley, Gardiner, and pretty much everyone in the history of Wicca, not to mention a distrust of most organized religion in general. i'll admit that. but a lot of authors don't do their research, and they end up equating Wicca with all modern paganism with modern witchcraft/spirituality traditions. it rubs me the wrong way. i also strongly dislike a lot of specific things associated with Wicca, but this isn't really the place to rant about it so i'll avoid that.

in the context of HP fanfic, it makes very little sense anyway- iirc, Wicca formed in the 1950s and wasn't exactly well known at the time the series takes place. even any type of Satanism would make more sense. or, ya know, just have a character whose family practices "witchcraft" as it's done irl.

if there was a fic where a young Hellenic Polytheist went to Hogwarts, that would be fucking amazing.

*** Tbh I only said Wiccan because I saw they made their own wands and from that moment on my imagination kicked off, but yeah, any kind of modern witchcraft practice is okay for this prompt, I guess.
