** I have several.

linkffn(11983735) *How do you solve a problem like Ginevra?*

It can be a tad confusing at times due to how the author writes, but I really loved it. Very magical, very intense.

linkffn(7190230) *Prejudice and Pride* is a time travel AU. Really liked it and best of all, it's long and complete (so rare for Gin and Tonics).

linkffn(8210840) *Colouring Hearts* is shorter but also complete, also a time travel AU and has a great plot. It's somewhat nonlinear and Tom is very in character.

Colubrina used to have two great WIP's /Things in Common/ and /Calligraphy/ but she took them down since I don't think she's planning on finishing them. If you don't mind reading abandoned stories, you might be able to find them on fictionhunt.

linkao3(Inferno by 7serotonin) is a great one shot.

linkao3(Left Hook by elicitillicit) is a time travel WIP. Well written and captivating but the author hasn't updated in a while.

  Stopping short of leaving the alleyway, Tom asks, "Have you ever had a Butterbeer?" She has. "No," she says instead. GWTR - a rather different time travel novella. Complete.

  Arrogance and bigotry can be well-founded, but perhaps that is when it is most important to fight through prejudices. Sometimes choices have to be made, even if they go against everything that you stand for. TomxGinny.

  Ginny never took Ancient Runes, but she grew up with magic seething in her sinew and coiling in her gut, and so laughter, hard and hysterical, bubbles up in her chest when she sees a precisely cut crescent moon sitting inside a pictogram of a sun.The sun marks the hours of the day, but the moon marks the passage of weeks. Months. Years. There's still shouting behind her.Ginny doesn't hesitate.
