:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a SSHG fanfic I read a longggggg time ago. I think I probably read it on fan fiction.net but not positive. I don't really remember the plot except there was some piano playing elements to it. The thing that stands out to me is the author had specific songs that went with each chapter. Like if Hermione played a song on the piano, the author tagged the specific song to listen to while reading the fic. I know this is vague but I'm just trying to remember some of the piano instrumentals that were included in the fic because I really liked them but it's been so long I've forgotten the names of all the songs.


** Funnily enough I'm also kind of blanking on the plot outside of the piano playing but I'm fairly certain this is Liminal.

  Severus Snape keeps running into a student playing piano. Why does he stop to listen, and how does she respond when she is asked to invite him when she plays? And what about Voldemort? Here there be fluff, romance, drama, and angst.
