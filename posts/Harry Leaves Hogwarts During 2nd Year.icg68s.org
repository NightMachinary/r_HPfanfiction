:END:
During 2nd year (Chamber of Secrets), Harry ends up leaving the school due to all the bullying due to him being a parselmouth.

The adults end up realizing what's going on and Sirius ends up finding him. I think he might have been brought in because the other adults couldn't find Harry (not positive if its that or if it was after his escape from Azkaban. Sort of fuzzy on the details). I believe they are in the muggle world. And I THINK Remus ends up being brought in a bit later.

Its a fairly short fic (probably less than 50k words), and I cannot seem to find it or remember its name. If it sounds familiar to anyone, please let me know.

**** I agree I mean teacher like Snape would have given him detention for not attending his class and would have told Dumbledore that he didn't attend his detention.
