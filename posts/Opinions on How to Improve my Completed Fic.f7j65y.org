Hi guys,

I completed my 55 chapter fic 1.5 yrs ago and I am thinking about making it better. The whole fic took 12 years to complete, lol, and I know I dragged on in parts. While for me, I am happy with the fic, I want to cut down, and make arcs tighter etc. It has been difficult finding a beta so here I am asking for your opinions.

I will keep an original version of the fic on AO3, but on ff.net, where it has been since 2005, I want to strengthen and make it better.

The fic in question is Imprisoned Realm.

For those who have read it, what should I get rid of? What do you want more of?

Thanks for your help. :)


** I think this is it.

** I've seen your fic before, but only on AO3, so I never realized it was finished! I spent the last couple days reading it & have thoroughly enjoyed it.

I've got a couple (okay, maybe more than a couple) thoughts, and I hope you find them helpful!

â€‹

- The beginning needs some work.

Chapters 1, and 5-10 chapters are slow and fairly difficult to get through, but after that the story becomes much more engaging & enjoyable, since the plot starts to take off and we have conflict between the Mirrors.

I think that the first chapter, while interesting and has some interesting background information, really doesn't give the reader a good idea about what the rest of the story is going to be like. addition, I think that starting a story with a description isn't always engaging for a reader. Sometimes it's better just to start in with the action. Instead of talking about how it's a full moon, jump right into Grindelwald's arrival.

The first meeting of the Harrys in Chapter 6 is interesting--but I think it could be better with some foreshadowing about how the Mirror Harry really isn't himself--in hindsight, it makes for a really great reveal that he's been possessed by the horcrux, but it would be really cool if we were able to see some of that earlier with a sort of "red glint" that indicates the Horcrux in control at times (maybe cliche? i'm not sure) or more erratic mood changes (probably less cliche but more difficult).

What makes these beginning chapters difficult to get through is that the perspective changes from an exciting one--Harry's--to less interesting ones at this time, primarily Lily & really anyone else. While the information presented is useful narrative, it's not as enjoyable to read since it's slow and seems somewhat more of an internal-monologue/info-dump than progressing the plot.

My main critique of this section would have to be the pacing and how it completely changes when the perspectives change between characters. Having a faster pace and less extraneous details would really help move the story along.

- What's happening in the original universe?

I understand that this sort of contradicts my previous point in avoiding extraneous details, but I found myself constantly wondering this. While the majority of the conflict is happening in the Mirrored universe, I am interested in the slow crumbling of the canon universe without Harry--how some of Voldemort's ideas are consistent between the two worlds such as conditioning the children.

This could be really cool to include as interludes, but it's not necessary.

- Battle scenes get complicated with the alternative perspectives

I love your epic battle scenes! I am impressed with how they span over multiple chapters & I think that's really awesome. It might be due to the formatting on FF but I somehow can never see those little lines that you've used to symbolize breaks in POV so I get sometimes totally confused.

This is really a very minor thing, and I probably should just delete this bullet point because I don't know what you could do to improve it since I think having multiple perspectives in this instance is very effective in showing all of the different aspects of battles that happen at once. So disregard this if you'd like.

- Chapter 54 is confusing

I understand that you've giving us some really interesting background on the Obsidian Stitch here, but I also think that it comes out of nowhere and just gives us more information without answering any of our questions. I would love to hear more about what exactly a Vindictus does. I would love to hear more about how the Mirror Harry manages his life when he seems so obviously depressed and doesn't maintain a good relationship with his family for many years afterwards. It seems that the Mirror Harry doesn't get his happy ending--and I personally love that realism, so don't change that. But with the way this epilogue is set up, you don't get a very satisfying ending with the spirits telling the story of the Obsidian Stitch. If you want to tell their story, which I think should or could be included, I would cut the story down to something much shorter, and then you have room to talk about Harry after he comes back to life--and it still could end on a melancholy note.

- Chapter 55 is both good and bad

I love the part where the Mirrors interact with each other with the portkey book (though my heart broke when the Mirror just said he was okay), and I love canon Ron's skepticism about the whole thing, and I /love/ the last view we get of the Mirror universe where the Mirror takes that first step toward reconciling with his family.

What I'm not fond of is how we just skip to five years later right off the bat. I want to know what the battle Harry had to fight in the canon universe! I want to know if Snape learns how much he helped Harry become a proper Mage and I want to know how people reacted when they found how Harry really was a mage and not making stuff up. I want the five years later to happen right after the battle on Harry's side ends--I love your battle scenes so having another one would be fantastic. I want Harry to just go serious OP and slam dunk Voldemort & wreck the horcruxes. And then I want to watch him heal after the trauma he just went through. Another person commented that you could do this with one-shots, and I think that would be an effective format to do this in if you don't want to include this with the main piece of work. We've invested so much time in these characters that we don't want to leave them! It's hard to tear yourself away from them!

- You do a great job of differentiating between which Harry you're talking about

I'm honestly really impressed. I've written something where I had two versions of someone at the same time and I had the hardest time trying to figure out how to tell them apart. I felt that your usage of "the Mirror" was excellent and completely understandable, so bravo!

- You /finished/ this massive piece of work (well done) and it has subplots and character developments and it's just dang good

This fic is /huge!/ 324,000 words and certainly deserves more attention that it currently has, because it is very well written.

One reason why it may not be getting the attention it deserves is because it is so huge. I know it seems somewhat silly with all of the requests for long fics, but there's some people that won't read anything if its over 200k. But to be frank, this didn't feel like a 300k+ story because the pace picks up after chapter 10 and the story is so engaging that it felt more like a 120k+ fic. What I'm trying to say is that you've written something massive but it doesn't feel like something I had to struggle through, except for the first 10 chapters.

- Your world-building is great

I love the world you created. It's super engaging and fascinating and I totally want to know more about it. The amount of detail you've put into this work and the depth of horror you've managed to convey in this war-ridden world is really fantastic. I also loved the mechanism where Harry was able to see the Mirror's memories, which did an excellent job building up his story and making his journey relatable. And oh my gosh--that Dumbledore betrayal scene was PHENOMENAL. I had no idea it was going to be something that serious--and to me, it frankly justified the amount of hate the Mirror had for him.

I also loved the different arcs that you had, and I think they were all really effective and I think important to the overall narrative.

This story really was fantastic. Great job.

-----

I have a few more thoughts, but I think I've left you a whole bunch of comments here. If you want to know what they are, just let me know, but these were my major points. If you think these thoughts were useful, just let me know if you want more. If these thoughts were completely useless, please ignore them all!

But I hope this helps. Please continue writing! I've really enjoyed reading this story & will be recommending it to my friends.

** I've just finished it and it's really good. The only thing that I would change is the last two chapters, the chapter 54 felt a little bit unnecessary I know that it shows how Harry survives and all of that but it has the feeling that it's only and old story, something that we may want for clarifie things about the mages or something like that, I don't think that the whole scene have as much impact as that moment deserved and like the rest of the fic had And the last chapter was good, but I needed a little more, maybe a few oneshots showing some scenes from that 5 years period, like Harry talking about Azkaban or Mirror Harry trial All of that said it's a great fic, it has a great plot, great character and it's really nice to see that not all is white and black I hope you keep writing fics, you're a really good writer ðŸ’œðŸ’œ Sorry if my Ingles is not good. It's not my first language
