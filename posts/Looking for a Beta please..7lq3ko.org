I am in search of a beta to assist me, I'm going to begin writing Chapter one of my story, and I really would like someone to be able to look it over. I have a hard time with grammar and punctuation. And two heads are better than one.

I don't like to talk about my fics to others, so perhaps if I get responses I will have to choose by a few questions such as How much free time do you have available to assist? who your favorite characters are, if you've beta'd in the past, if you're currently beta'ing. And of course I want to make sure you are interested in what I'm writing, I don't think beta'ing a work you don't like or find uninteresting is fair either.

Let me know, thank you!


** Without any information on your story, I can't say if I am interested or not but check out Grammarly. It is a spellchecking tool that helps with punctuation but sometimes it is a little too eager in that aspect. You can set it to British English and it will show you all words you need to change.

*** I have grammarly as well I just can't afford to pay for the best version of it. But thank you! I can message you directly about my fic and tell you the basic premise, I get wary cause the last time I tried for a beta years and years ago I told them everything about the story and they stole it, when i tried to post mine everyone thought I was the thief so now I hold my stories close to my vest

**** Let's play this the other way. If your story has one of the following elements I am not interested:

- Slash (M/M) as the main pairing

- Draco as a good guy

- Canon pairings (Ron/Hermione or Harry/Ginny)

- NextGen (unless there are no canon pairings, then I am interested)

- Weasleys who claim that Harry is part of their family or otherwise play an important role

- Daphne Greengrass aka Ice Princess

- A Good Snape

- A Harem

- Death Eater revisionism

- Tonks/Lupin

- Lupin as a father/uncle figure

- Friendly Goblins

- OP!Harry

- Monologues about being controlled

- Magical Animagi forms

- Harry getting a special, multicore wand

- Canon being rehashed

So, am I still in the running as your beta?

***** We might need to go over Good Snape, he is not good in my fic, but he's not completely and only evil like Voldemort is either.

Canon rehashed such as?

****** How close are you going to stick to canon. For example keeping the tournament tasks is fine but having Harry do them the same way would not be my cup of tea. Same for the Yule Ball. If Harry wants to go with Parvati then she's a fine choice as a date but if Harry chooses her because he sees no other option then again, I am out.

As for Snape, as long as you don't make him misunderstood, Harry's mentor or include a Snape/Lily, Snape/Harry, Snape/Hermione or Snape/Tonks pairing I am fine with it.

******* Harry doesn't feature much, as a character more as a background character. Canon happens but it happens outside of the main characters and is from the POV and limited knowledge of a side character.

Snape/Lily, is not mentioned or written about, this isn't a romance fic. so there will be no pairings.

** If you can link to an example of your work it might help potential betas decide if they are interested -- but honestly you don't need a beta until you are well on with your story and it's at least fully planned. A beta wants to feel confident that your story is going to be coherent and completed just as much as any other reader. More so really because it's a big commitment and no one wants to feel they're wasting their time on a writer who might run out of steam (not suggesting you will!). An idea of the story premise and main characters is pretty essential too.

But if you haven't even started writing the first chapter, it's too soon to be looking for a beta.

*** Oh okay thank you, I'm still doing a bunch of research into my main character and filling out her background since JK didn't do so.

**** Then I honestly think you would be better waiting until you have something concrete to work with. Good luck with it. :)

** I'd do it. My only qualms are over the top bashing, especially of Dumbledore and the Weasleys. And Draco pairings. Pretty much anything else is fine.
