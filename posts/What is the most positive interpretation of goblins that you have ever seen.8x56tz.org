To elaborate more, basically the most utterly helpful, do-no-wrong goblins you can think of in a fic.


** Harry Crow, as terrible as it is, the goblins only make it worse. As to the most evil? The Firebird Trilogy by /miles and miles./

****** First and foremost I highly recommend it, it is incredibly unique and manages to do an AU like none other. It remains incredibly well thought out and /has meaningful conflict./

As to evil? [[/spoiler][They reproduce using female witches. The act of giving birth to a goblin tears the woman apart. They have a bunch of witches held against their will in their tunnels. Worse still the ministry knows about it and continues to donate them occasional muggleborn witches.]]

******** It has its moments. It does go into some more backstory regarding that, there are exceptions (Flitwick).

The story does go to some dark places, but it does so rather well. Some would complain it's a bit too dark but I think it's necessary, after all the dystopia he builds /demands it./

Overall I will say even though it has it's dark moments the sheer creativity and the originality make this a must read; it's easily in my top 10 favourite fics.

******** Yes. If you want a fic that deserves 'grimdark' as its primary attribute, /Firebird/ is it. The first few chapters has awkward/uncomfortable worldbuilding, and it just snowballs from there. I felt kinda guilty reading it, and it definitely wasn't the guilty-pleasure type. It's creative... in the oddest places. It's intriguing... to the point of despair. It's a rebuke of so-called 'harem' fics... and yet plays it completely straight.

**** No meaningful conflict, no real flaws in characters, and poor characterization.

Harry Crow is often a fic that people new to the fandom read and enjoy; and I can see why. The writing is tolerable, Harry is powerful, and ends up with the perfect Hermione. But honestly that's /boring./

When I think of the best fics I've read Harry Crow can't compare. The characterization of Graces Malfoy in You'll be the Death of Me, the timidness of Neville in Asking for Roses, the creativity of Prince. These are all examples where the writer took something and owned it.

Harry Crow is decent writing and a well outlined plot. That's not bad, but what you get is far from memorable.

Addition:

Most of those who seem to enjoy it are new to the fandom and have not tasted the fruits that the fandom has to offer. If that is the case give me what you want and I'll rec you some.

****** I meant linkffn(Prince by SallyJAvery) which is a Venetian AU that somehow, someway is incredibly well executed.

Linkffn(Speak Softly, Love) is my first rec for you. This is 25k words but it feels like so much more. Great depth to a minor character.

Linkffn(Black Luminary by YakAge) is the most promising AU I've read since the Firebird Trilogy. He takes a whole new angle on things (no Voldemort as main villain) and although the characterization is weak at times the world building is on point.

Linkffn(Elizium for the Sleeping Souls by Voice of the Nephilim) is a thriller that is rather fast paced and surprised me with its ending. Their other work is solid too.

Linkffn(Asking for Roses by Dogstar101) is Neville/Hannah and the characterization of Neville is spot on.

You'll be the Death of Me is Neville/OC and is in my opinion the best romance in the fandom.

A few honourable mentions:

linkffn(On the Wings of a Phoenix by makoyi) is a fresh take, giving the villains a chance to tell their side of things.

The 2.6m word epic Sacrifices arc by Lightning on the Wave. It shows its age but it did some truly creative things and all 2.6m words are worth it; I devoured this within 10 days and did nothing else. The slash does not occur till late year 5 and is not very prominent.

I would be remiss not to include Prince of the Dark Kingdom, as even though it is incomplete what is there is nothing short of incredible.

**** The story reads like a parody of all the Fanfiction cliches if Robst wouldn't play it so completely straight: Goblins are warriors with honor, like Klingons, but better, Harry Potter is adopted by them and becomes the most awesome warrior ever, proficient in wandless magic and armed combat, he's also Lord!Potter!Gryffindor!... (I don't remember exactly), he's better than all the Hogwarts teachers - nah, that's to mild - he's better than everyone at everything, he's 11 yet talks like a 60 year old man and fond of grand romantic gestures while looking for a future wife, he wears magical Goblin weapons and armor that unfolds like he's fucking Iron Man.

** Sheesh...I still need to get around to writing that snippet idea of Lily and James hiding in their Gringotts vault. Stuff happens, Voldemort comes after them, Lily's sacrifice saves not only Harry but several goblins in the way. With the Potter parents dead and the Dursleys not interested, they end up raising the orphan Harry for their own...

...Take your pick! When Harry comes to Hogwarts, what's his defining trait that he picked up from being raised by goblins?\\
A) Obsession with numbers, maths, equivalent exchange and the stock/flow of spellcasting. Featuring Arithmancy mastery and a strong connection with Hermione.\\
B) Obsession with craftsmanship, examining and trying to replicate everything from his wand to Ron's dress robes. Featuring a prankster team-up as Harry pairs with Fred & George to reverse-engineer everything Filch has ever confiscated.\\
C) Obsession with goblin warrior code, from excessive honorifics, practising with a weapon he'll never use, and putting Draco Malfoy on hold until he can look up the correct response to his insults. Featuring a Harry/Luna pairing which sees Harry wooing her with classical goblin poetry.
