When Hagrid explains why he's there, the Ministry Official tells him that Dumbledore has no authoritative right over the baby, and that the Ministry has a department for finding a home for new orphans, and if Dumbledore wants to talk, to contact the Ministry.


** Could you imagine what could have happened if they had Placed little Harry with a new family. Sure there's the obvious ones, like he gets raised by who ever manipulates the system better.

Harry Malfoy - Harry Dumbledore - Harry McGonagall - Harry Fudge

But imagine the more mundane. Like for Harry's protection he just ends up an unknown child of some some small family. His inheritance is protected un he comes of age, but as far as Harry knows he's just John Doe, second kid of the Doe family. Grows up a normal kid, gets to Hogwarts having heard of Potter but not knowing that it's him.

Or maybe Harry Crouch?

Harry Crouch, in true /Harry-Potter-can't-leave-anything-well-enough-alone-style/ manages to accidentally free his brother Barty Crouch, Jr from their father's imperious curse years before it happens in canon. Barty, weak and wandless, flees the house and searches out his old master and (eventually) manages to resurrect him- all before Harry finishes primary school. Voldemort begins to gather his allies and strange happenings begin again in the Wizarding World.

Crouch Sr is caught in a web of his own lies so he can't /tell/ anyone why he knows for sure that Voldemort has been resurrected. But he's always been willing to do whatever he must to crush Dark Wizards, and if he has to join Dumbledore's little vigilante group then that's what he'll do.

(Essentially, there's a reason why Barty Crouch Jr/fake Moody was a feared fighter in Voldemort's forces- he was taught how to duel by a father who dedicated his life to destroying dark wizards)

Fun bonus scenes!

-Crouch Sr enjoys languages and Harry speaks Parseltongue. He teaches Harry a language he knows in exchange for Parseltongue lessons (which may or may not work lol). Mermish would be cute, especially with a little kid basically screaming on land. Goblin or French would be more practical.

-Crouch Sr is responsible for putting away Sirius Black without a trial and that should ABSOLUTELY come up at the most angst-ridden, teen-drama, orphan-issues moment possible

Edit:: omg I totally forgot that Mrs Crouch didn't die until 1982. Oh lil Harry could be /so/ attached to his new family, the potential for heartbreak is exponential there. His family gets murdered Halloween of 1981, he moves in with his new family and just when he starts to settle in and he's fallen in love with them, he loses another family to death and tragedy.

*** Nice, but I don't think he would remain ignorant after 11 years of age after attending Hogwarts with his scar hurting and as a wizard raised kid he would know that there's a famous scar on harry Potter's forehead. And if his scar wasn't popular and known than as a normal kid he would visit hospital wing and ask for headache potion or write to his family and they would have to tell him even if he had to keep it secret. And if somehow horcrux was removed when he was a kid than this line is plausible but still unless they do full adoption , his magical name would've harry James Potter for him to be able to claim his inheritance I guess.

** I'd love to see a fic where this results in him being raised in witness protection after the DoM has had a good look at both him and the house. I also can see the Ministry of the time hiding the fact that Voldemort has been killed for as long as possible in order to catch more of his followers before they realise they are on the losing side and start coming up with excuses.

*** I could see the DoM wanting to keep a close eye on Harry. Pandora Lovegood being an unspeakable (headcanon) would be assigned to raise Harry, seeing as she already has taken a short maternity leave because Luna''s just been born.

** Somehow I get the feeling they would put baby harry with a family that they felt was safe... But for stop would have been the long bottoms simply because I think it was like 3 hours or so Actor James and Lily died that they were tortured so under the context of that they would take Harry to the long bottoms thinking they had a perfect place to put him they may discover Alice and Frank being tortured when they arrive with the placement.... That would have made the story interesting.. Particularly Considering is Harry had technically been placed in the Custody of the long bottoms and then they were tortured To insanity would that Then Both Harry and Neville his grandmother wards... Or would They then place him somewhere else because the Malfoy always claimed the imperious curse At that time So they weren't above suspicion Harry might Placed with maybe the bones Or perhaps the patel family?... Maybe the Woods or Thomas's or the Finnegan's
