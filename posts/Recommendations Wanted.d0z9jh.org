*** This fic lowkey one of the biggest let downs in Harry Potter fanfiction in my opinion the first half was just about the best timetravel story in the fandom at the time and then there's the second half.

It's a fun read for sure tho

***** Yeah the biggest thing for me is that voldemort was alive unchecked for like 15 more fucking years, and he didn't do shit, like are you kidding me? Voldemort doesn't lose his body and the story still follows the canon timeline. Also the weird insertion of some new potters that are pretty weird, Leo was an ok character tho

*** He taught potion, not defense, while at Hogwarts.

And he uses Snape and Lily's potions as benchmarks for grading homework. For upper years, he relies on Bellatrix.

Lily soon develops a crush on him, and becomes rather jealous of Bellatrix.

In the second half, Draco's ‘redemption' is one hilarious story arc.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** Laughing all the way to London is decent. Similarish to Wind Shear. It does have the best way time travel paradox has been resolved I've personally ever seen in time travel fiction but not everyone mau agree. Also good as Found in the ashes by the same author but that has a prequel that if you don't read it won't make sense without it.

  In limbo, Harry doesn't choose to go back to the Forbidden Forest to face Voldemort. He makes another decision and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them?This is Tom Riddle's entire life, as close to canon as possible, if he shared his body with Harry Potter (and fell in love with him).

  The twenty-four-year old Auror Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.As the Master of Death, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected. Now, not really sure what to do, he decides to see what time will bring.Perhaps a change in the Ministry won't be too bad. Voldemort might be insane, but that doesn't mean, that all his plans are stupid.Accompanied by Death, Harry chooses that this time, he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.
