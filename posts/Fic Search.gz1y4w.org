:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello ! I'm looking for a fic where harry becomes a creature ( i think he was some sort of Greater Fae) and then he goes to Knockturn Alley. There a woman gives him a child and die in his room ( I think harry should have been her mate or something) and harry decide to take care of the child. Severus is harry's real father and the child is the grand daugther of the king to a sort of kingdom ? i'm not sure. Harry was hiding from the OoP but when his daughter become ill he contact severus and then stay with the order. After, he decide to go to Hogward with the child. i think the first part of the fic is finished but not the sequel. if someone know which fic i am talking about it woul be great. thank you !
