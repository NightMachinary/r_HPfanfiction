I've been really into Snupin lately, so I wanted to know if there were any good fics out there for my OTP.

FYI, I'm already reading “The Secret Language of Plants” so pls don't rec that one.

I'd be okay for one-shots and short stories (10 chapters or less).

Lastly, it would be nice if the stories are complete.

Thanks in advance for your help!


** I don't really know of any Snupin fics, but I do really enjoy linkffn(Dear Order) which I seem to remember having a background theme of Snupin. It's a hilarious crackfic well worth a read, as are the rest of the authors works.

** I only read the first chapter or so of linkao3(The Natural Order of Things) but it looks interesting.

Maybe try [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] too?
