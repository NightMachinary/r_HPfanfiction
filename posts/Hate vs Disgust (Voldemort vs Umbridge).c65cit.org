I've often heard it being asked why Umbridge is so universally despised while Voldemort is not that much hated. Hermione/Voldemort and Harry/Voldemort are such famous pairings while Umbridge/Anything does not even bare thinking about except maybe as a condom to the giant squid.

It is my hypothesis that humans feel disgust much more strongly and deeply than any hate. That disgust much more than hate can justify a lot of things in people's minds. I would attribute a lot of atrocities in human history to a person or group of people feeling disgusted by another group of people.

Harry Potter has a bit of escapism to it and normal elements such as Ron Weasley, Lavender, Dursleys and Mundungus Fletcher are often the target of fanfic writer's absolute disgust which in turn justifies all the atrocities they commit to them. I suspect that anyone that has read enough Ron Bashing fanfiction would have noticed that Harry rarely expresses hate against Ron (at the start at least) but almost always is disgusted by his actions/appearance/existence.

Umbridge too in my mind represents a more real enemy that teenagers face and are disgusted by.

Thoughts?

*** To these excellent points I would add one more:

5 - She's simultaneously weak and strong. I think we all suspect that Harry could beat Umbridge in a duel in OotP, and Dumbledore certainly could slap her around with his eyes closed. But despite her weakness, her other attributes mean those characters are forced to restrain themselves from using their power to expel her. This makes the injustice of her rule all the more frustrating, as we are forced to endure it in the knowledge that we could stop it at any time, it's just that the consequences of doing so would be severe.

***** Which actually reminds me of another thing JKR got right with Umbridge: the fact that she wields the authority of another person, not her own authority.

Umbridges are always seconds-in-command, never the leader. Leaders who carry actual authority cannot get personally involved in unjust situations - when they do, papers have a field day with "X politician made Y decision which resulted in Z sob story" articles. So generally speaking, the Umbridges of the world are acting in someone else's name, with enough independence that the authority-giver can deny the association if injustices come to light.

  Similarly, on a disgust scale, I'm more of a fan of the books than the movies, so even though I love Alan Rickman, I've always pictured Snape as hook-nosed and greasy and kind of gross, so I can't do Snape pairings either. And I think the people that do are visualizing Rickman, and not the book Snape.
#+end_quote

I as a person who can and does do Snape pairings, I wish people would stop saying that. Nothing can trigger my Do Not Want button faster than visualizing 60 y.o. pudgy Alan Rickman in a bad wig circa movie 6-8. I love Alan Rickman, but never in this role. But 30-something Snape from the books? His only problem lookswise is bad skin and hair. And as for personality, book!Snape with his temper and sarcasm and glaring insecurities is much more interesting character than always reserved movie!Snape.

********* I am a huge snape lover and i find that he is irresistably attractive.. due to his personality. I love Alan rickman and find him attractive. But that's not the point. In real life, i came across many people who can and are classified as not beautiful but after getting to know them and liking their personality i got attracted to them and find them actually beautiful after a while.. the opposite is also true.. i found many people who are beautiful in every way, but after hating their personality i couldn't find them beautiful anymore. I love severus snape because of his personality.. greasy hair or not. Hooked nose or not. Alan rickman or book snape. I love his cynical pessisism. I love his snarky personalities and killer sarcasm. I love his passion, whether it is his passion towards potions, towards a cause he believes in or towards a person (lily in canon, harry in my head lol). The snarry i love to read is when severus falls in love with harry's character and i imagine him as such a passionate person. I love that he is morally grey. That he is a realist. That he is a survivor. I can honestly keep talking about the things i love about severus for hours. So his personality makes me see him as desirable and attractive

********** Well, snarry is my all time OTP, but I don't find Snape's personality attractive. Instead, the fact that he is so fucked up and complicated is exactly what makes him such a fascinating character. He's passionate, clever, brave, witty, proud and also an unrepentant jerk who holds to his grudges and bullies children. He had a horrible childood, made some really bad choices and then did his best to atone for them even though his best wasn't always the best. I love him as a character, although I wouldn't enjoy hanging out with him as a person.

As for attractiveness, I don't see Snape as conventionally attractive, but I don't think he's that bad looking either. Harry hates him, so he sees his bad sides, but as I said earlier, his only real problems are skin and hair. Hooked nose is not a detractor for me personally, I actually like them on men. Adrien Brody is one of my biggest celebrity crushes ever, so I guess I'm weird like that.

*** We would probably hate Tom a lot more than we do if we had the chance to see Ginny's interactions with his diary, where he's properly manipulative and eventually imprisons a conscious Ginny in her own body and puppets her away to the Chamber, but as it is, we just get told briefly after the fact. I came across a fic recently that did a good job of showing Ginny and Tom POV on that year.

***** Well, it's the third in a long series. I do recommend the whole thing, it's great, but that's over a million words and still updating.

If you want to start from the start, it's linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7). If you want to skip to the Chamber of Secrets year, that's linkffn(Identity by MarauderLover7).

There are two main divergence points. The first is that Sirius escaped, more or less by accident, when Harry was nine, and took custody of him (which was fine with the Dursleys, but caused no small uproar in the wizarding world).

The second is that the Malfoys had a second son. And so Lucius decided to play both sides and deliberately condition Draco to bring out Gryffindor traits, in case Harry Potter became important and they wanted someone close to him.

*** Great points. This is why I hate Lady Tremaine out of all the Disney animated villains - she's the most realistic. I don't run into an Ursula or Maleficent in my real life, and if I did they'd be an enemy to fight and call others to join in. But there are all too many Lady Tremaines out there, making everyone's life worse, hurting just a small amount of people each, but there are so many of them, and they act like they aren't wicked, and the people who aren't their victims actually seem to believe this or at least not bother looking too close because it doesn't affect /them/.

Voldemort is like a force of nature - he's strong, and irredeemably evil, and also doesn't actually bother trying to justify his actions - he's very honest about being out for power. There's no point to reason with him, no way you think he could do better, he's just over-the-top evil.

Umbridge though is petty, cruel, stupid - there's no reason she has to be that way, she could be a better person if she wanted to and she doesn't want to, she doesn't care. She paves the way for people like Voldemort.

Imagine the school bully picking on the little kids, but then he's god his own little kid toady behind him laughing at the victims, someone that betrayed the other little kids to cast their lot in with the bully. Don't you hate the toady even more than the bully because they are more like you than the bully is, but just so /twisted/.

In Heinlein's The Puppet Masters, he mentioned that he'd turn from killing the alien slugs invading earth if it meant he could kill one of the humans who joined the alien cause to enslave the human race. The aliens are just that, you want to kill them for trying to enslave you but they're fundamentally unlike you and you could even fight them without hating them. But the toadies and traitors we understand all too well - and despise.

Umbridge betrays every human who wants to live in a peaceful, happy, rational world (not that very many wizards appear to want that but we the readers generally do). This is why we hate her more than Voldemort - Voldemort wasn't ever on our side or pretended to be (at least during the actual story, sure he had a time of pretended respectability but we don't really witness that). Umbridge sits in judgment and betrays all the laws she is supposed to uphold. He's corrupt, she's a liar, she's a traitor, she's a bully.

I really don't like Umbridge.

** The things umbridge did are easier for people to relate to their own experiences. Voldemort uses a torture curse that no one can really imagine how it feels since we'll never use it. Umbridge meanwhile does a torture based on cuts, which we've all experienced, and it's made worse by how the victim was made to do it to themselves, which again many people can relate to. People relate to how it feels to be called a liar in front of others when they are in fact being truthful. People know how it feels to be punished for something they didn't do. Many people know the fear of seeing a viscous person in a position of power. I honestly think that the reason umbridge is so hated is simply because her actions were so mundane. She wasn't a fantasy evil, she was the very real evil that we all see on a regular basis.

** I agree on some of your points, especially that of how Umbrige hits closer to home. However I also find that the way that Voldemort and Umbrige are presented make a valuable difference in the audience response.

If you go to how Umbrige is introduced she is described as ugly(toad like(not sure if the book uses that exact description)) and to top it off she also tortures student especially in a more realistic feeling with the blood quill that makes some readers relate too . In contrast Voldemort is first presented as a evil bastard that wanted domination, but then in the second book he is shown as a person who was not only handsome and charming but also was smart, meaning that in the eyes of many he was doing what he thought was the right path for the future.

So this deference of character might make the people see more of that tom riddle than Voldemort appearance, while in Umbrige all the fandom sees is a fat ugly person who only cares about her own interests.

** Voldemort is a terrible villain.

Aside from the encounter in the Chamber of Secrets, he's totally unrelatable and unreal. We can't understand him as a person, we can't understand his goals, and his behavior is so insanely pants-on-head stupid that we can't even properly fear him as a powerful dictator type.

Like a lot in canon, he's a walking deus ex machina, a person-shaped hole through which author fiat pours over the plot.

All of this is basically fine for the first book or three. In kids' books, adults are often presented more as forces of nature than comprehensible people. Which is fine, because to an 11 year old kid, basically any adult is so much more powerful (physically, socially, economically, whatever) that going against an adult can be likened to opposing a hurricane. (For a truly exceptional example of this and how opposing-a-hurricane grows into opposing-a-person, read the Knife of Never Letting Go series. [Really. Seriously. I cannot possibly recommend this series highly enough.])

But that all falls apart right around book 4 (and certainly by book 5). Harry's starting to view the world through a more mature lens and so a real antagonist needs to be a real character, with real motivations and disgusting but comprehensible behaviors (sadistic glee from torturing kids with a blood quill). Umbridge fits the bill perfectly. I happen to hate book 5 and have never re-read it, but for all its faults, Umbridge carries the whole thing. If it's worth reading at all, it's because Umbridge is such a perfectly detestable villain.

The problem at that point is that Rowling didn't give us another Umbridge for book six or seven, or grow Voldemort into a saner, more comprehensible villain. Instead we got a bunch of forgettable fucking-about for book 6 and then the infamous camping-trip-from-hell for book 7. Aside from a few really good action set pieces, those last two books are a complete fucking botch of the series precisely because they don't have a single focal point on a fantastic, contemptible villain like Umbridge.

****** Sure, and that could've been a really compelling story. Like over the course of seven books, we've got the three protagonists of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the three antagonists are Death's Cloak, the Elder Wand, and the Resurrection Stone which come into the possession of and begin corrupting the protagonists.

Harry just wants to be normal, wants a family and friends. He wants to hide from his fame and destiny. He gets the Cloak. It tempts him. Somewhere in the middle of the series, he uses the Cloak to get away with a terrible act. He regrets this, grows, and when he faces his Moral Event Horizon, he casts away the Cloak and takes responsibility for his actions.

Ron wants to be great. He wants to stand out from his brothers, and wants the power and recognition of greatness. He gets the Elder Wand. He becomes unbeatable, a prodigy of the International Duelling Circuit. The trio face down problems that can only be survived through overwhelming magical might and Ron saves the day via the Elder Wand. Eventually, his hammer makes him see all problems as nails, and he gets frustrated by his inability to solve problems through sheer power ("Why can't I get Hermione to love me?!"). He falls into darkness. He is either redeemed at the end (since it's a "kid's book") or he falls completely and becomes the main baddie of the last book or two. It's heart-wrenching for Harry to have to fight him.

Hermione wants to understand everything. She can't stand a mystery. She hates ignorance and the greatest point of ignorance for the entire human race is what lies beyond the veil of death. She gets the Resurrection Stone. She uses it to confer with the greatest minds of the past. She soars to new heights of magical understanding, synthesizing lost, hidden knowledge with modern scientific understanding. Eventually she delves too deep, uncovers knowledge that is a memetic threat - just knowing it is dangerous. But she's convinced that solving the problem just requires even more knowledge. In the end, she is either redeemed (since it's a "kid's book") and comes to accept the ineffible mystery of life - most notably love and her love for Harry/Ron - or she falls completely to darkness and has to be defeated by Harry.

If I were doing this, I'd have the final book be Hermione and Harry vs. Ron, with Hermione and Harry having given up and destroyed their Hallows and having to rely on teamwork (Neville, Luna, et. al.) and cleverness to overcome the hugely OP magical power of Ron.

You don't need a Voldemort to make the Harry Potter world both amazing and coherent and with a looming, dangerous evil. All you really need in an ounce of foresight and planning to make the world-building NOT terrible.

EDIT: This idea won't leave me alone now.

Each book would need to operate on three tracks. The main track would be the interactions among the protagonists and with their Hallows. The secondary track would be the antagonist of each story (Umbridge, Lockhart, etc.), and the final track would be the "B-plot" of various world-building and minor characters that comes to get paid off in the final book.

Book 1:

- Main Track: Harry gets the Cloak. The Trio become friends. The Cloak is all innocent fun for 11 year olds.
- Second Track: Dark Lord Voldemort was defeated? Or was he?! Something like the Philosopher's Stone plot.
- Third Track: We meet Neville, the Twins, Draco, etc. Draco isn't so overwhelmingly obnoxious. He has a tragic backstory and is eventually redeemed a la Zuko from A:TLA.

Book 2:

- Main Track: Harry continues to use the Cloak, but some of his actions start to seem mean-spirited or inappropriate. Hermione gets the Stone. Climactic scene when she finally figures it out and summons her beloved Grandmother.
- Second Track: Something like the CoS plot, with Hermione's knowledge from the past saving the day in the end.
- Third Track: We learn about Basilisks and other magical creatures. We meet some Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs that will come back to help Harry at the end.

Book 3:

- Main Track: Harry continues to use the Cloak. It saves them in a major way, but he also does at least one thing that's unquestionably bad and gets away with it. Hermione begins using the Stone. Near the end of the book she essentially cheats on a test by calling up a dead professor. She rationalizes the shit out of her choice. Ron gets the Wand.
- Second Track: Something like the PoA plot, but no fucking Time Turners. Time-travel's a goddamn can of worms and not worth opening.
- Third Track: We begin to learn about wizarding politics, the evils of complacency, and bit more about the wider world of Wizarding Britain. We meet Bones or someone "good" in the government who will come back to help Harry in the final book.

Book 4:

- Main Track: Harry faces a key choice about the Cloak and decides not to use it. Shoves it in his trunk and tries to ignore it but can feel it calling him. Struggles with what to do. Hermione has a major breakthrough with the Stone and becomes the youngest person ever to be published in Transfiguration Monthly. Begins to struggle with feeling like all her work is cheating. Ron attunes to the Wand and starts kicking ass.
- Second Track: Basically the Goblet of Fire. Harry considers cheating with the Cloak but turns it down, but he does take advantage of some of Hermione's new knowledge to defeat one or more of the tasks. Maybe an expanded tournment including non-champions (quiz bowl, dueling tournament, etc.) where Ron can shine.
- Third Track: We learn about the international community. Meet Fleur and Krum, learn about them as real people, and they end up on Harry's side in the final book.

Book 5:

- Main Track: Harry surrenders the Cloak. He is redeemed. Hermione struggles and we're not sure if she will surrender the Stone. She discovers the memetic threat but can't quite bring herself to accept ignorance. Ron starts getting really aggressive with his magic but when confronted about the dangers of the Hallows, refuses and chooses the Wand over redemption.
- Second Track: Keep Umbridge in all her delicious awfulness. But have Hermione defeat her via whatever the memetic knowledge-threat is. This is the cat-fight novel where the focus is primarily on Hermione and Umbridge (and maybe McGonagall, Fleur, etc.) Hermione watches in horror as Umbridge's head melts with knowledge "that man was not meant to meddle" with.
- Third Track: Sirius is exonerated and we learn more about dark magic, secret family grimoires, etc. Harry and Hermione will use secret knowledge from the Black family vault in the final book. Contrast is drawn between knowledge that is simply hoarded by families vs. intentionally scrubbed from history due its danger.

Book 6:

- Main Track: Hermione surrenders the Stone. She chooses Harry over Ron. Ron stews in anger and book ends with us unsure what Ron will do.
- Second Track: Voldemort. Voldemort is defeated utterly. Fuck Horcruxes, just give Voldemort a single phylactery that has to be tracked down and destroyed.
- Third Track: We finally learn the true nature of Lily's sacrifice for Harry. Dumbledore sacrifices himself to save Ron, but the contrast is how Ron rejects salavation vs. Harry's redemption. We learn about deeper, older magic like blood magic. Harry and Hermione use this at the end. (I'm a sucker for sad endings, so I'd say jesus-Harry sacrifices himself to save Hermione.)

Book 7:

- Main Track: Ron falls completely to darkness, unable to accept Hermione's choice. Harry and Hermione defeat him.
- Second Track: Ron himself is the villain, now. There's no Umbridge or Fudge or Lucius to fight against. Ron makes himself into a Dark Lord and seizes the tattered remnants of the Death Eaters and forges them into the magic-Gestapo that must be defeated.
- Third Track: Harry and Hermione use all the friends they've gathered along the way, all the little tricks that have come up as a way to defeat Ron.

** There's a second layer - at the end of the day, Voldemort has the kind of freedom born from power, a thing we generally desire.

​

Also, Voldemort's motives ultimately stem from very relatable things - fear of death and revenge against those who wronged and rejected him.

​

There are thus numerous avenues to sympathizing with him, especially if he never had a chance (on account of the whole love-potion birth-defect thing).

Also, most people don't generally deal with people who are actively trying to them - Voldemort's evil is too abstract.

​

​

Umbridge, on the other hand, is the avatar of every faceless bureaucrat that screws us, delights in petty torments, every terrible teacher who reveled in exercising power over mere children... She is the evil we know all too well, that hounds us from day to day - we cannot help but learn to hate her, for we know her all too well...

** Umbridge is simply much more relatable evil. Few have experience with psycopaths who want to take over the world, but many people met their own Umbridges.

That said, I don't like when Umbridge is senselessly bashed, presented as stupid and incapable of anything, just a target for the heroes to humiliate. It's just against everything that makes her such a compelling villain and it makes defeating her so much cheaper. Like, Umbridge is a sadistic bitch, but she is smart. It's not that she doesn't believe Harry about Voldemort, she at least seriously entertained the possibility since she sent Dementors to silence Harry. But she is at Hogwarts to enforce the party line, so even meeting Voldemort face to face wouldn't change her rhetoric. Probably the opposite, actually. And I doubt she really believes that the theory is a way to teach Defence or failed her own DADA OWL, like many fics claim. She herself was able to produce a corporeal Patronus with a piece of Voldemort's soul over her neck in a room full of Dementors. No, she doesn't teach anything because the Ministry don't want Dumbledore's loyalists to be able to fight. Making her see how wrong she is about everything won't work because she's already aware of that. She's also a higher-up that has the full backing of the Minister and isn't afraid to use it against anyone, sending for the Ministry official /cough \/Amelia Bones* cough* and presenting the facts won't magically resolve everything. That's why she's so terrifying. She knows full well what she's doing, and you cannot do anything about it.

** We get a lot more in canon of Tom Riddle's journey towards villainy. He's apparently always been a power-hungry psychopath, but a handsome one. A charismatic one. One who gained young Ginny's confidence, and whom even Dumbledore said had a sympathetic start. He's a better-fleshed-out character. The appeal of romantically pairing him with another character is similar to the appeal of Anne Rice's vampires, or the horrible people in /Dangerous Liaisons/. Evil, but glamorous.

Umbridge in canon is a one-note character. She's ugly, inside and out. She looks like “someone's maiden aunt,” and she talks with that stupid saccharine girly voice. She has no charisma, and no appeal. No one wants to see what's under that ugly pink cardigan because no one has seen anything appealing about her.

** While I do think your point is valid I would say its hatered more than disgust that causes people to dislike Umbridge more than Voldemort.

Its just a personal more grounded kind of opression compared to Voldemort. His form of villainy is on a large scale to a degree that many haven't felt personally or directly. Voldemort very rarely is directly fighting or messing with Harry and his friends. Even when hes actively trying to kill him its through other people he's the one pulling the strings. Yes thats hatable and you dislike him for that. But its not the person who is directly causing the discomfort. So more direct and more relatable.

** The problem we have is that Harry Potter books are from the point of view of very unreliable narrator: teenage hormonal boy under unbelievable amount of stress (the same applies to Dursleys, BTW, we really don't know much about them). We don't know much about who Dolores Umbridge truly is, we see only how Harry sees it. Yes, she is obviously very cruel and awful person, but we really don't know much about her. I am not defending her actions, but even the path towards evil is usually more complicated. In this regard, the portrait of Dolores Umbridge in linkffn(Error of Soul by Materia-Blade) is one which deserves an attention. It is a very unique story even in other ways, highly recommended (and yes, it is unfinished and rather cruelly in the middle of the story arc and cliffy).

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

** Within the realm, I'd also say that one of the differences in the reactions, aside from the fact that that Tom was attractive is that his backstory compared to Umbridge's is much more tragic. If she had a similar backstory, I think people would see her in a slightly different light.

**** I don't mean that you are only disgusted by things you hate, only that people tend to also be disgusted by things they already hate. The hate vs disgust dichotomy you are presenting is false. We don't just hate Voldemort, we love to hate him. And disgust isn't the only thing we feel for Umbridge, we hate her. Actually, personally, there are only four Harry characters that disgust me (Petunia, Vernon, Medungus, and Bellatrix). On the other hand, the list that Umbridge falls under (characters that make me angry) is much longer; though she is towards the top of that list.

** Here's my perspective on this.

Umbridge was a personal relatable antagonist who we saw very directly and significantly harass, harm, and otherwise alter the story. She has no redeeming qualities. We all know a situation of unjust punishment being dished out, of being accused of lying when you're honest, and the anger of someone abusing their power. We all know an Umbridge that we already dislike which makes her a symbol of that hatred.

Voldemort was someone we directly encountered... Three times in the entire series. The resurection, the Department of Mysteries, and the scene he died. He had very little direct influence on the plot. He doesn't really do anything bad to the protagonists directly. We are even made to have sympathy and pity for him due to his childhood which further dulls the already weak dislike we already had. How many evil dark lords have you met in your life? He just isn't comparable to someone you have ever hated in your actual life.

Voldemort is one of the weakest characterizations of a villain I've ever read about - he's on a similar standing as Galbatorix from Eragon a series that is mediocre at its highest. He just isn't compelling, he isn't relatable, he has little effect on the plot, and he was no personality. There just isn't anything to hate because there's not really anything there.

** The difference is, Umbridge is personal. Voldemort tortures and kills. Huh. Cool. Don't particularly hate him. But /Umbridge/ picks on weaknesses. When the last thing Harry need was to be called a liar, that is exactly what she did. And, unlike Voldemort, they couldn't do anything because she worked in the ministry and no one cared. That's why we hate her.
