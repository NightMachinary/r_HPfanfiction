  "His exam results came the day before you did; twelve O.W.L.s and he hardly gloated at all.”

  “Ordinary Wizarding Levels,” George explained, seeing Harry's puzzled look. “Bill got twelve, too."
#+end_quote

Twelve O.W.L.s would imply that both of them passed Divination, which is something I simply cannot imagine. It is pretty much said that only true Seers can succeed in that subject, regardless of however hard you study; you are either born with the ability or you aren't. And yet, Bill and Percy are shown to have somehow passed the subject, despite not a single mention of their Divination knowledge.

I think this is slightly lazy and shallow writing by J.K. Rowling who wanted to write both of them as the perfect sons (top grade, Prefect, Head Boy), and so didn't put too much thought into it. Unlike someone like Hermione who, fittingly, got nine Outstandings and one Exceeds Expectations - because her overdependence on books wouldn't help her with D.A.D.A., and it is understandable that she wasn't a Seer hence she wasn't prolific in Divination, and as a human, she simply couldn't handle the stress so she left Muggle Studies. That's a lot more detailed writing that has depth in it.

Eh, the general consensus is that it's "woolly." And my understanding is that it's because the future is ever changing.

I imagine that if one can memorize the various symbols and understand how the planets work they should get a passing grade. Both Lavender and Parvati passed as well. And if there was a Divination professor before Trelawney, BCJ did so, too.

*** Yes remember you don't need the highest score to "get an owl" in a subject, you just have to pass. So I definitely think you can get a OWL in divination without any ability to predict the future at all.

Getting 12 OWLs isn't like getting 90-100% on 12 tests. It's like getting 60+% on 12 tests.

** Is there any indication /at all/ that you need to be a Seer to pass the Divination exam? From what I understand, Seers don't do prophecies on-demand, it would be very weird if the examiners expected everyone to spit one out or fail.

Additionally, is there any indication at all that Divination is truly only about Seers? While we all agree that Trelawney is only bullshitting in her classes, the class might very well have existed before Dumbledore hired her and might at some point have taught magic that fits under the Divination umbrella while not being actual prophecies - things like predicting the wheather, some form of scyring, perhaps something like psychometry. Things that could be learned from books or other sources if one wanted to pass the exam without having a competent teacher.

Or perhaps the Divination O.W.L. has a theoretical exam, which could easily be aced by someone without any Seer talent and could be enough to pass even when failing to produce a prophecy during the practical exam (which I still think would be a completely unreasonable practical exam).

** My personal headcanon, which has no basis in actual canon, is that "Divination" is the class of magic that provides information, full stop. Trelawney, in the book/movies scenes that we see, is teaching about /precognition/ and /fortelling/, a subset of divination that deals with seeing the future. That part, by its nature, would be woolly and subjective and may indeed require the inner eye. However, while getting a vision might require the inner eye, probing probability and fate might not be, if done right. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero][0800-Rent-A-Hero]] does this very well, with rituals that combine multiple divination types to focus on a single piece of information.

But, it wouldn't be the only thing taught. The past is set in stone (and if you count Fantastic Beasts as canon, there are methods for seeing the past), so gathering information about the past and present might be much easier. I imagine that the "Point Me!" spell is a form of present-divination, as is the fanon-made "Tempus" spell, which tells the time.

Anyway, that's my two cents. Probably nothing of what I said is canon, but the way canon presents divination as almost non-magical just sucks my enjoyment out of it.

Giving wood the property of magnetism seems like an intermediate Transfiguration spell or a Charm.

Summoning and Banishing charms don't use gravity. Nor do Levitation Charms, considering it's possible to keep someone in their rough position with them without them turning - witness Snape in PoA.

In the real world school subjects have a 'weight' in regards to exams and coursework (some being 100% exam, others being 100% coursework and there being some courses with different divisions and emphasis). All courses at Hogwarts are 100% exam but most exams are split between theory and practical. We can assume they are given equal importance but we don't know.

Possibly, Percy and Bill could have made up any deficiency they had in the practical portion in the theory and/or also got lucky or had enough skill to score well in the practical. For example, Harry attributes his high grade in Defense to his Patronus as it got him "extra marks" in the practical section.

Tl/dr Percy and Bill could have got high marks in Divination theory AND we don't know what grades they got anyway, so technically JK isn't at fault here. Hermione just couldn't hack it like they could.

2. Percy is an asskisser. He might get a pass just for being a 'model student', without showing any particular talents.

3. I have my doubts that gaining an OWL in a subject is very hard to begin with. They are the first somewhat serious examinations of young wizards. Do we even hear of any students attempting an OWL and failing? You'd probably have to take a dump on the exam paper and completely fail at the practical to fail your owl if you're a halfway competent wizard or witch.

IMHO gaining an OWL is more about ambition and diligence than anything else.

Think about Umbridge preparing the students to take OWLs: she has no control over what they will be tested on, or how well they will do beyond how well she prepares them for the exam which is designed and assessed by external examiners.

It's not like American high school: it isn't in the school's power to give you a retry because the exam is done and done. If there are serious extenuating circumstances, and there are other externally assessed criteria to base it on (like a GCSE involving more than one exam, or coursework) you might get the exam board to give you a decent mark: falling asleep near the end of an exam you were failing anyway, then fainting and having a vision, probably won't hack it. You'll just have to either eat the bad GCSE, or wait for the next round of exams (there are often two or three sessions a year, to enable retakes) and retake an OWL while working on your NEWTs.

Because, as the joke goes, if you're one in a million in China, there's 1400 other people who are better than you.

** The only way to solve it is to headcanon it, there's not enough facts in the books. Personally I like to go with the idea that certain types of divination require you to be a "Seer" but other types are more like rote skills that you can learn to at least some extent. Much like drawing, I'm rubbish right now, but if I practice enough I'll passable. I'll never be Da Vinci though, no matter how much I practice. Same with tea leaves or taromancy or the astrology. Its mostly learned material, with just an element of talent rather than skill to it.

And I'd say that the theory exam at OWL would require you to present a theoretical knowledge of a wide array of methods. However the practical would only require you to demonstrate a single method in use, so you could choose whatever you were best at. It might be that there are some methods which are easier than others, tea leaves for example is literally just looking for shapes in the sludge. So you just have to train your eyes to pick out the shapes and memorise a bunch of interpretations.

Presumably at NEWT level you need to go much further, perhaps demonstrate a level of competence across varied types of divination, that sort of thing.

Nothing I've presented here is contradicted by what is said in canon, its just not backed up by it either. As I recall in his OWL Harry used a crystal ball. But he never took the subject seriously, never practiced, always made up his homework rather than actually practicing the skills he was being taught. So naturally he completely failed the exam. Its like having an art class, and printing off a picture for your homework each week rather than sketching it, then turning up for the exam and ending up doing a couple of stick figures.

** The only really goofy thing about this is that there are only 5 other electives, which every student had to choose at least two of them. There shouldn't be any conflicts possible. If there were 7 or more electives I could see a possible conflict in scheduling, but not with so few to choose from.

Even so, part of the reason Hermione might be challenged by taking all of them was that she was also playing catch-up for the time missed at the end of the previous year.

I agree with others that taking the OWL for a class you never attended should be possible, and that getting an OWL merely means you got a Acceptable or better. Hermione was shooting for the ultimate: Outstanding in all classes. There are some fanfics where they count an O as two OWLs instead of just one, which means Hermione would have 19 OWLs (and she could have gotten 21 if she tested in Divination and Muggle Studies despite skipping the classes) - but that's fanon trash so you can disregard it.

*** I think you might be thinking of ‘electives' like in American high schools, where I gather they're more for interest?

OWLs are like GCSEs (or O-Levels, as were): students have to take some core subjects, and then can choose ‘options' which are other GCSE subjects that not everyone has to take. They all lead to a GCSE, which is gained by taking an externally designed, carefully controlled, national assessment (usually exams, although subjects like Drama and Art have more complicated assessment arrangements).

While all lead to a GCSE, some are consider more prestigious than others, and some are widely considered a doss that hardly counts (rightly or wrongly). This second category includes anything with ‘studies' in the name.

** I disagree. To collect an OWL, one only needs to pass. A grade of Acceptable, Exceeds Expectations, and Outstanding all qualify. And the judges don't necessarily need to be seers themselves to verify that the students have correctly made predictions. They could simply be demonstrating an understanding of the signs. Like reading of tea leaves could be passable if “The tea leaves show a sun, so that means happiness is in your future” is an accurate response.

I've always found it interesting that they would get 12 OWLs because that could imply that Peru and Bill themselves were both given time turners in order to attend all those classes. And if so, they each successfully used those time turners for five years. It's also possible that their schedules better allowed for taking all the subjects, but I don't know that I've ever read an explanation either way.

**** Bill is a pretty big unknown in terms of definable skill/intelligence level in canon. We only hear secondhand stories of his cool job and good grades, and he doesn't do a whole lot in the little “screen time” he does get.

Percy, however, gets a ton of screen time, and while studious and ambitious, he never really seems to be shown as especially bright or talented - in book three, the twins prank his head boy badge, and it is implied that he has a hard time reversing it - despite having two years of magical experience over them. He is never seen “on screen” as being anything more than above average intelligence, other than the “12 OWLs” throw away line.

Hermione on the other had (perhaps only due to her high relevance to the story) is shown to be smart enough and talented enough to brew and cast far above her grade level - polyjuice potion, protean charm, undetectable extension charm, 115% on her charms test as examples.

I'm by no means saying Hermione is perfect, but she IS incredibly smart and magically talented. The most logical explanation for her failing to do what bill and Percy did is that JKR wrote the 12 OWLs apiece as a throwaway line and didn't really think about it, but if we have to accept that it is canon then my original argument makes the most sense.

** Headcanon: Flying classes used to continue for all 7 years (or maybe only until 5th year), and it's the fact that they were intending to stop this practice to make room for more academic subjects that allowed McGonagall to get Harry on the Quidditch team. In this circumstance, it would be because brooms used to be rarer and less accessible, thus first years couldn't be trusted with one until they'd been trained and certified by the school itself.

So getting a Flying OWL would be easy.

Ron and Harry both do well enough in Divination just bullshitting. Most students probably just treat it like HoM.

Bill and Percy almost certainly took Muggle Studies, probably with patchwork knowledge from Arthur shoring up their education. Arthur doesn't know much about Muggle culture per se, but he seems to understand the minutiae of relations between wizards and Muggles, which would be good to slot into an essay for some interesting asides.

So, yeah, I can see it happening. They didn't necessarily get 12 Outstandings, just 12 passes.
