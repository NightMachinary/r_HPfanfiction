With magic it should be easy to construct the 23rd century tech from The Expanse in the near future. Goblin belters rebelling? Muggleborns and progressive wizarding families emigration to the high-magitech martian magical republic while traditionalist wizards stay on earth? An alien lifeform capable of magic completely different than what is known to wizardkind escaping from the Department of Mysteries' deep space lab?


** I would pay decent money for a well-done crossover of these.

*** I'm trying to write a near future fic with magic tech which will have some aspects of this (constant 1 G acceleration spaceships with a relatively simple magic infinite reaction mass drive, before magical methods to manipulate gravity and inertia are invented later on and it moves to something closer to star trek) but I'm having a really hard time writing a good villain...
