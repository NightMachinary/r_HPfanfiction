When I say essay style fic, I don't mean the writer writing an essay, I mean an in-universe character writing about in-universe happenings.

It was an essay on Harry Potter. In this universe, when the prophecy was declared, the ministry took Harry and Neville and trained them, using some sort of time travel in the process I believe, as they came out older than they should be and dependant on medication. Harry was then declared boy who lived and Neville, now unimportant, was taken off of meds. Harry kills Voldy and disappears for a bit (and takes Neville with him, who I believe dies). Later on, Harry returns to got to a muggle university and makes giant advancements by combining magic and technology. Even later on, he opens a store in America that sells magical cameras (which later evolve into a sort of phone). They become obscenely popular but he gets in trouble for basically breaking the Statute of Secrecy. Don't really remember what happened after that.

My description may not be entirely accurate as its been a while.

Any help would be appreciated.

** There is the one written from Lucius Malfoy's perspective that was really good - a one shot unfortunately.

Harry and co made a deal with Voldemort that gives him magical Britain but it turns really sour for the Death Eaters.
