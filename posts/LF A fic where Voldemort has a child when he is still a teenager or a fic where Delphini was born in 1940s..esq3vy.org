I have read plenty of Delphini fics where she was born either at the end of the First Wizarding War or sometime after his rebirth in 1995, and so I thought that it will be interesting to see Delphini ( Voldemort's daughter according to the Cursed Child, may not be canon) growing up in 1950s.


** Delphi and Bellatrix as classmates would be interesting. Maybe even as sisters? I could see Druella or Walburga having an affair. Or Lucretia, but then she'd be raised as a Prewett

*** Imagine Delphini and Molly Prewett growing up together.
