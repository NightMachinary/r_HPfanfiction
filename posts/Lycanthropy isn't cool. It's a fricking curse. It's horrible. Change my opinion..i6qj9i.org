I just don't understand why there are so many people idolizing being a werewolf. Lupin had a pretty f***** up problem, he transformed into a monster once a month and if he couldn't drink the Wolfsbane potion he could end up killing innocent people. Besides, the transformation is horribly painful.

Why, then, are there so many people writing fanfics about "alpha werewolves", about werewolves having "packs" (which doesn't make sense, as werewolves transform once a month; they are normal people the rest of the month) and having amazing abilities that aren't part of the Harry Potter world?

/Sigh/

** That's basically it. Lupin had a pretty fucked up problem - people like Lupin, so they want him to be less sad and have less of a problem. Making Werewolves purely nice would be bullshit, so they come up with the rationale for why it's a power boost if he just 'accepts his wolf' or whatever to give a bit of fairness and development/growth to it.

Then you've got the Anne Rice effect where 'Vampire/Werewolf = Buff, Broody, Byronic Hot Person', the ridiculously well-disproven Alpha-pack dynamics thing (the guy who came up with that nonsense was one of the biggest proponents of it being nonsense), add in a dash of kink and a sprig of 'people did it before and I and others have enjoyed a fic with it in' and you've got a perfect recipe for HP-fandom werewolves and probably most of the reasons why so many people take/like that approach.

Strangely enough, changing the effects of the curse to "help" Lupin has an opposite effect (at least for me).\\
You go from "Lupin is sad because he is affected by a terrible curse" to "Lupin is sad because he is a whiny little bitch that can't accept the wolf inside him to get the powerboost".

**** Sometimes I do agree with you, sometimes I don't. Like any trope or even cliche, it can be done well or it can be done not as well.

Like, the Codex Alera (novel series where everyone has innate magic apart from the protagonist, basically) approach to werewolves could be really interesting. Imagine if you had innate access to some big boost of power and talent and skill, but you couldn't access it no matter how hard you tried. You're stigmatised for being what you are by anyone who isn't a werewolf, and you're also stigmatised by fellow werewolves for not going all the way.

You don't belong anywhere, and you don't even get the benefits of membership, all because you can't go Full Wolf. I don't know about you, but if it was done well, I think that'd be a pretty reasonable thing to make Lupin sad. :)

***** It sorta seems like the two of you are talking about different points, though I'm not totally sure. He's addressing stories where Remus could go Full Wolf but refuses to. You seem to be talking about an actual restriction. Having moral reasons why Remus didn't want to go Full Wolf would probably be the easiest way connect the two. Maybe there's a chance he'll lose his morality and control, and no matter how small that risk, he'd rather hurt himself than lose himself or hurt those around him. For me, I don't think that concept is bad or unreasonable, but it does feel pretty cliche. Also, normally the main character just magically solves his problem. Obviously, there are better ways to handle it so a variation of this concept could be interesting. I do see the appeal.

****** The Codex Alera thing was just an example of how 'character refuses or is unable to access ability that would make them more powerful/happy' could be done in an interesting way. Sometimes I agree with what the other poster said, Lupin not accessing a beneficial power can come off really whiny, but if you set it up in an interesting way, it can become more a workable idea. That example was just an offhand idea, so there's definitely flaws and limits to it and it'd need way more work to actually make into a functioning plot, but that kind of 'the only kid without magic in a magical world' vibe/dynamic could make a fun basis for writing this sort of thing. That was all. :)

Hell, to follow on from your thing, it could be relating to the trauma of his original turning. He does it once, turns, loses his morality and control, does something terrible under the metaphorical influence, and then keeps fighting that nature, hating himself for what he did and believing Werewolf-ness is a curse that makes people into monsters. After all, if it can make you do something like that, then surely all those people who believe in 'embracing the wolf' are deluding themselves, right? Or maybe he's just different? The one werewolf who is a monster, who is everything all the stories he's heard all his life say.

Basically, if you set up some internal logic to support the idea of 'positive werewolves', it can be workable.

And well, everything is cliche to those who've seen it a million times before. It's the nature of a cliche. Just gotta iterate on it a few times until you find something interesting to say/do with it. :)

Boy leaves farm and boarding school adventures are hardly original tropes, even when the original books were written, yet we're still reading those books and watching those movies and writing in the world decades after the first book was published. :)

Dan Brown (the writer of The Da Vinci Code) actually talked about this in his masterclass. It's one of the things I've enjoyed most from him and definitely boosted my opinion of him a lot.

“Every single idea has been done over and over and over. You don't need a big idea. You need big hows.”

And he's absolutely right. We know Bond will always defuse the bomb and get the girl, we know Indy!Harry will always beat Dumbledore, we know the Doctor will always run around and yell technobabble then defeat the monsters. But we keep watching and reading and enjoying because it's all about 'How' they do the thing. You work out how to make that new, and you've got 'originality'.

People don't like those who are different, but if no one talks about it, this doesn't mean disability and other conditions will just go away and people having them will just stop existing. I think it's no coincidence that only those who have experienced difficulties similar to those experienced by Remus actually accurately portray this condition. I'm all for escapism, but when it's a stigmatised illness, I think it's unfair to sort of almost make it an advantage.

****** True. It can be sad that people don't want to write about these experiences, but it isn't always as simple as that. Though for the record, I'm not defending the practice of 'positive werewolves', only attempting to explain the logic behind it. The OP asked why people do it, so I was attempting to answer that question, then you asked another why question and I attempted to answer that. I have no horse in this metaphorical race. Personally, I don't mind what approach they take - so long as the writer creates an internal logic to support whatever it is they're covering, I'm fine with it.

While I'm sure you're right that some of the people writing these stories and getting all de-stigmatised and escapist do take that attitude to real life, I'm sure there are also some that don't - are people reading/writing Pureblood Culture or Death Eater apologism fics all traditionalist bigots and Nazi apologists? No. You don't intrinsically have to believe what you're reading or writing. As with every issue, the spectrum of opinions will inevitably run the gamut of perspectives.

I can see your point vis a vis not talking about it, but for some people that's not why they write. They're not looking to create allegorical literature exploring real world issues that make them sad IRL already - they just want something fluffy to make them smile where the characters they like get a happy ending. They're not denying that people don't get happy endings in real life, they're just trying to cheer themselves up or distract themselves from reality for a while by creating a world where everyone does get a happy ending.

There are probably a dozen more other reasons too. Perhaps they don't feel they can do that story of prejudice justice. Perhaps they've experienced similar things themselves and just want a break from it for awhile. These are just the examples that occurred to me while writing this.

Generally though, to them not everything has to be grand literature exploring real world issues - sometimes you need stuff that's just there to be fun and entertaining crap. Burnout is very much a thing and we do often read and keep reading fanfiction because it entertains us, no? There's a reason that Reality Television persists so well, after all. :)

And I say all that as someone who teaches about mental health, works to reduce stigma, and advocates for better mental health service and culture in the UK for work IRL. :)

So, yeah. It might not be useful for fighting prejudice and such IRL, or even teaching people but it does serve a purpose for those people, at least. You and they just differ on what purpose you feel the narrative should meet, I suppose.

And I apologise if you feel I'm not taking you and your points seriously. My lacking ability to make my tone clear when writing on the internet kicking up again, I guess. I do think you have a point, but there is another side to things that I was trying to cover with my response. I do hope it came across right - to be clear, I was very much being a devil's advocate to try answer your question rather then decrying you or your opinions.

And well, if you're going to rant on the internet, this is probably one of the better topics to do so on. Always good to see people passionate about reflecting these experiences accurately and defending those whom society acts with prejudice against. :)

** Not even gonna try to change your opinion. So many people try to take away Remus Lupin's pain by having him ‘Accept his wolf' or giving him epic powers and a pack, but I think that takes away a lot of what makes him such a good character.

Take Greyback, for example. He's ‘accepted his wolf', allowing it to consume him, and it's turned him into a sick motherfricker, both in human and wolf form. Fan girls say, “oh, but Remus is inherently good, so he would be able to tame his wolf and make it good.” But would he? Fenrir Greyback could have been a decent, upstanding bloke before he was turned, but Lycanthropy is a sickness, and by accepting it, that sickness was allowed to enter and take over his mind.

So I agree with you. Lycanthropy isn't cool, it's not fun, and it doesn't make for mind blowing kinky sex. It's a disease that eats at the bearer's mind and soul, and it's incredibly painful.

I will point out, though, that Fenrir Greyback did canonically lead a pack of werewolves as allies to Voldemort. So they do have packs, but probably only after they allow the sick nature of the wolf to consume them entirely.

Edit: I forgot to add, it is reasonable that werewolves would have slightly enhanced senses. As we know from Bill Weasley's case, lycanthropy does affect the sufferer in human form (e.g. preferring rare meat) so it's not unreasonable that a werewolf would have better hearing, better sight (or, more specifically, better night vision) and a better sense of smell than the average human.

These, however, can be both a blessing and a curse: loud noises and high-pitched sounds would /hurt like hell/; bright lights, like those produced by the Patronus and Lumos charms, would be blinding, especially if they appear suddenly in a dim or dark room; imagine being the first to smell a fart, and then having to suffer it longer than everyone else because you can smell better, or the stench of the dead on the battlefield - burned flesh, blood, excrement, and the sickening-yet-sweet smell of decay, which the werewolf can smell sometimes days before everyone else.

Because Greyback wasn't actually transformed/in wolf form at the time of the attack, and he didn't bite, but rather, slashed Bill's face, Bill didn't become a proper werewolf. The wound was contaminated, though, so he received some wolf-like traits on top of the gnarly scars, like preferring his meat rare/raw.

Each "infection" is enough to warrant execution under military law (the UK didn't abolish capital punishment until after the battle of Hogwarts and even then not for military offenses such as unleashing biological weapons on civilians), the magical world still carries out summary executions as seen by the hunt for Sirius and the fate of Crouch Jr, so they'd have even fewer qualms.

It's a well-known fact that those that are desperate will take anything to change their situation. The fact that they were treated worse than muggle-born wizards does not help the situation. Not to mention the fact that they are poor and uneducated with nobody to love. Not many people would be willing to make the potion for them and those that would are not available to them. So, in the end, they would have to accept their wolf to have any relief.

Not to mention they would find other werewolves who accepted their wolf for the relief as well. Seeing that it helped others would aid them in the decision of accepting their wolf. This, in my opinion, would somewhat merge their minds and way of thinking with their wolf. This would lead to a more amoral way of thinking. They would of course like violence (because they have merged with a wolf) but will give them the strength to do whatever it took to get the ability to do whatever they needed to let them be seen as normal citizens.

This and the fact they were shunned by many even with the wolfsbane potion would let tom riddle come in. All he would have to do is let them believe that after the war is won he would give them their rights for their aid, and now he has them on his side. I doubt Dumbledore did the same which give them even more of a reason not to help the light. All they would see is the 'light' side did not care for them and their poster werewolf had everything they wanted and they did not. They would see how he turned out and feel jealous or angry because it could have been them if the 'light' cared.

All in all the human mind is weird and to merge it with the mind of an amoral predator and a desperate human causes what we got with the war.

P.s Fenrir greyback for me is someone who I became worse when he became a werewolf. He could have been slightly more inclined to violence and killing (maybe could have been killing and harming people) which would have been amplified by the amoral mindset he would gain as a full werewolf.

This is exactly the kind of romantic interpretation op is questioning. "Accepting the wolf" means embracing crimes against humanity since that's what infecting another person amount to.

People who are HiV positive do not embrace "the AIDS" and go on infection sprees (unless they are insane), they ought to take all possible precautions to prevent further infections.

There is nothing in canon which indicates that lycanotrophy makes you violent outside of the transformation itself. The unhinged violence is on the people, not their illness.

************* Never said anything that would lead you to believe it was a romantic interpretation. It's more of an 'it makes sense why some who accept their wolves would be more capable of being ruthless and violent'. Not to mention how you seem to believe in your replies that they are all evil. For me their behaviour is understandable. When all else fails, turn to violence to gain your rights.

The wizarding world is not perfect and neither are it's people. That doesn't mean I don't still love it but it's easy to see why somethings happened. To see some characters are more complex than just they are evil. You can see that some of their ideas are good for the wizarding world but are not seen. Separation from the muggle world completely, for example, is something that should be looked into. Rights for magical creatures are a must. The restrictions of magic is another. I'm sure it's canon but it could just be widespread fanon but a lot of magic that was restricted didn't need to be.

Not to mention the characters are not all black and white. James, Remus and Sirius are not the best of men but they did change. Severus didn't get to truly grow since he didn't let someone in and he wasn't a good man either, but he did the right thing. Dumbledore made a lot of mistakes and was very manipulative. He did it for the greater good but that didn't mean he wasn't manipulating a lot of people.

Sorry for the tangent but I hope you get my point. I myself am neither here nor there with the way people portray lycanthropy. As long as it makes the story more enjoyable and good im fine with it. But werewolves are creatures that were once human and now they are suddenly shunned. Not to mention all I have said previously. It all builds up and creates desperate people that can be manipulated. With my theory of accepting the wolf messing with your head slightly, it created people that can and will do anything.

I understand where their resentment comes from, but attacking the general populace is hardly a good response. If they actually went after their oppressors, we would not be having this discussion. They had various non violent alternatives to improve their lives, from the kind of manual labour which does not require a school degree to pulling a heist on a Sainsbury depot and living off that since magic would make such a plan ridiculously easy. But the werewolves, pretty much as one, chose violence against people who were not those in power.

*************** Because they are more of an easier target. Again some of them are not educated at all in magic at all. Majority of them are purebloods of course so they will obviously be confused in the muggle world. However, I would not be surprised if what you're suggesting was done by one or two packs.

What I think is that they were doing it not only by orders of Voldemort and Fenrir but just to have some revenge. Some of them could see the wizarding world as a whole as the problem similar to purebloods seeing muggles as a whole as disgusting. It wouldn't surprise me if they thought that everyone was to blame and the fact they were thrown out by parents, disowned, killed their parents or tried to be killed by their parents could lead to that.

That doesn't excuse the fact that what they did was wrong and that in our eyes it wasn't the only choice of action but to them it was. They were wrong for doing that but when stuff pills up It's not unheard of to see people act like that.

But what I will say is that there could also be werewolf packs that not only refuse to attack humans but instead use muggle means to survive, refused to join the dark and have accepted their wolf without becoming a cold-blooded killer. To me, it depends on the person and the circumstance. A kind-hearted person could be turned and become jaded and depending on where the went things could be different. If they went to Fenrir they would soon become as twisted as him. Or if they went to a pack that didn't kill humans and refused to bite anyone they would still be a little jaded but not have gone down that dark path.

The fact Fenrir and his pack are well known so I think that helps them get members.

But yeah this is all my opinions. For me, people are blank slates and it is the environment they lived in that causes them to become more twisted and dark. There are of course exceptions to the rule but even then your environment can either aid or hinder you. So the fact that werewolves are being shunned rather than helped and that like Fenrir and others like him are running around are not helping anyone. All it does is give more ammunition to people like tom riddle and cause issues for those who want to be good and would rather not hurt people every moon.

It's just all about the environment and the wizarding world is a very mixed one.

That's the crux of the matter, there's no indication that they exist other than Lupin. If they existed, you'd expect to see one of them throughout the series like that vampire Slughorn invited to his dinner party. Further evidence is that Lupin reached out to werewolves and came back with a through rejection rather than "two packs declared neutrality, three want to follow Dumbledore, 5 are on the fringe and Greyback has rallied 12" or something like that. All known Werewolves (other than Lupin) rejected peace.

***************** For me, it would just make sense that their were others either like lupin or who were against the whole dark lord thing.

To talk about the fact they joined Voldemort. I would guess it's cause they want their rights. Again we gotta understand that werewolves can barely hold jobs in the magical world. Lupin had to quit the moment everyone found out so he didn't get into more trouble with the parents. For them, the fact that he was promising them their rights would off endear them to his cause. I could understand that kind of thought process. Especially when they have no rights to marry.

For me, the books hold more than just good vs evil. There are shifty characters and groups throughout. Dumbledore was manipulative and deceitful 'for the greater good', snape was never a good man but he cared enough to make the right choice in the end, (I don't remember is this is canon or fanon) the purebloods had actual grounds for concern against the muggles even though they were blatantly racist and the werewolves that were on the dark side had valid reasons to be angry and follow the dark lord but they went about it all wrong. Main characters and groups had parts that were right. Muggles are dangerous and most should not know about the magical world, muggle-born wizards are good for the magical world because it stops inbreeding and gives new life to magic and werewolves shouldn't be thrown out from society and should instead be treated. With the wolfsbane potion, the main point of stress from being a werewolf is gone.

For me, it would obviously make sense that some of the wolf pack would be 'good' and not murder muggles. Some would use muggle means. But we must understand that most are pure blood's and have no clue. They lived happy lives until they were bitten.

Besides if Voldemort could have Severus snape a half-blood wizard stay by his side I doubt it would take much to do the same to the werewolves.

None of the Greyback encounters in canon are stated to take place under a full moon - in fact, both of the ones in Book 6 are stated /not/ to be a full-moon. The second time we see him in Book 6, he also states that he'd eat human flesh regardless of whether the moon is up or not.

It's never /stated/ whether any of the battles in book 7 take place under a full moon, but given that Lupin is included in plans around the children for the first one, that one's heavily implied not to. The movies have both battles /not/ taking place under a full moon, if that counts for anything.

Canon /does/ give us the Wolfsbane Potion, which lets werewolves stay sane during the full moon. If the final battle took place under a full moon (which the books don't say), presumably all werewolves present took that potion if only to remember which side they're on.

**** It probably has something to do with werewolves in literature/pop culture in general. Otherwise we wouldn't have that many books, films, tv shows about them! Same with vampires.

A lot of the time it has to do with the abilities and lifestyle the creature characters exhibit: super strength, shapeshifting etc. And most the time they're outsiders but like, /cool/ outsiders. 😂 So people gravitate to that. You could be the sophisticated vampire loner, or the "I totally have loads of friends because we're a pack!" outsider.

In HP, yeah, the movie makes Lupin's transformation pretty terrible. But IIRC the books don't really describe it as anything other than terribly painful - which is across the board for most werewolf pop culture canons. So I guess people can run with that and make it what they like or use lycanthropy = disease and turn it into an analogy for the Muggle world.

Lycanthropy as a trope though, i mean it depends on the books and the lore you are following as to whether it is absolutely the worst thing that can happen or not.

******** My problem with this line of thinking is the same problem that people have when this line of thinking is applied to real world issues. There is a reason that werewolves are often associated with the LGTB+ community and one of the prevalent reasons is that shared feeling of being hated for something "mysterious" that cannot be controlled and was not chosen. In my opinion it's one of the reasons that lycanthropy is so widely represented. Almost everyone can understand the position of the werewolf. What should Lupin do? He's taking medication for it. He's regulating himself. Should he be set aside from the rest of humanity? Should he be put in Azkaban because he can't hurt the dementors?

I'm not saying any of this because I'm accusing you of hating minorities, or whatnot, just as a thoughtful response for one of the many reasons people are intrigued in werewolves and have been for so many centuries. In my personal opinion you can't say that you hate all werewolves just because of who they are without getting into some interesting moral quandaries, even if it is just fiction.

********* Outside of your comment i have never heard of werewolves as supposed to depict lgbt people. and if it is somehow the case it would just be a further example of concepts coopted as a metaphor for the lgbt movement since the lgbt is eternally trying to create a big tent movement for outsiders. not a criticism of the movement but it is a political tactic not a representation of truth.

lycanthropy is not a metaphor for gay people, it is a metaphor for mental illness like bipolar disorder, multiple personality disorder and to an extent schizophrenia.

gay people do not have a literal switch in their heads causing them to act without the safety of others in mind. Remus is a high functioning member of this community who has in many ways been capable of suppressing his condition and a willingness to seek treatment. wolfsbane is the clearest lampshade on the trope. if you take this drug which is expensive and horrible you will be safe, you will not harm others or yourself.

and also no one can argue a person with a more aggressive mental disorder refusing to take their medication is not a danger to society. it's also a problem that ignores status or culture as it is a disease of the mind and often blood.

werewolfs are also denied jobs ,education and places in society. they are likely to be homeless and band together out of a mutual need to survive. it is an unfortunate ill of society that those with these conditions typically gravitate towards criminality or institutionalization due to simply the need to survive.

and when institutionalization became too expensive they were left to wander becoming dangers to themselves and others.

and before you jump on this as hatred against the mentally ill understand lycanthropy is an exaggeration. the closest real world example is if you had a family member/loved one who developed a disorder that might put them in a paranoid/jealous/self-destructive rage where they might conceivably kill someone. which is relatively unlikely in truth but not completely unfounded

im not just talking out of my ass. this moon madness is largely understood to be the origin of tales of werewolves in stories outside of those more mythological in nature. the moon likely having nothing to do with it other then giving more significance to otherwise random events.

Hmm. I think that's true in a lot of fictional works, and there's a lot of historical truth in that - the old term for someone mentally ill was "lunatic" because people genuinely believed the moon affected it.

BUT in the Harry Potter universe, lycanthropy is a metaphor for HIV. JKR has been quite explicit about that, and how Lupin's struggles with employment and opening up to people and his fear of anyone finding out "what he is" is a direct metaphor for how people with AIDS were shunned in the 80s and 90s. Remember she started writing these books in 1991, where there was still huge stigma around not just being HIV positive but being gay in general. I think the fact she's said that her werewolves are stand ins for people with AIDS and the stigma attached to that, that's why people in this fanfom associate it with LGBT issues, because AIDS has been used for years as an excuse to stigmatise LGBT people.

********* Is it wrong to hate someone for something they can't control? Absolutely. A current event is where if someone even might have Covid 19 they are expected to quarantine themselves from society for the good of everyone until it's confirmed they don't have it. They didn't choose to have it yet we have to expect people to do the right thing. But not everyone does. Some people act as if it's no threat and that it doesn't matter which makes it spread.

I personally can not see the werewolf/lgbt connection but that's just me because being LGBT doesn't HURT anyone else but being a werewolf(or in my example, Covid 19) CAN hurt someone. Especially if the proper precautions aren't taken.

Look at Lupin. He 100% doesn't want to infect anyone but he still does come close due to negligence (admittedly with good reason) to infecting several students or outright killing them.

Maybe if the culture didn't shun werewolves so viciously then he could be open about who he was, be afforded proper treatment to handle it, and be able to teach in the open instead of going the back alley method with secret potions under tables. Corona is a 24-7 illness. Being a werewolf only affects Lupin once a month.

LGTB+ doesn't hurt anyone. I meant to make that clearer! But bigots and homophobes sure did spend (and actively do spend) years acting like it did/does. Look at trans outrage. We're all supposed to be so terrified of them, right? Under each bathroom wall, a trans person just waiting to enact their fantasies of seeing the opposite gender on the toilet. LGTB+ people in the past (and present) were and are forced to hide who they are. That's where the parallel lies.

Corona is a 24-7 thing but it doesn't last for life which lycanthropy does. Plus I could see vengeful employees/jilted lovers etc etc purposely infecting people similarly to gray back which gives all werewolves a bad name. It's a very viscous cycle. The problem is, how do you tell them apart and because they are such a small population, it's easy to hate them and hurt them in law and public opinion.

Is it ok? No. But if a person has to deal with a very real idea that all it takes is one screw up(accidentally or purposely) and someone is dead or cursed, wanting to avoid werewolf's at all costs does make sense. Especially with cases like Grayback (and werewolf bigots and haters fanning the flames) people are frightened which as Yoda says leads to hatred

In one fic where Harry was a mage who studied under flamel and physically overwrote magic onto himself, and painfully made his animagus form a Phoenix(think blood magic, rune mage Harry) and he helped Remus find a sanctuary in the U.S, like a rehab camp in the wild with less than 10 people who turn but need guidance so not to run wild into populated people.

** I always thought a large part of the curse for things like vampires and werewolves is losing your humanity.

So most of the negative symptoms are just incentives to push the cursed person to lose their humanity/ soul. (Hunger/ painful transformations/ wild emotions)

If you look at it that way, it isn't too weird to also have positive feelings as a reward for bending to the curse. (Endorphin, adrenalin, sex, power, control)

This would also make sense with the treatment of werewolves in wizarding society: they'd have a lot of incentiveto be monsters and people would expect them to.

I think some werewolves have wolfish tendencies and if they embrace being a monster, they end up like Greyback.

I'm not denying that being a werewolf sucks, though. Give it enough time, and being a werewolf will kill you. Either by the painful and violent transformations, being hunted down for accidentally killing someone, or starving to death because they can't get a job to feed themselves.

What if there was a way for a lycanthrope, specifically Remus in this case, to have the ability to become a werewolf animagus on any of the days that he wasn't a freaking werewolf? I'm thinking it would be impossible in the first place, but it would be freaking cool if it could be done. Imagine the 93-94 year, where an animagus werewolf comes into the Gryffindor rooms, looking for Peter, just to scare the living shit out of that rat on either October 31, 1993 or on February 5, 1994. It was specifically never said that the previous two attempts were under a full moon, only on June 6, 1994. So Remus could have surprised both of them with his own animagus, teamed up with Sirius and prevented Peter from getting away in the first place.

Now vampires I could see as being closer to "neutrally" double-edged, but since HP doesn't explore them at all, that is up to the writer. But IMO, being a vampire should still be something you'd want to avoid, even if it isn't as bad as lycanthropy.
