** Does the servant necessarily have to be human? Because if not, George could acquire a house-elf, and ask it to sacrifice a finger. The asking is important, as if it's an order, it's not a willing sacrifice

**** My headcanon is that it has to be a true sacrifice, a permanent loss of flesh. It's dark magic like what took Moody's leg and eye.
