"Stand aside..."

"Please... no, have mercy /have mercy/..." She was a blubbering mess.

"I will not repeat myself, /stand aside foolish girl.../"

"Please no... have mercy... please no..." She kept repeating those words, almost like a mantra. The despair was obvious in her eyes. Her legs gave out under the pressure of his gaze.

A smirk laced his face as she backpedaled away from him, still sobbingly pleading. /Hmph, weak/. He dismissed her, turning to gaze at his "prophesied" enemy. He raised his wand.

"/Avada Kedavra!/"

​

​

She will forever treasure the look on his face. The fright in his eyes, together with the reflected green light of her spell.

** My version:

[[https://deluded-musings.fanficauthors.net/Lily_Got_Her_Gun/Lily/]]

Voldemort could hear the woman screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but as long as she was sensible, she, at least, had nothing to fear...  He climbed the steps, listening with faint amusement to her attempts to barricade herself in ...

She had no wand with her either ... How stupid these two were, and how trusting, thinking that their safety lay in friends, that weapons could be discarded even for a moment...

Voldemort forced the door open, moving the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one lazy wave of his wand ... and there she stood, the child in her arms. At the sight of him, she dropped her son into the cot behind her and threw her arms wide, as if this would help, as if in shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen instead ...

"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!"

"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now."

"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead..." she pleaded

"This is my last warning..."

A smile stretched across Voldemort's face when he saw the woman's resolve break, like so many before her, he watched as her shoulders slumped and her proud head lowered in submission.  Severus would so enjoy his reward.  “Please?” she whispered while moving aside.

The child had not cried all this time. He stood, clutching the bars of his cot, and he looked up into the stranger's face with a kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his father who hid beneath the cloak, making more pretty lights, and his mother would at any moment resume her laughing teasing...

The Dark Lord pointed the wand very carefully into the boy's face: He wanted to see it happen, the destruction of this one, inexplicable danger. The boy began to cry.  He had realized that this stranger was not James. Voldemort did not like the crying, he had never been able to bear the small ones whining back at the orphanage... It was time to stop the crying, to end this absurd threat.  Voldemort raised his wand “Ava...”

Voldemort's last sensation was the feeling of a bee sting behind his left ear, as Lily Potter emptied her father's Browning Hi-Power pistol's 13 round magazine into his head and chest, just as Anthony Evans had taught both his daughters all those years before. In a smooth motion, she ejected the spent magazine and inserted one of the two reserve magazines she had been carrying in her robes since the Potters had fled under the Fidelius. She dropped the slide and scooped up the Dark Lord's wand.

The loud cracks of the pistol firing had startled young Harry out of his tears, but the sounds did not frighten him. No child who had successfully survived fifteen months in the company of James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew would be frightened by a mere explosion. No, loud noises like that meant that fun things were about to happen!

​

The source of this was the age of Lily Potter, who coincidently is the same age as my wife. My Father in Law came of age during the time of Britain's national service and spent his time in uniform doing adventurous things in places like the Suez. When he left the service he, like many Brits of that time, he kept his personal sidearm, a Browning Hi-Power.

He and I spent many hours drinking my bourbon (which he called 'Yankee bathwater') and discussing out military service. He was dismissive of my Colt 1911, and I was of the view that making fewer larger holes in someone at pistol range than several smaller holes. (he called this 'typical Yank Overkill' to which I suggested that there is no 'over kill' there is only kill when it comes to firearms.)

Anyway, a version of the same idea.

** Closest I've seen is Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday linkffn(2477819) Backstory has Peter going to the Potters and telling them Dumbledore needed to speak to them, he'd watch Harry while they were gone. Harry's dead by the time they realize the deception and get back. They head to the Longbottoms as Neville would be the next target and Lily AK's Voldemort as he's targeting Neville.

** I had an idea similar to this - when Voldemort goes after Harry, he does so stealthily. He Disillusions himself, then flies (however he did it in Deathly Hallows) to Harry's bedroom window, opens it from the outside with magic, kills Harry, and leaves.

Lily's scream on discovering is loud enough to wake the neighbours.

*** Why would Lord Voldemort use stealth when he going to kill one with power to vanquish him? That too for killing a defenceless baby. He wouldn't want to kill the baby stealthily as it would make people believe he was scared by potters. Even if he would have spared potters life it would have stunned them and then killed Harry and not kill him stealthily

**** It's not cowardice, it's strategic thinking, the Slytherin cunning and guile. Voldemort knows where the Potters are living. The Potters themselves do not know that he knows. Voldemort knows the Potter have defied him three times, and their son is one of two potential "one to vanquish the Dark Lord". Why should he give them the opportunity to defy him a fourth time?

Besides, which is more terrifying? A killer who shows up suddenly and blatantly kills people, leaving witnesses, or the killer who gets in and out after killing, /without anyone knowing they were there?/
