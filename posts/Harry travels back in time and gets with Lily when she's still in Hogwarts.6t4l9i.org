No shame.


** Well, there are some things you pick up after a few years in the fandom and a knowledge of these fics is one of them so here we go: linkffa(Love Through Time), linkao3(Harry Potter and the Legacy of Hogwarts) more chapters available elsewhere, and incomplete linkffn(Throwing Out The Script). I'm sure there are more but that's all I can recall.

  One year into Voldemort's rein, a confrontation with the Dark Lord catapults the Boy-Who-Lived into 1975. Will he be content to sit around and let the past repeat itself? Absolutely not. Time Travel. Not very HBP or DH compliant. Awesome!Harry. Eventual Harry/Lily/Narcissa/Bellatrix. Not a smutfic.

** linkffn(12370765)

It has a female Harry and a side plot about the Black sisters. Probably crosses the line of crack but is hilarious. WiP.

#+begin_quote
  After a disastrous battle in the Department of Mysteries that claims her life Harriet Potter is sent back in time to prevent the second rise of Voldemort. A response to Anubis' Two Lillies challenge. Rated M for adult situations and some rather fruity language. Femslash HP/LE and possibly more. Wink wink.
