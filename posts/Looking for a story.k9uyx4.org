So I read this story a long time ago and I tried to find it again the other day but no luck. This is probably because I only remember literally one scene from it and the pairing. It's a Harry/Fleur pairing and the one scene is where Harry goes to Fleur's apartment for Christmas, he cooks dinner they talk about some stuff and Fleur is wearing this special dress that has like moving snowflakes on it or something. If anyone knows what the hell I'm talking about I'd appreciate it.


** The scene you're thinking of start at the end of chapter 23.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly. On hiatus. Note in ch. 34
