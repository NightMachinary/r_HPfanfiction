This fic is sad, happy, awkward, lewd and just plain amazing.

It's a Harry/Hermione/Ron fic that stole my heart and made me cry. It's set 30ish years after finishing Hogwarts, Ginny after a long battle with a wasting disease has passed away so Harry and his daughter move to Ron and Hermione's home to heal and recover.

Yeah, sorry, but no. I can't do it. This seems reasonably well crafted and all but I just can't.

I'm getting pickier as I get older. I admit that.
