I remember back when OoTP came out that was a popular theory. I kept expecting him to suddenly reappear all through HBP, or for Harry/Remus/someone to realize it was a portal instead of a death sentence and concoct a mad plan to rescue Sirius from the unknown.

So, does anyone know any fics (preferably completed) with this premise besides linkffn(A Black Comedy)? I've already read that several times.

Thanks!


** There's at least one where Harry explores through the Veil and finds that it leads him to the Star Wars universe instead of death. He sets about searching for Sirius.

I'm sorry I don't have a link, but if I recall it was unfinished so it may not be worth the/your time.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

**** I was thinking of one where Harry made very detailed preparations before going through the Veil, but that may actually be a DS9 cross-over. So... you may be right.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

Armed with knowledge of the future, Sirius fights to ensure the burden of prophecy doesn't fall on Harry's shoulders... But can he survive the war and keep his friends alive? Completed!
