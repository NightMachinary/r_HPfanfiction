Preferably without slash, with Dark, and where Harry meets the feminine version of himself. And completed.

** linkffn(I'm still here)

It's my favourite story right now and it still has a massive (25k+words) update twice a year or so.

Basically an adult harry follows voldemort to an alternative dimension and discovers that he also traveled around a decade back in time.

Then again, given its popularity, this might be the story that inspired this thread

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
