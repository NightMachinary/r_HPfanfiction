Heya, i have been out of the fandom for a while, and kinda want to get back into it. but sadly whenever i pick up a story, it just kind of feels badly written to me.

any recommendations for good ones?

+ if there's romance, and no slash :v

  In 2003, 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter discovered a new plot for world domination, but there was simply not enough time to save the destruction of the Wizarding world. Unless he could change the past... Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.(MoD Harry/Rebirth)

  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark... Warning: Deals with Stockholm Syndrome and dark themes.

  1724. All Harry wanted to do was to cross the Atlantic and start his apprenticeship under one of the most renowned physicians. Tom Riddle is convinced everything floating in the seven seas belongs to him. That includes ship-wrecked, green-eyed youths. Especially if they tell him to fuck off. [yes this is a Pirate!AU. Oneshot. Kind of?]

** I'm experiencing the same. : / I just assumed it was because of my preferred ship, though (Snape/Lily).

If you're cool with that pair (it seems they're pretty unpopular on this sub), then I'd recommend "A Dealer, not a Death Eater", on AO3. It features some pretty intricate plots with emphasis on the social environment preceeding the First Wizarding War. It has a /nuanced/ exploration of Snape's background, as opposed to most fics, which tend to ignore / minimize / simplify the cognitive dissonance which defines him. The characters are also delightfully complex; they're simultaneously lovable and deplorable. It's awesome. : )

Good luck finding fics!
