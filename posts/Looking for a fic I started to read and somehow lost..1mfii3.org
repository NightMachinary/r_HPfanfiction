I've been reading a LOT of different fics lately (I've got seven on-going that I check on a constant basis for updates and three completed fics that I read a couple of chapters from each day) so I won't give any details aside from the one thing I know is unique to this fic: Over one of the summers, Harry starts teaching himself wandless magic, and it messes up his wanded magic when he gets back to Hogwarts. Any ideas?


** It's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] by Myst Shadow. 110k words, last updated in July, 2013.

*** That's the one! Apparently I still had it bookmarked, it was just in a folder that had nothing to do with harry potter or fanfics. Thanks!
