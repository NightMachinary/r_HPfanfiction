I've heard a lot about how great hgfan1111's stories are, but apparently the writer deleted all of his/her stuff at some point. Does anyone have any in their archives that they would be willing to share? I'd just like to know what I'm missing out on.


** You are correct in what you've heard--Andi was one of the greats in the fandom, particularly for those who enjoy romance Harry/Ginny tales. I often find myself wishing to reread some of her stories.
