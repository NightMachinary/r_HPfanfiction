"So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there."

The war has ended and everyone knows about Harry, Hermione and Ron breaking into Gringotts to steal the Cup. The Goblins, however, are not impressed and have filed a case against them, suing them for damages and the "abduction" of their dragon.

Thoughts? Story would show the entire trial, I guess. Maybe some history on Goblins and the wizard-goblin wars?


** Harry and the others counter-sue Gringotts for aiding and abetting Voldemort and his Death Eaters and safeguarding his Horcruxes. The trial is incredibly one-sided for the war heroes. It is the start of a new era of financial transparency and updated, equitable banking laws.

*** This wouldn't work out how Harry would want it to. The Goblins practiced neutrality, at least from their perspective.

Being a criminal isn't grounds for a bank to terminate their business with you. Indeed, being a criminal, even one who has been arrested, charged and sent to jail, does not void your financial responsibilities, such as loans, rents etc.

While the creation of a Horcruxe may be illegal, the possession of one surely isn't. After all, numerous characters from the good side have possession of them for prolonged periods and no one assumes they're breaking the law by doing so. So you couldn't claim that Gringotts was harbouring an illegal item.

You could potentially get Gringotts on allowing for transactions to occur that are of a criminal nature, such as bribes, but you'd have to prove that Gringotts was aware that this money was being used for that purpose at that time. If you can prove that they later discovered (prior to the charges being levied) the true nature of these transactions, and didn't inform the government and terminate the offenders accounts, that they were participating in illegal activity.

That being said, I'm fairly sure that Gringotts is also its own nation with its own laws and treaties with the Wizarding governments, and that the banks are not on Wizarding Government lands, but rather are on Goblin lands. They may not actually have a law in their own government that mandates they do something like this.

At this point you'd have to try and levy war crimes on the Goblin government itself, and history has shown us that the only path this leads to is either:

A. War

B. All governments ignore it like it never happened and media forgets about it too

On this note, do the Goblins even have extradition laws with the wizards? Because if not a death eater could just sit on their land and the good guys wouldn't be able to do anything.

And on THAT note, if extradition laws do exist, and if this went to a trial, Gringotts are going to immediately do a quid pro and ask why Harry and his friends aren't being handed over to the Goblin government to be charged for having broken into a foreign governments building and stolen from it, as well as destroyed much of its property, endangering the lives of Goblin citizens and impersonating someone to gain illegal access to their bank accounts.

The point I'm making is, at best, such a trial will go on for ages and lead nowhere, at worst, you end up with an international war on your hands that is far worse than Voldemorts little war.

** Let me see if I can convey how I imagine this going:

Harry chugs veritaserum and takes a seat in the witness chair "Oh gee, you see, we'd discovered Voldemort created a number of artifacts to prevent himself from getting killed. One of them was entrusted to Bellatrix Lestrange, who stored it in her Gringotts vault. So! We devised a way to get it out and destroy it. After bribing one of the goblins, we infiltrated the bank, while being hunted by the corrupt government at the time, might I add, penetrated the vault's defenses, and retrieved the object we came for. At that point the goblin we bribed betrayed us. He prematurely took the payment promised to him and immediately alerted the guards to our presence. The guards, naturally, swarmed our position where we had to fight them off for a time. Ultimately we made our escape by stealing one of their guard dragons, enlarging the passage tunnels, and flying away."

Let me point out exactly what this says:

- Gringotts security, at an all-time high, couldn't deter three teenagers
- The Gringotts vault of a VIP couldn't deter /three teenagers/\\
- The full Gringotts security team /couldn't capture three teenagers/
- A dragon, that was being used as a security measure on the vault, /got stolen by three teenagers/
- A goblin was bribed, took the bribe, and immediately betrayed the people who bribed him (/goblins aren't trustworthy enough to be corrupt/)
- *Gringotts was aiding the Dark Lord*

I mean, of course you have the whole "disliked minority vs beloved national hero" angle, but event without that, when presented with the facts of the incident, the goblins look nothing short of greedy, untrustworthy, malicious, and incompetent. I believe anyone with an ounce of sense would try to bury the incident, rather than bring attention to it. Could you imagine how the goblins would react, when asked whether this is an accurate summation of events "Uh... no?"

** Well, you need to explain why the Ministry doesn't laugh in the goblins' faces (or worse) for daring to go after the three war heroes. Perhaps using the ICW as a way to put pressure on the new Ministry? Making Gringotts powerful enough to take on the Ministry would probably be going too far ad make people ask why there's not a new goblin rebellion instead, and turning the Ministry against the trio seems a sure way to drive them into another war against the Boy-Who-Lived and his many friends.

**** If they are strong enough to get their way by force (or think so), then the trial is pretty much just a farce, though.

In any case, I think it's more important to decide just what laws apply in the actual trial, and if individuals fighting in a war are actually responsible, if the Ministry pardonning them is a valid defence, if Gringotts cooperating with Voldemort negates their claims against the trio, if the dragons were legally kept in the first place, or mistreated, and whether or not a Death Eater vault hiding a Horcrux is a legitimate target in a war. Much of that depends on whether Gringotts is extraterritorial, or part of Wizarding Britain.

Plus, I think anyone can file a case - whether the case has merit is decided later in a hearing.

I guess it could go forward in Gringotts accepting that Harry did a great thing, but that he could have gone about it in a different way and taken the Goblins help. Or that irrespective of how great it is, they still suffered damage (both material and to their reputation of Gringotts being the safest place).

In order for Harry to be charged, he'd have to be extradited to the Goblin nation and be charged by them. Not happening considering his position after the war.

Goblins would only be able to do that if they went to war with the Wizards over it. Which they might very well do if they think they can win.

Harry isn't going to be able to counter charge Gringotts for war crimes without going to war with them either. That's how war crimes work after all. Sure you can charge them, but you can't actually do anything with said charges unless you beat their nation into submission in a war.
