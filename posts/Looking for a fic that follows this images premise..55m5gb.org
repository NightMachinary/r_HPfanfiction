**** And then Snape tries to limit his use of legilimency on Harry to as little as possible (if we are assuming that he does it often in canon) so that he doesn't have to look him into eyes. Maybe even tries to actively ignore him most of the time. Or maybe he does something completely different.

Also, Petunia would be affected by this too. It could go either way - make her more kind because she can't stand mistreating someone who looks like her sister. Or make her even more spiteful, because it reminds her of bitter memories or something.

General public by looking at Harry would be reminded more of Lily. Every time his picture would show in a paper, people will look at a mirror image of her. Some creative journalist could give more attention to muggleborn wizards and witches by twisting the story right.

I like it. It's a little change, but it would make a good "for a want of a nail fic". It could butterfly pretty quickly, if someone isn't afraid of completely derailing canon.

****** Mary Potter? Haven't heard that name for it before, interesting.

As recommendations, there aren't really any fics, that I know of, at least, that /explicitly/ make her red haired. It's not really a selling point for many people, more subject to the whims of various authors. However, the largest community of Mary Potters is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Miss-Potter/19146/][Miss Potter Community]]. You should be able to find a number of them there.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.
