Harry finds it so funny for some reason and he can't stop laughing whenever he sees Hagrid. Someone /cough/Colin/cough/ takes a photo of him and weeks later when almost everyone forgot about it, Harry bursts out laughing in the middle of breakfast when he receives the photo in the mail.

*** An artist friend of mine drew an erotic version of PS1 Hagrid as a joke and it's become a running meme on their discord in the nsfw channels. It's pretty funny how many jokes you can make about PS1 Hagrid coupled with other characters from the same blocky-graphics era. Think triangle Lara Croft, original Tifa Lockhart, some of the GBA and DS-era Pokemon characters, Duke Nukem, etc etc.

***** No can do. Said artist has had troubles with people reposting their meme pics/WiP art/etc and so they requested that we not share it with anyone not in the server.

******* It's just their personal server for their art. They've got a patreon up and patrons get access. Lotta different kinds of art; they like to try new things.

Pretty chill server, but they had to quit allowing non-patrons join because of the dumbasses that would post their art on imgur or flickr or wherever.
