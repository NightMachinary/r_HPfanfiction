I'm looking for fics like king of magic , savior of magic and for the love of magic. Pretty much good powerwank


** If you don't mind crossovers and relatively bland fics, the entire length of linkffn(Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe) consists of the author stroking Harry's dick for being 'oh-so-powerful-and-nice'.

linkffn(I'm not a hero), roughly quoting Harry while on trial at the Ministry, "I could kick your combined asses, but I'll humor you." Harry in this fic is, from the very start of first year, sharing the 'Most Powerful In The World' spot with Voldemort's son. Interestingly enough, it's actually a decent read that subverts quite a few cliches (WBWL where both the Potter and eventually the twin are nice, anyone?)

  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, but only after the world has been destroyed. Harry has his vengeance, but gets pulled into Voldemort's ritual and is dragged with his body to an alternate universe. First Chapter sets up the first scene. You can skip it reasonably safely. - Complete - Now up on webnovel under my original author name, burnable.

  James and Lily have been put into a coma, Adrian Potter is the boy-who-lived, Dumbledore raises him and drops his twin at his aunts. Harry the twin brother of the boy-who-lived comes to Hogwarts and gets sorted into Slytherin. Harry is different from what anyone expecting and he holds a few secrets. Dumbledore bashing, select Weasley bashing, Hermione bashing. (HarryxDaphne)

  Draco organizes a no-holds-barred poker game. Harry decides to compete... just a little fun fic co-written by Joshua. I might or might not write more on this.
