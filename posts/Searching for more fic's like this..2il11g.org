I was searching around the web looking for new fanfic's to read and cam across this : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9708318/1/The-Adventures-Of-Harry-Potter-the-Video-Game-Exploited]]

Now I've been searching for the past hour and could only find a couple of short 1 chapter fic's. So I'm hoping any of you out there would know of any other fic's out there that depict Harry's life as a video game.
