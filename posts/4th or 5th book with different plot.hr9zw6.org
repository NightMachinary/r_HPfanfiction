Looking for fics that are an extra year, before the end of war but with a new plot. for example completely disregarding book 5, and instead making a new plot for that book. book 5 is perfect, since they are already mature and I absolutely hate Umbridge, so a 5th year without Umbridge or something. year 4 works too, because let's be honest, the triwizrad tournament does absolutely nothing for the story as a whole. and Voldy could get his blood literally any other way.

so are there any fics that make new plots for either 4th or 5th year?

horcruxes might not exist and instead defeating Voldy a different way

or it could not even focus on Voldy at all

however, it needs to be canon until that point, so no No Voldy or no alive Lily etc. unless it's things more recent, for example them being able to catch Wormtail at the end of 3rd book. etc.

if 4th book, and keeping the triwizard, then making Harry not a champion, but it could still go on in the background. however, I really hate Umbridge, so no Umbridge if it's book 5.

prefer slash or no romance. or canon Romione at side.

no bashing unless Dumbles, Sirius, Remus, Minerva. that means no Weasley bashing, or Hermione bashing

no OC as important character.


** Its hard to find an appropriate story when you have 13 requirements that are told as a rambling string of thoughts.

Spell out exactly what you want with succinct points and then people will try to find you something.

*** I think it was pretty straightforward. if it was too hard for you to understand, you didn't have to comment.
