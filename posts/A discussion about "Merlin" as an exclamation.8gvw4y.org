I thought I'd make a little (read: embarrassingly long) post about the use of "Merlin" as an exclamation in fanfiction, as in "for Merlin's sake," "oh Merlin," "Merlin!" etc. because I have a bunch of dumb nerdy opinions about this.

So, J.K. Rowling has a lot of fun in her books when she coins terms for wizards that are plays on ordinary sayings. [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wizarding_idioms][See the list here]]. I'd like to argue, however, that she uses "Merlin" /very sparingly./

I have a lot of respect for fanon, so I get that this sort of thing evolves over time, especially a decade-plus after the books were published. But I still think it's worth pointing something out.

Here are examples of times when a fanfic writer would've used "Merlin," and J.K. Rowling doesn't:

- "Good Lord," said the bartender, peering at Harry, "is this --- can this be --- ?" (Sorcerer's Stone)
- "God, this place is going to the dogs," Malfoy said loudly. (Prisoner of Azkaban)
- "Don't tell me you don't /know/?" he (Draco) said delightedly. "You've got a father and a brother at the Ministry and you don't even /know/? My God, /my/ father told me about it ages ago." (Goblet of Fire)
- "Good Lord, Arthur," he (Lucius) said softly. "What did you have to sell to get seats in the top box? Surely your house wouldn't have fetched this much?" (Goblet of Fire)
- "My God --- Diggory!" Fudge whispered. "Dumbledore --- he's dead!" (Goblet of Fire)
- "He blew up his aunt, for God's sake!" Fudge shouted, banging his fist on the judge's bench and upsetting a bottle of ink.

"And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion," said Dumbledore calmly. (Order of the Phoenix)

- "Today?" shrieked Hermione. "Today? But why didn't you --- oh my God --- you should have said ---" (Half-Blood Prince)
- "Bill! Thank God, thank God ---" said Mrs. Weasley. (Deathly Hallows)
- "God, that's revolting," Ron added after one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee. (Deathly Hallows)
- "Blimey, I hope they escaped," said Ron, leaning back on his pillows. "I didn't get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all that quick-witted, though the way everyone was talking to me when I was him. God, I hope they made it." (Deathly Hallows)
- "So that's little Scorpius," said Ron under his breath. "Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains." "Ron for heaven's sake," said Hermione. (Epilogue)

As a matter of fact, Merlin is only used as an exclamation a couple dozen times in the entire series. When they do invoke his name, it's not like they're saying "God!" or "Jesus Christ!" They say it like they're invoking a saint.

It's more like the idiom "What in the name of Saint Francis the Brave was that?" [[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=What%20in%20the%20name%20of%20saint%20francis]]

In fact, /no one in the entire series/ ever once says "Merlin!" on its own. It's always "Merlin's beard!" or "Merlin's pants!" or "What in the name of Merlin are you doing?" or "How in the name of Merlin's pants have you managed to get your hands on those Horcrux books?" or "Why, in the name of Merlin's saggy left ---"

Welp. That's what I've got to say about that. I'm going to go rethink my life priorities and how I use my free time now.

**** Guys, seriously, you're "disappointed" in me? OK, here it is:

#+begin_quote
  "And are they getting married in my bedroom?" asked Ron furiously. "No! So why, in the name of Merlin's saggy left ---" "Don't talk to your mother like that," Mr. Weasley said firmly.
#+end_quote

Personally, I've always thought "Merlin's pants" is funnier because it brings to mind the image of wise old Merlin wearing nothing but a pair of saggy white briefs.

** Always interesting to see the Malfoys conform (doubly so with how they dress in the movies). Kind of throws the snobbish, pureblood etiquette, society stories off.

Given just how isolated and out of touch with everything muggle the magical-raised witches/wizards we see are, I wonder if it was intentional on Rowling's part or just a worldbuilding fail/nonissue.

I'm okay with the Merlins and equivalent exclamations ('Morgana's tits!' 'For Salazar's Sake...'), no matter how corny or jarring they are. It's fun and adds a bit of distance to the muggle world. There's this irrational sense of wanting to convert everything mundane so to have an appropriate amount of whimsy attached.

** It makes sense that Christianity would not just go away from magical culture, just because they separated. What would /not/ make sense if they were still catholic, protestant or anglican. Christianity probably took on a unique form for magical culture, embedding their ability within the canon of the Bible. Hey, maybe thats even part of why they think themselves above muggles - because they have received this blessing and these others didn't.

Merlin as an exclamation has always seemed to me like involking just this pillar of magic. I also often use Circe, Morgana, Solomon,... as exclamations, in the same vein as Merlin's name. If magic is a core part of their belief system, it would make sense to have - as you said - Saints of magic.

I also believe for the sake of my headcanon that naturalistic religions would be much more common among the magical folk. After all, the condemnation of non-divine magic, especially witchcraft, by the Church has a rather long tradition. I would assume magical communities would have been faced with an impossible choice when pressured to christianize.

** Eh. That might be official canon but it's not my headcanon and here's why:

First of all, Wizards and Witches started to hide from the Muggles primarily because of religious persecution, and since Wizarding society is very traditional and conservative, they will remember that for a long time.

Second of all, Wizards derive their traditions from paganism, not Christianity, sure there are exceptions such as the Fat Friar, but he wasn't devout, he joined the order in order to help people, here's an excerpt from his [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Fat_Friar][wiki page]]:

"At some point in his life, he joined the clergy as part of a mendicant religious order. Meaning that he spent his life begging in the name of charity. A noble life for a noble man. Apparently, given his physically large appearance, he indulged in the pleasures of food and drink.

The Fat Friar's kindness was to be his undoing. He was executed because senior churchmen grew suspicious of his ability to cure the pox merely by poking peasants with a stick, and his ill-advised habit of pulling rabbits out of the communion cup."

And finally, Merlin wasn't just a great Wizard, he was a mythical almost God like figure to them, at least British Wizards. More akin to Jesus than, say, a Saint.

** I do lean on "Merlin!" quite a bit and especially Hermione's "Merlin's pants!" because she used it so conspicuously, but I also use "God," "good Lord," etc. a lot too--just more "balanced" than in canon. I just figured you could reasonably extend JKR's use of "Merlin's beard" and so forth to more varied usage.

My headcanon is that Christianity was nearly stamped out of Wizarding Britain in the 1600s, the height of the witch-hunts in that country, but filtered back in over subsequent centuries with ~10% mostly-Christian muggle-borns added to the population with each new generation. So during the 1600s, Christian-based exclamations in English were replaced by invoking Merlin and other famous witches and wizards similarly to the names of saints, but by the present day, the lexicon has become more mixed.
