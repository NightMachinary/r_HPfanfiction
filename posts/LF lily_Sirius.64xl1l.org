Preferably lily lives that Halloween and her and sirius fall in love but I'll take what I can get :)


** linkffn(11862560) has Lily/Sirius, but only in flashbacks/memories (because she is dead). It's not main focus of the story, but has been getting more important in recent chapters.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

** "Im not the only one" seems to have a Lily/Sirius relationship in the making. It's a WIP, though.

** I love this pairing. These are both pre-Halloween but it's Sirius/Lily.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2819982/1/A-piece-of-sun][A piece of sun]] is an angsty one set after Harry's birth.

[[http://ficsbynell.livejournal.com/14029.html][Smoke gets in your Eyes]] - Lily can't go out with James because she's sleeping with his best friend.
