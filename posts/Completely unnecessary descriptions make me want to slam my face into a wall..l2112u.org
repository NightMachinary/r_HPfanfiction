I need some advice? Assistance? Something really.

At first I wasn't too bothered by the descriptions that I've seen crop up in almost every fanfic, but it's gotten to a point where I am simmering in rage.

"The bushy-haired witch did this, The bookworm gryffindor did that, the dog-animagus shat himself, the professor-cat-animagus coughed up a hairball".

Why in the name of my ass do people use these descriptors, ESPECIALLY when it is in a more serious scene and will completely fuck the immersion that I'm feeling.

It could be in the middle of an attempted sexual assault scene and they will still describe hermione as bushy haired or daphne as the ice queen. Like is that not slightly inappropriate for the context?? Am I crazy? How is that helpful to the scene?? I KNOW THAT'S WHAT THEY BOTH LOOK LIKE, YOU'VE SAID IT IN EVERY SCENE.

Maybe I'm just unnecessarily angry, I have always been quick with my temper, but I just don't understand, is there anything wrong with just using their name? Or simply describing them as she/he/they??

Please let me know what you all think about this, sometimes I think I suffer from the black madness. I need to know if I'm alone in my thoughts.


** Many young writers feel the need to vary the tried and true “(s)he said” approach. They see (s)he said this or that all over a page and think it's a bad thing, so they invent all these euphemisms thinking they're helping. They're not, because the point of the words is to describe actions and scenes, not make readers trip over Hemiones bushy hair or Harry's piercing laser eyes.

There are times for the prose to shine, but once the character appearances, names and settings are established, it's time to move on to the story. My $.02 anyway.

**** Agreed on the school requirements.

There is a conflict of values here: in a fic, you want to describe the scene and every sentence should be significant, short and simple - that makes it easier to read.

However in HS, the teachers want you to demonstrate your vocabulary. In HS, you should acquire as many options as possible in as little time as possible. In fanfic, you choose only the crème de la crème, the best ones that are most appropriate for the given situation.

Something about young Harry, fire and his eyes. Hopefully the boy wasn't blind of something similar. That would be a shit show of epic proportions.

Petunia was genuinely happy to let him in, that alone let him know something was seriously wrong.

He followed her into the kitchen where Harry was sitting with his hands over his eyes.

After slowly convincing the boy to open them he realized that accidental magic was a truly insane thing sometimes.

The boy had two pools of actual green fire for eyes, and as he ducked to the side, literal killing curse eyes as well. The boy closed his eyes again as Albus wondered if Harry could win in a staring contest with a Basilisk.

*** The part about (s)he is pretty spot on. It is a trap that all beginner writers tend to step into, one that is quite easy to get out of. The mind tells you that having it all over a page is bad and repetitive, which means the reader will surely notice it and hate it, so you switch it up.

I think saying 'black-haired boy' or whatever only works when the character does not know the character and uses their appearance to identify them. Once a name is exchanged, it should always be their name. No idea.

Curious on what people think of (s)he said, yelling. To me, it seems weird, but I still do it.

** It comes from a desire to avoid repeating "he said" or "Sirius said" or whatever after every line of dialogue, I think. An understandable pitfall, really, although you're right that it's surprisingly grating to read after a while.

The solution as a writer is to simply get comfortable using pronouns and taking advantage of the fact that if you're in a two-person back-and-forth dialogue, you don't need "___ said" tags at all unless you're deliberately trying to emphasize someone's tone of voice. In multi-person conversations, I don't think there's anything to be done but suck it up and get used to writing out everyone's name's repeatedly, although you can still provide some variety via context clues and variable sentence structure.

--------------

"What should we do?" asked Harry.

Ron shrugged. "I dunno. Hermione?"

"It's obvious, isn't it?" she said. "We need to brew an illicit potion in a bathroom."

They stared at her. "Come again?" said Harry.

"I said we need--"

"No, we heard you," Ron cut in. "It's just...blimey, you've changed, haven't you?"

I don't pretend to be a fantastic writer, but hopefully that illustrates how you can spice up dialogue without being repetitive or veering into "bushy-headed witch" territory.

** It's a mix between some writers not wanting to use names all the time (which even best-selling authors do) and trying to stick to the old rule of 'Show, don't tell'. So they end up thinking that a little descriptor can add some variety as well as have a tiny bit of showing, too.

Blindly following the 'Show, don't tell' rule often leads to things like this, as well as purple prose and the use of things like 'orbs' for 'eyes'.

** A lot of people got the lesson of "don't repeat the same words to close to one another". They didn't get the second part of the lesson about what constitutes 'too close'. Because using the same word every other paragraph is perfectly fine.

Additionally, when writing conversations - you can forego descriptors for a while if you have two people talking, or if it's a direct anwser from the previous speaker

#+begin_quote
  "Fuck me", she said

  "Gladly", Harry anwsered

  "Eww, i didn't mean it like that!"

  "Oh, ok then"
#+end_quote

Though i'd reccomend taking a lesson out of filmmaking and making sure your coversations actually mean something, and that something happens - so it's not just two people talking and staring at one another. Because chances are, if they do, the conversation isn't relevant or you'd do better writing a paragraph of exposition instead of trying to make it a convo.

"Well, I answered with Barnaby the Barmy for question three, but I think I got him mixed up with Uric the Oddball..." Hermione said.

"Don't worry about it too much - what's done is done, no sense worrying about it now. If you're going to have exam worries, could you at least focus on Transfiguration? We have that tomorrow..." Harry replied.

"Fair enough, but if I fail History I'm going to go mad." Hermione said, by way of conceding the point.

--------------

to...

--------------

Harry and Hermione had a brief conversation about exams. Hermione, who was feeling worried about having possibly mixed up Uric the Oddball with Barnaby the Barmy, was scarcely comforted by Harry's reassurances and suggestion that it was more useful to focus on the upcoming Transfiguration exam, but she had to concede the point.

--------------

The former might work, uninterrupted, for a short conversation - but if a conversation drags on, the reader might get annoyed by constant "he said, she said" without anything other than conversation in-between. At some point, it becomes a breath of fresh air when a character twiddles their hair, or takes a drink, or something /happens/ that doesn't involve more talking.

The writer, meanwhile, might only see the "X said, Y said" as the problem instead of the lack of interplay between conversation and, for lack of a better term, non-conversation - hence, descriptors start getting used instead of names.

It just gets more ridiculous. Physical descriptors are quite popular (hair and/or eye color), which are pretty funny when people try to find ways to do so with uncommon ones (eg: 'redhead' reads fine. 'pinkette' for pink haired characters doesn't to me). Then once someone reads a story that includes a certain type of descriptor, they're also more likely to use it in their own stories down the line

** Another reason this an overused writing technique is because authors often have paragraph structure that overuses a characters name, like it's repeated twice per sentence, or multiple times in a single paragraph especially with dialogue going on between two characters. Sometimes it's in effort to establish or identify a speaker so as not to confuse the audience. In cases like this it's better to go back and read the dialogue one sided and answer your questions as if you were another person. Restructuring the paragraph this way makes if flow better, and the readers can easier get the difference between two characters talking in a single paragraph without having to have them identified every sentence.

**** I know, I know. It's just so annoying. It feels like there are so many possible options when teaching students that will improve their writing overall that it's just lazy to teach them to not use the word 'said'. For example, cutting out dialogue tags does the same thing, and is a step that writers have to take when writing some point in the future or writing a scene around the dialogue to prevent the robot sound. It's a flow issue, not the word itself. I think someone said it was a conspiracy to make writing worse? I think it's a conspiracy to be as lazy as possible when teaching.

***** Yeah, but lazy teacher usually defaults to the workbook. So the question remains: why is the workbook shit?

****** More laziness? I don't know. Every single author I've heard talk about these issues disagrees with the way writing is taught. Maybe because English is a subject with very few objective answers?

** I used to feel this way but my perspective has changed now that I have to write as part of my job. I don't write fiction (I don't think I'm creative enough for that); but I have to write concise memos and the like, and boy is it hard to find just the right mixture of words to say in the most effective way possible.

Given that most fic writers are obviously amateurs with no one to help them edit their work or give constructive feedback, I give them slack for their description-heavy writing style. My bone to pick would be spelling, punctuation marks, and general grammar; if it's passable on those fronts, I can't complain much.

** I'll admit I've probably done this myself, however as others have mentioned, it's the whole 'show' vs 'tell' which people often swing from one extreme to the other on. It seems to take a number of stories written to find a decent balance point, and even then you tend to tweak as people say things.

I've found it's actually more useful to pull in descriptors for someone's look when introducing them to the scene unless they're doing something to draw attention to that body part and instead vary up the 'he/she /said/' bit a little by either adding descriptors for their tone or changing the word for what they're doing, or adding actions besides the speech.

People will ask, question, respond, reply, snarl, joke, laugh, growl, deadpan, whisper or say things (among other descriptors for speech) with a variety of tones and expressions, and no you don't (and shouldn't) repeatedly change things up, but if someone growls instead of says then you get an idea of how they're responding, however, if someone's got a growly/scratchy voice they're not going to be constantly growling, they'll speak normally for them it's just a rare descriptor to show that the person speaks a certain way that can be added.

The same can be said for accents, it can be useful to throw in a few descriptors or phonetics where needed, but you don't need to repeat it every time the character says something. A good point might be when their accent drifts or thickens due to something whether external or them putting things on.

Honestly, while 'the bushy-haired witch' is fine as long as it's not repeated too often, what would be better for a reminder might be something along the lines of 'Hermione ran her fingers nervously through her bushy hair' or 'she grimaced, fidgeting with her hair nervously'.

Job or ability descriptors... those can be a little more odd-ball depending on where the context is. Easy ones to bring up are those that involve titles that can be used, like 'professor' or 'sergeant', giving a minor descriptor such as what they teach or some detail on looks/habits can be useful, once again, depending on how often it comes up. We don't need to know that McGonagall is the Transfiguration Professor every other paragraph, but it might be something to throw in at points.

** Or maybe we just let people write how they like to write and move on if we don't want to read it. Fuck's sake.

*** I think you have misunderstood my meaning. I don't hate descriptors, but what is the purpose of using the same long winded explanation every time said character speaks. We all know what they look like. I don't need to be reminded every single scene that Harry's deep pools of emerald fire stare into your soul. Or how bushy hermione's hair is. It's the repetitive nature that is the problem. Not the descriptors themselves.
