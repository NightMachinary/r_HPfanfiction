Whether he became the Dragonborn, and got teleported via GOF, or was in LOTR, and came back by choice via Deus ex Gandalf(right spelling?). As long as he's quite clearly a different Harry Potter with maybe different Magic/Ki/Chakra/Reitsu/Mana/whatever. I like these fics. Bonus point for him being stupidly powerful. These are my guilty pleasures. Although no redo via time-travel, or reincarnation(unless it happened in the other world, like him being Sauron, or something) fics.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

** "deus ex gandalf" would technically be "deus ex deus" since the wizards are deeply connected to the gods of middle-earth, but for "another world" stuff? hmmmm, there is quite a few fics by Sakurademonalchemist that kinda counts but she doesn't complete many, and some of those are less another world and more hidden sections of earth and the others are time travel in a weird way (as in time travelling to the past and growing up in the past) sometimes both (there is a naruto one that had a fem!harry travel over 30 years into the past, put into the naruto world, but came to the HP world later)

** [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle]] /probably/ qualifies - the year 990 is absolutely another world, though I'm not sure if you would consider it a time-travel re-do or not - I don't. Nothing is repeated. Harry vanishes on his birthday before 5th year, and a guy falls out of a portrait a few weeks later. Spoilers and things, but the portrait guy is in his 40s and definitely doesn't act like Harry Potter.

I'm working my way through this one at the moment and really, really enjoying it. Part one: linkao3(11284494)

  It has always been said that magic and technology did not mix; too bad no one ever mentioned that little fact to young Harry Potter. Add in one mad genius bent on destroying the lives of ten thousand people by trapping them inside of his online virtual reality game and you have the makings of a very dangerous brew.
