Just an idea I had. What if they did actually die in a car crash?

Maybe it was their first time in a muggle car.\\
Maybe Voldy just really wanted their deaths to look like an accident\\
Maybe there was a drunk driver and he crossed the median on the highway


** Voldemort driving the other car.

I know my sweet car skills would come in handy

** Lily definetly should know how to survive a car crash+ isn't it heavily implied that the durability of wizard kind is superior to muggles, eg sports players falling from over 20 feet, crashing at neck breaking speeds and getting back up with minor injuries...

Wizards allow 12-13 year olds to play a sport where they send automatically chasing metal balls after the players, no way does a car crash actually kill them

*** I mean, if you get hit by a semi going 70 MPH and sandwiched between 2 cars, it's pretty traumatic.

Yes they play a sport where metal balls chase after the players, but getting hit by one still broke Harry's arm.

Where did they fall from over 20 feet in the books?

I mean the only time I can think of this happening is in the World Cup, with Krum doing his feint and the other seeker hitting the ground. I always imagined that there were impact charms on brooms (like air bags in cars) that lessen the impact. Otherwise it wouldn't really make sense.

But then again, what does make sense in these books. They seem to not really stick to any rules in particular anyways. So just try and have fun with the prompt. Or don't. Don't let me tell you how to live your life.

IIRC, Neville fell headfirst from a 2nd or 3rd story window, which would be about 12-20 feet off the ground. That said, it was accidental magic, so a trained wizard may not be as durable, depending on how accidental magic works.

***** Right I think the whole point of that encounter was that he did accidental magic. I would assume that if you were an adult wizard, who we don't see doing any "accidental" style magic in cannon, who fell from that height, and didn't use magic to help with the fall that you would be injured.

I know in fan-fic it is common to use accidental magic to save characters lives very often, but in cannon I don't think there are really any instances of using magic once someone is an adult (I think Harry in PoA was the oldest we have seen someone do accidental). Example would be Neville falling from his broom in flying class broke is arm (as opposed to bouncing).

*** This is wrong, because if that were the case, Quirrellmort would NOT have tried to throw Harry off his broom, and Dumbledore would NOT have needed to save him in the last minute in POA.

***** I mean just because you play a game at high speeds doesn't mean that it isn't "safe"

Take nascar for example. There hasn't been a death since 2001. Formula 1 has had some more recently, but they are still exceedingly rare.

And that is without magical safety precautions.
