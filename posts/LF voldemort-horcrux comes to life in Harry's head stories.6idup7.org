Preferably without ick pairings with TMR/ HP being a good example.

Not unopposed to suggestions where Harry absorbs the Horcrux either.

Thanks in advance folks.


** linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) should be exactly what you're looking for. It's a fantastic read!

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** linkffn(11762850) Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux is a good story with this premise. It even has an ongoing sequel.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Harry Potter and the Descent Into Darkness does this. It's very well-written but various aspects of the story prevent it from being one of my all time faves. I won't spoil it for you though.

*** I really appreciate you taking the time to offer the link, but I simply cannot stomach TMR(or LV)/HP pairing. The thought of a 71 year old and a 17 yr old (by the time of the battle of Hogwarts) makes me ill.

I apologise if I come across as narrow-minded or however you might phrase it.

**** That's one of the things I don't like. The other main thing is the way Harry tortures Rita but then a few chapters later he and LV are chatting about how the Dark Arts are actually good for Muggles. There's a lot of cognitive dissonance going on in that story.
