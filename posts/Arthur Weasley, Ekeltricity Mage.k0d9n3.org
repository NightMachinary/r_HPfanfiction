Mr Weasley has been playing with muggle electronics for decades, and despite not being able to pronounce what he is playing around with, he tries to reproduce them with magic.

All the stuff he collects and builds in his shed he starts selling, but with ridiculous names which are almost correct.


** Lol, I'd like to see Weasley Enterprise making lots of flying invisible Tanks

*** Could go with that too. I've always had the idea that the Weasleys should have their own wizard chess set with Arthur being the King.

When he takes a piece he pulls out a plug and yells 'EKELTRICITY!' and hits the other piece with lightning till the char and catch fire.
