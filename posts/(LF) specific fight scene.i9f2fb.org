:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm writing a villain for my D&D group, and like all mediocre DMs, I'm going to bite some ideas off of other people's shit.

I remember, vaguely, a fic where Harry is shown a memory of grindlewald starting his war, where he transfigures rain into needles and basically mulches a battalion of border troops. I also remember that the Dumbledore/grindlewald battle was written in this fic, and would appreciate being pointed at it so I can yoink some of the visuals for a BBEG, since those particular visuals were so visceral and awesome.
