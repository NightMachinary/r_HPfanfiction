I was wanting to see if there is any good Ben 10 and Harry Potter crossovers it would be cool to see one of my favorite childhood books and TV series mash together


** Sorry, no stories from me, but I do want to talk a bit.

This one's a neat idea, with one small thing to note: Ben's aliens are either reasonably strong (see: Fourarms, Diamondhead, Heatblast) or amazingly overpowered (Way Big, Alien X, Atomix). If you kept Ben to his weaker lot, he'd be about the same level as most of the cast of Harry Potter.

Also, thinking about it, magic /exists/ in Ben 10. Charmcaster, Hex, Gwen, all use magic. So be interesting to see how their magic gels with Harry Potter magic.

I look forward to seeing if anyone can drum up a few stories of this, as it sounds interesting.

** Not really there are some where Harry just takes Ben's Place but they aren't that long but not really many crossovers

I would love one where Harry's power he knows not is that Harry is a male Anodite
