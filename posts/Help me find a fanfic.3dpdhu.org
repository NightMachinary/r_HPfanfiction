Hi everyone! I read a great fanfic a little while ago and now the blog it was featured on has disappeared :( I was wondering if anyone could help me find it! It was post war, focusing on Harry. He was older, almost middle aged. He was depressed, divorced from Ginny, and Hermione tried to help him but he refused. Eventually, he ended up with Draco. I know this could be a lot of fanfics.... But I just wanted to put it out there to see if anyone remembers a story focusing on them in middle age.

Thanks!


** I second Lomonaaerren, great stuff even if its not what you're looking for.

In other news, we are going to need more to work with. Was there any specific phrasing that stuck out to you or scenes you remember? Googling that can really help.

For example, googling "Harry Potter Fawkes Exotic" brought up Soulbound ball that I was looking for. And "Harry Potter fealty contraception ward stone" gave me Core Threads.

Good luck searching
