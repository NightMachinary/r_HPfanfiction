:END:
So, I distinctly remember reading this fic a while back but I haven't been able to find it since.\\
I can't remember most of the first half, but I believe Sirius was dead? So it's probably post-OotP. Anyway, it focuses on Harry waiting for Sirius to come and get him, possibly from the Dursleys. When he goes to sleep he hears Sirius' voice telling him to wake up and that he is here for him and everytime he wakes up, probably back in his closet, and Sirius still isn't there. At the end he wakes up in some hospital bed and it turns out that he was in a coma from being abused by the Dursleys. The whole thing including Sirius' death was Harry's fever dream and Sirius had been trying to wake him up the whole time.\\
Something is telling me it was on ff.net but I'm not sure. If anyone knows what I'm talking about, I would appreciate the help.\\
Thanks for your time!


** So a copy of the futurama episode then?
