** "I fear that hermione may be the most evil of us all. This is concerning since I am a retired dark lord." Literally the funniest shit I've read in months. Bravo

** Is there a non-parody version of this concept? Where Voldemort winds up in Harry's body and decides to give just being Harry a go? It would put a new spin on "I'm just Harry damnit!"

** Also, it's [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/seventh-horcrux-hp-au.298748/][Seventh Horcrux]] (nitpicky I know). The Seventh Horcrux is completely less funny and therefore less interesting.

** This is fantastic. From beginning to epilogue, there wasn't a single moment of disappointment.

Hope this author continues writing, because he's something special.
