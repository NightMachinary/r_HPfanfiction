** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12299677/1/The-Universe-Is-An-Optimisation-Problem][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12299677/]]) -- /The Universe Is An Optimisation Problem/ by notasentientantcolony. Though familiar characters make cameos, so far the story mostly follows an original character, Ozland Dwimmersmith. The summary of the story quotes a review that marks it as just what you want:

#+begin_quote
  "The world of Harry Potter feels magical again. Without feeling childish." - Guest.
#+end_quote

And I agree with that review. Since the setting is an alternative universe, nothing you think you know about magic is guaranteed to be true, just like magic's capabilities were surprising when you first read /Harry Potter/. I especially liked the whimsy of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12299677/3/The-Universe-Is-An-Optimisation-Problem][this story's Diagon Alley]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12299677/4/The-Universe-Is-An-Optimisation-Problem][the Supermarket within it]].

The story is marked as an A.U. of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][/Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/]], another fanfiction, but you don't need to have read that story. The alternative universe is so different that you can't trust what you learned in HPMOR either.

  A weird pre-apocalyptic reimagining of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality in a retrofuturist AU with parallel universes, megacorporations, high magic, Cold War wizardry, and AI. "I've never been more confused or entertained in my life." - MurtGastin. "The world of Harry Potter feels magical again. Without feeling childish." - Guest. Updates every three Wednesdays!
