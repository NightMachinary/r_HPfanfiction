I was on tumblr and came across a post saying how Snape made Remus grade essays after substituting for him (aka after a full moon) in POA and I was SO hurt. It occurs to me that I haven't read much Remus appreciate fics. (Honestly, that man deserves more love üíóüíìüíûüíïüíó)

So, anyone have any fic rec about Remus Lupin?

I don't mind OC, cannon shipping (feel free to hit me with some Wolfstar üíó), different AUs/Timelines or just some simple plain old feel-good Remus appreciation stories.

Basically I just want some love for our favourite DADA Professor. üíïüíï

Thanks

Long & complete Remus-centric fic. I'm like at the beginning still, but it's good.

  ‚ÄúJust... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.‚ÄùWhat was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  Sirius is in Azkaban and Remus, for want of a better option, is getting on with his life. Sirius can only remember the worst parts of his life and Remus can only continue trying to live his, but eventually their separate threads must collide.*complete* (at last!)

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

** I enjoyed Shifts by FernWithy. This is quite an old fic ( it was written before the series was finished) but I think it holds up pretty well. It's about Remus becoming a teacher at Smeltings to protect Dudley during Order of the Phoenix. The author has written quite a lot of other Remus or Teddy Lupin fics aswell.
