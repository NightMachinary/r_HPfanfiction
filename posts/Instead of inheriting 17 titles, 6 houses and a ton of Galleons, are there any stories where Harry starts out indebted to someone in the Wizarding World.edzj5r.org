#+TITLE: Instead of inheriting 17 titles, 6 houses and a ton of Galleons, are there any stories where Harry starts out indebted to someone in the Wizarding World?

I think most HP fanfiction readers are tired of the stories where Harry gets everything handed to him upon his first visit to Gringotts. It could be interesting to see how he handles financial problems that he isn't the cause of. Would Harry be indebted to a crafty Slytherin who made a deal with his family before they were killed by Voldemort? Or does Harry have a compulsive gambler who knew his family and had access to his bank accounts? How would Harry earn money as a teenager? If anyone has stories they've read(preferably completed but not necessary) that explore this sort of idea, I'd love to read them.


** That would be an interesting take on "Muggle/Wizard" culture clash, as familial debt is a concept that has pretty much died, but is very much an historical thing.

Like instead of 'ministry forces a marriage law on everyone, muggleborns are horrified', you could do something with this...

** Wasn't there something in hpmor about Harry becoming indebted to Lucius to save Hermione? It happened fairly early, I didn't read far enough to see it resolved.
