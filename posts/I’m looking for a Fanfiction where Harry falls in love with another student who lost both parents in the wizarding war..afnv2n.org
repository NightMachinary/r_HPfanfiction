Slash or gen is fine.

Any house for the love interest, and OCs are fine.


** Most of Harry/Susan Bones fics have her an orphan raised by her aunt.

To narrow it down a little, what kind of fic are you looking for? Quality vs Quantity? Crack? Tragedies or romantic fluff?

*** something that's really long and at least decently written. I prefer slash, but I'm open to just about any ship.

Angst would be great. Lots of angst. Perhaps some emotional whump? But with some cute fluff sprinkled in. Ohh, and if it's someone that dumbledore does not agree with, that would be great! Or someone raised with muggles. Or the child of an ex-death eater couple.

**** The story which comes to mind is "The Silent World of Cassandra Evans". It starts out really dark with exaggerated Dursley abuse on Fem!Harry, which leaves her mute and dumped in a back alley. She manages to make it to Hogwarts and initially befriends Hermione, but when saving her from the Troll, the sheer brutality scares Hermione off. Queue some angst before it turns into a very fluffy, cracky comedy which subverts a lot of tropes (most notably "surprise sibling" and "OP!Harry"). It also has a well done Hermione "redemption" arc later on.

Susan Bones is the chosen pairing for Cassandra (Fem!Harry), so it's femslash. Dumbledore does definitely not agree with Cassandra's choice of partner. Susan has been orphaned in this fic and is raised by her aunt, who also opposes Dumbledore.

And the first few chapters are difficult to read since there is almost no dialogue and no one has learned sign language yet. 200k words in total.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
