Got super invested in a fic and found out after it got to a super good that it is abandoned. My heart can't take it.

This is the fic :)

*** Same, I even got to the point of going straight to the end of the last chapter to check it hasn't been marked as complete when it's been abandoned or if it mentions a sequel, going and checking whether the sequel is complete too. Got burned by that a few times. One I believe had 2 completed sequels, and the 3rd was abandoned after about chapter 6

** While I prefer to read complete fics, I'm not opposed to reading a good abandoned one either. What's it about? The summary doesn't really say much.

** On AO3 and FF.net you can filter by “complete” once I realized that I've never ever looked back!

** GreenGecko's Resonance trilogy is an epic that is just /barely/ abandoned. I don't know why. Just one minor villain to dispose of and it would have been done, but if I had declined to read it because of that I would have missed out on my favorite fic. I just posted this link to another site to a file where I gathered all the disparate parts of it into one file, so here's that link again:
