When Ron's team broke into that old shack in the east of Norwich, he never expected his life to change as he did.

The team had been assembled in a rush, after an informant told them where to find their target and what their plan was. They had to act now or risk Magical and Muggle Britain to be harmed forever.

A real bugger, considering he was planning on retiring next month. George had offered him a job at the joke shop, which he had been more than glad to take.

"Do you reckon he's really here?" Ron asked as they approached.

"Positive. He won't get away." the Head Auror answered. The old man had only been able to get seven wands for the task, but seemed it would be enough. The shack seemed unprotected.

And it was.

The Aurors had taken the property in a storm, and the prick Ron had been tracking for two years was suddenly tied up and in their custody.

Castor Crouch.

A lost son of Barty Crouch Jr, Castor shared the same mad expression as his father and Ron didn't want anything more than to punch him in the face. After all, Crouch had been the cause of the untimely death of a few fellow Aurors, and the one who cast that blasting spell on Malfoy's arse because he considered the git a traitor to the Death Eaters. Pretty nasty business was that, picking up Malfoy remains from the walls in search of clues.

"You're done with. Tell us where it is!" Ron demanded.

Castor only laughed though. He wasn't going to comply, and they were running out of time. THe Head Auror tried legilimens and Veritaserum, but nothing gave. Crouch was as defended for those means as his cronies, and the clock was ticking.

"Damn! There has to be something we can do!" Ron whined, kicking a chair.

Crouch and his people had placed a magical bomb in someplace in Britain. Magical and Muggle targets were involved, but even after a complete scan of Diagon Alley, they were clueless to the bomb's location. And the thing had enough fiendfyre to bring a neighbourhood down if their information was correct.

"We have people who might know, in Azkaban," someone suggested.

"And we are as close to getting info out of them as we are to get it out of this prick!" Ron yelled, as Crouch laughed.

"Quite a predicament, Auror Weasley," Crouch said, licking his lips maniacally.

"The people in Azkaban would talk to Crouch."

"That's useless! They know we can try Polyjuice, they'll never fall for it."

"There might be another way"

It was then that one of their men talked, a man with former experience in the Department of Mysteries. He told them about a ritual. A ritual to swap consciousness between two bodies, something that had the advantage of being permanent until reversed. Ron didn't like it, but soon it was obvious he was the best possible option to take the body of Crouch. That was if he wanted to save all those people, and the Secrecy of the Magical world at it.

"We'll keep Crouch in your body, in tight custody"

"You mean we have to do it now?!.... Bugger, can we at least tell Harry? So he knows the truth?" Ron asked.

"We will, once that we see him. This is too sensitive info to send a message. Your cover could be blown out and all of this would be for nothing."

It was so that Ron swapped bodies through a ritual and picked with disgust Castor's wand. Then, right when they were about to apparate away. Castor smiled and a side of the shack exploded. Castor's reinforcements arrived. Ron didn't know what was going on anymore and he ended up apparating away.

An hour later, as he recovered from his wounds with a massive headache. He checked his reflection to be that of Castor, so he proceeded with caution. He went to London and walked in the proximity of the Ministry, only to be shocked when he overheard someone near the entrance hurrying up saying "Yes... a raid gone wrong! The Head Auror is dead! Only Weasley survived!"

And with that, Ron realized that no one knew who he really was and that a maniac was running around in his body.

"Bloody hell!" Ron whined as he cursed out loud, "Hermione!"

** Pretty unique fic idea. Might also provide a reason for Ron leaving the aurors if he gets injured in the mission.
