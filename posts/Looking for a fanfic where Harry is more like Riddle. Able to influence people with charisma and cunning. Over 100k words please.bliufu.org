** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): the funny thing in this fic is that Riddle is actually portraying himself as the freedom fighter against the tyrannical king/emperor Francis White (Harry's public name in this story, as he publicly acknowledges Michael White, aka Sirius Black, as his uncle). Most of the story plays out after 2008.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) is a WBWL story, the first in an ongoing series. Harry has been compared to Riddle by people both privately(Dumbledore) and openly(Hagrid) and has a self conflict about him and Riddle's parallels. If you've read the POS series you'll probably see a lot of similarities in year one, but in year 2 it really starts to diverge. Definitely one of my favorite fics rn, and fits your criteria as Harry is quite cunning and charismatic with most people.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

*** Just finished year one and I'm droping it because Dumbledore is a ridiculous ham in this story and it's basically a shitty rewrite of Prince of Slytherin.

  This story chronicles the rise of Harry Potter, the right hand of the Dark Lord Voldemort. Features a dark Harry in Slytherin, from pre-hogwarts to the end of the war. Harry knew nothing of the wizarding world until a teacher from a mysterious school visited him and told him the tale of his father, catapulting him into a world of intrigue, politics and Power.
