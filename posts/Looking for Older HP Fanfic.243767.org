I had no idea that this thread existed... so maybe ya'll can help me.

I read this fic a long time ago (talking possibly 10 years) and I haven't been able to find it since. It was a time travel Harry Potter fic where he was beaten for some reason and lost his voice but woke up in the time of the marauders. I think the last chapter I read Hogwarts was being attacked.

If you can help me find this I will be forever grateful!

(I don't know how to do link flairs sorry!)


** No clue about the specific fic you're talking about, but it sounds quite intriguing.

EDIT: I was able to narrow it down to 86 stories on fanfiction.net for you.....hope it helps [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=103&s=2&c1=1&v1=491]]

*** I don't think your filters are quite right. Specifically, I disagree with the rating filtering being K-T instead of all. We don't know for sure what rating the story might be. Also, filtering by complete instead of all. OP mentioned the last chapter he/she read, not the last chapter of the story--It may have been abandoned. This increases the pool of candidates to 221 stories.

Finally, I would sort by publish date, rather than update date. Since OP knows it was a long time since reading the story, you can look at the oldest published stories first.

*** Good work!

OP mentioned reading the last chapter meaning there are probably more than one, so that narrows down the search too :)

Edit: There are only 17 fics if you filter at over 5k words (not the best solution, I know, because authors could make ten 500 words chapters -the horror- or have a long 50k oneshot).

** The only problem I feel like with searching "marauders" timeline is this fic was published before all of those filters... so they wouldn't apply? Thanks guys!

** I don't know if this search helps but maybe try it or some sort of variation [[https://www.fanfiction.net/search.php?ready=1&keywords=harry%20potter%20time%20travel&categoryid=224&genreid1=0&genreid2=0&languageid=1&censorid=0&statusid=0&type=story&match=&sort=&ppage=1&characterid1=1&characterid2=7&characterid3=0&characterid4=0&words=0&formatid=0]]

** Just found this sub, so I know I'm late to this thread. However, years ago someone created a bunch of themed lists for fics. I have no idea if your story is on them. But it might be a good place to take a look. It also gives you more than just ffn links like others have mentioned. [[http://painless-j.net/blog/2007/10/17/themed-list-time-travel/]]

I don't think I've read the one you're thinking of, sorry. Maybe if you gave more details? Though I almost exclusively read slash, so unless it's slash I likely have never read it. I have read my share of 8-10+ year old time travel slash fics.
