It's common in fanfic to downplay the blood wards, even though by all accounts they are powerful enough to almost kill a man and ultimately save Harry's life. Are there any fics that actually explore this? Also, also, also: would blood wards even work for pure bloods? I mean, half of canon characters are biologically Blacks, so perhaps the reason why they are obscure/taboo is actually because the vast majority of witches and wizards couldn't use them. Lily was able to BC she was muggleborn and only Harry shared her blood. Thoughts?


** The real reason it's rare in canon is because it requires the sacrificial protection to be in place before the enchantment can be cast over a home.

*** But you don't need the "over a home" part when you have the ability to burn people by touching them. The blood protection exists even before Dumbledore could facilitate child abuse since Voldemort's curse was reflected just by Lily's sacrifice.

** The blood protection thing is a poorly written piece of shit, IMO. It does insane damage to Quirrel in book 1, but when Crouch takes HP after the third task with the aim of killing him, it does nothing. Same with Pettigrew. When the snatchers under Greyback capture them after HP does his moron routine, it does nothing to the snatchers, even though they clearly wished HP harm. Not to mention the Dursely shenanigans.

You could argue that they specifically work against LV, but when they worked on Quirrel, they worked against his body, not LV's soul.

*** They worked on Quirrel because Voldemort was inhabiting his body. As JKR has said, Quirrel's body was basically a Horcrux when possessed, so it counts as Voldemort's body.

**** It didn't affect Voldemort's soul one bit though, because he was able to flee just fine. Quirrel was the one that burned up, not LV. If they were just against LV, they'd have just affected his soul (as I said in my previous comment).

Also Quirrel was not possessed. Ginny's case is what canon possession looks like. Quirrel was perfectly lucid and a willing host to LV. There's a difference.

Just goes to show how many plot holes there are in the fucking series.

****** It isn't semantics when you have two very different cases.

Ginny would have large gaps in her memory and blackouts. Quirrel had neither of those. TMR completely controlled Ginny's body to open the CoS and release the snake. As far as we know, Quirrel was lucid enough to make independent decisions and even talk to LV in the back of his head.

If you can't understand the difference between the two, then this discussion is pointless.

******* They are different, but it's literally called the same thing. The diary piece can't stay away from the diary though and it completely supplanted Ginny where as the main soul needed Quirrel to act normal and was by his own words there to watch Quirrel because of his prior failure. JKR referred to the main soul piece within Quirrel as possessing him and it's obvious why: It's a wraith taking up residence in a body. That's possession by any normal standards.

Like seriously, how is this in dispute?

*********** I don't think he can do that. Slughorn, Dumbledore and Hermione say there's a limit to how much splitting can be done. That means the soul pieces are all the same size and smaller than the main soil (otherwise he could just split off tiny amounts to make more Horcruxes).

Again, that is just your headcanon.

But the whole purpose of a Horcrux is to seal a part of the soul away. So why would the diary Horcrux shrink when Voldemort creates a new one?

************* u/MindForgedManacle:
#+begin_quote
  Why would it?
#+end_quote

Because if there's a limit to how much he can split his soul, if he could split off different sizes he would have done that. After all, the smaller the amount he removes the more Horcruxes he could have made. And he would have done it because thirteen is also a magically powerful number. But as the three i mentioned said, he already reached the limit of soul splitting when he hit seven Horcruxes. Since he didn't split smaller sizes it just follows mathematically that the soul pieces all have to be smaller than the main soul, otherwise it wouldn't add up to the amount of soul he had to begin with.

#+end_quote

It didn't shrink. What I'm saying is this:

Making a Horcrux always removes the same.amount of soul. Say Voldemort has 100 soul. Each horcrux removes 10 soul, and that number can't be changed according to my above reasoning. So the diary always had 10 soul, just like every other Horcrux. But the limit would be to remove 70 soul (7 Horcruxes, each with 10 soul), the main soil always has more than the individual soul pieces.

*** I don't think the protection was meant to keep anybody other than Voldy himself away from Harry, and even that ended after the rebirth. Quirrell being literally carrying Voldy on the back of his head is fair game, but everybody else isn't. The wards were supposed to be responsible for keeping death munchers and assorted dark scum in general away, but only from Privet Drive, and only up to Harry's 17th birthday.

Strictly speaking, there was nothing to harm once Quirrell died. Wraith!Voldemort is the lowest state he can be reduced to due to the horcruxes preventing his soul from passing on. Both times the blood protection effectively incinerated Voldy's body. A protection protects, funnily enough. Expecting it to harm and/or restrain a fleeing immaterial *thing* unable to pose a threat would be beyond its aim.

** I'm deconstructing them a bit at the moment, on the theory that while Dumbledore is indeed a fine wizard with lots of magic and whatnot, he's not a professional warder. The end result being that he set opposing wards up (antagonism vs magicals ward that Harry triggered) and caused the Dursleys to go even more batshit than they already were. Professional warders show up later and go "Merlin, look at this shit."

Lily didn't cast a damn thing on the house. She did protect Harry directly, though. Or, at least, that's how I'm playing it.
