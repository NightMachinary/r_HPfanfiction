*** Haha great! Hmm... I think I could go for either, though I don't think I'd want the kind of canon-compliant story where James and Snape interact in Purgatory after death, with nothing going on around them other than their conversation. I'd want there to be some sort of external environment for them to interact with, and ideally some sort of plot.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11457669]]) should fit. It's an AU where Snape is a good person.

  Albus Dumbledore rose to his feet, smiling at them in that way of his, like he knew something you didn't and he was proud of you for it. "Friends," he began.The door thudded open and the Marauders burst in, late and pink-cheeked with cold. The headmaster smiled at them, too, and Sirius gave a cheery little salute back.Severus sunk lower in his chair, staring witheringly over his butterbeer. "You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)

I like the way they eventually respect each other despite their mutual distaste.

** Though it is the third book of the linkffn(Where in the world is Harry Potter) series, I think linkffn(You did what) has a ton of hilarity and it's what I could see them being as adults, except a little less serious than even they would be.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?
