(Harry is hurt; Fleur is the, ahem, comforter.)

I'm guessing these are pretty rare if they even exist, so I'd settle for anything that remotely meets the criteria.

*** Oh, man, that's certainly one of the best H/F smutfics around, but it doesn't really qualify as Hurt/Comfort... but, if I hadn't read it before, I'd probably be more than happy with that, so thanks!

** Read the fics by durararaaa id: 3827270. He's written four Harry/Fleur hurt/comfort fics, two are complete, one is abandoned, and one is in progress, and they're all really sweet. Except for the ongoing one, which is pretty tragic so far.
