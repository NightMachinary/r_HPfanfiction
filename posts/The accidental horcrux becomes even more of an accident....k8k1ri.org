...when it misses Harry and implants itself into his teddy bear.

Now, we know the horcruxes (horcri?) have almost sentience at times. So the bear cannot be thrown away. It won't leave Harry's side. Vernon sets it on fire, it appears in the cupboard again five minutes later. Dudley tries to take it, it ends up back in Harry's arms (a part of Voldemort would not want to be cuddled by a fat Muggle child under any circumstances).

As Harry gets older and begins to speak, he talks to the bear (as lonely children are wont to do). Eventually, it talks back. The friendlier Harry gets with it, the more realistic it becomes. Cue a wizarding version of the film Ted. But instead of Ted, it's Tom. By the time Harry goes to Hogwarts, it can walk. Which is, yknow, comforting to others. Not. The bear helps him with homework and so on and ok /it's Voldemort/ but it's absolutely becoming less evil because it basically raised this lonely half starved kid and sees so much of its own past in Harry.

No one has a damn clue how Harry managed to "enchant" this bear, and it's only after the events of CoS, where Good!Bear!Voldie tries to stop Harry going off half cocked as he recognises the diary for what it is that Dumbledore realises what is happening. Harry, by now, is absolutely attached to his "friend" and believes the part of Voldemort in the bear has changed.

But has it?

Basically, this could go crack or horror. I can't decide.

I also apologise for this whole post. I think I've gone slightly mad!


** I would love for this to be played straight, as Voldebear slowly grows a conscience and learns to hate the monster he turned himself into, culmilating in a sacrificial play where voldebear throws himself into the path of an ak thrown by Voldemort to both save Harry and destroy the man he once was, both redeeming and destroying himself in the process. The entire story ends with an epilogue where Voldebear in the afterlife gets to exist separately from the rest of Riddle, and decides that he'll wait before entering paradise, for what is paradise without the only person who has ever loved him?

** Hmmm. This is actually a very interesting idea. I can just imagine Draco being all like,

"Still sleep with your teddy bear, Pottah?"

And then Voldybear retaliates some insult and/or does something to him in his sleep. It's like Voldybear becomes Mama Voldybear.

#+end_quote

What if the remorse itself came from VoldeBear? The cool part is if you write it a certain way, you can make it so the horcrux hunt still has to happen. Find horcrux, Voldebear feels more remorse and it joins him. By the time the final battle comes round, you have Harry and his uber bear. Insert epilogue where Voldebear is still around hundreds of years later, still protecting the Potter family.

Dumbledore hands out redemption like halloween candy. Snape gets it even with all of the terrorizing of children he does. Malfoy gets it even after almost killing four people AND bringing a bunch of death eaters and a werewolf into the school. Voldebear should be fine.

** I love it. would prefer horror with evil teddy in the end, although, as a horcrux teddy needs to be destroyed and we could have feels instead.

*Ron waked up in the middle of night with something pulling on his sheets. he looks over and freezes as Harry's teddy bear stares silently at him. what Ron doesn't know is that teddy was not stalking him, but Scabbers. as he recognizes the animagus.*

more than Ted, this would remind me on AI artificial intelligence. together with the boy. and that was very horror-y and yet it had a super sad ending too.

*** The bear doesn't /have/ to be destroyed. In order to get rid of the horcruxes, there has to be remorse. But it isn't said if the creator has to feel the remorse or /a/ horcrux. Because really, aren't they all parts of the same thing?

***** Can't c&p from my profile bit the crux of it was that yes - I love the idea of Voldebear just trolling the Dursleys. Especially Vernon, who he grows to absolutely loathe. Vernon gets out of the shower, there's Voldebear holding a knife and staring. But before Vernon can pick him up to try burning him again, he's gone!

In the version I've started drafting, Voldebear sticks with Harry on the basis that either one day he'll get the hang of this bear-body or he'll learn possession, and can kill him; or he'll end up at Hogwarts where he can hopefully find a dark family to latch on to. But the Dursleys are so awful that he can't help but end up being on Harry's side, and he wakes up one morning and realises that he actually cares for Harry. That's the start of his true redemption arc.
