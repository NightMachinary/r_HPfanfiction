** Get a PDF version of the book in which Harry is the age he's supposed to be in your fic, then search it for the word "Harry" to find all of his direct speech. Copy and paste everything he says it into a Word document. Whenever you're unsure of Harry's voice, consult this document.

*** This seems like sound advice. It only takes you so far though. You also need to track the changes you make in his personality as his character develops.

I'd also recommend tracking a few character traits like sarcasm, moodiness, etc and then during the revising phase go through and make sure these key traits are respected in the text.

I tend to keep character profiles for each story and update them as I go.

To be honest though, outlining and tracking is helpful, but the biggest factor is just a feel thing for me. I get a feel for the character and then I can stay in that character pretty easily. You just have to do the legwork to understand the character initially

*** I would add that sometimes when I am really struggling, I specifically write a lot of their dialogue word for word. The act of typing it in really helps me get their voice and speech patterns better than just reading it.

** Two pieces of advice that go hand in hand:

1. Really think about fanfics you've read that you feel did NOT keep Harry in character. Make a list (mental or writing it down) of the specific common pitfalls that you want to avoid.
2. Force yourself to re-read what you've written multiple times with an eye on identifying any time you've fallen into the traps you want to avoid.

Doing this helped me tremendously in (hopefully) avoiding bad habits when writing.

** remember that harry was a sassy complex moody teen who had huge emotion swings and as long you don't Plan him super calm or planning <without a plot reason>. All most any thing fits, hes a great friend with huge anger and self doubt issues in other places

** Watch fight club. The main character, called only "The Narrator" in the credits, is much like Harry. An everyman who keeps to himself but a bunch of crazy stuff is happening too. Starts off as detached and going through the motions of life but slowly gets angry and is eventually driven to the point of doing something about it.

Except instead of Tyler Durden, Harry has Voldemort.

*** This parallel would make an interesting fic on its own, too. I'd read the shit out of it.

** I just keep on going back to the original text for similar moods, even if the situations are different. He has a certain vocabulary.

I personally do it by just reading the ebook, because there are also ways his actions are described that are in character.

It's also actually easier if you do it for /all/ the characters, because then you can get a better feel for the differences, and that's why I use the original text. If I had a decently working brain, I'd probably have a file for every action taken and speech given in character for all characters, just to see what is that character's own set of expressions, actions and vocabulary, and what is common to all narration.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** Don't bother. Make Harry actually a character from a different universe using the scarcrux to possess Harry.
