Just looking for any good horror fics that really gave you chills. Any that have the same kind of atmosphere as CoS(Dunno always found that one creepiest)

Just how Harry hears the basilisk speaking to him as he wandered the corridors late at night, the creepy messages written in blood, students getting bumped off one by one by some hidden force no one can really stop lurking in the background.. all that lovely stuff haha

Somehow later books never freaked me out as much as CoS maybe was just the age I read it at or something. Any,way good Horror fic suggestions, please! would like LF with Hermione as main character but will take anything else you have too really.


** The closest one I can think that is also Hermione-centric is Anticlockwise.

This one is about a Lily Potter who survives Halloween by performing a ritual.

  Terrible things happen when wizards meddle with time, Miss Granger. Particularly to those caught in their way.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

** It's about the Black family, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663][Blackpool]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian][TheDivineComedian]] is spooky as hell, with both a ghost and psychological horror. The horror really builds up fantastically in it. TheDivineComedian has a few other fics that are really creepy too, like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13719279][Still Life with Skull]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18456680][Styx]].

There's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7864670/1/Mandragora][Mandragora]] by NothingPretentious which is a classic Harry Potter horror rec.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19437019][Ten Tips to Tranquility]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/bking4/pseuds/bking4][bking4]] isn't necessarily horror, but it's definitely creepy and enjoyable.
