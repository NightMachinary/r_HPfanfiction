I feel like for the castle to also be as magical as the books, the lights can be replaced with fairies in the lamps, lighting up the passageways. Classrooms that relocate spontaneously, etc. I feel like that element of Hogwarts is often abandoned in fan fiction. I'd love to find out what other secrets such as the room of requirement it might have. The possibilities are endless.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  Harry Potter, it can be said, has a pretty rough time of it. He certainly does have to deal with a lot of poor luck and unfortunate circumstance. What if, instead of getting angsty and blundering his way through life, Harry just rides his extraordinarily bad luck all the way to the top? This is Harry owning his destiny. Starts off a little dark, but gets crack-ish pretty quick.
