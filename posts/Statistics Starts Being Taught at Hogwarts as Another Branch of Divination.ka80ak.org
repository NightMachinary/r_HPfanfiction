Just a random idea that hit me today. Has any fic ever done something like this?

It seems hilarious to me! Like, running through my head was this sort of scenario:

Maybe a wizard of high status decided to go to muggle uni on a lark, and maybe said wizard laughed about it publicly because they thought it was all just some wonderful hijinx. After all, muggles are as good as barbarians, who knows how they even survive without magic, the poor things!

They come back after a few years in a state of absolute shock, with a masters in some bizarre thing called statistics, which is kind of like arithmancy, but it's used for predicting the future, and... and it's far more accurate than the wizarding practice of divination. I can only assume the collective eye rolls of all the muggleborns would be strong enough to tilt the earth's axis just a smidge, but they just sort of "bless their hearts" the wizards who are all raving about this new sensation in the divination arts and stand back quietly as the wizards have their fun.

That's how I'd imagine it, anyway!


** Da Wiki states part of Arithmancy being "predicting the future with numbers", sourcing an interview with J.K. Rowling from 2005. I think most fanfics adhere to that logic as well, so Statistics tends to be covered there instead of in Divination.

I'll agree it might be fun if it wasn't - if it was literally just about the magical properties of certain numbers - and someone comes in and combines the two subjects for a class project.

** As a muggle who doesn't understand statistics, kudos to this wizard who understood it.
