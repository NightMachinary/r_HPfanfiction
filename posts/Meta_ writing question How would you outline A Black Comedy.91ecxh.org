So I have a lot of trouble understanding how to format and write outlines. This has largely held me back from writing, as I can never seem to translate the several cool ideas I have about a certain plot bunny into something that would viably work as a story.

To that end, I'm asking for help. If I were to outline, say, the well-known fic A Black Comedy, how would I go about doing so? What's important enough to include, and what's more superfluous?

Sorry if this isn't supposed to be here, I'm having a lot of trouble understanding this whole outline thing.

** Not everyone has the same method of writing stories. However, if I were to outline ABC, it would look a bit like this. Of note, I write my notes inside of parenthesis, to differentiate from the actual story as I write. And most of the throwaway jokes would be written when I'm actually fleshing the story out, though obviously Nonjon is a master at that sort of thing. If there was a specific joke I want to make, I would make note of it.

C1

(Harry arrives at the Ministry. Is researching the Arch. Small explanation of Voldemort's defeat and the following months/years)

(Arch has runes. Get's Vector's help in deciphering. Gets some minor results in the past. Include examples in the past, such as a joke about throwing dogs through portal, and an instance of hearing voices on the other side. Story's timeline intent is that Harry arrives and this is the day he finally gets some real results.)

(story gimmick - Harry has magical "limbs" which are the result of simultaneously using summoning and banishing charms repeatedly)

(joke with the Unspeakable who is observing him about lunch. When she leaves, Harry is alone, and takes that time to get into trouble with experiments.)

(uses magical arms to manipulate portal. gets an unexpected activation. quick reminiscence about what he, Hermione, and Vector expect is on the other side of the portal)

(unspeakable arrives back with lunch, just to see Harry nearly get sucked into the portal. offers help, but he disappears in a vaguely self-sacrificing manner. Ending jibe about how the unspeakable can have his lunch, right before he disappears)

As you can see, there's nothing really nothing pretty about how I would do it. A hundred words or so for an outline which will turn into a couple thousands. If there is a particular sequencing in how I want some dialog would look, I might flesh that out a little bit more in the outline, but for the most part, I will try and go with the actual flow of the story when I right it, and use the outline mostly as the most critical points I want to hit. The minor stuff is just that - minor. Background details that are used to build the world and add flavor to the setting.

*** This is exactly what I was looking for, and incredibly helpful. /Especially/ because I can get a bit rule-bound and I hadn't honestly considered something so free form as an outline possibility.

Thank you so much.

** On top of what the others have said, have a look at somebody's outline. You don't need to follow any strict rules in regards to them. My outline, for example, is a bit of a mess for anyone that's not me. Somebody else's might be very neat.

** With regards to asking this here, its fine. This is a subreddit about fanfiction, if helping people write gets us more to sift through then that's a good thing, however, I would recommend that if you're trying to be a better writer I would recommend to swing by the DLP forums. They have a history of producing great writers and their community is good for helping you improve provided you're willing to take criticism. They will probably have resources to help and members that will discuss your ideas provided you've thought about them enough you're not asking them to do the hard work for you.

With regards to turning an idea into a story, you have a bunch of starting points. Some people take a scene, possibly more and trying and find a context for it. What needs to happen to get there, what would the effects be afterwards. Make more scenes and start trying to piece them together. Is your scene best as an opening or does it require set up? Is your scene the pay off or just a thing that happens? The other thing you need to work out is who is in your idea, your scene, what do they want out of it? A story is about conflict. How do the ideas and motivation of the people in your idea conflict?

When I try and plan out a story I try and take the genre from the idea. From there I'll have an idea of how the story works stereotypically. True originality is rare, most ideas are rehashes of other ideas hopefully combined in a new combination. Don't worry too much about trying to set the world on fire with a new structure. From there I'll work out a few characters that my idea requires, I'll flesh them out, work out what they want from life, how is there potential conflict? Their pursuit of what they want is the story I'm telling. How do the characters grow, how do I show that they went through something rather than had just another day at the office?

Do I want to try and get any ideas in there? Some people try and push politics into their stories, some explore good vs evil, some try and push alternate perspectives. I wouldn't recommend that without being careful. Some stories just become platforms for the author to rant and rave from, take a look at how Noodlehammer's love of magic has gone. Its gone off the deep end and down the rabbit hole. That being said, sometimes it can add depth, questions that have no clear answer can be open to your answer and doing so could make the protagonist go through some stuff. A classic is the idea of good people doing bad things for good reasons. The whole idea of in fighting monsters you must try not to become one. The magical world has literal monsters. JKR pushed the message that loves overcomes all. Voldemort was evil because he couldn't love. Snape could love (apparently) so he was (supposedly) redeemable.

While this is true, I think it should be stressed that their criticism isn't sugar coated in the slightest. If you get defensive, if you're not thick skinned yet, you can still dive in, but it's probably going to hurt quite a bit. They tear stories apart. It's mostly perfectly valid criticism, but nonetheless, many new authors have a hard time if they go straight to DLP.

Not to say you /shouldn't/ go there, OP, but just be mindful of what you're throwing yourself into. It's basically like showing up to soccer training, potentially unfit and having spent your summer lazing about, and then having the coaches put you into shape real fast. It's often brutal, not fun, but it does do the job.

**** Honestly I have to agree with this. I had a really bad experience on the DLP forums in 2008 (that had nothing to do with writing, and was about me personally) and it really changed how I view that place. While I understand they've made efforts to clean up some of the worst offenders in the years since, I just won't post there. It's been a decade and I still don't feel comfortable. :/

Which is a shame, because they produce some really great writing.

***** I know I've been kind of off-put by some of the comments there, particularly the ones that come off as though the user is genuinely mad at a story's flaws. I know reddit has many of them too, but the DLP community seems much tighter, and therefore those kind of things stand out.
