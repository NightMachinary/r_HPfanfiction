Hello, looking for some wrong boy who lived or back in time or alternate dimension travel stories. Preferably, slash or gen and Harry centric but het is fine.

I'd love more than 50,000 word chapter suggestions LV/TMR/HP stories from anywhere.


** 50,000 word chapter? That's a very big chapter. Or did you mean 50,000 word stories? I don't really read WBWL, but I do read a lot of HP/LV|TRJ. I'm not sure what exactly you mean by AU, whether it can be AU from the start or if you mean Harry travels to an AU. I've taken the wider meaning here just in case.

AU: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10724291/1/Stand-Against-the-Moon][Stand Against the Moon]] linkffn(10724291) has Harry as the leader of the non-human magicals after travelling.

For AUs from the start: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11538927/1/Mine][Mine]] linkffn(11538927) and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11685657/1/Hauntingly][Hauntingly]] linkffn(11685657) are new favs, even if the explicit slash bits are few and far between. Voldemort is still evil and still sort of insane, and Harry does not have a good time. I can not recommend [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/384445][SCHOOLED]] linkao3(384445) enough for the plot, but it hasn't updated in a while, and it has lost its way a little. For something more recently finished, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11330784/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sympathy-of-Souls][Harry Potter and the Sympathy of Souls]] linkffn(11330784) is more romance then slash as such, but still worth a read. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10461074/1/The-Devil-s-Playground][The Devil's Playground]] linkffn(10461074) is excellent with a great possessive Tom. Epic Solemnity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today][Death of Today]] linkffn(5402147) has a human looking sane Voldemort, so that may not be quite right for what you are looking for, but I tend to like Epic Solemnity's writing, and it is complete, which is always a plus. In the same vein, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985679/1/To-the-Waters-and-the-Wild][To the waters and the wild]] linkffn(7985679) is an excellent fic, even if it isn't quite what you are after I think.

Time travel: For Tom/Harry with fantastic characterization of both of them, anything by The Fictionist ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2227840/The-Fictionist][FFN link]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/The_Fictionist/works][AO3 link]]) but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favourite]] linkffn(5725656) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5736901/1/Past-s-Player][Past's Player]] linkffn(5736901) are particularly excellent in my opinion. Tom edges on evil and not very very well, and the dialog is snappy and smart. Harry also /isn't a doormat/. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/266699][The Love of a Good Wizard]] linkao3(266699) is very sweet and well written. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/439865][Again and Again]] linkao3(439865) has been recommended before I'm sure, but if you haven't seen it, it is worth a read. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9214710/1/The-Vitruvian-Man][The Vitruvian Man]] linkffn(9214710) is an old favorite of mine with a nice developing relationship.

If do don't mind MPREG, non travel AUs: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9591343/1/Some-Other-Beginning-s-End][Some other Beginings End]] linkffn(9591343) is good, but its a one shot. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/526351][Je Souhaite]] linkao3(526351) is pretty good too.

  7th Year Gryffindors learn why it is never a good idea to piss off Ravenclaw Hadrian Morgan. His payback during Professor Slytherin's class is BEAUTIFUL. In carrying it out, orphaned pureblood Hadrian catches the interest and libido of the present Lord Marvolo Slytherin, who -- with the assistance of the entire Slytherin student body as well as a few other surprising characters -- tries to lure Morgan into his life and his bed. But just how naive is Hadrian Morgan, really?1945-era mash-up of most major and minor characters of HP and other fandoms, as well as historical characters. [WAIT, PLEASE! .... ahem.... If you just heard a mental screech of brakes, please understand that this is not a farce, nor crack, nor crap. This has many reviews from now-devoted readers who almost bypassed it, but are now glad they accepted the dare to just try chapter one.]Chapter 13 is co-written by Marksmom.This story has devoted readers who take joy in wicked humor, intense slash romance, and surprises at every turn. I have been coerced by fans into giving this next bit verbatim: "If you don't think you'll like this, at least read Chapter One; odds that you'll regret it are vanishingly small."

** I have some suggestions for both Harry-centric Dimensional Travel and LV|TMR/HP stories, but there are /a lot/ of fics in the latter category, and I don't want to lay out my whole collection here cause that'd require a lot of words.

** Thank you everyone for the wonderful suggestions! And Fanfictionbot thank you so much for helping me understand which is which. I appreciate it so much as I would be super confused.

TheBlueMenace, I'm sorry for confusing you. I meant 50,000 word stories.

dotsncommas, I would tell you what I've read but it's a long list like yours is. I started reading Fanfiction in 2011 then stopped for about a year in 2013 and came back to it in 2014. Read almost everyday of my free time except when I played video games.

*** Okay, I'll just tell you what comes to mind then. Hope there's something here you haven't seen before. Maybe you can tell me what I've mentioned you have read, I'm curious :)

Harry-centric Dimensional Travel fics:

linkffn(Imprisoned Realm) this deserves so much more love.

linkffn(Stranger In An Unholy Land) this was a long time ago and I doubt I'd read it again, but at the time I read it it was brilliant. Very good fight scenes. The portrayal of Riddle and his relationship with Harry in the sequel was interesting, but that one only lasted four chapters.

linkffn(Across the Universe by mira mirth) One-shot.

linkao3(Master of Death by esama) Wonderful idea, unfinished and unlikely to be finished. Something of a mash-up of time traveling, dimensional traveling, and Harry-goes-back-in-time-to-raise-Tom. Sort of.

HP/TMR|LV fics. Seriously I've read so much of them I doubt I can keep track of them now...Every time someone asks for a suggestion for this one I'm tempted to type everything out but I'm lazy.

linkao3(The Root of All Evil Is Love)

linkao3(Lithium by grayclouds)

linkffn(In Death, Standby by Sophisma) Best of its genre that I've seen. Unfinished.

linkffn(Freefall by ladyoflilacs) Can't praise this one enough. Wonderful, wonderful prose, brilliant plot, brilliant characterization, brilliant everything and absolutely heart-wrenching. Unfortunately it's unfinished, and leaves on something of a cliffhanger. Frankly I've never been over this one since it stopped updating in 2013.

linkffn(Their Verdict of Vagaries) In case you haven't read this masterpiece yet.

Another one I don't have a link to but you can maybe find floating around the internet somewhere. To respect the author's wishes I won't do links, she deleted the story in 2014. It's Green Glass by mothgypsy, and one of /the/ most well-written fanfiction that I've ever read, and it's sweet and heart-stabbingly sad at the same time and I'm so not over it.

Author recommendations: the Fictionist, Terrific-Lunacy, batsutousai, Angstier, estalita11, Cannibal Inc, strange soulmates, ladyoflilacs (and her collaboration account, Ansketil and Lilacs, I haven't read any of those yet).

Hmm. This is all I can think of for now. For non-slash stories focusing on LV/TMR and HP:

linkffn(Friend or Foe by Niger Aquila) It's a trilogy, the third part is abandoned. This is the second part. The first part is linkffn(Learn from History by Niger Aquila)

linkffn(Fate's Favourite) ....the feels from this story overwhelms me so I won't even try to articulate it here. I can write a 50000 word essay on it, one that will probably turn into nonsensical babbling halfway through. Man. This story. There is so much in it. So yeah I won't do that here, but for real, this one is groundbreaking to me.

  Inspired by Master of Death by Esama. Harry Potter was the workaholic auror for the century. Concerned by his health, he was assigned to a 'two weeks assignment in L.A. hotels and brothels' by his superior. However, the trip turned to be something else altogether, because he found himself in the middle of winter 1926. And suddenly, he became a father of a newborn baby named Tom Marvolo Riddle.

#+begin_quote
  After the infamous massacre of the Potters, young Harry Potter went missing. It doesn't really help that years later he turns up again, a bit darker, stranger and more erratic than anyone had hoped for. But Harry hardly cares, in the end it's his decision on which side he will fight; dark, light or no side at all. Eventually HP/LV... of sorts.

  The smallest change in details can lead to vastly different outcomes. When Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary in his second year, he befriends the entity that resides within. This simple act results in a ripple effect that tears the story as we know it apart, causing a descent into the madness that is the human psyche.
