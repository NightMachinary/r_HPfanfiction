***** HMS refers to a literal ship. Like in naming a ship, you might name it the “HMS Victory” or the “HMS McBoatFace”

EDIT: it's used for the British Navy, meaning “Her or His Majesty's Ship”

** Lunar Harmony is probably the most beautiful ship name I've encountered (outside of RWBY, that is).

I also like the 'nautical' names, even though most are almost never actually used. Some of them sound like something straight out of Iain M. Banks (/H.M.S. Overworked and Underappreciated/, /S.S. The Government Stole My Toad/, /S.S. Flaming Nargle/ etc.)

**** While it's not a ship I care for, I've seen it on ao3 once when I was curious to see if there was anyone Lily was shipped with in any significant manner besides James and Severus. Incidentally, the answer to that question is "no" -- there's 10646 Jily fics, 1678 Snily fics and 276 Sily ships (the 3rd most common Lily pairing). Additionally, if you enable the OTP flag, you get rid of 72% of Jily fics, 61% of Snily fics and 75% of Sily fics.

You might find some fics here (Sily with the OTP flag that filters out everything else ship-wise): [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=otp%3Atrue&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=Sirius+Black*s*Lily+Evans+Potter]]

** I'm a big fan of the FictionAlley ship names. Some of my faves are: S.S. Betrayal (Lily/Sirius), H.M.S. Flaming Toad (Ginny/Neville), S.S. Batteries and Baking (Arthur/Molly) and S.S. The Government Stole My Toad (Luna/Neville)

As the FictionAlley ship name for Hinny is HMS Orange Crush, I think it'd be cool if all Hinny shippers could be referred to as Orange Crushers instead.

**** S.S. originally denoted a steamship, "single-screw steamship." In Star Trek, Federation starships that were operated by organizations or individuals outside of Starfleet would use SS instead of USS. Some Starfleet ships in the early years of TNG were denoted as SS as well, but that's probably a continuity error.

H.M.S. is "His/Her Majesty's Ship.
