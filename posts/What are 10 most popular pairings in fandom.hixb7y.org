** In this fandom? Somebody did an analysis of FFN and found out:

1.  Draco/Hermione by a wide margin
2.  Draco/Harry, although I suspect it's number 1 at AO3 given their preference for slash
3.  Snape/Hermione
4.  Snape/Harry
5.  Harry/Hermione
6.  Harry/Ginny
7.  Ron/Hermione
8.  Harry/Daphne
9.  Harry/Fleur
10. Harry/Voldemort

**** Snape's popularity in ships is probably due in large part to Alan Rickman's performance in the movies.

****** Snape is canonically rather ugly, while Rickman is not, and Rickman also portrayed Snape as more...reasonably stern, instead of outright cruel/petty/sadistic.

**** I guess a lot of people enjoy the enemies to lovers premise. I read a few of Harry/Voldemort when I was younger but am a bit weirded out by them now. I guess they justify their relationship by basing it on creature or soul bonds a lot. And if they're destined for each other by a higher power then surely that can't be inappropriate.... i guess that's the reasoning

*** Speaking of AO3, going to the Harry Potter section and opening up the relationship filter shows the top ten, so we can get those as well, plus numbers:

1.  Harry/Draco (39k)
2.  Sirius/Remus (17k)
3.  Harry/Snape (11k)
4.  Ron/Hermione (11k)
5.  Hermione/Draco (9.9k)
6.  James/Lily (9.8k)
7.  Harry/Ginny (9k)
8.  Hermione/Snape (4k)
9.  Harry/Riddle (3.9k)
10. Harry/Hermione (3.3k)

Harry/Draco is far and away the winner there, as you predicted, and I'm mildly surprised to see Sirius/Remus at #2 considering it's apparently not even in FFN's top 10. I'm also surprised that James/Lily made the ranking at all, since they're so background to the canon.

I'm not sure if AO3 makes a distinction between Tom Riddle and Voldemort in its tags or not, so that particular ship may or may not be a bit more popular in reality than the numbers indicate. I /am/ assuming the tags are symmetrical, that is to say Harry/Draco would be included alongside Draco/Harry.

**** AO3 has separate tags for Tom Riddle and Voldemort, but the tag [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter*s*Tom%20Riddle%20%7C%20Voldemort/works][“Harry Potter/Tom Riddle | Voldemort”]] includes both and has 6.5k works.

**** Majority of fanfic readers and writers seem to be dissatisfied with canon and want to explore their versions of the story.

Canon lovers, as shown on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]], are of course still the great majority of the fandom. They generally dislike fanfics and will downvote comments supporting other pairings into oblivion.

***** Yeah I experience those canon lovers on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] and them calling me immatury for not shipping canon pairings, but how would rank 10 most popular ships, like you said canon lovers are the great majority of the fandom so it's the most likely that 1.Romione and 2.Hinny.

****** Harry/Ginny by a wide margin.

There are also a [[/r/harryandginny][r/harryandginny]] sub with 8000+ members and a [[/r/hpromione][r/hpromione]] one with 322 members. Should tell you their relative popularity

1.That [[/r/HPRomione][r/HPRomione]] is second sub the other you have to message mods so I don't know how many members there are.

2.That's only reddit, if you look up on quora Romione is like 10 time bigger that Harmony.

Edit:Usually Romione fans win the pools outside of [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]]

*** In short, 1 and 2 makes no sense, 3 and 4 are disgusting, 5 is cliche and and boring, 6 and 7 are canon, 8 is Sassy Powerful Harry Needs A Bride, and 10 is disgusting+.

This fandom is the worst.

*** Are these the most written? Or the most popular as in most read/reviewed/favorited?

I would think Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione are in all the canon compliant ones.

It's sad to know the Hitler Youth and the girl he is racist against are on the top though.

*** I think it says a lot about the fandom that half of these pairings are what I would call "fucked up". Specifically, Draco/Hermione, Draco/Harry, Snape/Hermione, Snape/Harry and Harry/Voldemort. For that matter, Harry/Fleur is bad enough if it happens while they're still at school - the age difference is less of a deal post-Hogwarts.

This isn't because of slash or anything like that, but because those relationships simply beggar belief.

** Define popular. Most common as the main pairing from what I can tell:

Harry/Draco, Harry/Hermione, Draco/Hermione, Remus/Sirius, Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, Harry/Voldemort, Remus/Tonks, Harry/Snape, Snape/Hermione.

** My guess for a full fandom Top 10 would be:

- Harry/Ginny
- Hermione/Ron
- Harry/Hermione
- Harry/Draco
- Harry/Snape
- Tonks/Remus
- Sirius/Remus
- Lily/James
- Hermione/Draco
- Harry/Voldemort (or Tom)

It's hard to balance between measurable pairing stats on fanfic sites and generalised canon feels, but the canon stuff is why I've given James and Lily a spot.

Oh and the ranking is a guess too, I feel alright with that lot as a Top 10, but I'm definitely not attached to the order.
