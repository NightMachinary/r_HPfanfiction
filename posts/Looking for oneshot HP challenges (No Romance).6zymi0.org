** Crookshanks is a Khajit from The Elder Scrolls. They can canonically be full cat form.

This means at least human level intelligence and magical potential that anyone from elder scrolls has.

Harry dies to the basilisk but as it turns out the curse scar is also Harry's horcrux as much as it is Voldemorts. Harry thinks he's a Hogwarts ghost now. Dumbledore figures out he's a horcrux spirit.

****** Hrm... maybe the body itself would be the horcrux and if he actually tries he could posses it and be Zombie Harry but he doesn't know to try that.
