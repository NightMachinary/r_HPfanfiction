Salazar Slytherin turns out to be pretty much a third Weasley Twin with his love for pranks and chaos, turns out that the whole blood-prejudice thing actually steamed from muggle-borne being his favorite targets cause of how new they were to their world and how surprised/panicked they felt at his pranks. Add on the fact that this happened a thousand years ago when the lines between a prank and abuse were not even a topic worth wasting time on and the end result was the terrified muggleborn population ganging up to kill their tormentor before he arrived at a decision about just what to use the basilisk he got as a gift for.

Godric Gryffindor is, to put it mildly, the laziest fucker this side of hell. The guy gained a reputation of being courageous because he was just half-awake at best most of the time to the point that he simply didn't register that something was dangerous, only as an obstacle between him and his beloved bed; he was known as being noble cause he just couldn't be bothered to spend the effort needed to sully his honor and he was seen as a great warrior because every time someone (mostly Salazar) disturbed his precious 16-hours beauty sleep he would respond with ungodly wrath while holding nothing back all the while doing his level-best to end the fight and go back to sleep. Ironically for all his sloth he was the one who contributed the most to Hogwarts architecture and schooling, turns out that he heard the concept of Feng-Shui somewhere and decided to try it out by creating a castle built specifically to let him dream better, the whole making it a school thing was actually just a scam to get kids in the castle making background noise, though the poor kids learnt a lot from watching him duel whoever dared waking him up, mostly how to cuss in every language below the sun, but also some magic.

Rowena could give Hagrid a run for his money in disregard for the safety of others (only her focus was on experimental spells and transfiguration) she had the habit of randomly cast a spell she had half-thought out in students to see what happened, her saving grace was her unbelievably high charism, capable of getting enormous crowds to agree to help her in her mad experiments in the name of *PROGRESS*.

And Helga was a stereotypical army lieutenant times one thousand, anything that concerned having to fight bodily against and she was in, generally dragging along every student on the castle to the ride, she was the creator of the DADA class and this was done by bringing along any random beast she felt had insulted her to the middle of the grounds and letting it loose to try wrestling with it, generally resulting in the best escaping and the students having to fight it off. She would care for their wounds afterwards, but only in the most painful way she knew while lecturing the poor soul on how he should have been good enough to dodge and ordering a ridiculous number of sit-ups as penitence for the perceived faults.


** My personal "alternative take" for Godric is that he was an /idiot/. And yet, somehow brilliant at the same time.

"Godric, you can't do (thing), wizards have tried for centuries and failed."

"But I did it..."

The kind of idiot that somehow makes amazing breakthroughs in tons of different fields, by /total accident!/

But I like your idea of him just being really lazy as well.

And yeah, those fics can be annoying (even if I'm of the opinion that half the series only happens because wizards dare idiots).

My idea is kind of that Godric was the Kamina of the team (if you've seen Gurenn Lagann). Didn't really know anything about anything, but made up for it with /lots/ of enthusiasm and spirit.

That's be hilarious. Character masters... let's say "animagus transformation", but completely fails to turn a matchstick into a needle.

********* That's the kind of story I love in Harry Potter honestly. Wizards lack common sense because common sense works horribly. Or it turns out hogwarts doesn't charge tuition or something because people who have learned magic tend to get locked into a “this works, this doesn't” while people learning magic are where the majority of magical advancements occur. Like “5th year student accidentally creates a really useful potion because they weren't careful enough in potions class.”

***** See the way he was able to generate a potion that influenced luck was by working with fate. Luck is an abstract concept generated by humans that describes the idea of fate going well for you. With an understanding of the sanctity of causality in the temporal structure, as evidenced by the looping effect caused by time turners, he could adapt to the idea that there was a /certain/ outcome. Felix Felicis gives Godric the power of limited divination. Since he took a potion that allows him to see a way to reach a certain outcome, that outcome becomes a certainty. The potion gives an additional high, to put the drinker in the right frame of mind to make all of their plans certain. The potion doesn't influence a bunch of possible outcomes but rather guarantees that the outcome you want becomes a reality, as you now know of it, similar to the other instances of divination we see.

The other Founders all make appearances. Ravenclaw is a bit of a mad scientist, Hufflepuff thinks the castle is far to quiet since Slytherin left and tries to inject some chaos. And Gryffindor is terrified of the chaos he knows Salazar is going to bring in the next 7 years, he wants a vacation.
