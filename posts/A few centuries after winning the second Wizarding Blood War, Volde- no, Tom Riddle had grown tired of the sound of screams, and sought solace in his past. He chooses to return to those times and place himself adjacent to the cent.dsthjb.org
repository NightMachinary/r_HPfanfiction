In essence, a centuries-old Tom Riddle has seen the follies of immortality, understanding that to become godlike was the loneliest achievement of them all. He missed being surrounded by followers he had grown up beside, and whose children joined in turn. Sure some of their countless-greats-grandchildren were among this generation of followers, but it wasn't the same. As time wore on he found himself growing softer; the iron grass in which he held the world had been transfigured to soft copper, though he was loath to admit it. But deep inside the visage of Voldemort, a young Tom M. Riddle who had yet to be stained and tainted by the abuse of his peers at the orphanage was growing stronger as it watched a people who had suffered for generations grow and flourish in the slight loosening of Voldemort's grasp, and he wished to see what the world would have been like without his older self's war and strife. And so, unknowing of where the desire grew from, Voldemort sought a way to the past, convincing himself he just wanted an up-close view of his rise and first success. And under the unconscious and fast growing direction of his outer self he set himself just beside the center of the events to come,

At the common entrance to the wizarding world of Great Britain,

As the landowner and barkeep of the Leaky Cauldron.

Known to most as ‚ÄúJust Tom‚Äù but, when pressed, he gave the name of Thomas Enigma.


** I feel like this story idea begins with its climax. If you're writing this kind of story, Voldemort deciding he doesn't really like immortality/feeling regret should be the culmination of his character arc, not its starting point.

It's essentially the difference between an instant character transplant vs. character development.

*** You can just explain away the difference in character with the same excuse Cursed Child apologists use to justify the ridiculous characterizations of the trio (angry weaksauce Harry, idiot drunkard Ron, incompetent gullible Hermione) compared to their book personalities.

Their excuse: /"People change after 20 years!"/

It's lazy as fuck, but it obviously worked. üòÇ

*** Maybe you could start with him coming back and tell the reasons why he came back as a sort of b-roll behind the story of him becoming Tom? Maybe even make it so the b-roll swaps with the main story partway through, so you have how he becomes Tom as the main plot of the first half, then once you're sure everyone and their grandma is aware Tom Riddle becomes the barkeep Tom, the part of the story that leads up to him coming back in time with the secretly good part of his soul growing stronger with time. And then the climaxes are Voldemort coming back while Tom gives his life to see that the world doesn't end up being rules by Voldemort, or a similar ending.

*** It depends on how it's written. I think it would be a great start to one of those stories that start somewhere near the end or at a midpoint then we go back to the beginning. There's prolly a name for that but I'm not an author.

** I think this could work like a character development arc. You can use this to create a dystopian, Orwellian world. If you want to create a sequel, finish the first book with something dramatic, like a quote. Use the opportunity in the sequel to demonstrate how a dystopian world can transition to a better world.
