Also can anyone suggest any stories that are Similar to kathryn518 stories?


** Because of this author I actually learned to not read unfinished stories. I will forever regret reading her In Another Life fanfic, which was amazing, but it has not been updated since 2015, yet in her 'final' chapter she mentions that it is not abandoned but she can write what she wants and does not need to finish anything. And you know what? She's completely right.

My advice is to not even try to expect anything. I'll recommend reading complete stories, maybe look in the subreddit for threads about that.

Good luck

** They say they're still writing, but like plums, they were gone for a few years before they updated once a year ago and then vanished again. It's pretty hard to believe they're writing anything, and if they are, we probably won't know until they pop back up in a few years to say they're definitely still around.

Sorry, but it doesn't take 4 years to write a single chapter.

*** Yeah but I had to ask I feel like they are one of the last of the old authors that might have a hope of updating.

Sadly HPfanfiction isn't that good know a days all the good authors have moved on and no one has stepped up to take their place leaving Harry Potter fanfiction in the sad state its in today.

**** I agree that most of the people writing the big fics won't ever finish, but they're are also plenty of writers that are still updating and not lying about it like Kathyrn and plums*.

*no amount of discussion will ever convince me these two accounts aren't the same person, which is why I list them together.
