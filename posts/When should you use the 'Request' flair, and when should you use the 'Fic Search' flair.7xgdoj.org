As I understand it, Request is a general request for fics that meet so-and-so criteria, while Fic Search is meant for asking for a single specific fic.

But I've seen a lot of Requests that are 'any fic that has this in it' or 'one specific fic with this in it', so I was wondering, have I been doing it right?


** Actually, you're doing it completely right. It's just that a lot of people are doing it wrong. :)

*** If I'm the only one doing it right and everyone else is doing it wrong, isn't it more likely that I'm the one doing it wrong?

**** If a lot of people do something wrong, that doesn't make it right; it just makes it a wrong thing that a lot of people do.

** TBH, I always use LF for both situations cuz for the life of me, I have no idea how to make the "Fic Search" appears (not that I really tried to find out).

*** Eh, you just use the flairs. I find that the flairs in this subreddit are actually pretty good, there's a bunch to choose from and you can edit the text inside them to whatever you want.

***** Well...you know how you clicked 'reply' to reply to my post?

And how it's in a line of 'permalink embed save parent report give gold reply' ?

Up on any new thread you start, the options should be 'comments edit share save hide delete nsfw spoiler flair crosspost' instead.

You want the 'flair' button. Click on it, and a dropdown menu will appear; click on the option that you want, then click Save (on the dropdown menu, not on the post) to save that flair to your thread.

You can also edit the text of the flair if you want, I certainly did.

...This does assume you're using a desktop browser with javascript enabled, mind. For non-javascript browsers or if you're on mobile, it's probably different.

****** Oh, now I feel so stupid... thank you. I'll start using the correct flair then.
