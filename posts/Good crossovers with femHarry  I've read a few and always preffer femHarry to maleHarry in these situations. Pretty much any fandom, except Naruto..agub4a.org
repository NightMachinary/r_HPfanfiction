I've read a few of the big ones that get recommended a lot, like Observer Effect, but its been a while since I asked.


** Well, my friend, all I can say it that it was very lucky for me to find this tonight. I am also a big fan for Female!Harry over Canon!Harry, especially when it comes to crossovers. Don't worry, I don't like any type of anime either.

Here are some good ones I like:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11761202/1/The-Forgotten-Potter][The Forgotten Potter]] by njeha - It's a crossover between Marvel, the Vampire Diaries, and apparently more. Whilst it is very good, it unfortunately hasn't been updated in almost two years.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11854861/1/The-Ember-Diaries][The Ember Diaries]] by njeha - It's a crossover with the Vampire Diaries as well. Once again, the author hasn't updated in almost three years.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11957661/1/Alaska-Falls][Alaska Falls]] by njeha - It's also a crossover with the Vampire Diaries. If you can't tell, I'm a big fan of this author. Once again, it hasn't been updated in almost three years.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11063669/1/The-Almost-Forgotten-Marriage-Contract-of-1763][The Almost Forgotten Marriage Contract of 1763]] by worldtravellingfly - It's an Avengers crossover. It has a marriage contract, but it is rather well-written and has a good plot. If you're anything like me, I think you'd enjoy it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11324421/2/The-Ever-Twisting-Wind-The-Lightning-Thief][The Ever Twisting Wind: The Lightning Thief]] by Engineer4Ever - It's a Percy Jackson crossover. It's well-written and has a good plot. Fem! Harry is a daughter of Zeus. It also comes with two other companion stories that are basically different Fem! Harry's in other universes. I really like it. It's sequel: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12130850/1/The-Ever-Twisting-Wind-Of-Monsters-and-Titans][The Ever Twisting Wind: Of Monsters and Titans]][[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11309061/1/Consul-of-the-Underworld-The-Game-Begins][Consul of the Underworld: The Game Begins]] by Engineer4Ever - Is Fem! Harry is a daughter of Hades. I personally think that Consul of the Underworld is my favourite of the companion fics. It's sequel: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12862799/1/Consul-of-the-Underworld-Grinding-Phase][Consul of the Underworld: Grinding Phase]][[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10793290/1/The-Unrelenting-Frozen-Seas-The-Journey][The Unrelenting Frozen Seas: The Journey]] by Engineer4Ever - It's the last series in the companion fics. It's Fem! Harry is a daughter of Poseidon. It's sequel: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12506800/1/The-Unrelenting-Frozen-Seas-The-Trials][The Unrelenting Frozen Seas: The Trials]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11024296/1/Godling-Ascending][Godling Ascending]] by Hi Pot and News - It's with Fem!Harry (Herakles) as a demigod, but I forgot what legacy/parentage/grandparentage she's from, sorry. It was last updated nearly a year ago, though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11862402/1/Phoenix-Queen][Phoenix Queen]] by Sereven - it's a GoT/ASOIAF crossover where fem! Harry is reincarnated. She's Master of Death. It's very well-written and I really like it. It's a sort-of prequel is a Percy Jackson crossover with fem!harry's reincarnation as a daughter of Hecate: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12470816/1/Deceitful-Mind][Deceitful Mind]]

​

I have a whole load more well-written fics in my "Fanfiction Inventory" if anybody wants recommendations. I'll also be posting this on [[/r/harrypotterfanfiction][r/harrypotterfanfiction]] for all to come and request more. :)

*** I've read everything from Engineer4Ever and while I didn't like much Consul and Ever Twisting wind, I loved Unrelenting Frozen Seas. Su Li is just too cute not to like it and I prefer Rhode's personality a lot more than the other girls.I get that the authors wanted to mirror parts of their parent's personalities, with the calm winds, the harsh sea and cunning and ruthless underworld, but I really enjoyed more Rhode.

Godling Ascending I tried to read but got bored 4 chapters in. I don't remember why, I think it may have been because the setup was too artificial, if I make any sense.

I rarely enjoy reading fics with less than 50k, but I'll give a shot for the Marriage Contract one, it seems quite intneresting.

Not a huge fan of Vampire Diaries, but I do love some vamps. I did watch it till season 4 or 5 (the last one was after Elena stoped being a vamp or being crazy, somehow, I don't remember, just that she and Damon split up)

I should've said something about GoT in my description or tittle. I really hate the world and books. I always thought that after the second book, he lost completely his plot. He still writes marvelously, but the plot itself went to shit and he didn't know what to do, so kept adding characters to make you like and then kill, over and over again. For me, the only good characters are Jon, Tyrion and Davos. Even Dany is boring and tacky to my eyes. I find Cersei to be quite stupid, compared to her father or brother. She only got her father ruthlessness and not his brains, while Tyrion got the brains and Jaime got his sister's cooch. /endRant

Anyways, thanks for the suggestions, and I'll check the Vamp Diaries after I read the Avenger's one.

**** Hi! Sorry for the late reply.

linkffn(“Black Sky” by “Umei no Mai”) is a very well written crossover with the anime /Katekyo Hitman Reborn!/. It uses its tropes well, has some greatly executed characters and character interactions and stellar worldbuilding, though where it really shines is when the crossover part starts to become relevant. Which, by the way, the crossover fandom is almost nonexistent in the first ~60 chapters. Oh, and by the way, when it says “slow burn”? It /means/ it.

*** I think that something grinds my gears with a lot of crossovers with Naruto, is that they use Hari. Its such a bastardization of an already common name that it feels unnecessary and lazy, while trying to to "japanize" the name and story. Fuck, give her a flower name but in Japanese, not Nihonglish if you're that desperate to "authenticate" your fic, like Hana, Fuji or Sumire. I once read a x-over with Lily and Naruto's mom (forgot her name) swaping places after their deaths, and Lily is usually called Riri, which is fine for me, but only because it happens on dialogue, and not during descriptive parts.

Anyways, enough ranting... Gonna check this author out, thanks for the suggestion.

  Evangeline Potter is used to damning the Potter Luck. This time though, she's beginning to see just why no Potter ever went to a Curse Breaker about the issue. Bucky Barnes is certainly not about to start complaining. Fem!Harry/Bucky. Don't own.

*** I'd rather a longer story, I think I've only ever read and enjoyed one one-shot so far, one about Daphne and Harry, I think its called Ice Princess by Luan Mao, or something like that.

I like getting to know the characters, and usually this means reading about this particular iteration for a while. My usual minimum to start a fic is 30k+, with the occasional shorter pearl, like Hocus Pocus, Adele polkiss.

Gona read this though, because I love femHarry/Bucky. The saddest part for me is that most stories are never finished.

**** To each, his own, as the saying goes. Personally, I like shorter stories, particularly for humor - especially crack humor. I think it's really hard to sustain good humor for more than a few chapters. Drama seems much easier for authors to keep going.
