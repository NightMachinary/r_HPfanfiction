Most of us have read a scene like

#+begin_quote
  Lily knew that she was doomed. Voldemort had just killed her husband and was coming up the stairs. She tried to apparate away and even turning Harry's pacifier into a portkey, but the monster had placed wards around the property. There was no escape...
#+end_quote

Except, I'm pretty sure that the nursery had a perfectly fine window (or alternatively that Lily could blast a hole through the wall) and make a run for it. So are there any stories where that happens?

Please no slash, Death Eater revisionism or good Snape.

This means that while they can be enjoyable for some people, they'll never truly rise above being guilty pleasures. His fics have interesting premises, sure, but the execution is ... sub-par to put it nicely

I'm not aware of any drama involving him, mostly because I do not care about drama, but I can tell you that if you want to read about the hero struggling, failing, getting better, and succeeding because of the effort that you know was there, if you aren't only really reading is stuff for any iteration of the Harry--Hermione pairing, you'll get to about the middle of any of his fics, maybe two-thirds, and then you'll just be disappointed.

That is what's wrong with Robst.

***** Lets play it through. James stands in Voldemort's way while Lily rans upstairs. By the time James is dead, Lily has grabbed Harry and is at the window. By the time Voldemort makes it up the stairs, Lily is out of the house. Now Voldemort is in the nursery, looking around and noticing the open window while Lily is running away at roughly 5 yards per second, into the direction the window does not overlook. Given that we know that dodging is a valid way to avoid spells, they do not move that fast so distance is a good way of avoiding them.

Lily does not have to run a marathon to avoid Voldemort, just around the next corner because once he lost line of sight, Lily can escape.

As for wands, not keeping yours on your self in a civil war is a "plot device" level of stupidity.

While the concept of Lilly running away is interesting I doubt it would have worked for her. She also wouldn't know where Voldemort's anti apparition and portkey wards end.

I do sometimes wonder why Voldemort didn't just fiendfyre the house from the get go.

**** "Wand holsters" aren't really canon, so I think of wands as more like uncomfortable cell phones, being long and pointy and breakable. People put them down on tables and counters and such all the time. I imagine some robes have wand pockets built in, but Lily and James might have been wearing muggle clothes or something. I remember at one point Harry had his wand in his back pocket of his pants, I can't imagine that's comfortable and there has to be an increased risk of breakage.

****** Of course, but they were in their own home that they believed to be perfectly well hidden. Possibly they'd been cooped up in there for months and months. You'd let down your guard after a while, and if you have a curious 1-year-old, you might get in the habit of putting your wand somewhere out of his reach, like on the mantle or something. I work in a hotel, people accidentally leave their guns behind more often than you'd think. I had one moron call me and ask me to go out to the parking lot and look for the boots he'd left behind by mistake when loading his car. It was important because his gun was in one of them. There were families with kids loading up in the parking lot when I went out there. I guess my point is that just because someone is always carrying, doesn't mean they're always carrying on their person. If it gets uncomfortable, they will take it off, and lay it down somewhere.

Peter, or most other people, would give the secret up at that point. Unless you think that the Fidelius cannot be broken under those circumstances at all, but that would seriously suck for the keeper.
