** I think the best uses for them tend to be less about what they can do for the characters and more about what they represent. linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky) has the following passage from Harry's birthday party two or three years after Hogwarts (narrated from Hermione's perspective):

#+begin_quote
  Dean says he liked the watercolor [Luna] gave Harry, /Thestrals in Flight over the Houses of Parliament/. Luna went to the Tate with him and fell in love with Turner and Whistler. She is unconvinced that they were Muggles. Hermione remembers the coruscating pale-orange sky and the shimmering blue-grey of the Thames, the underlit architecture and the eerie outlines against the sky. Maybe the wizarding world is about to discover impressionism.

  Luna says that the thestrals in her picture are invisible to those who haven't seen death, just like their originals. There's no one at the party to ask if this is true.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

** In Gray Skye Mourning - a Snarry time travel fic, Snape is really into care of magical creatures and he helps with the birth of a baby thestral. IIRC the author goes into a lot of detail about thestrals and its some really great world building. Linkffn(8315797)

In Pieces is a Drarry fic where Draco is a ghost. Pretty ridic premise I will admit but I really really liked this fic. Anyway, a cool part was that ghosts could touch thestrals so Draco spent a ton of time with them. There was some interesting stuff about how thestrals interact with different planes. Linkao3(322299)

  As Severus Snape lay dying on the filthy floor of the Shrieking Shack, bleeding in the arms of Harry Potter, a profound, devastating realization awakens a long lost love, latent for years and torn asunder by time's cruel fate. Is love strong enough to overcome the pain from the past and ensure Severus' survival? Time-Travel fic. SSHP - COMPLETE.
