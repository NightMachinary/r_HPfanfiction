#+begin_quote
  Complete! With a Light Lord interfering in Potter Family matters and a Dark Lord hell-bent on killing off the Potters, a cadet branch of the Potter family has to act. Armed with knowledge, Family Magik, and supported by many cousins, Harry takes Magical England by storm. Realistic characters and some bashing, HHR with less focus on pairings. Betaed by Marc the Unruly

***** It's a fine story, but the cousin! Romancing that goes on with Harry and one of his cousins is distracting. It ends HHR but that detour just made it seem odd because Hermione ended up spending the whole fic being jealous. It probably would have been better without the romance completely.

***** It's not terrible. There are a lot of OCs in the extended Potter family to keep track of. There are plenty of questionable decisions all the way around that appear to be made solely to infuse drama. I like a good OP Harry story and this one fits the bill. It's fine, no major gripes, but not likely to end up on my re-read list.
