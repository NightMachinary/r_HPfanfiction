As I can recall, Harry gets fed up with no progress being made against Voldemort and hunts him down and casts a spell that sends both his and Voldemort's souls to the afterlife - specifically hell.

After arriving, Harry gets to work on some kind of garden before Death arrives, saying in short you shouldn't be here and promptly sends him back up to Heaven where he meets his parents and Sirius.

They spend some amount of time together (a decade, I think) where he also meets the Founders. Eventually he gets sent back.

Can't remember after that what happens. It was short, 4/5 chapters and ~30k words on fanfiction.net


** I feel like I read this long ago, but don't remember much about it.
