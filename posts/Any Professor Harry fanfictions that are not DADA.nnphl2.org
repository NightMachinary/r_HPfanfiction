I'm looking for any fanfics that have Harry becoming a professor but /not/ for DADA. This can include post-war fics, time travel, alternate dimensions, etc.

I just recently read 0800-Rent-A-Hero which inspired this post.

I'm not picky about pairings but am also interested in gen fics. Any suggestions?


** Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool by The Mad Mad Reviewer has a powerful older harry get dumped into an alternate universe just prior to 1st year. He ends up taking over transfiguration. I do enjoy it, but there is also a fair amount of dark backstory in it, so just a warning. linkffn(8175132)

The Archeologist by Racke (which was heavily inspired by Jamie Evans) has an experienced cursebreaker Harry end up back in time in an alternate universe, and ends up taking over the History professor position. This one is a bit hit or miss for some people, because stylistically the author leans a bit heavily on telling over showing, but I still enjoyed it. linkffn(13318951)

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
