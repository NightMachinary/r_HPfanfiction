In a grief clouded mind, Harry James Potter visits the Death Chamber in the 3rd Anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts. With a drunken mind, he makes the irrevocable mistake of tripping close the Arch and falls into it.

He later wakes up in a stranger's house that proves to be a witch through the extensive knowledge she possesses in magic. After introducing him to her small magical community and her two closest friends, the community is attacked. The community is attacked by the soldiers of various kingdoms and empires, who are on a crusade to wipe out all magical beings. He helps the woman and her friends to fight back. However, it came at a great cost. The people of the magical community are not very knowledgeable about the use of magic and are massacred. Women, children, brothers, small sisters, goblins, hippogryphs, bowtruckles, veelas...no one was spared.

In his anger, Harry unleashes all of his anger at the injustice of innocent blood being spilled and his grief for the friends he lost, on the enemy, for if they showed no mercy, he will show none. After the attack, the woman and her friends tell him of the state of the world. Magical creatures hunted by the Church for being demons, wizards and witches being persecuted for "paganism" and children who display a small amount of magic, being burned at the stake for witchcraft.

The three individuals have been trying to protect the magical beings and anyone who displayed magical capabilities, with various degrees of success. However, numerous kingdoms and empires have coordinated to purge all magical traces from Earth.

Harry realizes that he has traveled to the time before the Statute of Secrecy was put in place and before Hogwarts was built. So, he presents these ideas to the three individuals. A magical ritual to wipe out all existence of magic from the minds of non-magical individuals and completely separate both worlds. To also create a safe haven where magical beings could live together and practice magic.

However, to create such ritual and safe haven would take years and be obstructed by great opposition. Until the ritual and safe haven are completed, the four vow to protect and directly opposed any army that would harm their people. But to do so, they must hide their identities to protect their families from persecution.

The first individual, who has repeatedly admonished Harry for his cruel battle tactics and use of Dark Magic, believes that Bravery, Honor, and Chivalry will be needed for the coming war above all else, shall take the name Godric Gryffindor. He will train individuals to be soldiers that will defend their families and society from those who seek to harm it.

The second individual, who believes that hard work will be important to complete the ritual and safe haven and loyalty to keep it hidden from others, takes the name Helga Hufflepuff. She will train those who will help in the construction of the safe haven and help them acquire the necessary materials from loyal individuals.

The third individual, who healed Harry with her extensive knowledge, believes that Knowledge will be essential to create the ritual and safe haven, takes the name Rowena Ravenclaw. She will teach and pass on her knowledge to individuals that will help her create the ritual and magical protections of the safe haven.

Lastly, Harry, who has come to understand what he is creating and what he is doing. He, who used to hate those from the house of Cunning and Ambition, has come to understand the importance of ambitions in propelling the world forward to avoid stagnation and understands the need for cunningness in the coming war, and will use any means to achieve his goals, takes up the mantle of Salazar Slytherin.


** so Harry is the ancestor to his own worst enemy and who started the whole pureblood craze?

*** It has always being my headcanon that Salazar was not actually a blood purists, but hated the muggles for all the wizards and witches burned at the stake. Over time, blood purists would take the idea of Salazar hating muggles and twisted to suit their own needs and propaganda (like it always happen on history). Harry would obviously not have started the pureblood craze, but would have held some resentment towards muggles based on what he has witness during that time.

Regarding Harry being Tom's ancestor? I thought it was a neat idea that Tom is a parselmouth because of Harry, who got it from Tom. Sort of a small paradox and irony to the situation. Plus, him being a parselmouth is a characteristic that Salazar did had.

WAsn't the whole 'burning at the stakes' basically treated like a joke by wizards? Like it was rare muggles actually got anything right, and the few times they did, it was just a simple flame-freezing charm and no problem. One witch (or wizard?) literally made it into a game to be caught on purpose, because she found it fun.

***** Which is why I alluded to the idea in the prompt that standard wizards and witches during that time, did not had sufficient training or knowledge to protect themselves and it was mostly children who display small traces of magic who were burned at the stake.

***** Explain how a child or a wandless wizard is supposed to protect themsleves against muggles

****** wandless magic is a thing, accidental magic is a thing when a child becomes scared and/or angry.

Also most likely magical parents kept a CLOSE eye on their children in that time-period. While muggleborns are unaccounted for in terms of adult-protection, it is not outside reality to assume accidental magic may play a huge part.

The simple fact is that according to the books as we get informed, witch-burnings simply wasn't that big a problem.

******* I mean, that is definitely a possibility.

But that's just the burnings.

It conveniently doesn't mention the stonings, hangings, tortures, and other things like that.

So I'd like to submit the theory that while the burning was treated as a bit of a joke, the other forms of death were highly lethal to witches and wizards and that they were glossed over in wizarding texts because wizards wanted to keep thinking that they were incredibly superior to muggles.

I mean, Bathilda Bagshot had Gellert Grindelwald as a great-nephew, and he thought of muggles as inferior. Dumbledore, for all his wisdom, thought muggles were inferior. It's not hard to think that the infantilizing nature of the biases of the wizarding public would seep into the writing of the wizarding world.

But hey, that's just a theory. A crappy theory. AAAAnd cut.

I know that is a very common mistake most people make - but the whole witchburning thing didn't really start until the 15th century and went forward to the 18th century. It however didn't really happend in the middle age, because at this time the (christian-)consens was mostly that witches didn't exist. That was especially strong around the 10th and 11th century - meaning exactly the time Slytherin was around.
