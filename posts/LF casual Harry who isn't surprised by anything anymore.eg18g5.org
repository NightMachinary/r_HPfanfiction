******* I idealize the Potters too. I'm sorry if you couldn't tell the difference between the Potters of that world and the dimension travelers, when even Harry notes that they're spoiling his image of his own parents. And it isn't "cracked up to 11". Such people are unfortunately present in real life.

And them not being bearable is kinda the point of the story. They're the antagonists but they're the reflections of good people in this dimension but coming from another one. That's the entire premise.

******** The problem is, they were so caricaturesque that I had trouble taking it seriously like I started reading any part of James or Lily and pretty much jumped over it because my suspension of disbelief was already blown out of the window. I don't have a problem with them being antagonistic, the problem is when you make them so over the top that it seems like a cheap cartoon. Besides compelling antagonistic Potters have been done in the past in works like Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin.
