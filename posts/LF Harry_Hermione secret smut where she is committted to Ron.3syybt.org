I read one long ago, it was Ron and Hermione eating and a cloaked figure came and bound Ron. Then proceeded to fuck Hermione. Ron was screaming first but stopped when he realized that she was into it too. Then it was revealed that the figure was Harry and then they obliviated Ron before telling him that Ron's children were Harry's

  Hermione and Ron are eating dinner at their flat when something goes very wrong. Or maybe right? It depends on who you'd ask. M for a reason.
