:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This one's a head scratcher from me, what fic am I thinking of?

Harry's being slowly brought up to be the heir of Voldemort.

Celtic gods, the Earth herself and other fae all existed.

I remember vaguely that there's a werewolf festival at one point, with Luna as a werewolf kid, who's serving as a nexus point for the Moon goddess.

Sirius was turned into a werewolf.

I also vaguely remember that the beds that the Muggleborns were told to sleep in wiped their memories of their parents.

And, that's it. Any help would be massively appreciated.
