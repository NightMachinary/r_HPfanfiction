After reading a recent thread about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/db4z1d/is_there_some_kind_of_silent_bot_on_here_that/][homophobes in this sub]], somehow I want to make this thread just to piss off the silent homophobes (if any exist).

Give me your best slashfic here. Give me something that has great plots, characterization, and great writing. Something like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9323225/chapters/21128351][The Meaning of Mistletoe]] or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558][face death in the hope]], maybe something that deals with being queer in the magical world like [[https://amalthia.mediawood.net/ebooks/viewseries.php?seriesid=29][Aorist Subjunctive by Minisinoo]], or just some simple shipping fic like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12526968][higher than a kite and i've been painting the sky]] or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8274067][Or the Look Or the Words]].

**** Honestly, that first paragraph was enough to earn a downvote from me. I'm actually very judicious about my downvotes. Trying to limit downvotes to "not a positive contribution to the conversation". This almost always limits them to "unclear posts, do people have to ask 60,000 questions to know what you mean" and "posts that use argumentative or counter productive communication approach.".

However, being downvotable does not mean something violates the rules :/

** I have an unusual recommendation for you! It's by blackkat, an absolute QUEEN of rare pairs. Everything she writes is extraordinarily well-written. She has more than 600 stories, mostly in the Naruto fandom and mostly slash. I highly recommend checking out her stuff.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3652266/chapters/8069346][And the brave man with the sword]] by blackkat - currently 160k+ Godric Gryffindor/Salazar Slytherin with minor Helga Hufflepuff/Rowena Ravenclaw. It's ongoing (but updating!). The founders have lived for a 1000 years, but have been apart for the last 50 years due to some cold decision making on Salazar and Rowenas side. It's really /really/ good, and a different from the usual HPslash stuff.

By the way, if you want more HPslash without the homophobes, there's been an entire subreddit dedicated to it since 2017: [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]

** I know this subreddit, even the slash fans, hate Snape, but since he's my favorite character and I write Snape slash myself, no point in hiding it. And if someone else enjoys any of these recs, so much the better.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/317755][Father to the Man]] by Delphi. During summer hols, young Professor Snape, still mourning Lily, attempts a restricted spell to summon a glimpse of her and instead brings his 5-year-old self from the past into the present via a magical well. Filch finds him holding the almost-drowned boy. Filch and Snape eventually shack up while Snape researches how to get the kid back to his own time. A fantastic portrait of a highly intelligent but socially disastrous Snape, a credible and perceptive look at him as both a child and a self-loathing adult, and a funny, sometimes poignant story of tragedies that can't be fixed and redemptions that might be possible anyway.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/49532][Fantastic Beasts series]] by Delphi. A WIP series of installments chronicling young Professor Snape's developing relationship (even though he's unaware he's /in/ a relationship) with Silvanus Kettleburn, a much older quadriplegic dandy who's a remarkable feat of creating an original character from a bare canon mention: convivial, humane, scientifically-inclined, and much more sophisticated than Snape.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1104139][Night-blooming heartsease]] by julad. Snape/Neville, post-Hogwarts but not postwar. This was written before HBP, I believe, so keep in mind that it's old. Neville is sent to work with Snape on developing a potion that repels Dementors; the battle rages around them and between them, and they learn to respect each other. The sex scene is brief and rather tame, for those who get the wobbles over such things.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/196649][Sweet Afton]] by babygray. Harry goes back in time to save Snape, and overshoots his intended destination by 16 years. He hides out in the Forbidden Forest and starts a quasi-friendship with a young, bitter, curmudgeonly Snape. The romantic declaration is rather abrupt, probably because the writer was on a fest deadline, but the characterizations are a pleasure to read nonetheless.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/997569][Standing on the Shoreline]] by tofsla, Snape/Harry. This fic has a lot of fascinating queer themes braided all through it. Snape is living a depressing magic-less life after the war, and he's trawling for sex in a local pub when Harry stumbles upon him. Snape's wearing a dress, but Harry doesn't mock him for it. Instead, he starts visiting Snape at home and trying to coax him to reclaim himself, both as a gay man and as a wizard. A thoughtful meditation on what it might have been like to grow up gay in the 1970s compared to Harry's self-acceptance as an out gay man in the 2000s.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** LinkAO3(Of a Linear Circle by flamethrower) This one is Snape/OC and to my knowledge is still being updated. Time travel fic that goes back to the founders. This author has a few good slash stories so check out their other stuff.

Linkffn(Dragon Kin) This one is Hermione/Harry/Draco and it's a little off beat but I found it interesting.

Slash isn't usually my thing but I found these to be fairly well written.

Edit: the other fic by Flamethrower that I HIGHLY recommend is LinkAO3(Swung by Seraphim by Flamethrower) I found this to be extremely well written and while I think the fic is about 25 chapters too long it is a very good AU. It's technically slash but all that stuff is in the background so I won't spoil the pairing.

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.

A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** The Marriage Stone by josephine darcy has to be one of thw greatest fica out there. It has excellent worldbuilding, wizarding culture, a smart and powerful voldemort, and lovecraftian elements.

If youre someone who is not really into slash, i'd still recommend anyone to give this story a try- you really wont be disappointed. The real romance doesnt really come until way later in the story anyway.

*** I would not recommend this fic to anyone who is not into slash and don't understand why it keeps getting recommended as a good intro. I read slash fics occasionally but was very uncomfortable with this fic and this pairing and quit early on into it. The whole bed sharing thing and other things just read sexual grooming to me. The fact that a bunch of adults like Dumbledore seem to have no problem marrying a teenager to a death eater teacher that hates him based on some stone artifact is just not okay. This fic was written early on so I understand the pureblood Snape thing hasn't been debunked yet but Snape turns OOC very quickly. He all of a sudden starts caring about Harry, buys him clothes and worries about him in a sappy way which finally made me quit this fic for good.

** So, this popped up in my feed, and as you mention Minisinoo (I recognize the odd name), did you know this same author wrote a full novel in the X-Men fandom, called SPECIAL? In it, the main character (Scott Summers/Cyclops), is portrayed as a male hooker (apparently there's indirect comic support for that), although he's not gay. The novel contains a same-sex attraction from Warren Worthington (Angel) to him, not returned, but it's very gently and sympathetically presented. As a gay guy who's been in love with a straight friend when younger, I was impressed by how kindly it was handled. The two remain very close friends. This novel was recced to me by a colleague at work, and I was reluctant to read it, but when I finally did, it blew me away. I haven't read the story of hers that you mention, but the X-Men one is dark, brutal, beautiful, with complex characterization easily on a par with most professionally published fiction out there.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21965670-special]]

But if you're triggery about sexual abuse, be careful. It's very honest. It doesn't glorify prostitution (quite the opposite), but I do want to note that those who've suffered sexual abuse might find it difficult, but also maybe healing. The guy who recommended it to me (during a discussion about responsible handling of sexual abuse in fiction--not fanfiction, just fiction generally) was, himself, a survivor. That's a large part of why I gave it a try, and I totally recommend it.

It's not "slash" in the traditional sense, but it deals with a lot of issues around same-sex attraction.

*** I know that they're a big author in the X-men fandom, but since I'm not really interested in that fandom (my knowledge about X-men is limited to the movies and some cartoon I watched as a kid) I don't look too deep into their X-men fanfiction.

However that's a really good recommendation, maybe I'll read it somewhere. I always love Minisinoo's work, do you know they also wrote a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/FINDING-HIMSELF][Post-GOF Cedric/Hermione fanfiction]]?

**** Thanks for the recommendation. I don't read a lot of fanfic, but I did read the Harry Potter books. I'd almost have to live under a rock not to be familiar. Ha. I'm more likely to try the gay one you mentioned above, though, even if it is Cedric. I have an allergy to Cedric. Maybe because the same actor played in that godadawful, idiotic TWILIGHT series.

Anyway, as for any original fiction, I have no idea, but it wouldn't surprise me. The author writes at a professional level. Sorry I can't help further.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

  Lucius is out of luck in Azkaban, and Draco and Narcissa are struggling while under house arrest. So Draco seeks help from the one person who has the sliver of a chance to change his family's fate. The blond's offer in return: his life, his service, his dignity, because what are they worth in the face of his parents' extinction?And Harry? He struggles every day to make their world a safer place. Fighting as an auror to catch the dark wizards, who did not get the memo that there is no Dark Lord any longer.Can a reluctant Death Eater and the Saviour of the Wizarding World find a way into a better future, or are light and dark too different ever to work together?If you ask Ron, he would tell you, "Not a chance, mate."If you ask Hermione, you might get a different answer. Most likely one related to a book.But if you ask Harry, he has already met a Slytherin willing to sacrifice his life, for him to win; and a Griffyndor who has served his friends up for slaughter. Nothing is ever as simple as light and dark, so he might as well try.

  Harry thinks "Why is Malfoy working in a coffee shop in muggle London?" is a much simpler question than, "Are you going to accept that auror offer and, if you don't, what will you do?"
