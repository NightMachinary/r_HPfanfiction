I'm interested to see a fic that shows how Draco redeems himself after the war and perhaps befriends the golden trio but I don't really want it to be through romance with Hermione or Harry. Preferably I would like canon coupling if there are relationships at all.

This might be a hard request as I know there two are very popular pairings but I would appreciate any suggestions :)


** Late comment, but have you ever read The House That Cedric Built on ffn? I read it a long time ago, but I'm pretty sure it covered 8th year (with Draco returning and working through post-war consequences ) and stuck to all canon pairings.
