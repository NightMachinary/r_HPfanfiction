*** This is without a doubt in the top 3 of HP crossovers (though it's more of a fusion) of all time. Plot, pacing and (especially) characterization are masterfully woven.

I contacted the author a few weeks ago regarding the fic's state of abandonedness. She said that she hopes to finish it, just doesn't have the time and energy to do so right now. So at least there's some hope.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night.

** linkffn(The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter) and its sequel linkffn(Violence Inherent in the System by Darth Drafter)

They're both Harry Potter + Ranma 1/2 + Sailor Moon crossovers, with references to other Magical Girls. Granted, they're far more Sailor Moon than Ranma.

The Girl Who Loved starts off a bit rocky, but it gets better, and by the end going into the sequel, does a very good job of setting up the relationship between Harry and the other characters.

Violence Inherent in the System does a good job of setting the rest of the plot in motion, since The Girl Who Loved set them up over the summer between Harry's Fifth and Sixth year.

It also has one of the most hilarious ways of ending Lord Voldemort, and I absolutely love every second of it.

** linkffn(The Havoc side of the Force) is probably my favorite.

It is one of the only fics that doesn't make Magic an inferior or superior version of the Force. Basically every other HP/SW crossover either has the wizards being idiots or the jedi being idiots. Like 'I still haven't found what I'm looking for', more than half of its extremely long wordcount is Harry saying how inferior the Force is compared to magic. And how their 'narrow view' has prevented them from doing true magic.

Havoc side balances things out a lot better. Harry can't use the force and Jedi can't use magic and both have their advantages and disadvantages compared to the other.

Combine that with solid humor and action scenes and you got a brilliant crossover.

The trials of living in Zuellni aren't as bad as back in England, but the Contaminoid threat will rear its ugly head. Harry has to fight to protect what he holds dear, but that is nothing new.

** linkffn(7578572)

A Study in Magic is probably my favorite completed crossover (sequel in progress), of Sherlock and Harry Potter.

AU set years in the future where 9 year old Harry and the Dursleys were involved in Moriarty's 'great game', and adopted by Johnlock in the aftermath (when the Dursleys die). What sets this apart from other fanfics is the brilliant awareness of the implications of a fic set in the future (with Sherlock giving a phone that works in Hogwarts, Harry, Ron and Hermione set to invent Magical internet) with very well written Sherlock-HP character interaction (especially Snape /and/ Sherlock, which goes as well as you can imagine, and Mycroft-Anybody), more ways their worlds intertwine (Spoiler: /Lestrade/ was a name changed upon marriage from one we are *very* familiar with), and Sherlock's enthusiasm for deducing the logic behind magical rules (such as Gamp's Law). Some well thought out OCs, some tropes /well/ subverted (4th Year), and in particular a very nicely written, business-savvy Ronald Weasley, which is always a breath of fresh air from all the bashing I see these days.

*** The first 50% or so of this was a lot of fun and very interesting to read. I feel like the last half or so has really gone off the rails a bit though. It's a crack fic, I get it, but sometimes it feels like reading manga like Bleach, where a dozen chapters go by with no real plot advancement.

Still fun, but it has gone downhill a little for me.

**** yeah me too. Really enjoyed the first half, but by the second I was a bit sick of it.

But it may have to do with the fact that I'm not into crack!fic in general, the exception being that fic and seventh horcrux (also the Ottoman one (that one was pure gold to read))

Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
