** They get fewer reviews because you can only review once, while a story with 50 chapters gets up to 50 reviews per reader. Easy logic. And the very best one-shots have an insane amount of reviews for only one chapter, look at "Cauterize" for example.

And they get fewer favs because they are automatically "completed", no reason to keep them on your fav list to be alerted to future chapters.

Overall i don't think they get a lot less recognition. Most of the most emotionally impactful fics in the fandom are one-shots, and the majority of readers know that. The very regular threads in this sub asking for the best one-shots, which always get a lot of replies show that one-shots are well liked in the fandom.

*** I don't actually equate one-shots to snacks myself. They're often as satisfying and memorable as a long chaptered fic, in my experience, and there's a sense of completion that long fics often fail to deliver. But then, I lean more toward one-shots in my reading and bookmarks. Fewer of the 100K+ fics hold my attention all the way to the end, although I suspect I'm in the minority here.

***** Well, yeah, it's clear not everyone enjoys them. I just wanted to point out that the snack analogy doesn't apply to everyone's tastes. For me, I think the fact that many one-shots are artfully using our knowledge of canon to shift perceptions or play upon a canon moment or act as a character study without having to spell everything out is a genuine pleasure. A small jewel in its proper setting; a sharp-eyed and emotional moment that would otherwise get lost in a longer story.

As for the issue of caring - I already care. Canon made me care. The fic author just needs to tilt the characters to catch the light a certain way.

Not arguing that you /should/ enjoy one-shots the way I do, of course. Just explaining that one-shots can give me as much joy as long fic, and that having "more" isn't always what I'm looking for from a fic.

** They get less attention because you only get one chance of seeing them when you look for new stories. They'll only be at the top of search results for a day. When a story has 50 chapters, it will be at the top for 50 days. You can also review each chapter, so one reader could leave 50 reviews, whereas a oneshot would only get one per reader. You also don't follow oneshots.

******* Oh, interesting link. Thank you. I inquired because the whole one-shots vs. longfic/chapter fic distinction doesn't come naturally to me. My original experience of fandom didn't use the term "one-shot." Everything was just fic, and long fics were self-evident. It wasn't until I started browsing reddit that I realized some communities of fans not only divide them, but that one-shots suffer by comparison.

******** I think terminology is confusing. I much prefer the classical distinction between “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story][short story]]” versus “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel][novel]]”. That is how I tend to subconsciously translate “one-shot” and “long story”, also “one-shot” is probably one-chapter long, except then you have weirdoes like the author of linkffn(Black Vengeance by Teufel1987), who (among his other issues) has 25k words long chapters. So “one-shot” is story which has just one chapter of reasonable length.

The basic different seems to me to be that short story is usually just one-idea thing, there is no character development, the only thing matter whether the story gets to usually surprising and entertaining conclusion (i.e., Molly Weasley turns out to be [[https://youtu.be/HWqKPWO5T4o][Dona Weasley]]). Novels on the other hand are a way more complicated and instead of one shocking point, it is about multiple plot-lines and character development.

********* I don't mind fannish terminology, but this particular distinction has no bearing on the ways in which I evaluate, enjoy, or search for fics. I often have to shift gears when I'm on reddit because it's not my fannish background, and assumptions here don't necessarily line up well with my own tastes.

I do think you can get character development from a one-shot. 20K to 50K is plenty of time to chart a shift in choices and temperament and desires. But it's usually focused on one character's development instead of an entire cast's. But I'd agree that it's more common in one-shots to have character studies, and I love those, so it works for me.

Also, IMO, a genuinely gifted, subtle writer can pack a lot of development and subtext into a few words, which stands in for longer, more plot-oriented changes in the story's protagonist.

Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him. AU. Powerful!

  Horcuxes were the pits. Dark Lords with prejudicial god complexes were worse. Ones that abducted and experimented on every magical variant they could get their hands on to 'enhance' power were enough to make Harry outright murderous. It didn't help that his girlfriend was a variant, & Harry really wanted to hang on to the only girl crazy enough to snog him. Eventual Dark Harry/OC

  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. Story contains more detailed magic, politics, and more. It is a story of growth and maturation.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

*** But that's not really the purpose of fanfiction. It's certainly an impressive feat to write a standalone novel. But honestly, if I want to read something like that, a professionally edited and published work is likely to be far superior. I come to fanfiction to read about the Harry Potter characters.

To each their own, of course.

***** That's a false dilemma, but I've read Cauterize and like it. I can't say Victoria Potter really appeals much to me. So I guess that's your answer.

Putting more work in doesn't always make for a better fic, especially when authors focus on extraneous details rather than the strength of their writing, as so many of the writers of very long fics do in this fandom. I'd absolutely take a well written one shot (and I don't really think Cauterize is the strongest in this category, tbh) over slogging through a super long fic that needs some seriously brutal editing.

** They just get buried quickly, and it's nearly impossible to search for them.

I tend to sort by word count/kudos/favorites to find well written works, one shots usually ends up many pages back with that criteria, so they can be hard to discover.

That said, after I complete a long fic I'll usually check out the author, in which case I'll read through any one shots they have if they sound interesting.
