Recently I've read through a bunch of Manipulative Dumbledore fics, some good and others more ridiculous. I wanted to discuss how the people here at [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] view that particular trope, and what opinions they have on it.

To facilitate the discussion, here are a few questions I'd like to present.

- *There are fics out there in which Dumbledore controls and micromanages almost every single aspect of the Wizarding world. In others, his manipulations are of a lesser nature. What level of manipulation on Dumbledore's part sits well with you?*

- *What do you think is an appropriate in-character way for Harry to react to finding out that his life is being controlled inside out in such a fic? Should he flip out and confront Dumbledore? Should he manipulate him back?*

- *What is the best, and the worst(if you remember it) Manipulative Dumbledore fics that you have read in your time in the fandom?*

- *Is there something in particular that you /like/ about Manipulative Dumbledore fics?*

- *Au contraire, is there anything in a Manipulative Dumbledore that turns you off?*

- *Is there any advice you'd like to give to writers who are writing this type of story?*

Let's discuss.

Note: This is not a discussion on /'Evil'/ Dumbledore, but on a Manipulative potrayal of the bearded Headmaster. The /'Evil'/ discussion is for another day.

  What level of manipulation on Dumbledore's part sits well with you?
#+end_quote

Personally, I'm happy to read any kind of Dumbledore in my stories as long as it's written well and believable. The only problem with most of the extreme Manipulative Dumbledore fics is that Dumbles is supposed to be a mastermind who controls every aspect of the wizarding world, yet continually underestimates Harry and gets outsmarted and outmaneuvered by him frequently.

#+begin_quote
  What do you think is an appropriate in-character way for Harry to react to finding out that his life is being controlled inside out in such a fic?
#+end_quote

From a strategic standpoint, I would say it's probably best for Harry to hide that he is aware, and use the time to gather more information before he makes a move. The best response will probably differ depending on the situation.

#+begin_quote
  What is the best, and the worst(if you remember it) Manipulative Dumbledore fics that you have read in your time in the fandom?
#+end_quote

I won't be able to tell you off the top of my head, but generally, the best kind of Manipulative!Dumbledore fics for me are ones where Dumbledore is slightly manipulative but still working for the good side. He may simply be keeping secrets from Harry so that he can keep his childhood a little longer (not knowing that he already lost his childhood at an early age) or in order to not burden him with unnecessary information etc.

#+begin_quote
  Is there something in particular that you like about Manipulative Dumbledore fics?
#+end_quote

There are some stories that need more antagonists against Harry because otherwise he would be overpowered in some way and needs the adversity such as Time travel fics. I do like the idea of a Manipulative!Dumbledore in that if Dumbledore was actually evil, then it would pretty much be the ideal way to take over the wizarding world. Simply portray yourself as the savior and then mold society however you like.

#+begin_quote
  Au contraire, is there anything in a Manipulative Dumbledore that turns you off?
#+end_quote

There are many things that turn me off in this trope usually in cases where Dumbledore is portrayed as the "greater good Dumbledore". In canon I think he was shown to be the opposite of that, Prioritising the individual over society in many cases. Like how he doesn't promote lethal violence in defense (caring more about the individual enemies over the rest of society) or how he came to care too much about Harry when he realised Harry had to die to bring down Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Is there any advice you'd like to give to writers who are writing this type of story?
#+end_quote

Try to make Dumbledore a more believable character and incorporate flaws from canon such as him believing in the inner goodness of everyone and believing in house unity etc.

*** What are you talking about: Dumbledore KNEW that Harry wasn't treated well! (As far as I remember he says so in canon!) So he - IMHO - knew that Harry didn't have any childhood worth speaking of (houselfs probably have more of a childhood than he did!)

We don't know if Harry actually had to die (I mean what about transferring the horcrux to somebody else (a convicted deatheater for example!)?)...I don't know if Rowling stated this outright (I mean Dumbledore didn't even TRY to look for other solutions - no, he raised a martyr/a weapon!)

**** You've been reading too much fanfiction buddy. Though that's not the problem, taking them too literally is. In many ways, Dumbledore did conserve what was left of Harry's sad childhood. Do you think Harry would have cared about things like Quidditch or finding passageways to sneak into Hogsmeade if Dumbledore /did/ tell him about the prophecy or Horcruxes etc in his first year? I really doubt it. The fact that Dumbledore censored this information from his very young and not at all mature mind at the time actually did let him be able to have a sense of normalcy which is all he ever wanted.

But you're right, the first eleven years of Harry's life was very difficult. Maybe more difficult than Dumbledore realised. But Dumbledore also did say he tried to research as much as he could about Horcruxes before Voldemort stole Harry's blood and he devised the idea of Harry sacrificing himself while being tethered to the living world through their connection. It's also definitely not canon that you can simply transfer the Horcrux from one thing to another. That's a common trope in fanon xD

***** Sad childhood? Harry had non - IMHO he never behaved like a child (he might not have exactly behaved like an adult either, but a true child? Nope...for example his sense of wounder at seeing magic was severely under-developed...come on most of us would be elated at seeing magic and we aren't as exuberant as children anymore (!), while Harry on the other hand treated it like he grew up with it most of the time)

Sure he would have - you can't train 24/7! You got to have fun every once in a while, too!

Also: It would have been the right thing to do (Dumbledore preaches about making hard choices while he himself really doesn't and plays everything close to the chest and keeps secrets - in Harry's place I'd have blamed him for both Cedric's and Sirius's death and I would have hated him!)

Yeah, he planned to sacrifice a child...pretty despicable in my book! (note: It might have been the right thing to do, but not looking into alternatives is what makes Dumbledore so bad....I mean couldn't Voldemort have been thrown into the Veil? Wouldn't that remove his spirit from this world? The horcruxes can now be hunted down at the light sides leisure because there's no way Voldemort will take over the government if he's been removed from this plane of existence already!)

Did Rowling ever say it can't be done (moving the horcrux)? She never said either way as far as I know (note: I haven't read all the interviews!)

He just should be benevolent as well, and so skilled, he'd not risk antagonising Harry with crude manipulations - he should be good enough to manipulate Harry openly and make the Boy-Who-Lived like it.

linkffn(When Harry Met Wednesday) This is the best I've seen. Dumbledore is manipulative, and though things fall apart for him it was due to circumstances beyond his control. Also his reasons for doing so in the first place make sense.

I love the idea that the wizard world is an even worse place than canon portrays. That Dumbledore alone is holding everything together with both hands trying to make things better. He holds so many positions because he can't cede them to another without someone like Malfoy usurping the position. That he is forced to make the chose between lesser evils and sacrifice or endanger people.

  What level of manipulation on Dumbledore's part sits well with you?
#+end_quote

I can deal with all kinds as long as they've been thought through. Benevolent, Evil or just morally indifferent, I've seen good attempt at each of them already. When it comes to the scale, I find the Dumbledore interesting that has a thousand threads from his net, playing with his puppets all over the place. Unfortunately I never saw it done in a good fanfiction. I saw the character himself done well once or twice, but never in a story that was good enough to let itself be carried by the character.

#+begin_quote
  What do you think is an appropriate in-character way for Harry to react to finding out that his life is being controlled inside out in such a fic?
#+end_quote

There are several ways I can see Harry reacting. First of all, he just accepts it and takes it as it comes. That would play right into the way he was brought up - take it and be glad you at least got that much.

I also could see him break, some lever in his head flipping over and him going on a rampage. I mean, honestly, canon Harry is a freakin stone-cold monolith of emotion when it comes to dealing with the outside world. He got so much shit his entire life its nothing short of a miracle he didn't have a mental breakdown that sent him lying next to Gilderoy and Alice. I have even seen the extreme case - Harry cutting his losses and joining Voldemort, done in a way that didn't break my suspension of disbelief (the fic ended up in a very freakish Harry/Bella and was weird in general, but that one aspect was done well).

There is also one with a benevolent Dumbledore where Harry begins to work his way through to the Headmaster's heart and takes on a role not unlike a grandson. That is honestly my favorite reaction - Harry seeing the reasoning behind Dumbledore (as flawed as some of his decisions may be) and reaching out to the struggling General.

#+begin_quote
  What is the best, and the worst(if you remember it) Manipulative Dumbledore fics that you have read in your time in the fandom?

That is a tough one, as I don't bookmark fics I don't like. "The Real Us" is probably up there with the worst, right with "Partially Kissed Hero", but those stuck in my head because they're just bad overall.

Good ones, well, the Books for a first. Dumbledore /is/ manipulative in canon, just with a benevolent character and positive, self-sacrificing goal.

#+begin_quote
  Is there something in particular that you like about Manipulative Dumbledore fics?

Harry growing a backbone is probably my favorite aspect of it. Its a development of character for Harry to take on responsibility and lead out of his own will that I really enjoy (which is also why I do it in a lot of my own fics).

#+begin_quote
  Au contraire, is there anything in a Manipulative Dumbledore that turns you off?

#+end_quote

There is nothing worse than a dumb Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore is a freakin' genius wizard and researcher and arguably a great politician. He is /not/ easily outmaneuvered by an 11 to 17 year old, not even if this teen has the mind of a 30 year old in him. Harry often has the momentum in these fics as Dumbledore does not expect him to act, but the moment Harry does it, Dumbledore won't react by talking into Harry's conscience over and over and over again. A benevolent Dumbledore may adapt his plans to the new Harry. An evil Dumbledore is simply a force Harry won't be able to deal with alone, and will even have problems with if he has a lot of allies. Evil Dumbledore won't use Amortentia, or Imperio, or have half-baked contingency plans. Evil Dumbledore would stomp Harry into the ground with magic that is /maybe/ known by some researcher in the DOM, but won't be found by Hermione in the Hogwarts library and won't be overcome by a summer of Occlumency training.

Any amount. As long as it doesn't fall into the trope of all of his manipulations falling to pieces because Assertive!Harry. You are all going to crucify me for stating this, but the ultimate Manipulative!Dumbledore is in HPMOR.

They are so detailed, he steals Harry's pet rock without even understanding the reasons for it.

I was a teen male at one point in time. I would have been pissed if my life was being controlled in such minute detail. Hell I would be today. But unlike what most media portrayals of teen boys are, we aren't simple. We can understand complex situations. I think a realistic reaction is to confront Dumbledore, then hold anything he says under a lens of distrust. Anyone I know would also be put under that lens.

edit: This reminds me of "The Truman Show". An adult who is realizing his whole life is a lie and he's been manipulated. He goes for escape at any cost. I would consider this a reasonable response.

You've got to be if you're going to ever get that powerful, that old without becoming a complete shut in like it's implied Druella Black was or any other of the surviving members of that generation.

While Porthos is a bit more wroth and prone to fling fireballs at things than Dumbledore is, they're both similar in the way they constantly manipulate things to make the younger generation deal with pressing issues.

** First things first: For me this is not a "trope" - it's the truth, Dumbledore (good intentions aside) is a manipulative old geezer without a spine (he doesn't like the use of deadly spells and he wants to give trained killers second and third chances, so that they can go out and kill more innocent people...DISGUSTING!).

Sure he has good intentions, but if I were Harry and I'd learn that he had stashed me at the Dursleys I'd not listen to a word he says anymore - I'd tell him to stick it and go to hell!

What level? - Every level because let's face it: Dumbledore does hold a lot of positions of power!

Either reaction is fine - publicly outing Dumbledore as the manipulative liar he is would be great IMHO!

Don't remember any fictions for long (I just read too many of them!), sorry mate!

Dumbledore getting his and his unquestioning supporters (McGonagall etc.), too :)

Hm...can't think of a single thing (I'd have loved it if Dumbledore had been the genuine article, but he shows his true colors by leaving Harry with the Dursleys in the first book already!)

Advice for writers? Don't make him go down without a fight - someone who's more or less ruled the wiz-world from the shadows for decades will not be ousted ASAP and aurors would have a hard time arresting him - even more so on his home-turf (Hogwarts!), where the wards are on his side etc.!

*** Having morals does not mean Dumbledore lacks a spine. This sort of thinking about how Dumbledore is just a coward who wants to manipulate the entire wizarding world is the exact reason this trope is so looked down upon in some communities.

**** If your morals lead to more deaths? Yeah, it does mean you are spineless and can't make the harsh decisions that a leader in a war needs to make!

I mean did the British in WWII fight with stun guns? No, they used weapons just as deadly as every other party in the war and they even committed what should IMHO be considered war crimes (bombing raids on civilians/cities ordered by bomber command!) because they thought this was necessary! They'd have LOST with morals like Dumbledore's (this can be said for every war in human history IMHO, if one side lacks resolve to do what is necessary than they inadvertently lose the war - unless the other side is just plain stupid!)
