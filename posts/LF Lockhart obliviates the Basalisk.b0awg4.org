So this was just a random thought I had the other day. I've never seen this in a fic. Would love to read it if one exists.


** "/Obliviate!/"

The nerve of this human! To think! He dare use his filthy magicks to try to defile /me/, the greatest serpent who ever lived? The fool! He shall suffer terribly when I- I...

Who am I?

Where am I?

Wait, what'ssss that I smell? They smell like flowerssss...I think. Never really ssssmelled flowers before.

Ah! There they are! Ooh, is that a hairlesssss rat that I see? It'sss quite big. It looks nice. Maybe it will be my friend. It's eyesss are a pretty color.

"/Hello! Will you be my friend?/"

No responssse. They fall down.

"/Oh no! Are you okay?/"

No responssse.

I lissssten.

No heartbeat.

I ssssniff.

They ssssmell dead.

Then a few memories ssssstart to enter my mind. I remember who and what I am.

Noooo.

I did it.

I killed my friend.

I am a ssssssad sssnek.

:(

The end.
