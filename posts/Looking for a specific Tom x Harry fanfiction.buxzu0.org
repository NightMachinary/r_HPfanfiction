:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's a fic on I belive ao3/archive of our own that is in Tom's point of view and he encounters Harry Potter who accidentally traveled to the past, and becomes obsessed with him. In Tom's pov he refers to Harry as a creature or something otherworldly like that. Its not based in Hogwarts, at least not for Harry. One time Tom can't find Harry and has to track him down. I think at a later point in the fic Harry realises he can't go back and accepts it.
