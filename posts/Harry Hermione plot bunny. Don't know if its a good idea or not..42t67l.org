This story isn't an attack on H/Hr shippers. Its the fact that i'm an H/Hr shipper that this idea came to me.

NO BASHING!

This whole idea actually came out of two things.

1. Rons jealousy getting the better of him about Harry being entered in the Tournament which leads to Harry and Hermione spending "quality" time together.

2. Me realizing that Harry and Hermione don't exactly have the strongest of friendships (outside of their adventures).

Which leads to my story idea.

At the end of book 4 Hermione is getting insecure thoughts and feelings about her friendship with Harry after the weeks they did spend time together. Hermione, being a determined person to get to the bottom of things, figures out a plan to get to Harry's house during the summer. Harry and Hermione spend time in his room (dont know how many days they spend. I'm defiantly not making all the events that happen at Harry's house pact into one day). Events happen leading Hermione unable to stay silent and asks Harry "Are we even friends?" Which leads to a huge fight. Eye-opening, Illusion dismantling, fight. No she doesn't go back home. She stays at Harry's in the uncomfortable silence (Mostly because I don't feel like drawing out this fight.)

This will be an AU Book 5. The whole Dementor thing never happens. I might not even have Umbridge in this story.

Reason for the plot: Every friendship needs a good fight. The fact these two never had the fight they needed annoys me. I'm the type of person that can't tolerate relationships that blatantly ignore the obvious. Book 6 and Book 7 have this sin. The amount of times their friendship could have become stronger, it was brushed aside but plot. Funny enough, that it's book 5 where Harry and Hermione become closer.

Anyways i'm rambling. Criticize, Tear apart, Debate, Approve, What have you. This is my first time sharing a story idea, so I hope my idea came across the way I intended.


** "The fact these two never had the fight they needed annoys me."

They fight pretty badly in book three when she turns in Harry's Firebolt against his will. Like, that's just not something friends do, and she did it anyways because she "must always be right."

*** Ok look. People hate on Hermione for doing this, but she was pretty much justified in what she did here. I mean think about it. There's a mass murderer out there who's specifically targeting Harry, and everyone's worried that he's going to be attacked. Out of nowhere, he gets an anonymous gift of the FASTEST, MOST EXPENSIVE BROOM EVER PRODUCED. Of course she's going to be worried that it's from Sirius Black. If Sirius was actually going after Harry, that's exactly what he would have done because then he doesn't have to even go to Hogwarts.

And of course Harry has a past history with cursed brooms, and if he wasn't a complete idiot (or rather if he wasn't a thirteen year old), he would have remembered that and been concerned about the Firebolt.

********** Regardless of how right she was - actually, it's probably worse since she /was/ right - it's the lack of trust that I can imagine him taking offense with. In canon OotP the thing that pisses him off the most is being left out of the loop, right? He doesn't like people making decisions for him, especially if they go behind his back to do so.

So on the one hand, he's angry because Hermione went straight to the teachers as if to say "you're too stupid for me to tell you about it, I think you wouldn't listen so I won't even give you the chance" when it turns out the broom wasn't even dangerous, and /she's/ angry because he blames her for (correctly) thinking the broom was from Black and that /to potentially save his life/ she told the teachers.

Sounds like you could spin quite a bit of deep-seated resentment out of that.

She did it the wrong way though, she should have confronted Harry first about her theory and if Harry didn't want to do the right thing then go off and tell McGonangall about it. Instead she made a decision for another person without consulting him first.

***** You're absolutely right about that. Even if she strongly suspected that Harry wouldn't do the right thing, she should have tried.

In my own story where I dealt with that incident in retrospect, I had Hermione admit that she didn't act like a good friend because friends /trust/. A friend who doesn't trust you isn't a good friend. She didn't trust Harry to do the right thing.

Though, to be fair, I had Hermione admit that she knew this at the time and went ahead to go to McGonagall anyway because she decided that she preferred a living ex-friend than a dead friend, and further also hoped that she stood a better chance of being forgiven if she told without talking it over first becaue the latter would likely be perceived as more of a betrayal.

So, I think you're right... but it's theoretically possible for even Hermione to agree that you're right, but still have sound reasons for her actions.

*** 1. That wasn't a fight about her needing to always be right. Yeah the way she went about it could have been done much better, but she was thinking about Harry's safety. Remember at the time, they thought their was a mass murderer after Harry. You can't tell me that, that broom present wasn't suspicious at all. Heck she was right where it came from.

2. There's a difference between a fight they can get into and a fight that they NEED.

**** Well, then it depends on how good those other ideas are. A fight and the making up can be very nice as a starter, but in my personal opinion, it's easy to draw it out too much and overload the story with drama. Harry and Hermione are facing a mass-murdering psychopath after book 4, that's a very big incentive to get over a fight rather quickly.

** "The fact these two never had the fight they needed annoys me. "

Harry blew up several times against Hermione in book 3 and 5. Hermione was quite a bossy person and liked to nag. Harry usually responded by brooding in silence first, lying to get her to leave him in peace next, and finally exploding in anger.

I honestly don't think book Harry and Hermione would make a good couple. They were both too serious and generally didn't get along without Ron. During their lone times in the tent, Hermione would pull out Phineas Nigellus' portrait for company, and Harry would stalk Ginny on the Marauder's Map for hours. That was awkward.

I don't mind writers pairing them together, because I really really like Hermione. But Harry's character has to be modified in this case.

*** The fact people keep quoting that little tid bit of mine means I didn't explain myself properly.

Here's what i mean by that. Every friendship has arguments, they have fights and people move on and then things just keep coming up and its just a cycle of more arguments and fights.

For example: I've had fights with my friends. Then I would have that ONE fight that brought out everything that would explain why each one of us acted the way we did towards each other for years. That fight is what I mean and in the end it would either cause a drift or it would make the friendship that much stronger.

I don't really count Harry's anger in book 5 at the beginning because THAT is an entirely different conversation. This conversation is about how Harry and Hermione treat each other compared to how Harry and Ron treat each other compared to how Ron and Hermione treat each other.

Also: No pairings will happen in this story. I'm avoiding all romance.

****** Suspense of Disbelief. Basically something that sticks out so much in a story line that you lose your ability as the reader to believe the story anymore.

For example. Harry Potter, we all suspend the reality that magic is not real, so we can enjoy the story.

Not having any relationships or teenage drama in a story about 14 and 15 year olds would be so unbelievable it wouldn't be readable.

Good example I can think of was a story I read a long time ago. It was a terrible fic, but the stand out fact was that somewhere in the 3rd chapter, Harry picked up a guitar and started playing and singing country music....it was so confusing I had to stop reading the fic because it didn't make any sense.

******** There is the other side of the coin on this as well. Some authors go the other way and the entire thing is about the characters and their emotions or relationship problems, but completely forget to write a plot somewhere in there. So there is all this 'character development' and none of the substance that actually yanks the story forward. A healthy balance of both is really what is needed to make the story seem somewhat reasonable.

Harry Hermione stories are certainly my favorite, I never was a fan of Ginny as a character in the books or movies. There are a lot of different directions you can go with that pairing.

15 is a young age to have a serious relationship that doesn't end in more or less disaster. I'm saying that from experience, but that is all part of the fun!

I find this thesis to be unfounded. My best friend of over 20 years and me never had a fight. Not about the tools in the sandbox and not about any girls. Do we need it? I think not. I also don't need a fight with any of my other friends.

But a character driven story with a start like this sounds like a decent read. Have you thought about doing it after Hogwarts? Maturity could add to it quite a bit, me thinks.

I'm usually the mediator that has to pretty much tell 2 people to sit their asses down and actually talk about their issues instead of constantly avoiding it.

**** Oh, I told plenty of my friends "You know, I don't really have a thing for her" when I see that he is loosing his shit over his crush. Its what you do. You give it up yourself so that your friend can pursue his happiness. In return, he will do so too whenever you need it, if he is a true friend.

But damn me, if I didn't think about those times often, asking myself "What if I didn't back off? What if I was the one?"

I could see this scene, Harry realizing that he basically just gave up the girl he wanted, needed, longed for,(add romantic dribble here) in his life and then confronts her about it, ending in the scene you described. "Have we ever been friends, Harry?"

Following that I could see him going back for his seventh year or simply that life slowly catches up with them. Early Adulthood, I speak from experience, is freakin terrifying. You have no idea what you're doing and shits hitting the fan in regular intervals. Most teen relationships do not survive the change into adulthood simply because the change of pace, the stress and the uncertainty is too much for two unexperienced people to deal with. Add to that the inevitable media fallout afterwards and the fame, and you got yourself more than enough reason why Harry, Hermione and Ron would go at each others throats out of a need to let off steam.

From there you could build a "new" relationship between the two. Speaking, once again, from experience, more often than not people change a lot when they hit the harsh reality of life and the last bit of the veil of teenage dreams fades. Maybe build their relationship on mutual interests, goals or vices (Hell, one of my best relationships yet was built on our mutual liking of Whiskey). I once wrote a break up between Hermione and Ron because of their different ideas of how a family looks like. In this fic the goal of Harry and Hermione was to "take over" Britain by political means. In the end Hermione would be Minister (Ministress?) of Magic and Harry Chief Warlock with Ron happy as Chief Auror with a huge family of small Rons and Padmas.

Anyway, I'm rambling. There are a lot of possibilities and whatever avenue you're choosing, be sure to post a promotion.

They've been fighting a war since they're 11, facing murderers each year, and dealing with far more stress than most people ever deal in their lives.

A break-up could still occur, but probably because the world slowed down and they have less stress, and the small things might start to matter more. Unless they really got past that small stuff while fighting for their lives at each other's side.

Good point. Although I didn't mean "active" stress (I'm getting into territory here where I'd love to use my native language). I'm talking, as you say it, about the stress of small things and existential questions. Making money, having a career, having children,... Thats not the stress of life threatening situations and war - something I would compare with a hammer smashing a rock. This every-day stress is more like a waterstream slowly eroding your defenses. Most people loose their edges, but stay put, some drift away.
