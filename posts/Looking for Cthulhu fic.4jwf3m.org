I read a fic a while ago where Harry had an animagus form that was Cthulhu. It was longish at around 50k words, can anyone help me?

  Every seventy years members of the Order of the Bath, a British order of chivalry, are being killed off. That is until Harry is brought in to hunt the killer or killers down. Harry/Padma. *Complete*
