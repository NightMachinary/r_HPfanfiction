:END:
Hey! I'm looking for 2 fics that kinda have the same underlining theme.

Fic 1: (No magic!) Snape is a gay retired soldier in medieval times. He is forced into an arranged marriage with Harry who is intersex and is being raised by her aunt and uncle as a girl. Harry us bullied for being intersex by his cousin and village children. He is scared Snape will kill him when he finds out. Snape is annoyed to be marrying a girl since he's gay but is happy to find out Harry is intersex and Harry wants to be a boy so they live happily ever after.

Fic 2: Harry and others are going to Hogwarts for the possibility of an arranged marriage and Dumbledore arranged for Snape to marry Harry (who again is intersex but has been raised as a girl by Petunia and Vernon). They marry but do not consummate and Harry becomes suspicious of Snape's relationship with Lucius Malfoy. At some point Harry runs away but is found again. In the end Snape again finds out Harry is intersex and they live happily ever after.

Omg I know that was long af but it's been bugging me FOR A WHILE! Really hope somebody out there can help.

Thanks üçÑ
