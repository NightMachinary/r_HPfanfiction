** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13034223/1/A-Discordant-Note][A Discordant Note]] by Noddlehammer is pretty good. I might actually skip the fic its a sequel to; Noodlehammer has a talent for spinning what would normally be a fic turn-off into a good story, and in the prequel Harry is just straight up an asshole, but kind of a sympathetic asshole to a degree? When he moves from Earth to Planetos a lot of the asshole gets left behind because he doesn't give as much of a shit, so the character becomes less distasteful.

I like this one. I'd like even more if the author actually wrote this Dune xover which is inted at at the end of the fic.

Author isn't liked on this sub, and I don't like him either, but his stories are very well written.

I would recommend reading the prequel but see to my above sentence.

*** His stories end up with an asshole Harry steamrolling and power-wanking. I dont mind Super!Harry as long as it has an interesting plot. Does this actually have any plot that keeps you wanting to read more? Or is this same old stuff in a new dress?

**** Yes, because Harry's assholeness and his power levels are well explained.

Harry is a sociopath because his relatives dumped him in an orphanage, no one in the orphanage liked him, then when he finally gets adopted turns out his adopted parents don't actually love him and only uses him as a status symbol. If your childhood years are like that I won't be surprised if you turn out to be a sociopath too, or even a psychopath. Sociopaths aren't known to be nice to others.

The Super!Harry occurs late in the story because Harry has been practicing magic from when he first discovered it. The ritual he did early on in the story helps him understand magic more. I mean if you were training yourself on something from a very young age, I expect you to be exceptionally good at it when you grow up.

Again steamrolling only occurs later because of extensive training. Harry almost gets killed and hurts himself at the world cup. After that he begins training with Luna in the Room of Requirement.

The only parts I don't like is the hatred of religions at the end of the story, that was definitely the author projecting, hence why I said I don't like NoodleHammer. But since the rest is excellent, I can tolerate it.

** I really enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13118200/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Land-of-Ice-and-Fire][Harry Potter and The Land of Ice and Fire by kossboss]] linkffn(13118200) and this old but good one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132113/1/The-Difference-One-Man-Can-Make][The Difference One Man Can Make by joen1801]] linkffn(11132113).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910526/1/Death-has-no-Master-but-Life-has-Servants][Death has no Master, but Life has Servants by Jinchuu21]] isn't bad linkffn(11910526) but I'm not a huge fan of the Saint Potter trope.

  A small change in Harry's battle with the Basilisk had him slowly absorbing Voldemort's memories from the Horcrux in his scar. Follow Harry as he makes preparations to leave the Wizarding world behind for good with Sirius and embark on a long and exciting journey into the unknown. But little can prepare Harry for the eventual Game of Thrones he must play to survive once there.

  Another task had been given to him. Not one of prophecy, but of choice. He had long ago accepted his need to help people, to protect those who could not protect themselves. War was all he had known, all he was good at. It was time to help heal. But, sometimes, to save a life, you had to take one.
