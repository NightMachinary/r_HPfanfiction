Dumbledore realizes this and begins using it to avoid paying teachers and to eliminate political opponents.


** There was a one-shot where Dumbledore used the defense post after the first war as 'community service' for all those Death Eaters trying to claim the Imperious defense. He always made sure it was a two year contract for Death Eaters, and by the time Voldy came back his inner circle was basically nonexistent.

Edit: Sorry, I've got no clue what it was called, and can't find it saved anywhere. I'm pretty sure it was on FFN, but that's all I've got.

*** Because in canon, the defense teachers usually last nearly the whole year and rarely have a gruesome death (just an "impaled on your own sword" karmic moment). In this, the curse interacts with the scarcrux to work much quicker.

For example: when Lockhart vanishes Harry's arm bones, the curse causes him to break every bone in his body. It's a cracky premise, which of course is my specialty.
