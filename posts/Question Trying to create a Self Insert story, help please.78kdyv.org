So I'm trying to create a self insert fanfic, just because I like reading them and wanted to try my own hand at writing one.

I have a basic idea of who I want to use, but I wasn't sure so I thought I'd ask here.

I have it between Ginny Weasley and Pansy Parkinson. Ginny because she is at the front of a lot of the action, at least in the later books. So I thought using her as my self insert would be good.

Pansy because she was absolutely terrible in the stories and I thought if someone took her over things would be different.

I was curious on who would be a good idea, or if anyone had any other idea.

I didn't want to use a Professor or someone from the Ministry because I figured that would be too easy, I wanted to use a student as my self insert so that they would have some trouble. But if anyone could think of any other student let me know.

I didn't want to use Hermione because that would be too much for me, and same with Luna; she's one of my favorite characters but I don't think I'd be able to write it believably if it was Luna as my self insert.


** If you do use Ginny as a self insert, you would have to ask how her family would respond to her personality changes, and when exactly do you become Ginny?

If you're Ginny from birth, no problem, it's not like they would know a difference anyways. But, if you take over her body during the fight with the supreme danger noodle, that's probably the best time, changes can be blamed on traumatic year. Any time after year 2 and everyone would be watching her to see if she has another major personality shift (last time she acted vastly different she was possessed by a dark lord.)

*** I wanted to use Ginny either before her start in Hogwarts (I could explain her change in personality on her brothers leaving home if I used her before Hogwarts) or after her first year because of the whole diary thing, that would be a great way to show her have a drastic change of personality after something so traumatic that would be believable if I did the self insert then.

So yeah, I think I'll do it sometime after the diary incident. Maybe even when Harry saves her or whatever, that could be when the switch changes.

** A Professor wouldn't be easy lol, it would be the hardest. Think about it, the Profesor is teaching in the middle of a class in Hogwarts or wherever, suddenly, enters SI, the knowledge and personality of the Professor are no more, being replaced by yours. What do you do? The only thing you know about magic is that is LeviOsa, not LeviosA.

You could say you were Obliviated, but then you would have someone inside your head checking, and seeing that you are, well, not you. In a world were possession is possible, and viewed as extremely dark, well... you are in a shit load of trouble.

** I suppose it depends on what you want.

Ginny of course has the advantage of being very close to the canon events, and the people around her are generally the more fleshed-out and developed characters, and we know a lot more about her home situation, her family relations, and we can at least make some educated guesses at what her early childhood was like. So choosing Ginny would probably be the easier route.

Pansy, on the other hand, would be more challenging. She is a lot less developed; we don't know anything about her home life, her family, or anything at all, really. Her only role in the story is to be the "mean girl" from Slytherin and besides she's a pretty blank sheet. You'd need to invent a lot more details about her, and you'd need to invent a lot of OCs in the form of her family. If you still place her in Slytherin, you'd need to give some characterisations to other Slytherins, who in canon don't have personalities at all.

Either could work, mind, but Ginny is definitely the easier option.

Ginny is a pretty good choice, she has an easy in with the main characters. Also, as others have said, if you're not inserting as a small child Ginny has a traumatic event for a believable personality change.

Pansy might be interesting, but you'd have to deal with all the junior Death Eaters, it would be significantly harder to write about I think.

Easy? Are you a knowledgeable and skilled Witch? This might be far harder. Suddenly you know less than a first year and you're expected to teach.

Just curious, why isn't your self-inserted self just going straight to Dumbledore? Or if not him, Amelia Bones.

*** Well I meant easy just because several self insert stories I've read have the SI gain memories from the person that they've become, so I figured that if it was say a Professor or someone from the Ministry it would be too easy since then my SI would have all the knowledge that person had plus the knowledge the SI had from the books.

But yeah, I think I'm going to use Ginny Weasley. She would be the easiest to write, I could do it after Tom and the diary got destroyed in the Chambers of Secrets. That would be a perfect way to explain Ginny's personality change. Something so dramatic would change her or so people would assume, so that would be the best way to do it.

Actually I figured I'd use Albus and Amelia. I wanted to use Amelia because she seemed to be stern but reliable, believing in the truth of justice and fair play. And I figured having a Ministry official would help my SI with Peter Pettigrew, Barty Crouch Sr and Jr and all that.

** I think you have to ask yourself how much political maneuvering and Machiavellian scheming you want to deal with. If I imagined myself in slytherin I'd feel compelled to use subtlety in my communication and constantly be on guard for double meanings and how people /actually/ view and relate to each other.

If I were in Gryffindor I'd just be able to say what I think and do what I want, but action would be the only way to get things done.

*** Hey, Slytherins don't HAVE to be about political maneuvering and Machiavellian scheming. Especially not at age eleven. That's a bit of a fanfic trope and seldom used in a very interesting way....

I mean, in the books, Slytherins aren't exactly depicted as political mastermind. Okay, the most prominent Slytherin is Draco Malfoy, who wouldn't know politics if his life depended on it, but what we see of the other Slytherins doesn't really say "political mastermind" to me.

The only Slytherin who even begins to attempt any sort of political maneuvering or Machiavellian scheming is Slughorn, and he's SLIGHTLY older than the students; he's had DECADES to get good at it.

Just feels a little odd in fics that have elveven-year-old as world-weary and cynical politicians (and usually not as skilled as the author thinks they are either).

It's very possible to do a Slytherin fic with no political maneuvering at all. :)

**** I honestly think that's a failing of Rowling. She made slytherin house into a house about cunning and ambition, she makes the hat sing about people who want to achieve their goals no matter the means, and what do we get? A bunch of retarded nazis. Who are also ugly. Hell, even Zalazar himself was apparently a nazi. Real deep character that. He makes snek and snek kills mudbloods whoop whoop. So evil, and not even for any particular reason. Every time fanfic authors try to insert some depth of character or politics or scheming or just generally intelligent conversation I think that' a good thing that gives the whole setting more depth. They might not always succeed, sure, but I like that they try.

I totally agree with you that slytherins don't have to be Machiavellian, and they don't have to scheme. I do think that they have to have on thing in common though for the most part, and that is that they have a goal and are always mindful of working towards, even subconsciously. Like Percy for example. Tom Riddle is also a great example of this. Both weren't adults before they started working towards their ambitions.

***** I agree that the houses as portrayed in the books are somewhat shallowly presented; Slytherin in particular just becomes "the evil house" without many redeeming qualities. And I'm not opposed to fanfics creating a little more depth and sympathy to Slytherin, nor would I mind some better look into the "ambition" part.

It's just that fanfic authors seem to just turn them into the "pureblood elite/nobility of the wizarding world" and a group of political masterminds, usually written by an author who has no idea how nobility acts or how political masterminds operate, and the entire thing doesn't come across as deep at all...

Besides... they are KIDS. Eleven-year-olds are NOT master politicians and schemers who think years ahead, no matter how they grew up. In these fanfics the first-years read like worldwary forty-year-olds, and I'm like, NO! At that age the scheming should be on the level of Malfoy's stunt in the first book (trick your enemy into breaking curfew and tip the caretaker about it), not complex political alliances and stuffy speeches about how you manipulated the situation to your advantage to assure the ties between two Pureblood families.

....actually, you know who'd make a good Slytherin? Bugs Bunny! Okay, he doesn't have the ambition part and is generally content to just chill in his rabbit hole until someone bothers him, but he's got the cunning and the wits, and the ability/will to go to just about any length to achieve his goals.
