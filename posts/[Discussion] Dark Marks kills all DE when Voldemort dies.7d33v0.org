** In the epilogue, Draco clearly survived.

#+begin_quote
  Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat.

Draco Malfoy also took the mark in HBP, so I think Rowling's opinion is pretty clear. (At least it was [[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/27751][very heavily implied that he did]])

My opinion: Would it be in-character for Voldemort to tether his life to his servants? Sure.

Is it possible to drain someone magically? Sure, as we've seen in CoS.

So is it possible that Voldemort did it in an AU? Definitely - it's just not canon.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

** Well, in the film universe it's false. Draco is marked and shows up in the epilogue.

In the books it's not made explicit whether he was marked or not (although it's likely and was confirmed via Pottermore).

** He wouldnt do it. Voldemort i mean. If he is teathered to his servants, that means should his body be destoryed, so would his followers unless he bound it to his soul which he would have to redo with each horcrux, since in his mind the soul isn't infinite. (it is and isnt). The Dark Mark isn't unlike the golden coins that Hermione makes. A glorified protean charm based around a tattoo that is animated. The only question is does the tattoo grant information? Possibly. But that doesnt make them bound to voldemort... Voldemort just has the Master Dark Mark
