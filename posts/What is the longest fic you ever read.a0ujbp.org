I'm currently trying to improve my French by reading linkffn(ce qui aurait pu se passer) which clocks in at 1.3 million words, although I don't know how much of that is author's note.

What are the longest fics you've read? Does the quality of writing stay consistent, does the author improve over time?


** Dangerverse by Whydoyoneedtoknow clocks in at almost 2 million before the one shots and side stories and what-not. I was lucky enough to catch it on the front page of FFN at chapter 2 when I was like 12 and it's been my absolute favorite for a long time.

**** It was supposed to be a 10 chapter fluff fic where Remus is happy, Sirius is free, and Harry is out of the Dursley's.... Danger started as a Mary-sue on purpose.... it snowballed. A bit.

My understanding is Anne (her other penname) just kept thinking of "what ifs" and decided "why not" so.... she did all of it. Which is where a lot of the more ridiculous stuff comes in. But it never takes itself too seriously.

And considering the divergence point happened in the founders' era... its gonna be pretty AU.

** I've read A Cloudy Path which clocks in at 1.3 million. I've also read Of Sheep and Battle Chicken, which between all the posted materials is probably around that length, if not longer, though strictly speaking the first part is only like 750k. I can't make it past year 2 in Prince of the Dark Kingdom so I can't claim that.

**** Oh god, I haven't read anything in that fandom for several years at least. I can give you some fics I liked, but they may or may not be signs of shit taste.

That said [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636239/1/A-Dark-Dawn][A Dark Dawn]]: Complete- A dark take on a first contact AU, due to /stuff/ the Turians nuke Earth and leave humanity for dead. Several centuries later...well, we're not as dead as they thought and we want blood. Very much HFY, but also explores some of the human cost in a society that is completely oriented around extracting bloody vengeance

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5898628/1/Mass-Effect-Iron-Rebirth][Mass Effect: Iron Rebirth]]: Dead- The Lazarus Project ran into some issues and they have to stuff Shepard brain into a YMIR mech.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7170477/1/Renegade-Reinterpretations][Renegade Reinterpritations]]: Complete - What if Humanity made first contact with the Batarians? Not a traditional fic layout, think more a story outline with codex entries thrown in. Still very interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5639538/1/Accidental-Hero-of-the-Galaxy][Accidental Hero of the Galaxy]]: Complete- What if Shepard just wanted to cover his ass and not get shot at. Very much in the style of "Ciaphea Cain"

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/Mass-Effect-Crossovers/2927/0/?&srt=4&r=10][Mass Effect: Human Revolution]]: In progress- A crossover of Mass Effect and Deus Ex primarily, but has elements from most Square Enix games, What if Adam Jensen and Garrus were Buddy cops? (Also, Garrus is space Batman's amnesiac son)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8064299/1/Consuming-Direct-Control][Consuming Direct Control]]:Complete, but the sequel is dead before arrival- What if TIM had Shepard recruit Alex Mercer to the Party

Also, check out the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/MassEffect][TVtropes rec page]]. It has a pretty large list of recommendations. I wouldn't necessarily second all of them, but none are /terrible/ in my experience.

I've read it a few times and it always loses me for few thousand words in the middle but once I'm through them it's sweet. I've also read the Black Queen series linkffn(8233291) in more or less one sitting which is about 840,000 words and I know I've read other series which have a higher word count, I just can't think of any others off the top of my head. There are also other fanfics which I followed and read while they were still WIP but haven't reread since so I won't count them.

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry

** I read an absolutely ridiculous and awfully fun fanfic in Russian "Дедушка П" that is 2 915 814 symbols. Just for shits and giggles, the author compared it to "War and Peace" (2 966 547) at the end. I was absolutely shocked because, until I finished that monstrosity, I thought I didn't like crack fics.

It's basically about a very resourceful, perverted and money-loving old man who was reborn as a magical child with dwarfism. Yeah... He proceeds to have orgies at Hogwarts, make a ton of money selling snacks and beverages during Triwizard Tournament, brewing moonshine from leftover pumpkin juice, sire like a huge new generation of wizards in Australia by donating his sperm, going to a parallel plane of existence as part of some demon's harem, buying a huge ranch in Australia, getting captured by US government for experimentation, etc (these are just some bunnies I remember in no particular order).

It was insane but somehow cohesive, and I breezed through it.

** The longest HP fic on my favorites list is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality), followed closely by linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles). I found both quite thought provoking, although in terms of writing quality, HPMoR easily wins out.

But if you're just asking for the longest that I've read in any genre, it's definitely [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With This Ring]], which is close to 2.5M and updates daily with over a thousand words. The canon Young Justice series has a 5-year timeskip. This guy is covering the whole period /without/ a timeskip. The writing style has definitely changed since its beginning, although I don't think it was /bad/ then. And when all is said and done, Power Rings are Awesome.
