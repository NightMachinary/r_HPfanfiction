** Don't know if this thread is still relevant but I'll post anyway.

I'm looking for a beta for my multi-chaptered, possibly novel length fic. At the moment I only have 5 chapters. I've started and stopped this fic so many times over the years, but I really want to continue with it! It's a remus/sirius fic set in marauder time (yeah, yeah I know, overdone). Link to ffnet: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10762558/1/Both-Ends-Burning][both ends burning]]

What I'm looking for in a beta: -someone to give me a sense of accountability, so that I'll be more inspired to continue writing this thing -to help me with dialogue. My writing is at the moment very character introspective, and I think I have an issue with moving things along -help me avoid plot holes, brainstorm plotlines and character developments with me

Thanks in advance! You can contact me via messaging here, or on ffnet
