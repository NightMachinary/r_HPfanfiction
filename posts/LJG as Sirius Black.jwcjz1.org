If you don't know who LJG is... well I feel bad for ya. Anyways I feel like Leather Jacket Guy (from the [[https://youtu.be/2GIYMB-sRcA][Try Channel]], and his own yt channel(areyahavingthat) is what I believe a modern Sirius would be like.

I feel like it would be such a great fic, obviously it have to be a crack fic; like just imagine that Dumbledore, Remus, and Harry discover that instead of hiding out at Grimmauld place Sirius is just in Dublin shooting videos for YouTube were all he does is get drunk and say funny and zany things then gets paid for it! I can already imagine Remus's exasperation!ðŸ¤£
