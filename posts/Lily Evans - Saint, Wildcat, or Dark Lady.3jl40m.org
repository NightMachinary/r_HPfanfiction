Lily Evans tends to get one of three characterizations in fanfiction.

- *The Saint* - This Lily is sweet, unfailingly noble, and beloved by all. This characterization would be called a Mary Sue if she was the main character.

- *The Wildcat* - This Lily is one that everyone loves... until they make her mad, then everyone runs in terror from her ferocious temper. Often paired with a crusader mindset, there usually are a lot of comparisons between this Lily and Hermione.

- *The Dark Lady* - This Lily is not actually evil... but she is amoral and ruthless when it comes to things she holds as the most important... and that's almost always Harry. This Lily would do anything, sacrifice anything, go down the darkest roads, all for the sake of Harry's survival.

These characterizations, combined with the claim that Lily is the smartest witch of her generation, covers just about every version of Lily I've ever seen. Some fanfiction, like Renegade for example, combines elements of two archetypes(ferocious temper with ruthlessness and a lack of mercy).

Which do you prefer(mine is the Dark Lady)? Have you found an archetype that's different than these three?


** These archetypes are actually what turns me off Marauders era fic. /So many/ of them rely on the fanon archetypes to pull the weight of the characterization - not just Lily, but James, Sirius, and such. No one comes off sounding like teens. Maybe it's just the fics I've encountered, but the era seems more caricatured than others? Like the few things we see from that era in canon are totally exaggerated in fic, probably because there's so little to work with.

I really like girllikecupcake's ideal Lily; that falls in line with how I'd imagine Lily, too.

** I think of the three I prefer wildcat, but even so that makes her often seem like a ticking bomb. I don't like the first one, because I don't see why James would be romantically interested in her (very different personality types, "perfect is boring"), and I don't think I've ever run into the third type.

To not clog up top-level, I'm gonna reply to this with how I see Lily, having read fics involving her for over a decade :)

*** I prefer the hard working, loyal, fiercely independent, /funny/ Lily who happens to have a temper. I've read a few of them.

I don't like her being all "super crazy smart," I like her actually working for it. Some I've come across have her struggle a bit in transfiguration (generally a plot device because obv. James is good in it), have a natural skill in charms, and a good understanding in potions partly due to Snape helping her get it early on and providing a good foundation. She'd have no outstanding skill in the others, just the drive to do well. Lily worked for her grades, her scores, her place in that world.

I love when she's loyal. She'll do whatever she has to for the people she cares about. Her close friends, her family, hell her school. It might come out as recklessness, rushing out wand-first when [place] is attacked, but she's a Gryffindor and she's doing what she thinks is right.

I don't like the simpering clingy Lily. The one who suddenly in 7th year absolutely needs James or she won't survive. I hate that Lily, because it goes against who she is and the spirit of the time. Lily doesn't /need/ a partner in order to be strong. She can get things done on her own if she wants. She won't turn down help that's offered when it's needed, but she might not ask for it.

Lily is funny. There's no way around this. James had to be interested in her for more than her looks or possible unattainability. This would also come into play with having a good enough sense of humor to appreciate James' goofiness (when it's not harmful, at least). I think if pranked, instead of being mean and screaming, she'd plot something in return.

She does have a temper, though. But what seventeen year old girl doesn't? It's not the kind of temper where she's yelling at everything that breathes, but it is the kind where if you piss her off, you're going to know immediately. I love the trope of "magic sparking hair when angry" to depict this. She doesn't even have to /do/ anything, but it's seen. Add in a secret sailor mouth for fun.

*** JKR seems to like the idea of playing with very different personality types, though. Ron/Hermione, Arthur/Molly, Remus/Tonks, and even James/Lily are, from what we know of canon, the poster-children of "opposites attract". In fact, I'd say Harry/Ginny and possibly Bill/Fleur are the only major canon relationships that don't follow the opposites attract trope.

**** That's certainly true, it could be a part of why I don't like the idea of 'saint' actually fitting for Lily that I hadn't noticed. Though I like to think that Tonks is somewhat similar to Remus when he was younger. I don't buy into the fanon idea that he was /all/ books and quiet and passive rules.

Do we know enough about Arthur and Molly outside of them raising kids to know they're personality opposites?

*** i can definitely see james having a crush on her just because she was pretty, though. he was doodling her initials before actually knowing her, when she'd expressed mostly disdain towards him and sirius.

**** Having a crush and wanting to seriously marry her aren't the same thing. He could absolutely have a crush on the pretty red head, but I think she'd have to have more than that.

*** Have you read linkffn(Firebird's Son) and sequels? They are AU and definitely tend towards grimdark, but the Lily there is pretty ruthless.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
