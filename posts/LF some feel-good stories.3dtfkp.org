I've recently enjoyed TheEndless7's Letters, butalearner's Curse of Truth, and even longer stories like the Alexandra Quick series. I'm not particularly interested in heavily political/dark stories, just nice fuzzy oneshots or something that's really immersive. I know I'm being a little vague here, but any recommendations are appreciated. Thanks!


** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=168043][Celestie]] is one of my favorite authors for feel-good slice-of-life type stories. Her fluff is never saccharine and doesn't ignore tough topics as they come up, like the war, and the story feel substantial even though they're just about the everyday. As long as the story isn't marked with dark/horror, it'll likely fit your criteria (her angst stories are fairly light).

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305538][Amaranthine]] and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]] are stories I rec here often, the former is a James/Lily and the latter is an ensemble next gen Weasley family short story. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=334471][Hunter's Moon]] is her new Marauders era that I literally /just/ read, and it's silly and wonderful. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=331194][The Enemy of My Enemy]] is a riff on the female Marauders trope, which is my next to-read. She writes all genres and eras, so you'll probably find something to your taste.

I know a ton of feel-good stories, so if you want to be a little more specific, I might be able to provide more links :)

** At first I thought I had just the favorites list for this. Now I'm not so sure. (If you /wanted/ H/Hr I think I might have been right in the first place.)

  Hermione is sad that her parents can't relate to her magical life, so Harry learns how to use a muggle camera to take photos that she can mail to them with her letters. Using her as a model, however, makes him realize how beautiful she really is.

*** Okay, my edits have tormented the bot needlessly. Let's see if I can fix this. ffnbot!parent

EDIT: Okay then. Now I can ... remove the links? Sure. Why not. As long as the bot's reply is still there.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

  This is for the I Never Challenge. A very evil challenge devised by a doubly evil genius; the challenge was to write a story that I would never write, with a pairing I'd never pair.

  Trelawney never made the prophecy, Voldemort was never defeated on Halloween of 1981, Britain has fallen into darkness, and Harry Potter is just another no-name soldier trying to smuggle a certain Muggleborn witch out of Death Eater territory
