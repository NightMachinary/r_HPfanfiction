I always hear people talking about how hot draco is (same for snape?) but I really don't see the appeal. I think it is more a thing for tom felton/alan rickman which makes some sort of sense, they are quite attractive out of costume, but how they look in the movies just doesn't do it for me. Draco in the movies really does look like a ferret, and snape looks frumpy


** I'm a heterosexual male so I wouldn't know, but I think people's attraction to Rickman was more because of his voice rather than his looks in the HP movies.

While I'm not really attracted to guys generally, I think the only one that came even remotely close to getting my attention in that sense in the movies as a teenager was Cedric.

****** No- as an American, who has never been a fan girl- and in general does not get google eyes over attractive celebrities, Alan Rickman is/ or was the exception. He has always been my hall pass ( I'm 40, and I have liked him since I was in my teens) and it's not because he's a Brit- although the accent and the voice don't hurt. It's also his commanding presence and his ability to transform himself completely for all his roles. As far as looks go, his aquiline Roman profile and big smile were as attractive as it gets for me. Not to mention, from every account- he was a genuinely good man, who only loved one woman his whole life.

*** People love redemption stories. Personally, I find fanfic versions of Draco quite compelling. I like AUs where the author interrogates ripple effects from minor changes (e.g., in linkao3(stealing harry by copperbadge), Lucius goes to Azkaban for being a Death Eater when Draco is a baby, so he grows up domineered by his mother and terrified of his father). I also love fics where Draco reckons with his past and legitimately untangles his guilt and complicity in helping Wizard Hitler.

I wish that slash in HP featured more of the good characters, both Neville and Ron are plenty interesting and I think get overall more development than Draco. Poor Ron got shafted by the movies though and Neville being chubby and a bit cowardly earlier on also means nobody writes for him.

** I think it's mostly because of Tom Felton that people think he is hot. Also, looking from an outsider's perspective (although I doubt most fanfic writers go that far), he is the popular preppy kid who bullies the group of weirdos (the weird kid, the poor kid and the nerd). His only disadvantage is that the weird kid is more famous and more talented than him. Still he manages to get an entire school to bully Harry prior to the First Task with the 'Potter stinks' badges and to bully Ron with the 'Weasley is our king' song. So most likely he had a certain appeal with his peers before his family falling in disgrace with both sides.

** I don't believe Draco has ever been described as "hot" in the books. Much of such description may thus well be credited to Tom Felton, but ... the character of Draco came from a longtime pureblood family with tons of money so - he probably knew how to behave himself (outside of when Harry was observing him), and to both dress and act the part. That may have gained him some extra points of perceived "hotness" amongst his peers. Not to mention that he was a seeker for the Slytherin Quidditch team, so ... "a jock" (?) perhaps gaining some extra momentum his perceived "hotness".

On the other hand, Snape ... well, we all know that Alan Rickman was way too old to portray the character canonically speaking. Also, the character of Snape has been described as somewhat unappealing in the books; "thin", "greasy", "sallow", etc. and coming from a poor background ... on any school I've attended, any of those qualifications don't bring you on the top of the "hot"-list :D

** Interesting stuff:

According to this [[https://snape-sanity.livejournal.com/1621.html][post,]] book Snape was a thin pale man who had sallow, oily skin, greasy, shoulder-length black hair that hung in curtains around his face, cold, black eyes that reminded you of tunnels, uneven, yellowish teeth, and a very large hooked nose.

Book Draco is almost like a blank slate. He is described as /"a pale boy with a pointed face and white-blond hair,"/ who /"greatly resembled his father,"/ which tells us nothing about his attractiveness. Disappointingly, Lucius is described as someone who /"could only be Draco's father. He had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes."/

Narcissa was described as /"blonde too; tall and slim, she would have been nice-looking if she hadn't been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose."/

I only skimmed through COS and GOF to find the Malfoys' descriptions. I can't remember how they were described in the other books.

** I think Narcissa is the only Slytherin in the series described as good looking (or at least would be if she didn't have a disgusted look on her face), and Bellatrix as having the vestiges of good looks that have been ravaged by Azkaban.

It's important to remember that the books are from Harry's perspective. He has no issue noting when people he likes, or at least is neutral towards, are conventionally good looking, but he hates the Slytherins and that likely makes even the best looking ones faintly hideous to him. The exception is young Tom, but he does not know that Tom Riddle is Voldemort when he first encounters him, and so is able to see/acknowledge his handsome appearance.

I think we can deduce from context clues that Draco and Pansy are generally good looking... obviously not Veela-level gorgeous, but they're the most popular in their houses and seem to be able to induce the rest of the school to go along with their anti-Harry/Gryffindor sentiments from time to time. Harry (and JKR) just hate them both (Pansy especially), so they never get a fair description. I think it highly unlikely that a mean, popular girl modeled after the girls that used to harass and bully the author was, in reality, a hideous pug-faced cretin.

Snape, on the other hand, is described in detail and is flat out weird looking/unattractive. No argument there. People just love Alan Rickman.

I suspect Pansy's popularity is a combination of wealth (her and Draco are close) and being part of the sacred 28. There's quite possibly not many sacred 28 teenaged girls of her age group.

As much as I HATE to say it, I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out Daphne Greengrass was attractive simply because Harry never finds anything to complain about her.

As for Scared 28 girls in her age group... there are at least 3 others in her year alone (Millicent Bulstrode, Daphne Greengrass, Hannah Abbott) and Harry has almost no awareness of anyone outside his year (except another girl from the Sacred 28-- Ginny!) so I don't think that distinction alone would account for Pansy's popularity.

I reckon Pansy is popular, even if she's not all that attractive. Although there's also the possibility that Harry notices him because he quite quickly becomes obsessed with Malfoy.

It's possible that Daphne is attractive and so he never sees reason to bring her up or - yes, maybe she is the dullest of the dull. I've never been keen on the 'ice queen' thing. I've always imagined she just keeps a low profile.

Edit: As for Ginny, Draco considers her a 'blood traitor' whereas Hannah is a half-blood. Millicent... doesn't fit with Harry's view on pretty men.

I agree that the Blacks quite likely do have some degree of similarity in looks. Especially with how inbred certain circles are.

That said: Allan Rickman's voice sounded like dark coffee or chocolate and all other things sinfully delicious. Appearance wise, though? No. Character, no.

** Like someone here said earlier - it really is entirely subjective, isn't it? Draco is very much not to my taste, while Snape I find really attractive, he is so charismatic in the movies thanks to Alan, and it's not just his voice either (although it does play a great part in the appeal) - he just exudes charisma and his signature snarkiness, which a lot of people have a thing for. That's why we have fanfiction - we can explore characters we are interested in and focus on their stories, and if some people want to see more of Draco and find him attractive - way to go for them; if some fanfiction exists, it means it has an appeal at least for someone, so I guess live and let live.

**** The [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c6p4xj/hp_fanfiction_subreddit_survey_2019][survey results]] from last year show that this sub is 60% male. My guess is this is because its reddit which is already male dominated.

The other reason I would think has to do with what type of content is upvoted and downvoted. In HP fanfiction slash and fics about characters like Draco and Snape are extremely popular. On this sub even asking for a recommendation for slash or anything involving those two is likely to get you downvoted. It's quite hostile to anything that many users here dislike. Since I would guess that women are more likely to read slash or read redemption or romance fics with controversial characters like Snape they are much more likely to leave this sub.

I like reading fics about Snape and the constant discussions on here how he is the worst person ever get tiring. I can imagine for anyone who likes slash as well this sub is just not a good place to be at.

****** I agree with you. I got to the point that finding out an author was male was a brownie point for his fanfic. I'm female, but there is some limit to my teenage-girl-crushing-on-the-bad-boy tolerance (or crushes in general?) Maybe it has to do with my age or how annoying I found those vapid teenage years even when I was one. What I don't know, is why Harry Potter ff reddit is so male dominated.. Maybe girls prefer other forums?

And I think Snape's attractive is the potential for saving. He can be saved (as shown by Dumbles.. Maybe) and that triggers us wanting to be the saviour and special someone that helps him become his best version. The other thing is that as an adult reader, being attracted to a teenage boy is slightly disturbing and Snape is more age appropriate.. And his voice (at least Alan Rickman's) is very attractive.

******** To be clear that is assuming a majority of fanfiction community members partake in the survey, which isnt the case. It is likely, that the most prevalent members are male, as they persist more vocally. Honestly, labeling a thing in a community based on the gender of some of its members seems stupid to me empirically. There is no way of saying how many members are a gender definitively, nor is there a way to tie those members to an act that maybe their fault without them admitting it.

TLDR:dont be sad, the survey results cant tell the whole picture and it doesnt matter if its male or female dominated anyway.

** I would say a huge part of it is because Draco and Snape (but especially Draco) both work in narratives that many girls grow up being told are romantic. Many movie and book tropes are actually incredibly toxic, namely towards young women, and involve a man controlling a woman for her to be happy, a woman plays hard to get until the right man breaks down her walls by ignoring her boundaries, or a woman “saving” a man who's only willing to change for her. They're incredibly toxic, but many of us still find ourselves drawn to them. Look at Sweet Home Alabama, any movie where Harrison Ford is the male love interest, 50 First Dates, etc- Draco and Snape can each work in their own ways as a guy who's “assertive,” possessive, and doesn't back down when being told no. In a lot of ways they have the most “romantic” personalities.

Then you add on that Draco is in many ways conventionally attractive to a western audience in the little we do know about him- blonde and pale (and I believe tall too?) with enough left out that we can fill in the blanks and- ta da. Perfect fan fiction fodder.

Snape, meanwhile, if you nitpick his description is a tall man with long black hair- very easy to be a bad boy love interest for someone who listens to too much My Chemical Romance (guilty as charged, though I hate Snape).
