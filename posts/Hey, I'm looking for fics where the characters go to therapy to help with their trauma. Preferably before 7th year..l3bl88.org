** - “Inner Demons by serendipity_50” linkao3(601124) has been written by somebody who seems to have some idea what psychotherapy is all about. It is all about the post-War PTSD for Ginny and Harry. It is always the first one, which remains in heart forever, and this was the story which persuaded me that amateur written stories may be worthy of reading.
- “Daphne Greengrass and the 6th Year From Hell and Daphne Greengrass and the 7th Year From Hell by WhiskeyTangoFoxtrot” linkffn(3912184;4236594) have a side-story with Ron dealing with his wounds from the Department of Mysteries ... those brains were surely not that innocent as they thought they were.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.
