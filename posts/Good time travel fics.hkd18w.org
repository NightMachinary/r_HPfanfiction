I'm looking for any good fics where one of the characters go back in the past and try to change things.

An example is there an back again, by chuchi otaku on FanFiction.Net

Thank you!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment]] is an incredibly unique time travel story, and my favorite fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/28/Circular-Reasoning][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning]] - good and fairly popular time travel story. Action based.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/7/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love]] - humor time travel story for a change

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home]] - excellent time travel story.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7062230/1/][https://fanfiction.net/s/7062230/1/]] - good time travel one-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4726291/1/]] - dark time travel one-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4080247/7/Lost-Time][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4080247/1/Lost-Time]] - travel to the future (not exactly what you asked for)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4198643/13/Timely-Errors][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4198643/1/Timely-Errors]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here]] is a popular time travel story which has spawned many copies. I don't think it's good but it is often recommended.

** If you are looking for fics that feature time travelers changing things fast and effectively, check these out:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): 20 years old Hermione goes back to her 2 years old self, tells everything to Dumbledore the next day, who then takes things from there. It's my poster fic for how Peggy Sue time travels should be done.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry is thrown back to 1975 and has to team up with Bellatrix. This fic is interesting in that Harry possesses only *incomplete* information. He partly improved things before suffering another magic accident. This new Bellatrix is a delight to read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8669569/1/][Don't Waste It]], linkffn(8669569): Perhaps the only Wormtail time travel. He defeats Voldemort in a way true to his character, but very efficiently.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/][Ginny's Return]], linkffn(4740107): Perhaps the only completed Ginny time travel. This fic assumes manipulative!Dumbledore so she has to do things herself. It takes a little longer than "A Little Child", but she completes primary mission still very efficiently and painlessly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717): A unique Hermione time travel narrated from James Potter's POV, and she's not paired with anyone.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): Very powerful postwar Harry gets thrown back to his 11 years old self, and promptly neutralizes Voldemort even before arriving at Hogwarts. But as the summary says, he will kill them all over again, and without getting other kids involved. This fic is more about him fitting into this new reality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan travel back 25 years to their 8 years selves, kill most of the bad guys before even returning to Hogwarts. But they couldn't quite get Snape and Karkaroff...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455): Perhaps the only fic in which a time traveling Hermione kills Tom Riddle in his orphanage, instead of raising or shagging him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4487319/1/][The Greatest Minister of Magic]], linkffn(4487319): Cornelius Fudge gets another chance. Very in character.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4061219/1/][The Time Meddlers]], linkffn(4061219): This fic is interesting in that they create a new villain after dispatching Voldemort relatively quickly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516): Powerful Trio Peggy Sue time travel. They solves the Voldemort problem by Halloween 1991, adding to drama is a 5 days old Rose.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more.

** Aww, no one is mentioning Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past? It's not on FFN anymore, and hasn't been completed (nor abandoned!), but it does a really good job of balancing foreknowledge with the butterfly effect, and it avoids having an overpowered Harry by focusing on his friends and how he tries to build them up and prepare them.

** Willing time travel, or accident? Does universe hopping count? I'll assume it does.

*That Universe Over There* - linkao3(23702959)\\
Harry touched something in the DoM he wasn't supposed to and finds himself on top of a certain school. He notices a little girl there with him. Yoink. Spoilers: That girl is that universe's analogue of him.

Harry is the MoD, is forced to take up the Peverell Lordship, has a vault filled with money, and the Goblins /want/ to help him. But does he use this? Hell no, he's anti-social, and the Goblins grin all the time which frankly scares him.

Ivy (Girl Harry) is an experience of itself. She's like Fred and George, the Marauders, Hagrid, Charlie, Bill, and Hufflepuff rendered down into one person. And dosed with cocaine. She turns Hogwarts on its head. And may or may not have a Hufflepuff Army.

*Double Back* - linkao3(19267840)\\
After an accident, Harry wakes up in the past. After about a week of moping around, he decides to change things and apparates to Privet Drive and punches Vernon in the face. Yoink. Also, he parades around as James Potter.

There's Polygamy, but that's more of the political and pureblood side of things. One is for love, and the other is for politics and line continuation.

  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Changing time is difficult though, and the more changes he makes, the less predictable the world turns out to be. Though now maybe he actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well.

** Kinda Roundabout Destiny by MaryRoyale but it's more like AU where Hermione is James Potters sister... but like it makes sense. Also gosh I've been reading so many Hermione-goes-back-in-time fanfics that I get them all mixed up, but I'm pretty darn sure I'm thinking of The Last Marauder by Resa Aureus. Dumbledore charges Hermione to go back in time and break Peter from the group and also fix some other stuff. (I just remember absolutely falling in love with it)
