** You could have it so that Snape survives Voldemort in the shack, but still dies in the Hogwarts battle, either by sacrificing himself or being got by a cheap shot once the battle is over by a defeated DE, so you can still have him and the Slytherin's fighting but still have an impactful and sad death.

** It is story dependent, but from what you've given, it looks as though /this/ story is best served by having him die, and there's another story you've yet to write, with a different beginning and middle, in which he survives the shrieking shack, where the whole story is written to support that.

I mean, you can actually, in the second story, just jump to his surviving and go from there, filling in as you need to.

** Nagini bites snape, but is driven off before he can be killed.

Snape survives in there, but will likely not survive beyond a few hours. So we get the defending from Voldemort as he drags himself onto the field. And then we get the touching moment as he succumbs to Nagini's poison.
