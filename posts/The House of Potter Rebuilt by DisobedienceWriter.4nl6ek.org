Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/3/The-House-of-Potter-Rebuilt]])

A work inprogress. A more proactive Harry from the beginning.


** Just finished the first chapter. The writing structure is fine although it is very brief. A whole year covered in a single chapter is quite a lot to cover and it suffers for this.

Because it is so rushed in its pacing there is a whole lot of telling and not much showing which doesn't sit well with me.

The end of year climax also comes out of nowhere and there is no weight to the drama because of the above issues. I didn't have time to start caring about anyone.

For all it's rushing nothing seems to happen. Harry just reads books for most of his scenes.

** Hm. I'm usually very wary of fics where Harry shows Hermione "the truth". Him giving her a "real" Hogwarts: A History that he found in the library and then tracked down... just rubs me the wrong way.

*** That's actually kinda funny, because a part of me enjoys those. But then again, that's probably due to the fact that I knew a Hermione/Hermione-like person and we absolutely despise each other, and I may be enjoying her suffering vicariously through a fictional character.

I have rarely claimed to be a good person.

** I wanted to like it, but... it's very odd. I can't really express why, either.

*** That's a pretty good description of all of his (her?) works. I think that just might be DisobedienceWriter's style. I haven't read this one yet (going to wait for it to get longer), but I do kinda dig the other stuff they've wrote.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

** Welp, broke down and read this. This work is clearly a continuation/refinement of ideas that were present/proposed in his other piece that I've read often enough to remember clearly linkffn(Knowledge is Useful, But Power is Power). The way the Ministry tries to lower the skill of the average witch and wizard, the importance of keeping secrets, and so forth. It also keeps the "kill Dumbledore early" thing, but I don't like what s/he has done with this Dumbledore, in making him a clear bungler. The Flamels are quite interesting, and I'm sad to see them go.

All in all, I look forward to seeing where this is going.

  Harry and Hermione are gifted a handwritten book at the beginning of Fourth Year. A book that reveals horrible truths about the world they live in. Prepare for a tougher Harry and a battle focused on the Ministry.

*** He already deviated a good amount from canon plot, esp in 3rd year, so I suspect 4th will continue to do so.

*** Seems to be that it will be more "get someone in to acquire the parts from Harry needed to resurrect Voldemort" than "sneak Harry out." My guess? The medallion is going to be very, very important.
