** linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff) very much does her own thing. She befriends Hermione, but is rather distant from Harry and Ron (who don't really become Hermione's friends as a result). Plenty of laughs and hi-jinks, very little of canon. Occasionally updating.

*** Curious, if Hermione never becomes friends with Harry and Ron, how does the author handle Harry surviving to the end of the year without the part she played in events? Cause to be honest, if Hermione is off doing her own thing and not getting involved in the plot, Harry would either have to smarten up fast and start taking learning magic seriously or I don't see him making it through to the final battle with only Ron for support.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.

This is like deamus fic, except Seamus is a trans male character and it is all 7 years summed up.

Not too long (50,000ish), shows development of their characters a small bit of trio bashing not much (it's a side comment but still).

Really good easy read, sweet and I love seamus' character and his friendship with lavender and pavarti. Bit of transphobia towards seamus. Worth reading. :)
