So. Kim Possible! Harry Potter.

I was wondering about Ron Weasley and Ron Stoppable switching places with each other. I'd love to see Kim in a relationship with Ron Weasley at the same time as Hermione with Ron Stoppable. You could (easily) convince me to look into some StoppableWeasley as well.

Basically, I think the shared names are a gift too great to ignore. Are you aware of any fanfic that capitalizes on this coincidence?


** I vaguely remember seeing a crackfic somewhere where Ron Weasley ragequit Hogwarts or something and went on to become Ron Stoppable.

It might have been a throwaway line or an omake somewhere, because it wasn't more detailed than that.

** I read one where Kim and Ron show up at the castle and the two Rons bond over food. It was pretty funny. It's been SO long I dunno what it's name was but they go to the kitchen to make what I assumed was some sort of signature food from Kim Possible.

** Not to criticise but I just have to say that this subreddit never ceases to amaze me. I hope someone can help you but I've never seen this crossover.
