I see this all the time, voldemort destroyed via airstrike, missile or the like, or a muggleborn/muggleraised character raving about the bombs the muggles are capable of deploying.

And I think- what? Wizards, whose life expectancy is 150, don't know what a bomb is? Voldemort, who lived through the London Blitz, doesn't have defenses against them? The second World War ended with two nuclear strikes, and the cold war was even more pervasive.

Wizards would have developed defenses against normal bombs after the Blitz, because Diagon Alley is smack in the middle of London and would've been hit. After Nagasaki and Hiroshima, they'd have studied Nukes and Radiation, and also developed defenses against them. I very much doubt that wizards are clueless.

Not to mention, you can't bomb a target if you can't find it, which is exactly what the Unplottable Charm does.

Add to that Firearms, btw. Muskets have been around a really fucking long time, and I very much doubt that a normal shield charm capable of blocking pretty much anything short of special counters would be bypassed by a bullet.

I really hate this trope, because it's so fucking dumb, and usually an indicator of either "military cool" or "wizards dumb" fic.


** I find it's usually all part of the larger muggle wank that people seem to like. And there is certainly some validity to certain muggle things being superior (phones are objectively better than owl post, the same way they're better than pigeon post), or more creative (I mean the internet is pretty impressive). But I personally don't get it, I'm not reading Harry Potter fanfiction to read about people shooting each other, I'm reading about it for the magic and the characters. If I want to read about the miracles of tech, I'll read sci-fi.

I do wonder how much of it is because guns can be a large part of life for some people, but seeing as I live in a largely gun free country (and the UK is also largely gun free), I just don't see a whole lot of point.

Voldemort would absolutely know about muggle weaponry for the very reasons you mention. I think it's actually a rather interesting part of his character that isn't explored. He lived through a muggle war. He saw muggles inventing new ways to kill each other. He was sent back to the orphanage without being able to legally perform magic to protect himself if his home was attacked. It's not really that hard to see how it feeds into his mentally of muggles being something to despise. A lot of hate is born of fear, and he had plenty to fear from muggles in his life.

*** It's because of how absolutely clueless wizards seem to be about the muggle world. The most exposition we get to that is through Arthur Weasley, who seems to be as close to a Muggle expert/enthusiast as we see in the magical world - and he appears super clueless to the realities of modern muggle life and capabilities.

Then, logically, it seems to make sense that Wizarding society (if we're taking their canon attitude into consideration) split off from the muggle one a few centuries back - the Statute of Secrecy providing a convenient point there. It's a fairly easy take to make that the Muggle capabilities since then have gone somewhat unrecognized - the most advanced muggle-like technologies we see them accepting since then seem to be trains and cars.

So with a magical world that doesn't know much about a muggle one, weapons seem like they could be a blind spot. Where one falls on the magic vs technology scale of power will depend on the reader and their mind - anywhere from 'magic is far stronger without any changes' to 'magic is worse in an upfront fight'. I personally fall under the idea that magic could be adapted to match/fight well against guns/weaponry, but that it would require a fairly sizable change in tactics - and, of course, that wizards tend to focus on fighting other wizards/magic.

For Voldemort specifically, the case is that he's a wizard supremacist - along with the other purebloods. Imagining that he'd overlook 'weak muggle technology' as inferior to magic seems quite fitting with his canon portrayal - though you're right that a smarter/more competent version of him would not be so.

Anybody who spent even a few months in the muggle world or in contact with a muggle would know more than Arthur, and we know half-bloods are prevalent and likely increasingly common. Any muggleborn will obviously blow his knowledge out of the water. His position as a muggle expert in the Ministry isn't evidence that wizards as a rule know nothing about muggles, it's evidence that the Ministry is astoundingly bigoted and he got his job because he's a pureblood.

***** I agree re: ministry bigotry.

At the world cup its suggested that during Hogwarts years, young people are more in touch with muggle fashion and essentially implied that even half-bloods or perhaps even muggleborns fall out of contact as they age. (I suppose they've got no qualifications for the muggle world, not everyone could accurately make fake documents, references, etc and - let's face it - the ministry is extremely unlikely to have a 'helping muggleborn returnees' department.)

I think the film versions of the uniforms caused this to be lost to most people (fics tend to bias towards the film uniforms and people outside fandom aren't that invested). In particular, the books give nothing to suggest that trousers are part of the uniform - it's not on Harry's list and the robes can't be open fronted because when Snape is turns upside down his pants (UK) are seen by all.

I'm not sure why people like to generalize wizards as though they're some hivemind, especially based on, what, just the Weasleys and maybe one or two other ignorant wizards? There are plenty of examples showing wizards aren't "absolutely clueless" about the muggle world.

- Draco Malfoy knows about helicopters at eleven years old.

- Hagrid and Arthur Weasley know about guns, which have been around for centuries, so it's likely the average wizard at least has some idea of what they are.

- There is a steady influx of Muggle-borns coming into the wizarding world, who would spread their knowledge.

- The majority of the population is Half-blood and Muggle-born, which means most wizards have a connection to the Muggle world.

- Bombs have existed for a thousand years, and the World Wars leveled cities. Wizards would have noticed this.

- Kingsley Shacklebolt, a Pure-blood, works for several months under the Prime Minister blends in so well with Muggles that no one notices a thing, including the Prime Minister who knows about magic.

- The Ministry of Magic has a whole department dedicated to dealing with the Muggle world (Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee). The visitor entrance is also a phone booth.

- Their use of muggle vehicles (cars, trains, buses, etc)

**** There's a very real possibility that Arthur Weasley was the only person really interested in the job, or at the very least was the least likely to abuse it in malicious ways. I certainly can't recall anyone else in the books interested in 'Muggle stuff' to the degree Arthur is. Could be any number of things really. The books take place from Harry's perspective, and there's a great many things he's ignorant of, as they just don't fall into his orbit of interests.

And Arthur is fairly talented in his niche of interests. He did enchant a car to fly, turn invisible, and gain a degree of semi sentience after all, even as ignorant of the whole as he may have been. To compare the man to Fudge, who hides his head in the sand and actively sabotages any potential allies, especially one as potent as Albus Dumbledore, is a bit unfair.

***** Arthur is the Head of the " Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office", which is (from what we see in OotP) a tiny office with 2 members.\\
It's not that great of the job, not the lowest of the ladder, but not far from it. As for Arthur competency, I don't see any raison to put it into doubt. His job consist into :

- Identify enchanted Muggle artifact
- Confiscate it if it's considered illegal
- Potentially arrest/ give a fine to the culprit (or maybe he doesn't even do this part and it's the police, canon not really clear on that point).
- Obliviate any Muggle in accord with the Treaty of Secrecy (once again, maybe another office does this)

At no point during his job does Arthur need to know "how" muggle things work. He only have to know if the item is enchanted (which seem a skill more likely to be learnt in Charm than in Muggle Study). He doesn't even need to be able to mingle with Muggles, since anyone he interacts with is either "in the known" (like a Muggleborn parent), or will have no memory of it.

Also, he is not "the" expert of all things muggle, if you want one, you better look for a Muggle Studies teacher, or the one who wrote the books they use.

And finally, before CoS and Harry, the closest link between Arthur and Dumbledore was the fact that his 2 brothers in law were in the Order (he and Molly were not),pretty weak reason to do a favor. So I can think of a lot of reasons about why Arthur got this job other than /Dumbledore pulled some strings/.

- Not a lot of people wanted this job (since it's not that great), and from the one wanting it, Arthur truly was the best (the ministry prefering someone good at charm rather than someone knowing everything about muggles)
- The Muggleborn who were in this office were killed during the last war, and he got promoted by virtue of being alive.

***** That not quite right. He's the Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts. Based on the title all he needs to know is what a 'Muggle Artifact' is and have it confiscated if necessary. It's a literal impossibility for one man to know the whole and breath of an entire world, let alone one he doesn't actually live in, and even more so with a family as large as his to support. I don't think there's a person alive who can.

It's possible Dumbledore did pull some strings for him, we don't know. It's possible the man's a tour de force on the clock and we just haven't seen it because Harry hasn't seen it. Any speculation on the subject is just that, as it's not in the books or confirmed via Pottermore or JK herself. I will say though that if Albus did do such a thing I doubt Arthur knew about it.

The fact that bombings are never mentioned by anti-muggles in the books sort of implies that they don't believe it to be that big of a deal for them, or they don't care what the muggles do to each other. Or it may have been that the bombs never hit a wizarding area.

** If you do any historical research on explosives and firearms and then correlate the timelines with the Statute of Secrecy, it becomes obvious that wizards aren't ignorant of them due to segregation from muggles. Bombs and guns pre-existed the Statute and were not only very effective but were also commonplace. This means that wizards of the time wouldn't have seen them as a "muggle thing" anymore than they saw wheels, shoes, hats, or swords as exclusively muggle things. My thought is that they really didn't start distinguishing muggle innovations as distinct from their own until the industrial revolution, or possibly even the second industrial revolution.

Their contempt for firearms and bombs then is likely due to the fact that they see them as obsolete. Magic is fully capable of conjuring bullets and accelerating them, and without any issues of running out of ammo. It is also fully capable of conjuring an explosion without any need of lugging around heavy and dangerous equipment.

In fact, it's likely that wizards possessed spells that were upgrades of greek fire and slings thousands of years ago. And then developed defenses against them. Which is why they don't use them anymore --- they already figured out basic defenses against them that are so effective that they moved on to other means of attack.

I mean, logically, if wizards were vulnerable to bullets, they wouldn't be getting machine guns /instead/ of their wands. I always roll my eyes when I see people say that they should carry a gun in their off hand. Why? Their wand /is/ a gun. But they don't use it to expel projectiles because evidently that's an inferior strategy.

My theory is that wizards just have enchantments on them that vanish anything that flies at them faster than 50 m/s, among others. That covers everything from arrows up. There's magical workarounds of course, but muggle attacks would be simply ignored. Same with bombs. Maybe wizards are immune to non-magical fire (flame-freezing charms always annoyed me as a particularly silly defense against burning at the stake anyway).

I've gone into this direction of exploration in a great deal more detail [[http://brilliantshard.wordpress.com][in my own AU]], but that's some of the pertinent thoughts to this discussion anyway.

** I mean, I entirely agree with you on that, or at the very least that the Wizards in important spots would have to keep up with that sort of thing. If there's a Wizard who maintains the protective magics on Diagon Alley, for example, they'd have to know that bombs were a thing and how to cast the magic that protected against them. There are arguments against that, though.

For everyone else for whom the information isn't immediately relevant, I can kind of understand why they might not go beyond 'bombs are the boomy things, right?'. If you don't use that information, why would you bother learning it? Bombs haven't fallen on England in forty years, so it's not an active need to protect against them. Hell, it could just be that some paper-pusher in the Ministry thought "It's been forty years since those dastardly Muggles did the bomb thing, surely we can cut the budget for those bomb protections and spend it on something important like Quidditch". And if you doubt that might happen, would a government that supposedly (not sure if this is fanon or canon) cut their police forces drastically over the ten peace years since Voldemort 'died' bother spending money on protections that hadn't been needed for three or four times as long?

If the information isn't useful or used somehow, it'd be left in a book somewhere for later reference and forgotten about across the decades since 1945. Especially if you're one of those people that are convinced that the Muggles are merely animals, you're not going to bother learning about it. The young magicals who can barely be bothered to learn magic certainly wouldn't.

Take Occlumency, for example. Wizards know that there are people around who can literally read their minds. Every thought, feeling, memory, etc, can all be seen by these people. Yet, it's not a mandatory class and we're only told of two or three (IIRC) people in the series that know about it. If it's safe 99% of the time, Wizards don't seem to really put in the effort to prepare for that 1% chance of FUBAR. There are other examples of that "Eh. It'll be aight." mindset around the series, but it is a pretty British mindset of not really giving too much of a fuck. We're a very tired, laissez-faire people.

Secondly, sure the older Wizards would at least know that bombs exist and have experience of being around them, but knowing that a thing is a thing doesn't necessarily mean you know anything about a thing. For instance, I'm a twenty-something Western kid with easy access to google, libraries, and a dozen ways of acquiring information on 'Muggle society' that Wizards wouldn't necessarily have without some moderate effort - I know what a bomb is and I have a vague (emphasis on vague) conception of how it works, but I couldn't for the life of me tell you how to protect against one or even how to put one together.

I agree it's more than likely utter Mugglewank bollocks, but there are some possible explanations for it. A good fic can make anything work and all that. :)

But I feel like the reason Arthur's knowledge is lacking is because he is sort of like a Weeb.

** It's easy to think Wizards are ignorant of a lot of muggle weaponry and warfare because the purebloods we know of don't display a lot of familiarity with the muggle world or inclination to learn about it, if not outright disdain for it. Voldemort most assuredly knows about WW2 and the Blitz, having lived in both worlds at the time, but I imagine for a lot of people at the time had an "out of sight, out of mind" mentality.

People in general just don't care about wars on distant shores, wars they can't see or feel the effects of, and magic is very good at getting people to ignore things, I think. It's entirely possible that the magic that shields Diagon Alley from muggle sight and access protects it from muggle attacks as well, and if that were the case, why would they care about muggles killing each other?

** I'm usually ok with "They don't know what an atomic bomb is". They are not demonstrated often, you learn about it in a decent history class, usually well above the age that the worlds split off in. It is entirely reasonable for wizards not to know about atomics (or disbelieve them).

​

Bombs in general? not so much. Wizards would know about explosions (as they can be magically caused). Hell, they use muggle explosions to hide magical incidents.

​

The one that really gets me? Fannon wizards always have no clue about the man on the moon. Rockets are not so rare that you would never observe one, and several times in very recent history a good chunk of the worlds attention has been toward space endeavors.

The idea that wizards wouldn't know the word bomb or what they are is utterly ridiculous. Most wizards are half-bloods, there's a steady influx of muggle-borns, and bombs have been around for about a thousand years.

** I do believe that wizards (at least older ones) have some basic understanding of bombs and muskets, but don't you think that during the reign of Voldemort, there would have been some censorship. As opposed to Grindelwald, who just believed in wizard-superiority and did think that Muggles were capable (foreseeing WW1) and really thought they were a threat, Voldemort believed that they were insignificant and had no power. Because of this, even if he knew of the power they possessed, he most likely encouraged Wizarding Society to think of them that way too; as less powerful and insignificant. During the First Wizarding War and Voldemort's reigns, Wizard Superiority Complexes were enhanced, and so no one really suspected the power of Muggles. Also, even though Tom Riddle grew up there, I highly doubt Voldemort would want to interact with Muggles. Also, the people in the stories who are portrayed as being ignorant about Muggles were likely not taught about them. Obviously, at some point in time, even the Weasley's were Supremicists, hence the whole "My entire family's pure..." and "Mum's cousin is an accountant, but we don't really talk about him" thing. Even if they weren't hell bent on the eradication of Muggles, he topic is still stigmatised in the Wizarding World.

*** September 7, 1940 - May 11, 1941

Basically all of his third year. And you know that he didn't go back to the orphanage for holidays. He hated that place.

Edit: honestly having Tom grow up around this time adds a lot of complication to /Harry Potter/.

I mean, civilian evacuations began in September 1939 so its a bit conspicuous to have so many kids running around King's Cross on Hogwarts travel days.

**** and regardless of when exactly voldemort grew up, he certainly would have know what a bomb and a gun was, he's basically a muggleborn. And given his obsession with staying alive, it stands to reason he would have looked for a way to survive getting shot or blown up. A lot of my favorite fics have a voldemort whose muggle hatred is born out of a deep deep fear from the second world war that the muggles were going to destroy the world and kill everyone. Which well given MAD during the cold war and the way us Muggles treat the environment, may not be completely irrational. Wizard kind probably would be better off without muggles and our unmanageable population growth and WMD's.

***** When he grew up makes all the difference. Knowing what they are when you are a kid, and knowing what they are 40 years later is a big difference. Bombs, rockets, missiles, and explosives have changed so much over the years since then that they are infinitely different from what they were.

Voldemort could have lookouts watching out for bombers, or listening for the telltale whistle of the bombs. And then the building exploded because missiles don't whistle anymore, are faster, and can be laser guided.

*** Assuming you mean harnessed electricity, you're completely wrong. Bombs have been getting used for literally a thousand years. There are records of China using them as far back as the 11th century. So it's pretty silly to think wizards don't know what they are, especially considering bombs have literally flattened cities that they have lived in.

There are plenty of examples showing wizards aren't "that ignorant" about the muggle world.

- Draco Malfoy knows about helicopters at eleven years old.

- Hagrid and Arthur Weasley know about guns, which have been around for centuries, so it's likely the average wizard at least has some idea of what they are.

- There is a steady influx of Muggle-borns coming into the wizarding world, who would spread their knowledge.

- The majority of the population is Half-blood and Muggle-born, which means most wizards have a connection to the Muggle world.

- Bombs have existed for a thousand years, and the World Wars leveled cities. Wizards would have noticed this.

- Kingsley Shacklebolt, a Pure-blood, works for several months under the Prime Minister blends in so well with Muggles that no one notices a thing, including the Prime Minister who knows about magic.

- The Ministry of Magic has a whole department dedicated to dealing with the Muggle world (Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee). The visitor entrance is also a phone booth.

- Their use of muggle vehicles (cars, trains, buses, etc)
