I'm not saying muggle clothes are better. I was just all of a suddon hit with the mood to see harry wear a suit to the yule ball. No reason just thought why not. I mean he grew up in a muggle(if sheltered) home I would have thought he would have worn a suit to the ball.

P.s. Bonus points if he refuses to wear his school robes period, and instead wears pants, and a shirt throughout his time at school, if the rules state he has to wear robes, than either he doesn't, and makes a big scene or he only wears them during class.


** I /think/ he went muggle in this one:

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

*** If I had to guess, you asked for something that is vaguely indy!Harry which a large part of the community hates. People judge the fuck out of requests here for whatever reason, it's why you almost never see slash requests, they get downvoted to hell, instead, they made their own community for that.

**** That's just stupid(no offence meant to you). I mean I asked for a slightly more rebellious Harry towards the uniform, not some stronger than dumbledore, and thinks muggles have it all figured out. I mean this is literally just around his clothing choice, and how he prefers muggle clothes. I mean if you went from america to india you would prefer to dress up in american clothes still, and that is all i'm asking for. Not one where he has a harem, or learns/gains all of voldemorts powers through his hocrux.

You know what I mean. Again sorry it's just how everyone seems to literally hate anything, but canon Harry annoys the shit out of me. I mean people write fanfiction for one of two reasons to either explore other characters, or change the story, and when you want to change the story suprise that is a different character who is NOT canon.
