** Do you read mostly Harry x Ginny? I've seen him (?) quite a few times, too, usually with just a plain, "Good job." I think it was always on an H/G fic that I noticed it.

As for who he is... Just a hardcore Harry x Ginny shipper? I don't know.

***** If it is, at least they are increasing the review count. I sometimes am guilty of sorting fics by review count when I am trying to find something to read.
