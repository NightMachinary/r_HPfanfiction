For instance, in this new world the knowledge of magic's existence is kept from even the immediate family of Muggleborns, or at the very least the knowledge of magic being real is Obliviated from them when their magical child graduates from Hogwarts. So how much different would Harry's formative years be if Petunia wasn't aware of magic being real, and didn't spend years of her life stewing in her own jealousy regarding Lily's magical abilities?


** Nurture vs. Nature, how much of Harry's personality is a product of his environment. Does his saving people thing stem from his inability to trust adults? Do his morals stem for his dislike of the Dursleys and the unfair way they treated him? Does Harry desire to be just Harry, a normal kid, stem from the Dursleys obsession with normality? Harry grew up not being allowed to ask questions, would he have known the basic stuff like that Voldemort's followers are called Death Eaters and that Sirius Black betrayed his parent before 3th and 4th year.

There is another kid in the household to see how Harry could have turned out were Petunia and Vernon to love him. But siblings are rarely carbon copies of eachother, so I'd hope for the wizarding world that Harry would be nothing like Dudley.

** I had a fanfic Voldemort wins idea like this, where his society is super strict and thinks all magical kids belong in the magical world so they memory charm the parents and steal the kids away at earliest signs of accidental magic, or if they're older and already attached they arrange for "accidents" to happen to make the kids more isolated and indebted to the magical world they "rightfully belong in."

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

*** A recent book club entry had Hermione and Draco set up something like that, replacing muggle-born magical children with short-lived simulacra. Kind of interesting. I didn't like how the story had Harry and Ron and various other people fallen into selfishness and laziness and debauchery, though.

** I wonder if Petunia would still be similar, unable to fully embrace Harry but not bitter enough to dump him in a cupboard.

I'm assuming she thinks Lily got headhunted by a fancy, secretive private school. So they still would have been estranged as Lily chose to live in the magical world and Petunia still could have felt abandoned and resentful; she just wouldn't have known why Lily left her behind.
