In the mood for a godlike MC in the HP universe right now, and as long as it's a decent word length, i'll have no complaints. I would prefer if it's not a harem either, but it's not a requirement.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** This made me remember linkao3(6122017)

I assume Master of Death ! Harry counts as godlike?

I don't usually read fics with that trope, but the author is great, and I liked this one.

They have a ff.net profile, but this fic is not posted there.
