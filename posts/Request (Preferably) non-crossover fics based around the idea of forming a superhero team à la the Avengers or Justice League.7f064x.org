The fic needs to be well-written and contain no slash. I would prefer that the fic is set solely in the HP universe, but I wouldn't mind a great crossover recommendation.

The fic should have the main character (not necessarily Harry) assemble a group of 'unique' individuals - the more contrasting, the better. Together, they face threats while learning to work as a team, in order to unite against the big bad (preferably someone else besides Voldemort). A plus would be plenty of world-building in the fic.
