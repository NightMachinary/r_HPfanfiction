**** Hell yeah! Okay that's awesome, thanks for the confirmation. Now I'll add on to your prompt.

Harry spends his whole life working with Voldemort, corrupting him more than he already was. Each of the Potter's are working hard to contribute their evil to the world.

But what if they weren't the only ones who made a deal with the devil?

As the corrupt evil deals unravel throughout the different worlds, something quite obvious becomes apparent. Every act of evil was done by someone who, in another life was desperate. So desperate that they would go to the robot devil for help. Now, little things weren't created by the robot devil; It's unlikely a bully like Dudley made a deal with the devil. The people who made deals were the people who committed such disgusting, wrong acts that they couldn't possibly be done by a human. It had to been caused by the robot devil.

In another world, far far away was a scared orphan boy by the name of Tom. Tom had a crushing, dreadful fear of one thing; Death. Tom is so desperate for immortality that who does he go to for help? The singing robot devil of robot hell. The robot devil gives Tom what he wants; Immortality. The only thing the devil wants in return is for Tom to commit the foulest crimes against humanity. Murder, torture, ect. Tom becomes Lord Voldemort, because his fear was so strong he went to the robot devil.

After Harry (who was also aided by the robot devil) kills Voldemort, Voldemort is granted immortality in robot hell. The only catch? He is tortured for eternity for his sins. (Tom: "Just tell me why?" Devil: "Please read this 55-page warrent." Tom: "There must be people worse than I?" Devil: "We've checked around there really arent.")

(This really spiralled out of control. I don't even know what I'm talking about at this point. I'm sorry.)

**** Son of the Hell Queen. It's a smut piece in ao3 where Lily is the queen of Hell, but she can't visit the mortal world because of a civil war in there, or something.

There are some time travel shenanigans and Harry & Lily are re-united and she explains her heritage... and Harry's job^{TM} is to corrupt witches and damn their souls to hell basically, as Lily has been doing.

You can see the resemblance.
