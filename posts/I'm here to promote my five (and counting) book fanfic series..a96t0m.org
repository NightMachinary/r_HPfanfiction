To start off, I'm proud of my work so far, which began out of just a need to let off some steam and just steamrolled into something really cool (in my opinion).

The story is a re-telling of the whole series, but as it progresses, everything changes and it stops mirroring the books at ll, the fourth book is the last to be similar, as it peaks into an entirely different path at the end. I've done something I didn't do before and actually read the books while I wrote it, so I could actually get it right with the timeline.

But if you're looking for canon, it's pretty uncanny (look, a joke).

Anyway, let me tell you the deets. This story contains OCs, OC protagonists and OC secondaries. There's about five OCs in this story, some good and some bad. They all have a purpose in the story, and they're also magically powerful. However, while they're magically powerful, there's limitations to that power that you will discover, You can't just be overpowered and call it a day, there's consequences, mental and physical.

Best if you like OCs, want overpowering that comes with dangers, like it when Severus Snape (and another poor soul) gets a chance at redemption, love the Weasley family (it gets pretty Weasley after a while), and you really want to see Harry get a break from being a target of evil beings. I can tell you right now he's pretty happy not getting all the attention.

** I made a start, and I'll congratulate you on writing so much.

I'm struggling, though, with what feels like a very OOC Malfoy family. Narcissa befriending the Bloodstones because their power could be useful, I could easily see. Narcissa befriending them against her husband's wishes because of female solidarity with a woman who ran off with a political nobody - no, that doesn't sound like her. And Lucius of canon is the type for ice-cold revenge, not such revealing displays.

*** I need to add to this, to point out that her befriending the malfoys was necessary for the plot to advance, and I actually had two versions of this story, one where they go a completely different route and I got halted on a standstill because everything was...uh... weird. The other version had the Malfoys being killed off entirely, because some death eater told Voldemort that Lucius was going to betray them, and so Voldemort offed them but it was Draco who was left spared because Dobby took him "somewhere safe", it was a totally alternative timeline with diferent outcomes that I couldn't seem to finish.

*** I know they're OOC, but I've been having a hard time writing the Malfoys so, just know there's a major fallout. Lucius isn't over it, not one bit. It's not really female solidarity that she's doing it for, but the sympathy from one mother to another, as she'd do anything for her boy.
