:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
From what I remember, everybody is from a different timeline.

In one person's time, Cho Chang is a housewife, in another person's she is not. Su Li may have been an assassin in her timeline.

Somebody, maybe Hermione, asks who is a time traveller and everybody raises their hand

That is all I remember, does anybody recognise it?

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.
