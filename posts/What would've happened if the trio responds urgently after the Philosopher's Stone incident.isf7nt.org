I mean, I'm gonna be honest, if there was a soul loose on someone who was supposed to be dead, we'd probably freak out. Like, what would've happened if Inter-house unity was actually achieved, preparations were made before the war, like medbays secured, storage rooms secured. IDK, would've been pretty baddass where we see a fic where the Light side was on equal footing with the Dark SIde. Kind of like "What Might Have Been" by Catherine or Cate in ff.net
