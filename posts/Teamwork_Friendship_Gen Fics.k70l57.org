I love the *Kindred Powers* series by /Kirinin/ and every time I re-read it, my strong cravings for teamwork fics are reawakened - I'd love to see any writing that features building strong bonds with others, but where the focus on a pairing is, if not absent, than less forward than usual. Give me all that 'true Nakama' bullshit, I love it! Recovering from trauma! Epic quests! Whatever you like! Unexpected friendships welcome! Does not have to be centered on our Golden Trio - long or short, I'll take 'em all! Bonus points for throwing some mentor feels in there as well! Snape, Lupin, Padfoot, McGonagall - whatever you got!

(I don't think I should have to add this, but no bashing, please - the point is in making */friends/*, not enemies!)


** Ooh, you'll love *Forging the Sword* if you can get over the premise.

Both Slide's *Anguis series* and *Stygian Trilogy* have great friendship/teamwork and are brilliantly executed.

*Subversion* is a nice WBWL gem with some great friendships, but it's incomplete.

Afraid my taste is quite AU, so if you like fairly canon-compliant fics some of these might not be for you.

  ::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. (Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.)

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** Nightmares of Futures Past is a redo with a strong focus on Harry training and preparing all his friends, teaching them martial arts (for both self defense and fitness), Occlumency, drilling until they can cast spells accurately and reliably, etc. /This/ Harry certainly isn't left alone when his name comes out of the Goblet of Fire.

Unfortunately it's incomplete, and FFN deleted it over a bogus copyright accusation. The author still intends to finish it, but it's been updating just a chapter every three years or so. The most up to date version is at [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]]
