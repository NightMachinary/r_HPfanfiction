One of the most common tropes in FF is that when Harry enters in reason and realizes that he is at war and that he needs to kill his enemies, Albus is there to tell him that he is disappointed and that he should forgive and blah blah blah.

Does Dumbledore in canon at any point actually say that the enemy should not be killed? or is that just common Fannon?


** It's fanon. In fact, on their way to Slughorn's he encourages Harry to use any spell that comes to mind. In the books, he and Harry do appear to be against killing people themselves, but recognize that's it's necessary and that they'll have to get their hands dirty.

** It's fanon, as an example in the department of mysteries fight he is actively trying to kill Voldemort. basically Giving it one more college try , and he's doing it to try and spare Harry the hardship of the Prophecy. He only fails because he can't bring himself to kill Harry when Tom was possessing him.

** The closest we get to canon evidence for this is this passage during the DoM fight:

#+begin_quote
  “You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. “Above such brutality, are you?”

  “We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,” Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk toward Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall. “Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit ---” (OotP, Chapter 36)
#+end_quote

However, I think this is a very special case, given that Voldemort had several Horcruxes at the time (which Dumbledore knew) and was therefore functionally immortal no matter what Dumbledore did, and shouldn't be taken to indicate that Dumbledore was always against lethal force.

*** Honestly, I feel the "other ways" seem even more terrifying. I mean casually walking towards one of the deadliest men alive while insinuating anger to the point where even death is too little? That would scare me.

**** Dumbledore wanted poetic justice, Voldemort didn't want to die so he'd let him live but in a way that Voldemort would hate it.

** Not specifically, but there are intances where he could've, perhaps should've killed and didn't. 1: captured Gridelwald 2: captured inner circle Death Eaters at the Battle of the Ministry, all of whom promptly escaped next book 3: Draco in 6th year

*** With regards to the Death Eaters captured during the fifth book, Dumbledore didn't know that he'd be cursed some months later, and had he killed them without a trial, there's a risk that he might set their own efforts back considerably.

Not to mention that we don't really know what the Wizengamot considers to be an appropriate punishment, at least for purebloods with considerable connections.

** Dumbledore comes across as this forgiving type, with his chances for such people like Snape and Hagrid, so maybe that's why fans write him like that. To me it somehow seems exactly what I'd have expected. I mean, I'm not even surprised they write him this way. But then again, in OOTP he says Voldemort's death would not satisfy him or something along these lines. When Harry says in HBP he wants to be the one to kill Voldemort and take as many death eaters with him, Dumbledore is happy about this. Even if this is more about the fact that Harry realised he would fight Voldemort of his own free will, you'd think he would give a long speech about forgiveness if he was strictly against lethal force. Harry pretty much says,' I'm going to kill those bastards' and Dumbledore is all for it. So in reality I don't think he is as gentle as people want to make him. I mean, that sort of forgiveness comes across as being naive in Dumbledore's case. He's old enough to know that during war you don't get to be nice. And after all, forgiveness and not killing is Harry's signature so it would be rude to take it away from him.

** I think this stems mostly from the fact that the Order mostly (from what I can remember) used stunning spells, and Dumbledore's generally forgiving nature. But I can't really think of any time that was explicitly said.

*** I think categorizing the Order as mostly using stunning spells isn't exactly fair. Remember how mad Lupin was DH for Harry just using expelliarmus? He says you have to at least stun if you're not ready for more. I think the adult members of the order were more than ready to kill if need be, though they obviously weren't just tossing around avada kedavra. Dumbledore does capture a bunch of death eaters in the ministry battle, as opposed to killing, but it's shown how absolutely easy it is for him to beat them, it's pretty reasonable he wouldn't just go for the slaughter. He's still dealing with a ministry that will lock up the death eaters like Lucius, now that Voldemort's return is acknowledge, plus he doesn't know a countdown clock is going to start on his life in a month or two.

**** Three reasons I don't think this counts as a counter argument:

1. Dumbledore was dead at this point.
2. This was a mixture of Lupin going overprotective and captain hindsight. If Harry wasn't discovered, they wouldn't care if he spent the whole escape giving an Expelliarmus laser light show synchronized to ACDC's Back in Black.
3. Because you can be damn sure people would be looking at him funny if he raked up the most impressive kill count ever during the escape.

I'm not saying yes or no. I just think that using this counter-argument is spurious.

***** I always got the impression the revival was sort of an educated guess. Like the information he had from his books and had gleaned from his investigation into Voldemort (after he found out about Horcruces in Harry's second year) made him think it was possible, and he couldn't find anything else so he just pinned his hopes on that because Harry had to die regardless of anything else.
