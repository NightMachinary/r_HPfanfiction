Looking for fics that feature a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy][Genre Savvy]] character. Ideally, where it has a significant impact on the plot.

The only ones that really come to mind with this were the two D&D based ones I read (Natural 20 and the Girl in Red, i think). But that is not really what I am looking for (In that case, they treat the wizarding world like it is their world, and the tropes just work, while everyone is wondering why they do). Instead I'm looking for one where people look at the wizarding world and go 'Hey, don't you see what is going on here? His name is Lupin dammit!')

I'd prefer ones where it isn't necessarily the main character noticing this. (That is, not an OP/well read Harry who sees it coming). Someone external (like say, a Muggleborn's parents) noticing it and trying to do something would be much more entertaining.

Example of what I am looking for: * Noticing that the events are structured neatly into yearly episodes, maybe trying to head it off. * Noticing that Harry seems to reset his friendships/get rejected at the beginning of every Summer. * Comment on how Harry has few friends, is an orphan, seems to be powerful, seems to have things revolve around him * Comment on some of the absurd names (Lupin? really?) * Comment on the absurdity of the house system. Maybe Meta-ing it to their advantage. * "Hon, how come whatever you are talking about in your first letter of the year always seems to have something to do with whatever blows up at the end of the year?"

Bonus points if after one of these comments someone goes "But that isn't how the world works, it isn't a story" and gets responded "You live in a world with magic and prophecies. Is it really so unbelievable to have fate play you all like storybook characters?"


** Dogbertcarroll asked himself that same question ( "You live in a world with magic and prophecies. Is it really so unbelievable to have fate play you all like storybook characters?" ) and came up with this answer: linkffn(7597067)

Not really what you're looking for but a hilarious read none the less.

  Harry is sure he's living in a fairy tale with himself as the hero. Really, what else makes sense?

*** This is very close. Sadly it has a bit of the 'runaway' problem that was being discussed below, where it quickly deviates from Harry understanding the rules of the universe are storybook. In this case, it is runaway rule of cool rather than runaway powertrip, but still.

It was still fun, particularly the first few chapters :)

** Linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fates fool) has the main character (forcefully gender bent time traveling Harry) be aware of the End-of-Year surprise. It's not completely self aware/genre savvy, but it still kinda counts.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

*** Also, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) has Milo (rules lawyer type DnD character/player) treat the first few years like a DnD campaign. I think side quests are mentioned, but for sure he looks at the House system at a meta level. (One for the heroes, one for the villains, and two for generic NPCs)

  Milo, a genre-savvy D&D Wizard and Adventurer Extraordinaire is forced to attend Hogwarts, and soon finds himself plunged into a new adventure of magic, mad old Wizards, metagaming, misunderstandings, and munchkinry. Updates monthly.

** Hah that would be interesting. I'd like to see a story like that. Preferably with Harry or an OC protagonist being the genre savy one.

*** Eh, the reason I said I'd prefer a non-main character (of the meta, not of the fic necessarily) is that I've read a few OP harry fics that flirt with this (usually as a 'my all-powerful harry who sweats diamonds and shits gold also knows the meta of the story he is in! Isn't he so OP?' Ugh.) I think the Gamer! ones like to do this.

And honestly, Harry coming into the world Genre-savvy would be less interesting than someone coming upon it in later years.

**** I think the problem there is that they slap genre-savy on TOP of some (or multiple) ridiculous power-ups. I'd immagine a Harry who has no OTHER abilities but genre saviness. And of course, just because you know the genre you are in doesn't mean that EVERYTHING is foreseeable. After all, not all "Children boarding school stories" have the exact same plot and tropes.

***** Well, a lot of fics don't know where to stop. It is worse than average in op!char fics, likely because they are power fantasies and not 'lets explore this concept' fic.

Harry has special powers / is half dragon / can turn into a rubber duck. Ok that is interesting.

Wait, now instead of the dreary creature shaming the books have set up with, Harry is off wooing some magical creature community which is somehow more stable and competent than anything in the book. And they give him secret powers and a royal love interest.

Oh! And then Harry is revealed to be the heir to all of wizardom and has a marriage contract with every named canon female...

Don't forget the named canon male who ends up female in most fics (Zabini of course).

**** Do not tell me to not be excited about things I like, like dolphins, or ask legitimate questions of other people who happen to have names about DOLPHINS. You did not have to say anything, so shut up and manage yourself. I'm not trying to be anything. I am just excited and happy. I'm sorry if you think that is some huge crime. A lot of people on this stupid website seem to think so, that all you can be is negative and cynical and rude here and anything else has to be ruined because it's not all sad and stupid like you are!!!
