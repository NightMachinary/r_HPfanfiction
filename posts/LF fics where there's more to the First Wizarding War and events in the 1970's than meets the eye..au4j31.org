In canon and in most fics the information about the First Wizarding War from 1970-81 is pretty bare bones. It mostly just sets up Voldemort and the Death Eaters as being pure evil. In fact, I'd go as far to say that the First War doesn't really make much logical sense in-universe and mostly is for worldbuilding.

‚Äã

Regardless, in most cases, the First War isn't very important and mostly the same as canon. It was scary, Voldemort is evil, Death Eaters are Nazis(except they didn't have institutional power), the Potters die; and there's not too much more than that.

‚Äã

I recently have been reading linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind) and it does have a rather interesting take on it. Where the war and Voldemort and the death eaters in general are less black and white than Harry and the reader are lead to believe originally. I guess you can consider it Dumbledore bashing, but it's less bashing and more him being the antagonist. There are a few other stories that do similar things as well, but this is the one that springs to mind.

‚Äã

So I'm really looking for anything that kind of subverts the normal things known from the 1970's in canon and it *actually matters* to the story's plot.

  Being petrified and having one's absurdly lucky best friend kill a big snake really gets a girl thinking. Where could they go from there? A midnight conversation leads to a promise to do better, regardless of breaking one, two, or a dozen laws along the way. With a definitely safe wand, allies expecting her to be the next dark lady, and a free summer, what is a girl to do?

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

*** Well, around here I've only ever seen people call the war in 1970's Britain either "The First Blood War", "The First Wizarding War", and plenty of fics will just refer to it as "The First War".

‚Äã

But I just checked, pottermore refers to the conflict as "The First Wizarding War" as does the Harry Potter wiki.
