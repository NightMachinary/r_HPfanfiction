Looking for stories where Harry either removes or changes the Dark Mark.

No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche. Anything else is okay.


** I'm trying to remember the one where Snape is unconscious in the hospital wing and his dark mark is burning black /(voldemort has found out snape is a traitor and basically torturing him from a distance using the dark mark)/ and Harry is able to grab it and influence the mark to stop burning. It's definitely in one of my Harry & Snape non-slash stories in my snape list: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cdkuzu/my_severus_snape_fanfic_library_list_please_help/]]

I think it's the same story where Harry is able to use Lucius Malfoy's dark mark to teleport to Voldemort's location. Lucius didn't know Harry could do this, but he volunteers his Dark Mark for the task to help rescue Snape from torture. I think.... unless I'm confusing that for a Hermione/Snape story, but I think it was Harry and not Hermione. It is in my Snape list somewhere, just can't remember which story it specifically was.

Snape's dark mark is removed at the very, very end of Harry Potter and the Chained Souls. You'll need to read Harry Potter and the Enemy Within before reading Chained Souls though.

** Went back through my notes to find my response to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/kap2rm/harry_or_someone_else_changes_the_death_eater/][the last time somebody asked this]], only to find out that was you.

** Time to Spare is a time travel fic that includes this as a minor plot point. linkffn(2538955)

I've definitely read others but I can't quite remember the titles. I'll update here if I do.

#+begin_quote
  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...
