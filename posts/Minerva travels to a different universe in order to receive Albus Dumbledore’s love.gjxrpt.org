I remember it involved a time turner and she was able to go to a different universe with a much older Dumbledore. In that parallel universe, Albus and Minerva were married and had 2 sons together. But then Minerva was captured and killed. Albus 2 eventually gets Minerva the younger version pregnant but she can't keep going back in forth from universes.
