*** Can I ask how you define 'canon compliant' in this context since I'm coming up with a few different definitions in my head and I'm curious:

A) At the end of the story, things end on terms where canon could continue. (Harry, Ron, Hermione - Post victory celebrations while drunk and then Harry goes his separate way)

B) The participants all canonically got along well enough to have their getting together make sense (Harry, Ron, Hermione) as opposed to (Hermione, Draco, Neville)

C) Happens either after canon has all taken place, or so far before hand that it does not matter. (Sirius, Remus, Alice-not-yet-Longbottom)

*After the Sea* is the first triad story I ever read, and I quite liked it. It's a full triad (so relations between all three), and an alternate ending to 'The Die' (which is a great story on its own, but not a triad).

I remember some Remus/Sirius/Hermione stories, but in those it wasn't a full triad /and/ she eventually chose just one. Tonks was also a major bitch in those stories.

linkffn(10772496) - *The Debt of Time* has an MMF threesome scene in it, no relationship though. It is an epic story that is a must read in the fandom regardless.

The author of that story also has some [[http://shayalonnie.tumblr.com/moresome-recs][recommendations on her tumblr]] regarding moresomes.

Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.

Right! Hermione would immediately go into research mode and try to figure out how to get her free will back.

The Fic has some really great parts, but the "can't change anything" and "allowing Dumbledore to control her" are really stupid plot contrivances that made me irrationally angry - probably because it weakens one of my favorite characters. She'd never just accept this.
