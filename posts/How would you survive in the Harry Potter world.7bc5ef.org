Let's say you're dropped in the Harry Potter world, Age 11, with magic and a Hogwarts Letter. You also have 'proof' that you're a Half Blood.

What do you do? Do you go to Hogwarts? Do you get involved in the plot? Or do you just say 'lmao fuck England' and go to Antarctica or something?


** Gonna lock in 'd' for "lmao fuck England".

I'd try to get a place in some magic school that is likely to be untouched by the war.

I would probably send a letter to Dumbledore or something though. The letter would detail the existence of horcruxes, their location etc etc.

** Since you wrote that I remember all of the books content, this is going to be one hell of a fixing-marathon for me.

- Go to Hogwarts (Hope for Gryffindor, but any house would work. Slytherin would just suck because could you /imagine/ sharing a dorm with Malfoy?)

- Become friends with Harry (which also would be vastly more difficult as a Slytherin)

- fix stuff left and right

Frankly, I'd mostly focus on making the Resurrection not happen at all. Which means getting Pettigrew imprisoned and consequently Sirius free.

I'm not sure if I'd reveal to Dumbledore that I know whats gonna happen. It would probably make many things easier. If he knows how to imprison a spirit, for example, we could trap Voldemort at the end of the first year from where I can reveal to Dumbledore the existence of the Horcrux /plus/ the existence of the Horcrux in Harry giving the old man enough time to research how to remove said Horcrux without killing Harry. He would have enough time without doom looming over everybody's head, since Voldemort would be imprisoned in spectral form within a saltmine turned atomic waste dump under a Fidelius Charm, or something. Plus, if I tell Dumbledore, he can get the ball on Sirius rolling through some pretense. Which is a gamble, to be fair, but I'll trust the intention of Rowling's writing and assume Dumbledore would be supportive here.

If I could get Voldemort removed from the immediate equation, I got a lot of space to breathe. Second year is easily fixed. You remind Ginny what a shit idea it is to write in something that talks back. If the advice isn't heeded, you turn her brothers on her. If that isn't enough, you write a letter to her father. Simultaneously, since I already talked to Albus (I'd totally be on first name basis already), I can tell him that the diary is a Horcrux and he could just trade Ginny the diary for a Kneazle she can talk to when shes lonely.

Third year will probably be the most normal one ever. Pettigrew is already in Azkaban, Sirius out of it. We have Lupin as a Defense teacher. I'd probably make it my mission to try and break the curse on the Defense position. Lupin for another year would be dope. Also, who's interested in seeing what happens when a timeturner produces paradoxes? Everybody? Good! 'Cause you bet your ass I will try that. Will there be 2 Hermiones? Lets hope not. Can you imagine that conversation? "Hi, mum and dad. I time-cloned myself and now you have twin daughters."

Fourth Year is already fixed. No Peter - no signs of the Dark Lord - ergo, no Crouch junior. Still... I'd probably check on Alastor Moody, should my mission fail and Lupin isn't Defense Professor in fourth year. Then again... I'd check any Defense Teacher. Unfortunately I am neither a Cursebreaker, nor old enough - and to be quite honest, probably also not as handsome as Bill Weasley, so asking Fleur to the ball in the hope of pairing myself up with the quarter-veela probably isn't happening. Maybe I'd ask Hermione before Krum does it? That would probably depend on who I like and whom I don't like at this point (and if there are 2 or more time clones of Hermione). /Anyway/ - I can assume that Harry isn't part of the tournament, so we're cool there. If somehow, for some reason someone /did/ infiltrate the tournament and Harry is part of it, well... Dragons, Mermen, Labyrinth and I'll research how to dispell portkeys. I'm just not entirely sure where that portkey would lead anyway, since Voldemort is still chilling in the deepest cavern of some radioactive saltmine nobody but Dumbledore remembers the location of.

Ya know, people bring this up all the time, and IIRC the canon ruling was don't trust something if you can't see where it keeps it's brain or some such.

Which would sound like a good rule, regardless of the exact phrasing.... but Sorting Hat. Which has no brain, is a magic item, and is trusted to look through children's minds AND make life changing decisions for them.

It's kinda sets a rather bad precedent that sounds like a magic diary is great idea, and I'm surprised most of the rich kids don't have one.

#+end_quote

Yes, but only if I can't get one thing to happen. World Cup, right? Barty in an invisibility cloak right behind Harry and Ron. Would be a shame if someone tripped, wouldn't it? Maybe grab the cloak in a wild dash to get balance back, and maybe dump butterbeer all over it.

Because honestly, I don't know and do not want to find out if Aurors can track anonymous letters if they really want to. It will do in a pinch, but even if Operation World Cup fails I'd still rather just go to Dumbledore with that and let him handle that. If push comes to shove, he'd have more options to explain stuff away.

But I won't make a definite statement on this because I can't say if I still do after sharing - what - a good 250 to 300 days with her in the same dorm for 3 years? For Luna the same. I probably love talking to her from time to time, but I am not sure if I'd be cut out for a closer friendship with Luna Lovegood.

It is an interesting scenario to think about though, I did it a lot when I was young. Harry Potter offered me an escape from my life growing up. Some of the first things I ever did on the internet were seeking out information about Harry Potter, and finding communities that grew up around the mutual love for the series.

To answer your question; I'd go to Hogwarts, tell Dumbledore everything, then I'd be a wizard. I suppose being forced to go through adolescence a second time would be a fair punishment for such a reward.

Befriend Susan Bones who is the niece of Amelia Bones, a woman who from just the few moments with her seems pretty strict but fair in the terms of justice. I'll tell Amelia about the Horcruxes, about Sirius and Peter and everything else.

And then once I tell Amelia I'll likely tell Albus, but I'll only tell him after I tell Amelia, always good to have back up help. Trusting Rowling's writing I'll say that he believes me, I could always be given Veritaserum as well, that way he'll have to believe me.

Try to help Dumbledore with Barty Crouch Jr, Sirius and Peter. Make sure there's no way that Harry can do the tournament. If he somehow does end up doing the tournament even though hopefully by that time Barty Crouch Sr and Jr are in Azkaban, I'll need Amelia and Albus' help making sure the portkey doesn't go to the graveyard.

I'll learn Occlumency, help Harry and co out with spells and training. Maybe even start up Dumbledore's Army early on. Quirrell is awful in first year, Lockhart is no better. Umbridge is horrible, and if Barty Crouch Jr is in Azkaban at this point and Dumbledore gets Mad Eye Moody I'm not too sure how he'll do teaching students, it would be great to be able to keep Remus since he is the only good Defence Professor, but if I can't I'll help Dumbledore find a good Defence Professor.

Make sure that the Horcruxes are destroyed, find a way to destroy the Horcrux that is inside Harry so that he doesn't have to be killed. And for something minor find a way to get rid of that annoying portrait of Sirius' mom. Although hopefully at this point Sirius is out of Azkaban, raising Harry someplace else entirely and it is unplottable.

** Writing a fanfic about just that at the moment ([[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/wandless-hp-si.42588/][Wandless by fflai (SV)]]), will release Chapter 2 this evening.

I won't spoil the plot here, but definitely going to Hogwarts. Would you really turn down the chance with all your knowledge about England? You don't know if Magical Germany is better at all, for example, it might be horrible! And contrary to fanon, Dumbledore isn't evil, he just makes mistakes that can probably be avoided.

Generally the genre of "Self Insert" fanfics is what deals with that, sadly there are only like 5-10 good ones in the HP fandom, a recent recommendation thread is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/70zyai/selfinsert_fics/][this one]].

My personal recommendations are (in order):

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/wand-hp-si.4477/][Wand by Hiver (SV)]] - while his spelling and grammar isn't always the best, hiver writes very fun stories, that feel authentic - his OC simply feels alive.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/][A Curse of Truth by butalearner (FFN)]] - it's also a nice fic, canon-like universe and a paranoid author. The ending could be a bit better, but I really liked the story.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/][The perks of Survival (SB)]] - the premise is awesome, the worldbuilding was also intersting in this one, but IIRC it is a bit of a different universe.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11691332/1/][So How Can I Weaponize This? by longherin (FFN)]] - fun fic, fun premise, but not exactly Harry Potter universe again.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12369247/1/Triumphant-the-Dreamer][Triumphant, the Dreamer by Shadowblayze (FFN)]] - "Big Sister of Harry"-SI, it's a rather fun story, even if the insert is definitely the biggest Mary Sue ever. Still fun for a while, don't judge me.

These are best ones that came to my mind, so I hope you might like this in addition to the discussion.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

** I'd stay in England, try to get sorted into Griffindor but probably end up in Hufflepuff any way. I'd try to befriend the trio but end up being seen as this weird Hufflepuff stalker girl instead. Susan Bones and Hannah Abbot seem like people I'd be friends with in real life anyways. I can be kind of competitive academically, so I can see me and Hermione having a rivalry (as I kill myself trying to out study her but try not to appear that I'm killing myself to do so). I'd blow off Astronomy though. It seems like stuff muggles have already all figured out.

I'd try my best to gather some information to get Sirius freed. I think I'd use a cover that I was a magical Nancy Drew junior detective. I'd learn some detective spells and something that will "surprise" reveal Pettigrew in the middle of class (humano revelo?). Private detective seems like it would be a cool career as an adult anyways.

I think I'd also sell homemade house memorabilia during Quidditch games. Money is most likely going to be an issue. I could probably get decent at transfiguring things into pennants, giant foam hands, buttons, etc. Maybe see if I can get permission to sell some hot chocolate if the profit margin seems worth it?

I think there's a good chance Dumbledore would erase my memory or something (or just think I'm nutters) if I came clean right away. I'd try my best to get rid of the Horucruxes myself before Voldemort is resurrected, at least the more easily accessible ones. The diary I could intercept during Lockhart's book signing. I'd make a show of looking for something and after Malfoy walks out ask Ginny if she'd seen my diary. Then the damn thing goes in the room of requirement and I don't touch it until I can destroy it. Honestly, figuring out how to destroy the horrucruxes would be the hard part (volcano?). Nagini, Voldemort, and probably the cup (although I'd try to find it) would be up to Dumbledore or Harry.

I'd try to learn Occlumency in the mean time, just in case the shit hit the fan and I had to confide in Dumbledore anyways. I don't think Dumbledore's evil, but I don't want to take the chance that I'm memory screwed and sorting gum wrappers with Mrs. Longbottom in Saint Mungos.

I'd try to track down Umbridge's brother and get some proof of her half blood status for just in case black mail/give to Fred and George and see what they can do with it.

Assuming if I could get around the trace (or it didn't work because my "soul" was older) and If I didn't have any kind of "family" to go to during the Summer I'd make myself an aging potion and then get a real estate agent to show me a foreclosed house somewhere out in the country. I'd then proceed to break a shit ton of laws and memory wipe the real estate agent and various muggle bank people that it even existed. I'd then make it unplotable. Then I wouldn't have to hide in the Room of Requirement every summer. Or I'd wimp out and not do any of this, but think about it a lot. lol

Oh and I would definitely befriend Luna in second year. I would not take her being bullied well. There'd be some shoe stealing thieves that would find they now have to poop through their noses.

Sorry for the big block of text. lol I've been flirting with writing a self insert.

** Okay, I will write my answer from two perspectives, one from actual 11-year old me and one from the perspective of me now transported to my 11-year old body.

Actual 11-year old me, without prior knowledge of the plotline: I don't know. I was very nerdy and academically inclined as a young kid, almost like a Hermione but without the courage. I think I would probably not want to go to Hogwarts because "that's not the right thing to do! I need to get a /real/ education" or something... However, I'd probably get harassed from the Ministry to go to Hogwarts! Once I got there I wouldn't get involved in anything; it sounds too dangerous. When the war gets more dangerous I would probably just try to stay at home...

With prior knowledge: Hm, I don't know how I could convince people to /believe/ me if I tried to solve everything beforehand. So I would try to transfer to another wizarding school as soon as possible to be safe, knowing that the environment would likely become more dangerous in a few years. Maybe in America or something?

** How it likely will go down:

I arrive in North Korea with no kind of communication to the wizarding world.

Because a ‘magic pub' is probably easy to find.

Don't find it, get stabbed and sold to some brothel because I neither have any ID nor do I have enough money(because I am 11) and can't pay for housing.

..................................................................................................................................................................................................

How I would like it to go down:

First Year: I arrive in my London and get to Kings Cross station, as it is the only landmark that I can find in Muggle London.

I go through the ‘portal' and find someone that can take me to Diagon alley.

Getting to Diagon alley, I search for a way to send an owl.

Having sent an owl, I hope for someone of the staff at Hogwarts to meet me.

Go on the Shopping tour, can't buy anything extra and only second-hand things.

Wait for September 1:st, during waiting time learn some ‘fire' magic that can be fired of quickly. Earn some money through safe bets, like calling my parents and asking for some. (Also when I'm talking to them, perhaps explaining what is happening. Let the ‘magical' of my parents explain to the other..)

Start by getting sorted into Slytherin for my first plan to work.

Because of previous knowledge, I avoid Harry Potter as much as possible, in order to preserve knowledge about the future.

Let Harry deal with the ‘Snape is evil, we must stop him' farce.

When Quirrel is dead and lessons start again, wait until we perform the ‘small creature into matchboxes' transfiguration. Set Pettigrew aflame. Offer to buy him a new rat if caught. If not caught, imply it being Seamus Finnigan's fault. Malfoy will probably help fuel this fire as Finnigan is a half-blood.

..........................................................................................................................................................................................

Second Year:

I can't deal with the Basilisk so Ginny will be the next point to strike.

Steal the diary.

‘Accidentally' get sent to the Headmaster's office whilst carrying the book.

Get him to notice the diary, he will hopefully recognise it. If not, get it back to Ginnys possession.

Let Harry deal with the Basilisk problem. ...........................................................................................................................................................................................

Third Year:

Unlikely to happen, but if Sirius still escapes:

Have the fat lady torn.

Make an effort to make Harry go into the Forbidden shack, when it is not a full moon.

Like a surprise attack by a crazy madman, that has kidnapped Ron to make Harry go to the Shack. (Ron is just stupefied somewhere in the garden outside of the Hogwarts walls, so the Marauders map can't see him). .........................................................................................................................................................................................

Fourth Year:

Unknown if Voldemort is acting behind the scenes during the Triwizard tournament.

Use a wait and see approach.

Harry is not the extra champion. Good. Do nothing. Harry becomes the extra champion. Bad. Do something.

Check Moody. It's unlikely I could get the hip-flask, so main focus is the first DaDa lesson. If the same, not Moody. If changed, maybe Moody.

If the Tournament gets to the labyrinth, get them to change the last task. If unchanged. Get an unbound portkey and bind it to the spot the trophy will be and the front of the stands. Use a broom and fly over to the trophy. Leave your portkey, take trophy.

Here there is two options: 1) I get to meet Voldemort. Hurray! Death if I don't use the portkey again. Continues in 2) I am portkeyed in front of the stands with an audience watching me. Being expelled is the only reasonable conclusion to this. ......................................................................................................................................................................................

The world is saved. Now all I need to do is find them horcruxes.

I can't get them so I have to hope Dumbledore believes me when I tell him that they exist.

After they are done, I finish my schooling and get a job as a clerk in some store.

** Honestly, based on my personality, I'd be in Gryffindor or Slytherin (hopefully Gryffindor). Lay low for a while. Study magic really hard because, you know, IT'S MAGIC! Once I know my way around a spell or three (around 3rd or 4th year) start to subtly make friends with Harry and gang. Join the DA and demonstrate my (hopefully) strong magic skills, gain their trust. Doubt Ron and I get along, at least at first, due to my massive crush on Hermione (Emma), but may the best man win.

At this point I'm probably more qualified than the ministry six, except maybe Hermione's knowledge and Harry's experience, but certainly better than Ron, Neville, Luna & Ginny. So naturally it would be the ministry seven.

Sixth year I secretly take the dark mark, betray the gang to Voldemort, revealing I'm actually Riddle's son, my name was an anagram for I AM TOM RIDDLE JR'S SON obviously.

The rest is history.

** Well, with your particular set-up, I'd check the year and decide based on that. But unless it was extremely inconvenient (such as being 11 in 1996 or 1997, which would basically make me dead weight), I'd go, for reasons that I feel should be fairly obvious (check flair if in doubt), though I doubt I'd be very involved since I know the whole thing ended up alright and I wouldn't want my involvement to break stuff.

Now, it gets funnier if it were the actual 11-year-old me who learned that she was a witch, because the me at that age would survive “barely” but it would definitely be an interesting ride. Assuming that I'd get to get involved with the plot it would lead to some “canon fixing” because even at that age there were certain ... parts of my character, that would have caused some changes, such as the fact that even then I knew better than to sign something without learning what exactly it does (think of the DA parchment, and how it would go if people knew it was cursed before they signed it), and the fact that I had some ... issues, that I had to work through but really wouldn't be able to in the wizarding world and that would probably end up traumatising someone a bit (imagine year 6 with an addition of a girl who was willing to love potion herself and point herself at Harry in order to understand what love is, only she would do it after asking Harry if he blamed someone for doing something when they couldn't control themselves because they drunk a weird potion). Probably wouldn't get involved with the plot at all during the last year, as I'm way worse at having the courage to stand up for myself than I do for others (the latter of which would require going on the camping trip, but an underage character they need not), but instead would go stealth amidst the muggles, though that could be of use to the trio for obvious reasons (a potential safe place) so that too, though minor involvement, may change something.

I'd probably cause many a character to want to stun me whenever they see me, on principle.

** Legal guardians make it hard to make your own choices.

Let's assume I'm in an orphanage. My legal guardian would probably be thrilled at a boarding school taking me free of charge for ten months out of the year. I might be able to influence them, but the prospect of improving everyone's lives by a substantial margin would tempt them. I'm not enough of a smooth talker to dissuade them.

Orphans have trouble getting adopted overseas. I'd have better luck in that regard if I were in Cambodia than the UK.

I would try to give people more knowledge and get out of the way. I'm a flee-er, not a fighter. I'd point Dumbledore to the Room of Requirement if possible to get rid of the diadem horcrux, and then I'd sort through its room of hidden things to earn pocket money (and do something about the vanishing cabinet).

** I'm such a hufflepuff and I'd probably have fun tbh. While also studying nearly as much as Hermione. Hogwarts sounds great. Magic, free food, sleepovers everyday, literally boarding school sounds fun to my ears. Too bad I've never experienced it.

** Go to hogwarts get into ravenclaw if the sorting hat takes requests and keep to myself to change canon as little as possible while exploiting the Room of Requirement for all its worth Till fourth year we're I make my first change by poisoning Cedric before the third task with a non leath poison that will slow him down so Harry is the only one to make it to the cup at the centre of the maze.

Then hope that my time abusing the Room of Requirement over the first four and a half years has been enough to make a difference.

It fifth year I would be a background member of the D.A. And make my second big change by make Umbridges trip into the forbidden forest at the end of the year fatal and have her death blamed on the the giant spiders to give a reason for them to be exterminated before the final battle.

After sending Umbridge for her date with the acromantula I would take the knight bus to London and then make my way to the ministry sneak into the department of mysterys and then when the death eaters split up to hunt Harry and his friends take out the death eater one by one using a combination of stealth liquid luck and silent casting to hit each in the back with an invisible spell of my own making.

As you can tell I am aproching combat from the mindset of Squad two from bleach:

"If your comrade is being defeated, you should see it as an opportunity. Rather than standing in the way, you should stab the enemy in the back".

Or at least the first half of it

*** Solid plan, though I personally wouldn't risk your department of mysteries strategy as too much could go wrong. Though it may be worth going in to swipe some time turners before they're all destroyed, and take any opportunity shots at death eaters that occur.
