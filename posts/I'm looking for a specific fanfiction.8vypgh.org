Hey guys, a while ago i read a fanfiction that i thought was really good and i wanted to read it again but i couldn't find it anywhere. I looked up tags and stuff for around an hour and couldn't find it.

The fanfiction was about Harry Potter, except his name isn't harry. Harry is the illegitimate son of Regulus Black and Lily Evans and is dropped off at an orphanage. He is given a name when he gets there but i can't remember what that was either. Harry is OOC in it and joins Voldemort. Voldemort does not have any horcruxes, he instead has made himself into a combination of different immortal creatures. It is Harry/Voldemort. Lily makes Harry into her horcrux to protect him. If my memory serves me right then Harry is also an unspeakable and works with Lily without realising that shes his mother.

I believe it started with an I but i am not 100% sure. If you recognise this fanfiction can you please tell me?


** linkffn(5402147) I think it's this one. I'm not sure, though.

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.
