Feeble is the mind of those that flee from their fears,

For no good can come out of cowardness; Only tears.

It is with great distaste that I speak of his ventures,

Even though you might have heard of his adventures.

Gilderoy Lockhart is his name, does it ring any bells?

In every library the collection of his books dwells.

​

​

He who spent a year with the Yeti, holidays with hags,

Had a break with a banshee, with house pests played tags.

Wandered with werewolves, traveled with a troll,

Voyaged with a vampire, gadded with a ghoul...

But enough of /his/ achievements, for they are not his.

Do not believe in his poisonous tale, whatever it is.

​

​

Feeble is the mind of those that take credit for other's work,

For that is precisely what happened here, he's a shirk.

A fraud, some might say, steals tales and usurps them,

He'd find those who achieved great deeds 'n' give them rum,

They'd drink, and drink, and drink, until they passed out cold,

Gilderoy'd then steal their memories and make lots of gold.

He'd hurry to his study room and write all of this down;

Few weeks later you would see his new publication around.


** It's quite a sweet song.
