Rumour has it that following the Opening Feast, she locked herself away in the Headmistress's Office, along with enough alcohol to drown an Abraxan, and refuses to come out until Harry Potter owns up to his latest mess.

  Harry Potter was not really ready for a family. Who is? This is not really a Harry/Harem story - he doesn't even get laid until the very end of things... But it's funny. I promise.

  The problem: muggleborns face terrible discrimination, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things are only getting worse. The solution: Find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them, even if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way!
