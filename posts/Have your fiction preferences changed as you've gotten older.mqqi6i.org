So I'm curious, has anyone drastically changed their favorite tropes or preferred pairings as a direct result of getting older and having different life experiences?

If so, was it something specific or just the general impact of learning & perspective changes over the years?

I definitely have higher standards for the quality of writing but in general I still prefer the same kinds of tropes and the same central character across all my fav fandoms.

My biggest change in HP fandom is in pairings, specifically Drarry and Snarry. They used to be some of my favorite pairings (and I still read some fics) but I now have a very low threshold for it.

My perspective on the book canon characterization was the thing that changed (I find Snape very toxic and Draco too immature in a way I didn't used to) and now I just can't suspend my disbelief enough to enjoy the fic anymore - and I know it's silly, cause it's fiction and in an AU the characters can be very different, but it's just how I feel now.

(this is all about personal preferences, there is no insult or kink shaming intended)


** It changed a bit. I used to really love angst and dark fics. I used to be able to read 100k words of misery for misery's sake. Now, I can't stand them anymore. I need to be assured of a happy ending before I start an angst fic, and the angst has to be purposeful otherwise I'll drop the fic.

Other than that, I now lean more towards romance and character studies. I like fics that really dive deep into the head of a character and how they play off each other.

Because of this, I don't read Harmione fics as much as I used to. I am very attached to their characters and dynamics in the books, but with both Harry and Hermione being popular self-insert characters, it's so rare to find stories that remain faithful to the canon characterization and dynamics.

Even pre-covid I started gravitating towards escapism in my media, and just don't want to use my free time to be experience more angst - plenty enough of that to go around.

****** I wouldn't call it a lessening of character, at least not personally - I just didn't have the same frame of reference then, and filled in emotional and experiential gaps with the media I consumed. Now I have lived experiences to inform how certain types of trauma feel (like death, illness, and pain), and don't feel compelled to willingly revisit those feelings or pick at emotional scabs in my leisure time, if that makes sense.

******* What you say makes sense intuitively but I don't fully trust my instincts. I believe that stories are how we humans gird ourselves to face the traumas of life. When we were younger perhaps we were more willing to face these stories because we were bolder, more willing to compete, to maybe suffer loss, in pursuit of our goals. I'm wondering if, as we've aged, we've found our place, fought our wars so to speak, and thus become too comfortable and unwilling to face the unpleasantnesses that we used to. And I'm wondering if that reflects a loss of competitive spirit.

I'm thinking about myself mostly of course. But also wondering if I'm alone in thinking in these terms.

** No I totally get where ur coming from. I used to love reading fics where the main character goes against the grain. I was young and edgy and watching young characters kick the shit out of the canon and world and logic their way through everything was awesome. The problem is I read in worlds like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Naruto, my hero, etc. those fics all follow kids. And those kids will start back talking older, experienced, leaders like their an idiot and just be right 90% of the time. looking at some of the shit I used to read now I cringe. I still like a character going against the grain, but now it's a requirement of mine that it be as thought out and dare I say it realistic as possible.

I wonder if that's why people started to write fics where the characters are excessively formal and speaking as if they were "adults". And by "adult" I don't mean just being formal, but using jargon on complicated subjects that even adults don't usually talk about.

But I don't remember the dialogues themselves well, so I was wondering what dialogue do you think is most forced? And I don't watch much anime / game / film, but there are a lot of cases where a child just doesn't sound like a child.

** Let's first of all agree that our standards are higher. I think that'll hold relatively well across the board.

I found that as I got older and revisited HPFF since leaving 10 years ago, several changes occurred:

1) My sense of humour got drier; situational comedy was not as amusing, nor was twin speak and pranking

2) I got out of my teens and stopped thinking "oh my god it's a SEX SCENE" whether for comedy, drama or smut purposes

3) I had more appreciation for longer, well-written mysteries

4) I empathised lots more with post-DH/Epilogue Trio-deals-with-raising-kids type stories, and the conflicts found in those stories

And not least

5) I had less patience for AU fics. Because canon is hard enough to deal with as is.

** I used to read a fair amount of shipping fic, but now I really prefer gen and avoid smut if at all possible. If it's a plot centric fic with sex scenes, I skip the sex scenes. I'm not a prude, I just find sex boring and I want them to get back to the plot. I am also now really into female Harry, where I used to avoid it. I even started writing my own female Harry series and that never would have happened ten years ago. I'm also now more into Slytherins and Snape.

Some things that have stayed the same: I love time travel, hurt/comfort, plot focused, characters with a mission/plan/con. I generally prefer the magic to stay similar to canon, but having some additions or explanations isn't a bad thing.

Not sure if that made sense - but romance playing a big role is fine by me, smut is a bit iffier (it's not easy to write well and integrate into a good plot), but if either becomes the whole focus of the thing I'm going to lose interest. Eg, I was reading an interesting Draco timetravel one a month or so back, that was pretty well done - and then it (in an entirely understandable/foreseeable way from the plot/characterization) became heavily/almost entirely about Draco and Harry being horny for each other. Which makes sense for 5th year - but, um, it made the chapters drag on for me when they seemed to all be about that.

Smut for the sake of smut is a huge no. It detracts from the story. It adds nothing.

** For me, I've found that I've kind of become a writing quality snob to some extent. I paused my fanfiction reading for a good 4-5 years post university and exclusively read published books again, and usually the ones that got Hugo, Nebula and World Fantasy Awards or nominations, at the very least.

So when I came back to fanfiction years later, I suddenly didn't have the patience for very badly written prose. Like I will happily gloss over the occasional spelling or grammar error (up to 1-2 per chapter), but really *bad* writing is something I simply can't read anymore.

Also because I've read so many fics in the indy!Harry and OP!Harry subgenres as a teenager, they've become unbearable to me.

I don't mind fanfiction that is geared towards a specific ship, but, from what I've read or been recommended in the ship side of HP fanfiction stories, the romance is usually god awfully written or maybe I just don't have the patience for it *shrug*

I also read a LOT more humour fanfiction these days, but that maybe because of the general doom and gloom of the past year and the half and the state of the world in general.

** Apart from the obvious higher standard in writing style (because now I actually know how to find the good stuff), I find myself gravitating towards older characters. I've been reading a lot of post-Hogwarts stuff in the last few years, because I've kind of moved on from the original series but am still in love with the world. There are only so many canon retellings you can read, so I prefer stuff that broadens the wizarding world. My favourites now are fics with adult Harry&friends or people we meet as adults (Remus, McGonagall, Sprout). Pairings don't matter as much to me anymore.

I have little patience for the good girl/angsty brooding bad boy trope. ESP when it involves her trying to “fix him”.

I really like fics that have the characters post-school. And more new adult themes. I'll still read younger but I really prefer the new adult stuff.

I have high standards on smut. No tolerance for sex god BDSM master 16 yr old boy.

I'm much more aware of toxic and unhealthy romance themes. I can't explain but it's harder for me to get into things where (if it's a straight couple) the girl and guy don't seem on equal footing. Like both of them are toxic? Ok...but the guy toxic and the girl just bends over backwards doing emotional labor? No. Also the “I hate everyone but u” trope on guys....and the thing where the guy is very very overprotective of the girl like she's made of glass. Just no. I mean I like a dark morally grey fic sure but I feel like these kinds of themes are overly romanticized within the story.

** I started to avoid romance more and more, because I simply find the romances in majority of fanfics way too unrealistic (Example: falling in love waay too fast, just being eternally happy with no arguments or difficulties) or borderline toxic (the age old 'GIRL FINDS A BAD BOY AND TRIES TO MAKE HIM SEE THE LIGHT (dramione is especially guilty of this). )

It is exceptionally rare I see any good romance in fanfiction, and when smut also begins to enter the fanfic, I am out and will not look back.

** I used to really like reading about OP characters. It's a bit embarrassing. I just can't read junk like that anymore. Now my favorite trope is time-travel, which is an expansion off the OP thing. A character who time-travels has a fair amount of power with their knowledge, but it's not over the top, since it's not anything tangible, and the future is constantly changing. I mostly enjoy the character interactions, and having other characters slowly realize something is off. It sort of reminds me of angst, which I also used to read, but not very often. Makes your heart race a bit, and you anticipate the next twist. I also CANNOT STAND it when a character does something that would never work in real life. I'm not talking about magic and plot armor, and all that. Say a character does something that would never be well received in real life, and the other characters just brush it off. I can't really describe what exactly, but I know it when I seeing, and it drives me mad.

** My views on FF changed with my views on canon HP. It's kind of a chicken or the egg thing. But as I grew older, I was more critical of the adults, more analytical about the plot and details, and more knowledgeable about what it's actually like being in near-death experiences. Naturally, my views on canon shifted and I can barely tolerate reading FF that is too canon compliant. Most of the stuff I read now is either AU or is about characters that don't really appear much in canon (e.g. Tonks family, other side characters). Incidentally, most fanfictions are also quite critical towards various canon details, so I'm really not sure whether my opinions shifted so drastically because of the fics I read or if the fics I read shifted so drastically because my opinions shifted.

** Indy!Harry got old real fucking quick. I'm honestly not convinced I ever really liked it, it's just that there was a broad stretch of time where the only fics of any quality and length being written were independent Harry sticking it to the man. I feel as though I didn't really mind it at first, but over time I've grown to hate it. I greatly prefer stories where the various "good guys" work together and sometimes at cross-purposes to try and solve greater mysteries or big problems, but those are rare. Good luck trying to find a story where Dumbledore means well, Harry doesn't act like an indy cunt, the bad guys are intelligent, and nobody gets bashed or flanderized.

I am the Fanfiction Lorax, I speak for the OCs; use moldyshorts, old goat, pup, or flaming chicken again, and I'll break both your knees.

I also didn't really care about pairings at all, but now the only stuff that seems even remotely realistic is Harry and Hermione, or in some instances Gabrielle, Katie Bell, Angelia, Tonks, and the few other women he had regular contact with and something resembling an actual friendship. Unless you're running an AU where Harry meets different on the train and has totally different friends or something, it just doesn't feel very convincing anymore. I didn't use to mind Harry Ginny, but I've read so much of it now that I've started to feel like it doesn't work because Ginny is basically an OC. Rowling gave her zero personality besides being an ascended fangirl, so while there are good Ginny fics out there, they're also not really Ginny, any more than a Severitus fic has any-fucking-thing to do with canon Severus Snape. It's a different character entirely, and I feel like you can only go so far with that before it's time to just throw in the towel and give it a rest.

I can't really stand anything that makes use of book 7's sequence of events anymore. Even slightly. Remus hooking up with Tonks has only gotten weirder and more inexplicable as time has gone on. I can't really imagine Ron with anyone besides someone like Lavender. Pairing Bill and Fleur up along with Tonks and Remus feels extremely random, and gives a sort of impression that Rowling was just pulling names out of a hat or something. "I need a marriage for the plot because I need a crashed marriage dramatic battle, but I haven't developed anybody enough to sell that yet, time to write the names of all the tertiary characters down and do some blind draws." Never mind the weirdness of Tonks marrying a man over twice her age whose canon personality is bland and depressing: if Fleur could get over all the problems she seems to have dealing with people and fall in love with Bill after having barely known him for a year, then by all rights Harry should be going on dates with some girl from Smeltings or something. Which honestly would be a pretty funny AU to explore: Harry/OC, Harry has and struggles to maintain a relationship with some totally normal girl that is his sole childhood friend: he tries to keep the worlds separate but can't, and she inevitably gets dragged into it.

As an extension of that, I can't really stomach those kinds of AUs that tell a new story or a new sequence of events, but then just default to the way Rowling did it for everything that is actually important. Sirius gets exonerated and Harry learns how to turn into a magical panther or something while carrying dual enchanted glocks with him, but the graveyard scene still goes exactly the same way it always does and nothing actually new or interesting happens: MASSIVE AU, but Harry/Ginny Ron/Hermione Remus/Tonks Arthur/Molly DH Compliant Albus and Scorpius get on the train in the end. What was even the point, then?

I used to read everything and not really care. But some things become much more obnoxious over time. AUs that don't really diverge on anything important. Defaulting to Rowling's own pairings which don't make any sense at all because you want romance involved but aren't creative enough to deviate in any real way. Stuff that turns Dumbledore into a dark lord or Molly Weasley into a potions rapist. Funnily enough, you never seen Snape using Amorentia on anybody to push students together or ship pairings for his own amusement: another funny or dark idea that you won't ever see. Molly being evil and manipulative was edgy and novel at some point, but that boat sailed years ago.

Seriously though, if you care about romance at all, at least don't copy canon, because it doesn't make sense. Logically Tonks would hook up with someone like Bill, and even though I'm not a Harmonian, that was obviously the correct canon pairing, it makes the most sense and it certainly feels the most thematically correct and "vanilla." Rowling has literally admitted that Hermione was her self-insert and that she modeled Ron after her own husband and the relationship she has with him. She's also admitted that she regrets not pairing Harry and Hermione, but that she can't really change it now. So let's all just admit that she has a dysfunctional marriage that she couldn't help but project onto the books and move on.

I think most of all, though, I really just want complete stories with happy endings. It's surprising how rare those seem to be. Harry was a huge downer in canon even though he lead one of the most heroic and chad lives it's possible to live: a happy ending or a more happy and confidant Harry are the things that interest me these days.

And he should really use the sword of Gryffindor more. I know how I was when I was fourteen, I would have walked around with it everywhere if I could have gotten away with it. Seriously.

What logic is that?

Not to rain on your parade, to each his own, but one of the main reasons I like this universe so much is the nuanced characters, who feel like real people.\\
It's normal for someone to like someone because he's kind, even if he's also depressing and bland. It's even /usual/ for someone subdued from hardships to gravitate towards someone full of life, even if maybe a calm support would do them better. People who have trouble dealing with other people quite likely /will/ latch onto the first person they meet they don't have that problem with. And so on.

To just want similar people to be paired seems sadly reductive to me.

Because they're the same age, because they have similar interests, because they would actually have a future together. Because Tonks Bill would still exist in thirty years, while Tonks Remus absolutely would not.

"To just want similar people to be paired" isn't "reductive," it's real. It's more realistic than Rowling's drawn-from-a-hat pairings. Opposites don't attract, people who complete each other attract. They may appear opposite on the surface, but in reality they are not. It is their similarities that give them a foundation to build love on, love is built, it's not something you fall into. That's lust.

Remus and Tonks didn't have a relationship, they fucked and then he died and left her pregnant. Then she died too, and Harry was left holding a baby. Nothing about Remus helped or completed Tonks, and nothing about Tonks was good for Remus either. Remus didn't understand any of the struggles and issues she had with her life as a metamorph, and her abilities as a metamorph wouldn't have helped her understand or emphasize with a guilt-ridden man whose friends are all dead and who believes he is a monster undeserving of love. The two of them together is red flags all over the place. Their experiences did not equip either of them to build any kind of foundation between them that love could have grown on. The two of them could not help each other, or heal each other, even in a one-sided way of one helping the other. Them having sex was the high point of their relationship, that's as far as it could ever go. Remus and Tonks is just the story of a young woman fucking a much older man because it seems exciting, and then getting pregnant without planning to. It happens all the time. Guess how many of those relationships end happily ever after? If the war hadn't killed them, they would have eventually broken apart, and Teddy's existence would have merely accelerated that. Babies don't stabilize bad relationships, they hasten their end.

The irony is, you're right. Tonks being a stupid cunt who had a one-night stand with someone exciting that's twice their age and then forgot to put a condom on or use contraceptive IS realistic. That happens all the time in real life, and it ALWAYS ends badly. The bad joke is that you're using the fact that it's realistic to suggest that it is a viable relationship, and not a doomed fling with a baby nobody wanted thrown into the middle of the whirlwind for extra drama.

Remus Tonks wouldn't have lasted five years after the war ended, if both of them had survived. That's also real. That's realistic. Their mutual deaths saved their relationship. It was preserved forever mid-whirlwind. The self-destructive explosion at the end never got to happen.

****** And I'll try and ignore how you've lost the plot of the entire thread, which was a question asking have your fiction preferences changed as you've gotten older, and if so, how?

I've been at a loss on what to say about your complaints on my preferences from the beginning. You're just whining. Yes, I prefer to not see characters engage in obviously self-destructive and doomed behavior, because I've seen quite enough of it. Which is what quite a few of the pairings in Harry Potter are: Hermione and Ron are doomed for divorce in any sane universe that isn't authorial wish fulfillment, and Remus and Tonks would have been doomed to a loud and violent separation if they had both lived.

And yes, their relationship IS inexplicable, which is what */my words/* were, emphasis because you seem to be feeding me your words and then arguing about it. It is inexplicable because they were surrounded by meddlers and well-wishers who should have stopped them from making the obvious mistake they did when they conceived Teddy. With how much Molly Weasley tried to run Sirius' own house and affairs for him, and with how much she complained and ran the ear off of everybody about what was proper and correct behavior for young adults and adults, I find it completely unbelievable that Remus wouldn't catch a tea kettle to the face for having a roll with Tonks, a woman half his age, when Molly nearly has an aneurism every time Tonks, Ginny, or Hermione walk around in "improper" clothes. It is completely unbelievable and very inexplicable, that nobody in the Order cared, that Molly Weasley didn't care, and that neither of Tonk's parents cared. For that matter, it's inexplicable that /Remus/ didn't care, or at least didn't care enough to turn her down flat and push her away. It goes against everything that was established about his character. I am talking, and have always been talking, about characters behaving in-character or out-of-character. */You're/* the one who brought up what was "normal," what was "real." Not me. That's */your/* talking point, not mine.

If you don't want to talk about "realism," then don't bring it up, or waste my time by forgetting that you're the one who brought it up in the first place. You're the one who brought up what was "real," what was "normal." You're the one who called my opinions "reductive" and "boring" and then started going on about normalcy and realism.

From the very beginning, you don't even have a point. You don't know what you're arguing for. You whine about my preferences and opinions and call them banal and boring, you claim that I'm reducing characters because you misunderstand what a "summary" is (that post is quite long and talks about many things, not just one thing, sorry I didn't write a doctoral thesis on the one specific thing you decided to nitpick about). You start us on this track of realism and then abort and suddenly want to know why we're talking about realism, like I care about it at all, like we aren't talking about a relationship between a shape shifter and a werewolf, like you aren't the one who brought this up in the first place. And you're still ignoring the original point, which I've never stopped talking about, because apparently you don't care or just don't want to see it. That point being, yes, I have a preference, it's for people to have happy relationships with people who are good for them, and for people to behave in-character.

You've done nothing but obliquely imply that Remus and Tonks is a "good" relationship because it is "realistic" without ever expounding any further than that. Nothing could possibly be further from anything I said: I called it weird and inexplicable, which it is. It is a choice that doesn't make sense, it doesn't match facts and characterizations that were previously established, people around them did not react in a manner befitting what we know of them either, and no explanation for any of that was ever given. Fleur and Bill was also drawn out of a hat, but at least Fleur got a character arc out of it.

Their relationship is an out-of-character event. Remus was the responsible one and never would have allowed it to happen, he was so straight laced he wouldn't even share any information with Harry on what the Order was or what Voldemort was doing, which Sirius vocally disapproved of. Molly didn't give a shit, which I find improbable in the extreme. Tonk's parents are ghosts that don't exist and didn't care, even though they were so intimately involved in the Order that Harry was taken TO Ted Tonks when he was injured during the beginning escape sequence in book 7, with both Ted and Andromeda being trusted and involved enough to be caretakers for Order safehouses. Tonks doesn't have any kind of understanding or pull with Remus to get him to open up, especially not after Sirius died. If Remus couldn't give Harry the time of day because he was too busy rolling around in his own sadness and sense of extreme responsibility, there's no reason for anybody to believe Tonks could succeed well enough to be impregnated.

Rowling pulled their names out of a hat to create that relationship. I don't give a rat's ass how realistic you think that is in hindsight. I'm not talking about whatever you refer to when you call something "realistic." When I use that word, in the context of a work of fiction, I'm referring to the fiction making sense within it's own established setting, which is realism as defined by the standards of literary criticism. When you use the word, you're talking about real life. Using your definition, fiction is not realistic, and never has been. It is incredibly structured and engineered, it is full of utterly improbable coincidences, it follows its own previously established rules, it proceeds in a sequential order of events that by definition must make sense, and it nearly always features some sort of aesop or political message. Nothing could be further from the true kind of realism you seem to be obsessing over than a work of fiction. There is nothing spontaneous about a detective novel or The Lord of The Rings. If anything, the detective novel, which is what Rowling obviously based the structure of the series on, is the most aggressively curated and least spontaneous of all storytelling formats.

At this point, I don't really expect you to see or address the original point. Obviously you've completely missed it, and there really isn't any further point talking to you about something you aren't paying attention to and have no interest in. I reread my entire original post twice just to double check, and I only ever used the word "realistic" once, in reference to Harry having relationships with girls he spends large amounts of time with at school, like Hermione or the Gryffindor Chasers. No, I'm not arguing for "real" and never was. I don't care about realism. Thanks for finally catching up, I'm glad we needed twenty paragraphs to establish that you're arguing about a complete non sequitur.

If I wanted to watch adult children wallow in the consequences of ruining their lives, I could just go for a walk. Most people read fiction and fantasy for the escapism. Shocking, I know.

***** They didn't have a one night stand at all. Tonks was clearly in love with him so much that her patronus changed to match Remus' (hers turned into a Wolf)

We don't even get enough characterization in canon or moments of them together to see how they really fit together in a day to day basis to judge that they “were clearly bad for each other” like what?

Tonks and Remus spent a lot of time together working missions for the Order it's not strange they would fall in love with each other.

Why do you just assume Tonks and Remus don't have similar interests but Tonks and Bill do?

Tonks is an auror so is knowledgeable in the dark arts and Remus is knowledgeable about the dark arts that he can teach a school. So they have that in common. They both can hold their own in a duel they have that in common, both competent. Both care for their loved ones. Tonks clearly likes a good laugh and people who play off her jokes, Remus spent his entire school years being a marauder and playing pranks and jokes so he's certainly able to let loose if he's around friends and loved ones.

*** You do a disservice to Ginny. I agree people don't always write her well but she has a personality she doesn't just exist as a fan girl...

Also we basically know nothing about Bill we hardly get to know him. We know he's handsome and a curse breaker and popular. Why wouldn't someone like Fleur who is also really attractive, also a powerful knowledgeable wizard, also really popular not get with Bill? Again with what we know about Bill's personality there's nothing there that wouldn't work with Fleur. We just don't really know Bill or Charlie. As for why they got married so fast it's uh because there's a war, Bill is in the order and could die at any time so when they fall in love they want to get married ASAP. This is actually quite common IRL when there's a war going on people get married a lot quicker than they otherwise would.

Also I think Remus is only like a bit over 10 years older than Tonks. It's not that unheard of for this to happen. Remus is depressed but that doesn't mean he isn't loveable? Remus is also extremely smart, kind, and has a sense of humor. And again it's war time everyone is rushing to get married.

**** No, I'm not doing a disservice to Ginny. I'm being brutally honest about the reality of the situation, which is that she's an ascended fangirl. The person who did her a disservice was Rowling. She was introduced in book 2, and nothing interesting was done with her, ever. She got zero development. Then near the very end, suddenly Rowling starts aggressively pushing her to the forefront of the story, making her character seem off-putting with how forward it was and how unnatural her being thrust into the limelight felt. Harry has no reason to even like Ginny, let alone "love" her. The monster-in-the-chest scene is widely panned as being utterly ridiculous, and */rightly so./*

Ginny went from being a childish fangirl, to behaving like a jealous ex even though they had never been together in the first place (dragging other boys into closets and dating to try and make Harry jealous), to suddenly monster-in-chest and now they're a couple.

That's not love. That's not even sexual arousal. It's a joke. It's no wonder literally thousands of fans put a pin on that exact moment to say "and that's where she obviously love potioned him." Because that's /exactly/ what it looks like.

I know what good Ginny looks like. I've read good Ginny. I've */written/* good Ginny. Good Ginny does not exist in canon, and if you think she does, you've obviously not reread the books recently. Severitus is a great idea that makes Snape a much more interesting and compelling character, and I enjoy reading those stories, but it's not fucking canon. It's an OC wearing Snape's face. Snape isn't Severitus and never was, or could have been. He proved that solely through his behavior towards Neville. He was a shallow and unrepentant bastard that abused children to gratify his own ego, and Rowling inexplicably expected us to forgive after forcing him to make doe eyes at us. Good Ginny is not any fundamentally different from Severitus. Lots of writers can do Ginny justice, but Rowling is not one of them, and she's the only one that counts.

I'm not doing a disservice to anybody. I'm being honest. Your bone to pick is with Rowling, not me. Actual love and romance is built up over time with mutual bonds and trust, it's not a monster in your chest telling you to start frenching a girl you've never cared about until now. That's why so many people argue that Harry/Hermione or Harry/Luna makes more sense. It's because it /does/.

If Rowling really wanted Ginny to be with Harry that badly, then she wasted 90% of the series. Look at all this space for build up where fuck-all was done. Luna got more emotional rapport with Harry in a few chapters of book 5 than Ginny got with him in six books.

If this was a democracy the Harmonians would have it, and I'm not even one of them. The reason they 'have' it is because they recognize that love is built up over time, and not something crammed down your throat in the span of a few months. As such, the closest thing to real love that exists in canon is Harry/Hermione, with Harry/Luna as a distant second. Ginny isn't even really in the running.

You call it an 'opinion' because */you personally don't like it./* Feel free to prove it wrong. I've told no lie. Ginny all but disappeared for four years, she only became relevant near the very end of the series. The lion's share of her character development happened /off-screen,/ where Harry certainly couldn't have seen it. Where's the character development? Where's the slow and gradual buildup over time? It's nowhere. You can cite nothing.

Save your dissertation, I've see somebody go on for 100k words on why Snape and Hermione should be having sex in a closet. Any idiot can talk about anything for hours if they have half the wit to string sentences together.

Harry and Ginny didn't have real love, and neither did Ron and Hermione. Real love is built up over time. Rowling pushed them together because she had an agenda, and she's even admitted it. Rowling has admitted across several interviews that she pushed Ron and Hermione together because she viewed Hermione as herself and thought of Ron as a sort of proxy for her own real-life husband. She also admitted that Harry and Ginny got together solely as a consequence of that. Which is another way of saying Ginny was just the spare loose end that could be tied to Harry for convenience.

Furthermore, the actors who played the parts in the movies all agree. Watson felt that Hermione's relationship with Ron was "dangerous and unstable," and that it wouldn't last. Rupert Grint agreed, saying that he's "pretty sure Ron would have divorced her already and moved on."

You can't talk about Harry and Ginny without talking about Ron and Hermione, because the only reason Harry/Ginny existed in canon was because she was the convenient loose end that was lying around after Rowling de-facto decided Ron and Hermione absolutely had to end up with each other.

Rowling has admitted in other interviews that if she could redo the series, Harry would end up with Hermione. Ginny would just be a friend, no different from Neville or Luna.

So spare me the essays on how you and a few other people are absolutely convinced they're soul mates. I wanted Harry to end up with Luna, but I got over it. You need to get over it, too.

"For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron." What's more, Rowling went on to actually admit that Harry and Hermione should have been endgame.

Additionally, all THREE of the actors who played the parts in the movies felt that Ron and Hermione's relationship was doomed, and that Harry/Hermione made more sense after everything was taken into account. Watson doesn't think Ron could have ever truly made Hermione happy. Grint says that the marriage would have imploded and that Ron would have divorced Hermione by now.

I'm not a Harmonian. I don't really care. If I could have gotten any pairing I personally wanted, it would have been Harry Luna, because I feel like it would have been therapeutic for Harry and that they were the best match for the other, emotionally and in attitude. They would have healed each other. But Rowling HAS admitted that she regrets not pairing Harry and Hermione, she HAS admitted that their relationship was projection and wish fulfillment on her part, and she HAS admitted that Hermione makes far more sense with Harry. She has gone so far as to imply that if she could do the series over, she would pair them together. Though that was merely an implication, not a confirmation.

Harry Hermione makes the most sense as the core relationship of the entire series, and both the author and all the actors in the movies have admitted it. I don't understand you people who still cling to denial.

** God, I've got to get off Reddit. I'm so tired, right now. Procrastination!

Not really? I'm pretty widespread in my tropes - although the only thing I can ever read is drarry, anything else I can't stand.\\
I prefer not to read sex, but contradictory I find it difficult to read T-rated fics since I, prejudicially I admit, believe that the writing is going to be less mature.\\
As for tropes, anything angst - except mpreg or MCD - is pretty much my jam. Marriage contracts and magic/world-building...politics, too.\\
There's a lot of stuff I enjoy.

** When I was younger I loved hero stories, good overcomes evil, good guy falls in love. Now... Jesus Christ, I am a gluten for dark and fucked up stories. The kind of things that when I finish a chapter I needa go take a shower. And my god the smut, I can't look at normal fics the same anymore. If I was to be judged at the gates of heaven with my fic history my ass would be punted sooo hard the devil himself would be holding up score cards.

** I have got suuuuuppppper into Wolfstar since I first got in to fanfiction. I stumbled upon The Shoebox Project back when it was still being updated on livejournal and it made them my OTP. Now I read marauders era Sirius/Remus almost exclusively though I have recently started branching out to non-Magic AU's of the same pairing. I never thought I'd like them, but then I gave Text Talk and chance and it was cute as hell so I read Sweater Weather (twice in a row...) and now I really like them 😂

** I think my tolerance for poor writing has decreased - but otherwise, the major thing I've noticed is that I'm more sensitive/alert to certain jokes/throwaway comments/problematic inclusions, which I'm going to blame to being on the internet over the past few years :P

But in terms of what sort of fics that catch my eye, that's been relatively unchanged. I suppose I'm more open towards the less action-y ones than I was a long while back, but... On the whole? If it's well written, I've always been likely to enjoy it!

** I used to love reading fics with 200k words and up and actually reading them all. Absorbing the stuff the author wrote for the worldbuilding, the type of governance and the like, the way how a school system works, spells, all the detailed stuff.

Now I prefer reading fics with less 100k words and even I still skim paragraphs most of the time just so I could get on with the main plot.

I also used to love reading long and detailed battle scenes. Now I just skip it to the part where one gets injured or dies and the other remains standing and alive.

** I started with Dramione, then moved over to Drarry. For a long time I stuck with that but started liking more neutral/slightly dark Harry. At the same time I hated, literally despited, the idea of Harry&Tom/Voldemort ship (same for any ship with Snape but that one still prevails).

After that I grew up from Wattpad mania and moved over to FanFiction.Net and AO3. Now, I'm unable to read fanfictions where main ship isn't Harry&Tom/Voldemort. Either I read something with that ship or a story that doesn't have a ship for Harry at all. Also, I only read things with Harry as the main character and still like the idea of neutral/dark (also evil if it's nicely written) Harry.

It's the one true ship for me and that will probably never change again xD

** It's kind of funny how there are two main camps here - the ones who used to read stupid things and now realise and can't stomach it anymore, instead looking for quality, and the ones who used to read quality stuff and now can't be bothered to add to the pressure of real life, instead seeking out the stupid and the simple.

I'm in the second camp. (Though there /is/ still some level of simple which won't do.)

And how some people used to like dark angsty angst and now want a happy ending, while others went from fluff when they were younger to angst cause they relate more.

I still switch between both, but now I have to plan it so I don't fall into an angst pit without recovery time lol.
