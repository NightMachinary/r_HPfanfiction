An oft discussed topic, but one that should be refreshed every few months.

How do you fight through writer's block? Are there specific techniques you use when dealing with writer's block? Are you having writer's block right now?


** I said it before but if feels like I'm in constant writer's block. I don't know if anyone has it like myself. It's like this: I know exactly what I want to write but I just can't bring myself to do it. The only way I found to break this was to simply force myself. But even then I write a 100 words at most and give up for that day. It's annoying as hell because I want to write a really long fic, but I barely have more than 7k :/

** I sometimes get drunk to force my way through a writer's block. Dialogue becomes very easy to write and that helps a lot. I'm currently working on a story where Sirius is one of the main characters and writing about him while I'm drunk works perfectly.

It's not healthy at all, I know, but at least it helps.

** Think about what drives you to write. If it's reading good stories, read good stories (preferably not fanfiction, so you can get fresh ideas). If it's reading shitty fics that makes you want to improve them, go over shitty fics (they aren't hard to find). If you're writing because you wanted to explore the world of HP more, read the books again and write down the concepts that you want to see explored. Sometimes reading theories about the books can change my perspective, open my mind so to say.

Simply taking a break can help as well. Fanfiction isn't your job after all, you're doing it for fun, so you shouldn't stress too much over it - otherwise what's the point?
