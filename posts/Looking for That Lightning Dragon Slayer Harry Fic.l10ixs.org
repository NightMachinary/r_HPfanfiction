So, I Can't remember the title, but I remember it going in depth on him injuring himself attempting to activate his lightning slayer magic, going so far as to strike a tree with lightning. Any knowledge would help.


** Sounds like Fairy Tale by Araceil. If so, it's not copied over to their AO3 account (everything on ffn was deleted last summer).

It was also an unfinished story, but I have a download of the first 15 chapters. (Don't know if any more were ever posted; that's how many I had before discovering it was deleted.)
