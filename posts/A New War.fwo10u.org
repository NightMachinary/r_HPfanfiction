Prompt:

Decades after the fall of Voldemort, all is well for the heroes of the light. Hermione Weasley-Granger has been minister for many years. Together with Harry Potter, longest serving Head Auror, and Percy Weasley, Head of the Department of Magical Transportation, she has nearly completely eliminated the threat of pureblood supremacist ideology and Dark magic.

Then, from her deathbed, Sybill Trelawney prophesizes of a child who will lead the way to finding the Source of Magic, through which all magic can be controlled.

Chaos erupts and old allies become enemies. Hermione wants the Source in the control of her reformed Ministry. Luna Scamander and Hogwarts Headmaster Neville Longbottom oppose her and want the Source to remain outside anyone's control. The rest of the former Order and DA are divided between these sides.

The goblins and other magical beings as well as the remnants of the Dark also seek to control the Source.


** I wonder where Harry and Ron would fall. Probably with Neville and Luna. It would make a really interesting sub plot of them having difficulty going against their friend and in Ron's case his wife. They would probably take the children and go into hiding either at Hogwarts or put up Fidelius Charms on a new hide out. They would be on a mad race to find the source before others and try to put it under fidelius and obliviate it from the secret keeper or make an unbreakable vow to never under any circumstance let it's location be known to another person or creature.

*** Yeah there's a lot of room for characters struggling with divided loyalties here. Harry would have helped build the Ministry as it currently is, is that enough to make him trust it with this power?

The 'children' are also an area for interesting stories here. They would be mostly grown by this point and would be making their own choices for where to place their loyalty.

**** I don't think so. He would have faith in Hermione not to abuse it but he knows very well how easy it is for the Ministry to abuse it's authority as he has seen people become it's victims (Hagrid, Sirius, Buckbeak) and has himself been a victim of the Ministry. He is also prudent enough to think of the ramifications when he was 17 as shown by his actions regarding the Hollows and has been an Auror for than 2 decades.

He would probably have arguments with Hermione trying his best to make her reconsider and Hermione would do her best to make him see the benifits of her course of actions.

Another layer would be that Harry has led the aurors for a good while. He has fought alongside them and lead them. He would be highly respected, admired and liked which would make it really difficult for the Ministry to go against him with it's superior numbers as the Aurors would be reluctant and suspicious about going against Harry and many might retire or secretly defect and be a spy for him.

On the flip side Harry would not try to make it a public matter to prevent causing public disturbance to prevent increase in crimes and to save Hermione's reputation. He would try not to bring his comrades in the matter so that the Aurors would still be there to protect the public. They would be only asked to help if he needed it.

This would lead to it being a small team of Hermione and her most trusted trying to hunt for the Source while also trying to capture the others. They would not be fugitives officially as declaring them so would be risky as they have a lot of influence due to their positions.

It would be really interesting to see it.

** There was actually a fic similar to this where UnspeakableChief!Hermione believed that she could harness the Hallow's energy to cure magical ailments and so she tries to hunt down Harry and force him to give up the Hallows. Can't remember the name, unfortunately, but hopefully somebody here remembers it.

*** That's the one where Dumbledore added a compulsion charm to the copy of the Beedle Bard he left her, right?

I'm thinking of this one as more a benevolent(ish) dictator!Hermione fic than an Insane!Hermione fic like that one was. It is a great fic though, dark and gruesome but well done.

**** u/Efficient_Assistant:
#+begin_quote
  It is a great fic though
#+end_quote

The fic in general was really well written and I enjoyed the whole cat and mouse aspect of the work. Just like canon however, I enjoyed everything except the epilogue. Unlike canon, which was an ending I could at least feel ambivalent about, the epilogue of Hallows and Pathos left me with a really bitter taste in my mouth.

PS: Thanks for reminding me of the name! :)
