I don't remember reading any stories with either Harry's parent or Harry being Survivalist or Preppers. Maybe his parents have a better fall back plan than the Fidelis and either survive or trap the house.

Just an odd idea for a story.


** Mm, now imagine that...Voldemort tries to kill the Potters by sending a small army of Inferi against them, but the Potters are prepped and the thing turns into a zombie apocalypse siege.

** Yes. Linkffn(The Guardian Wand).

It's about an emp going off. The Grangers are the preppers though

  Dumbledore's dead. On the train ride home, cars are at a standstill, the electricity is out, fires burn unchecked from Scotland to London, and chaos reigns in muggle Britain. Somehow Harry has to survive this new world while destroying Voldemort.

*** Mm, this looks interesting.

Question, though; do Time-Turners come up in the plot at all? I know that in canon, the British stock of them was lost in the Department of Mysteries battle in book 5 and wasn't replaced for a long time, but still...?

EDIT: Sigh. Started off so well, but I just stopped being interested around Ch 30. The goblins were just too gratuitously greedy and...yeah, it stopped being interesting to read.
