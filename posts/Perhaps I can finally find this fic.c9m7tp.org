Hey all, hope you're doing well. This has been annoying me for over a decade now, and the thing is, I remember a fair amount of the fanfiction in question. It was on MuggleNet's old fanfiction portion of their site, probably around 2006 or so, as the fic included characters we first met in Order of the Phoenix.

Here's what I remember:

1. Harry walking through the Veil to commit suicide (because of Sirius' death, made for a great prologue)
2. Harry somehow coming back, obviously
3. Jack Sloper (one of the new Gryffindor Beaters) turning out to have been a Death Eater and curses... Ginny?
4. Frankly, a fair amount of sex scenes between Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione (and an excuse that since Harry came back from the Veil, he's been insatiable)
5. One or both couples somehow being allowed to have private chambers in Hogwarts (I never said it was a great fic)
6. Hermione's parents getting killed in a Death Eater attack, and she's comforted by Ron

I remember it being fairly long, but it was a 13-year-oldish me reading it, so take that with a grain of salt. As I said, it would have been around 2006ish, after OotP. I've been searching on and off for years, but have had no luck. Any idea what this one is/does anyone remember it?
