I'm like 95% sure it was on Ashwinder and was rated Wanton or Lascivious. IIRC, Hermione is chillin in the attic at Grimmauld Place and ends up talking to a portrait and learning about being like an apprentice or a pet. It's kind of hard to explain since I don't truly remember the entire story. I know the general idea is that she is supposed to be subservient to him. She decides to do this with Snape. She ends up like sitting at his feet while he reads, and everyone walks in and like freaks out over 'how it looks.' But when they approach it's like there is a magical barrier around Snape and Hermione.

I hope this is enough info. I've been browsing around on Ashwinder and haven't come across is yet. Thank you for any info you can provide!

*** I skimmed thru the first couple of chapters, and I'm almost positive this story is not the one I'm looking for. However, I am very excited about Chasing the Sun and plan to start reading it tonight! It seems familiar, and it's possible that I read it a long time ago, but I will definitely be reading! Thank you!

** I believe you are referring to "The Old Ways". I don't remember who the author was be she(?) wrote two versions of it, one before the release of the final books, and one post book7. I think both are on the wiktt site.

*** Thank you! I will look into this, I' at work atm. But again, even if this isn't the right story thank you! Any lead helps!

EDIT: Yes! This is it! Thank you! As soon as I read the title, it just sounded so familiar. I found the copies you mentioned on WIKTT! Thank you again!
