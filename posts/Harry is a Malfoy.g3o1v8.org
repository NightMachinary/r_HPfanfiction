:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi, I'm looking for a specific fic about where Harry is actually a Malfoy and thus is sent to the Malfoys. To integrate Harry into the society, the Malfoys gave Harry a tutor to learn from and uses some spell to teach Harry on etiquettes. Harry thinks that the Malfoys hate him because of the speed and what the tutor says until the tutor was exposed and fired. That's all I can remember since it has been a long time since I read this fic. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!
