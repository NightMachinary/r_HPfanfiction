I think we can all agree that the whole concept of house-elves as presented in the books is deeply problematic, but as a fan I don't really want to believe that the whole of the wizarding world is complicit in slavery, so here is my alternative in-universe explanation: what if house-elves see humans as their pets?

You get attached to your pet, you take care of it, you clean up after it (and here I'm going to assume that house-elf magic is powerful enough that this doesn't actually take that much effort for them), and it doesn't matter if your pet turns out to be a serious asshole, you're probably going to keep it anyway. It's a matter of pride, if nothing else. And clearly house-elf culture puts a lot of importance on their wizarding pets.

In this context getting clothes would be the equivalent of your dog running away; clearly something that's very upsetting.

What do you think?


** The amount of abuse Dobby goes through doesn't work with this idea.

It's much easier to simply say "fuck canon!" and turn the elves into servants, and ignore all the abusive parts. Make Dobby into some crazy servant torn between loyalty to "his" family and to Harry if you need to redo that plot.

*** But Dobby's canonically considered to be a weirdo by the other elves, so assuming house-elves are pretty much indestructible to physical abuse (which I always kind of thought anyway considering how casually he talks about ironing his own hands), he could be the kind of weirdo who 1) takes the whole thing way too seriously, and 2) is, what, proud that he can't even take care of his own wizard family?

That is an... interesting motivation.

Rowling intended her fictional world to be deeply flawed. Over the course of seven books we get to increasingly see the ugliness and the disarray behind the beauty of the magical world. The government ranges from inept to corrupt. Bigotry is common. At its most extreme is the violent terrorism of the Death Eaters. But there are also 'softer' forms, like Lupin struggling to get a job as a werewolf and only barely being allowed into Hogwarts. And that's just what's clearly meant by the author. Stepping outside that, it's easy to find evidence of more problems with wizarding Britain. For example, it can be seen as a society where child abuse is common and accepted---consider how casually it's mentioned that Neville was held by feet outside of a window by his great uncle, who 'accidentally' dropped him. One can also look for evidence of economic inequality. And there's the casual dismissal of muggles as having any sort of rights or being fully human---cough obliviation cough cough. Or the massive fucked up-ness that is Azkaban.

The house elf thing is just one more on the list (though admittedly, one that Rowling doesn't fully explore). Why would you want to whitewash over the author's presentation of her world as full of serious social ills?

*** This is a good summation. At best, the wizard-elf relationship is one of indentured servitude. In reality and practice, it's slavery. There is no other way to sugarcoat it. Maybe some elves are treated well, just like in real life there were slaves who were "treated well", but at the end of the day, they were slaves.

*** I don't know why the OP wants to change it, but in some stories, I've changed elves into servants, not slaves, because slavery is such an evil institution that any character with a shred of compassion and decency would oppose it, violently if needed, and that can derail a story.

*** It raises far more interesting moral questions for slavery to exist and for even the 'good guys' to practice it. Can you be own slaves and still be a moral person? The Order of the Phoenix don't free Kreacher because they don't feel it is tactically sensible, but would they if they could (probably not, except if you're Sirius to torment him)? If you are against it who can you ally yourself with to do the right thing?

The world should be messed up. Aiming to remove the problem of House Elves from wizarding society such makes for a blander picture or in some cases simply reverses the problem by foisting it onto the muggle world (which wizards could justly criticise hypocrisy and for still using slaves today, for instance in the sex trade or in various other professions even within well-off countries).

** Why don't you want to believe that? is it as hard to believe that the entire United States was complicit in slavery of OTHER HUMANS? Don't wash over it, don't try to come up with alternate explanations, because there isn't any. It happened, it's how it is. Accept it. It's horrible, it's disgusting, and it's real. Work with the problems in the story, ask questions about it. That's way more interesting to face it head on, rather than try to twist it into something "acceptable" in your own eyes.

** I am inclined to agree this is best for a silly story. Though Dobby taking Lucius to be neutered would explain why Draco is an only child, when an heir and a spare would be much more sensible.

I don't really think it fits an owner pet relationship from a human perspective. If you had a load of wild versions of your pets running around killing your pets you would probably see humans putting them down. Also the elvish tendency towards self-abuse does seem to extend beyond Dobby (see Kreacher and Winky).

** We don't really see too many House Elf owners in the books, so it might be a bit of 'out of sight', 'out of mind' type thing and most people are largely unaware of the real problems.

** I actually go the other way. The way I handle it in my stories is that house elves (unlike, say, goblins and giants) are working animals magically bred up to human intelligence. This allows their psychology to be different enough that they genuinely want to be servants and aren't just brainwashed, without going to the dumb "living off their owner's magic" trope.

I do this in large part because if you actually approached canon!house elves from a real world perspective (i.e. Hermione's), as [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] said, it would cause so much conflict that it would derail the story.

...Although that might be a good story in its own right. Hermione blows up at Ron and anyone else who supports house elf enslavement in second year. She starts SPEW earlier and quickly recruits Dean, followed by many of the other muggle-borns (who like canon!Hermione might not even know about house elves yet). This causes more conflict by separating the muggle-borns even more from the rest of the school, and she has to face the struggle of fighting a hopeless uphill battle to free the elves that most of her new social circle agrees is more important than the fact that the elves themselves don't want it.

*** But the thing is, wanting to be a servant is perfectly fine - wanting to be a slave isn't fine. Brainwashed or not, it's wrong. Even if you want to be a slave, you should be freed - since you do not lose anything. As a free elf, you can still work for free for your family. But as a slave, you cannot leave, even when you're abused.

The problem with the SPEW plot is that it pretty much turns everyone who doesn't at least support Hermione's movement after she starts it into an evil scumbag or an absolute braindead moron who can't even understand how evil slavery is.

So, where would Dumbledore be on this issue? The Weasleys? The Longbottoms? Bones? The Order? On the side of evil, or on the side of good? Why would purebloods who were willing to risk their lives for muggleborns not oppose slavery?

*** Breeding/creating a slave race (as you've described) is morally much worse than abusing pre-existing creatures. It's like having children in order to hurt them. If you're breeding them up to have human intelligence shouldn't you also be breeding them up to have human rights? Like freedom?

**** That's fair, but that's also on the wizards who created the house elves well over a thousand years ago, not the ones alive today. The situation now is that they have a servant race (using that term deliberately), most of whom would refuse freedom if offered, and a better reason than brainwashing for why that is the case.
