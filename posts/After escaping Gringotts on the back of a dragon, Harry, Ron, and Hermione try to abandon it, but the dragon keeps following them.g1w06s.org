*** I wouldnt think so, Basilisk venom and Fiendfyre can destroy Horcruxes only because they'd destroy it beyond repair. Dragonfire just seems to be normal fire as Charlie's been burnt by it and is fine.

**** Well, magic is all about intent, right? It's never explored, but maybe that includes the magic of magical creatures; we know from Fantastic Beasts that demiguises can choose to be visible or invisible. Dementors can choose who to suck on, even if they can't fully control their aura. Maybe the dragon didn't really want to hurt Cedric, just wanted to scare him.

***** Rowling = Lockfart!\\
She gives Harry the 'GIFT' of Parseltongue and then fails to utilize the plot device in the rest of the books!! :p

One of the best utilizations of this ability is the late, Great Bobmin356's "The Queen Who Fell To Earth" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7591040/1/The-Queen-who-fell-to-Earth]]

It's the 1st book in an HP/"Dragonriders of Pern" crossover series. Absolutely magnificent!

Unfortunately, Bob passed before he could complete the final arc. :( I still grieve his loss.

"Preck?" She offers after a moment.
