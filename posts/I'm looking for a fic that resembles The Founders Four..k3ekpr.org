** In linkao3(22144981) Harry, Neville, Luna and Cedric are reincarnations of Salazar, Godric, Rowena and Helga. I haven't read it, so I'm unsure of the quality.

There is an Amulet of Time series. Post GoF, canon pairings. Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione travel back in time via a strange amulet (they do it on the way to Hogwarts for their 5th year IIRC).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1507087/1/Amulet-of-Time-4-There-and-Back-Again][Part 4: There and Back Again]]

They are sent back to the Founders Era for a year, then they use the amulet again and appear during the war with Grindelwald, then they have a relatively peaceful year in 1975 and then they are finally back in their own time to defeat Voldemort.

I've read only the 3rd and 4th parts 4 years ago, so I don't remember much.

  Harry spends the whole summer before fourth year feeling restless. He chalks it up to the weird dreams he's been having, assuming Voldemort is responsible. And for some dreams, that's true - but what about the other ones? The ones that feel... familiar?Back at school, things change one morning in September, when he and three other students wake up with the memories of the four Hogwarts founders in their heads. They don't know why they've returned, or how it happened, but they know one thing - they changed the Wizarding World before, and they're going to do it again. It's about time they shook things up a bit.Tagged underage for Harry/Cedric (14/17)

  On a dark and stormy night, the staff and students of Hogwarts were taken by surprise when four mysterious figures appeared outside on the grounds. Who are they and why do they look like the Founders? What does this mean for the war? AU Time travelling
