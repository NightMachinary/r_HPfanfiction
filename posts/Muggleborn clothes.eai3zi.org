A teenaged muggleborn comes to Hogwarts and wears merchandise from porn sites that aren't obviously related to porn. (Shirts with sire logo's that look completely normal.) Snape loses his shit at this student for all his inappropriate clothing and the entire hall goes quite as Snape realises he just told the entire school he knows these sites.

Bonus points if it is a specific site for really weird stuff.


** most of the hall wouldnt go quite

as most of them would not know what the internet is being that its the 90's and halfbloods and purebloods wouldnt know them anyway

** It would have to be a definite AU since internet and cell phone weren't really a thing in the original timeline, but I think it's a funny concept. I would read.

** Internet as we know it from today didn't exist during Harry Potter's time:

- First web browser, the Mosaic, appeared in 1993.
- Throughout the 1990s, the predominant way for household to connect to Internet was the 14.4kb (yes, kilobit) dialup modem.
- Google would not be founded until September 1. 1998, 4 months after the Battle of Hogwarts.
- Facebook would not exist until 2004.
- YouTube would not exist until 2005.
- iPhone was first revealed in Jan 2007, the year Harry Potter became Head Auror.

Basically, if the Trio started using stuffs like iPhones without a major change in the story setting, you can safely assume they are written by ignorant authors and thus shit fics.
