The fic started on the train and Harry meets the rest of the canon protagonists. It turns out Hogwarts is an actual shithole because the Slytherins are kind of rapey and Dumbledore keeps giving them a "second chance". Malloy and the goons turn up and Harry beats the shit out of them, stabbing Malfoy with his own wand. Harry is above the law because he is a "War Mage". It was a H/G ship.


** Sounds very much like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463), although that Harry arrived only in Year 7.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

That sounds like linkffn(Echoes of Power, Part I: Anger by moshpitstories)

Edit: And it was already suggested...
