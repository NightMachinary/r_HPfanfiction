Are there fics with this idea already done? If not it could be good. How would Harry act if he's viewed the same way as Dumbledore? Would he reconsider Albus's actions? Maybe he'd do the same, or even make the same mistakes. Maybe this Dark Lord is descended from one of his friends for a twist.


** Harry sat frowning over the newspaper. Another person had disappeared. A half-breed, just like the last three cases. Harry knew it was no longer his job to look for active cases. Younger Aurors had this job. There was a reason he retired. He was no longer the man who had defeated Voldemort. No longer the man who broke all records when it came to catching dark wizards. He was still Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, but there he didn't need the quick reaction time of a young man. He was still a powerful wizard ... some claimed him to be the most powerful wizard of their age. But he was painfully aware that he could no longer keep up with a younger, dark wizard.

So by the time the first wizards and witches came along - Aurors he'd trained himself, former students who'd attended his occasional guest appearances at Hogwarts - asking for his help, he was torn. He was 116 years old - nearly a year older than Dumbledore had been the day he arranged his death.

He felt every single year when Diagon Alley was attacked for the first time. Two of his great-grandchildren had been there ... no, not just there, they were the target of the attack. With their Veela blood they had inherited from Victoire and their werewolf-blood, they were considered half-breeds of the worst kind. Teddy's son was beside himself, demanding that Harry has to do something. The dark wizard was too powerful for the Aurors, Harry was the only one who could do something against him.

So it came about that Harry found himself on the Hogwarts grounds. The headmistress, a woman young enough to be his granddaughter, let him into her office.

"Harry, you aged well," the portrait said.

"Hello Professor," Harry greeted his old mentor.

"Headmistress Jones said you wanted to see me."

Harry nodded, then buried his face in his hands.

"A new dark wizard rises. He is powerful, maybe even more powerful than Voldemort was. And we know nothing about him. Professor ... they all expect me to save them again. He fears me. I know that he is fears me. He leaves Godric's Hollow alone. But I'm too old. I know I wouldn't stand a chance against him if I had to fight him face-to-face. What shall I do?"

"You already know the answer. Are you here for advice or to calm your conscience?"

Harry sighed, smiling sadly. "Maybe a little of both."

That evening, a group of about thirty wizards and witches gathered at his and Ginny's home in Godric's Hollow. Some of those present had fought by his side almost a hundred years ago. Neville and Hermione. Ron was no longer by her side, he had died peacefully in his bed nearly a decade ago. Maybe he was the one who got lucky. Ginny, of course was there as well.

But most of them were young. Some with fresh faces, barely older than Harry had been when he defeated Voldemort. Talented former students handpicked by Neville. It was them who would win this war. Harry doubted that he would see it's end.

"Welcome," said Harry. Ginny squeezed his shoulder. "At the first meeting of the new Order of the Phoenix."

** It's almost the mirror image of this, but in one-shot [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27669059/chapters/67709576][The Dark Lord Option]], Harry pulls a prank at the Careers Meeting that has him assumed to be the next Dark Lord. After graduating, he uses that position to keep the Ministry from corruption (He's /the/ Dark Lord, only he should be dealing with bribes and miscarriages of justice) and slaps down would-be Dark Lords (he's /the/ Dark Lord).

When he has a close call due to getting past his prime, he pulls a Dread Pirate Roberts to make Dark Lord Potter seem immortal.

** Harry had ignored the Prophet's news reports. Even with Skeeter long gone, the paper's propensity for sensationalism hadn't lessened a bit, something that irked Hermione to no end. He'd also laughed when the reports of the new dark lord hunting down old pureblood families had come. It was propaganda, he told himself. The ministry wasn't happy and was trying to shore people against the poor boy for his more explosive (slightly!) Ideas on old war criminals.

It was only when Luna sent a tropical bird with a letter asking if Harry was up for a challenge of a new dark lord and whether he's give Quibbler an exclusive that his eyebrows shot up. That day, Harry re-read all the articles about Lord Frank Longbottom, the upcoming dark lord, and here he was looking forward to a quiet 60th birthday with Ginny and the kids.

*** Wizards and witches are supposed to live twice as long as muggles. The films seemed to have got everyone's ages wrong, as they had Snape, a man in his late 30's played by a man in his 60's.

So Harry being 60 would be equivalent of someone in their 30's.

Unless wizards aged at the same rate as muggles, and therefore spend 80 years immobile. Which I think both Dumbledore and Marchbanks proved otherwise.

**** I don't remember the dates, but I reckon Dumbledore was in his 60s when he defeated Grindelwald. So, I thought it would be fun to have a Harry in his 60s who wants a peaceful life but is still sprightly enough to wage war against another dark lord.

Of course if Neville had bashed his son in the head with a few boxing plants when the boy started practicing necromancy, it all could have been avoided. Damnit, Neville!

***** According to [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/dumbledore-family/albus-dumbledore/][hp-lexicon.org]] Dumbledore was born in August of 1881. So if he defeated Grindlewald in 1945 like [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Duel_between_Albus_Dumbledore_and_Gellert_Grindelwald][Harry Potter Wiki]] says then he would have been like 63 or 64 depending on the time of year , if I've done my math correctly.

***** In the Fantastic prequels we get a Dumbledore played by Jude Law, who was in his early 40's at the time of filming, so that could work.

But he definitely wouldn't be a old or aging man
