I've reached a point in a fic I'm writing where Harry is in Potions class, but I can't come up with a potion for him to make, because I have no idea what the base liquid for any potion is.

Example: The Fandom wiki page for Wiggenweld Potion gives the first step as "Add salamander blood until the potion turns red." The salamander blood has to be added to something that isn't red, and is already in the cauldron, otherwise the first step is nothing less than adding a single drop of blood to an empty cauldron.


** Water makes sense. Also the old Pottermore potions game would use 'standard material' that looked a lot like mulch (or weed). We used to joke that students who asked Professor Snape were told it was 'the ashes of students who did NOT PAY ATTENTION'.

*** "Standard potions material" is a mixture. Think Italian Seasoning.

The base liquid for a potion would depend on which potion you are making. You can't just say water, as there are multiple types of water: distilled, spring, rainwater, purified water, deionized water...

I've seen a fic that said using aguamenti to get water for a potion base wouldn't work, because it's essentially distilled water and healing potions need the natural minerals in spring water. Maybe that's only true for healing potions?

Play with it. That's the fun of fanfiction.

** What would the potion do? Or what would be an interesting liquid base? Or does the potion have strong attributes like being vile dark magic or really difficult or esoteric or arcane?

Sure, you could use plain water as the base, or distilled spirits or wine or whatever. But what if it's a horribly dark evil potion with evil effects and an evil intent? "The ancient skin-bound tome said to begin the potion by bringing three drams of orphan tears to a boil in a bronze cauldron. Scrawled in a different hand was a cautionary note: 'BOTH parents dead!!!!'." Or perhaps some other bodily fluid that Harry can't obtain ethically: "Bile. The potion called for bile. Human bile."

A painstakingly difficult, finicky, time-consuming potion? "Every seventh night for seven lunar cycles, collect seven drops of water from the hair of seven mermaids..."

Maybe the potion starts by liquifying a solid: render the fat of a magical creature, thaw mystical glacier ice, heat a block of some metal until it melts. Squeeze juice from a magical plant. There's so many bodily fluids from so many creatures...

I believe in The Accidental Animagus, Voldemort's resurrection potion has a base of "One live unicorn dissolved in basilisk venom".

**** "Harry." Hermione called across the room. "The potion states 'three drops of fresh orphan tears'."

That was convenient thought Harry and Ron.

Hermione having how lived in a tent with 2 boys for 3 weeks, attending a boarding school for six years and having meet the Weasley Twins curtailed Ron's raising fist.

"No boys, a fresh orphan."

Harry's grimace and Ron's slow drop of his smile was enough to show that they understood. Never leaving an opportunity to be cad remain unused, Ron opened his mouth.

"So how 'fresh' is 'fresh'?" he asked. "I mean Harry's parents was awhile ago wasn't it. You reckon Katie Bell could cry in a cup for us?" Ron looked up at the roof of the tent. "Or do we need a /Daily Prophet/ to find Death Eater raid locations".

Hermione was unusually surprised by Ron's callousness.

"Ron, honestly, considering the book is called /Rickmans' Reservoir of rituals for the reuse of the recently repatriated with unbeing./ I imagine that fresh means the first tears of an someone freshly orphaned."

"Well that's a bit harder then ain't it." Ron replied.

** It's a lot of fanon. The easiest thing to do is have him do a potion from the books or just say "the base" unless the potion is a central part of the story. I doubt any readers care very much. I'll never come up with Latin-derived incantations for any new spells I have characters do; I'll just say something like "they did a nonverbal spell that resulted in X" or "they said an incantation that [narrator] didn't recognize," and I think it's basically the same situation with potions.

There's a list of known potions ingredients somewhere, and I guess all liquids on the list could be used as the base. I wouldn't get too specific with it if you don't have to; it's easier to have characters discuss specific steps as it shows up in the conversation rather than you personally creating a whole fictional set of instructions.

If you do have to get specific, then everyone's given you great advice already. I'll add that [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966][Azoth by zeitgeistic]] has a really gorgeous expansion of Potions lore that's very relevant to the plot. Harry is a Potions apprentice in it, so it makes sense that there's so much development of the practice. Here's the excerpt on bases:

#+begin_quote
  In his notes, he scrawled:

  /The first step of brewing a potion is to determine the appropriate base. (How???) Bases separated into 7 categories:/

  *distilled water*

  *aqua vitae*

  *aqua regia*

  *aqua fortis*

  *cinnabar* -- maybe should be used in nutrient potions since it sounds like it tastes good at least?

  *vitriol* -- no doubt what Snape made all his potions out of

  *sal ammoniac*
#+end_quote

AND

#+begin_quote
  Harry understood that passage now---Potions were a bit like him and Malfoy: Volatile ones needed a volatile base. Fortifying ones needed a fortified base. Life-giving ones needed a life-giving base. Cinnabar, Aqua Fortis, Aqua Vitae. Malfoy was probably all those things to Harry.
#+end_quote

The second passage is especially relevant because it shows why going into detail about the intricacies of potions making is important and symbolic for the plot as a whole. If it doesn't have some kind of meaning for the characters, then I recommend not stressing yourself out trying to develop your own potions unless it's fun for you as the writer. The audience likely doesn't mind either way.

EDIT: I just learned how to do quotes.

*** Would be funny as well for Harry to use his cooking knowledge and use sourdough starter as a base. Hijinks and malarkey may or may not ensue. Or he cheats and uses like household cleaners - windex for sal ammoniac, etc.

** Water, oil, or literally any other fluid for that specific potion - bubotuber pus could be fun.

If you're inventing a potion, it doesn't really matter how you begin.

Slice ginger root finely and place in the bottom of a cold cauldron. Douse with sword fish oil and light fire beneath the cauldron. Add shredded liquorice root and two pints of mooncalf milk diluted tenfold. Stir ten times. Add powdered mutlap livers and stir until the potion turns green. Etc etc etc.

** Okay - this is something that I thought of that I will eventually be including into my fics, but more of as a throwaway line and not anything I will actually be expanding upon, but you're welcome to it. So, my head-canon for potions:

Base 1: Water. This is what most potions start with. These potions are typically the least expensive of potions, make the largest batches, and are the most common of potions.

Base 2: Oil. Could be magical or regular. These potions are the second most common of potions. They are typically more powerful than water potions, and bit more expensive. You'll get a medium-sized batch

Base 3: Blood. These are the advanced level potions. They create the most potent potions, and are the most expensive to buy. Blood potions make the smallest amount and are the most rare.

Yes, there is a Base 4, which is any sort of acid, but these potions vary too widely for any stereotyping.

And, of course, there are outlier bases, but this covers the majority of them.

** It's indeed never really said. Voldemort's rebirth cauldron is said to be

#+begin_quote
  It was full of what seemed to be water ...
#+end_quote

but that's about it. Personally, I make it so that the base is part of the potion. The base is the solution created from one or more essences. Water is an essence, but so is Murtlap essence. And the most complicated potions need multiple cauldrons, because the solution is not the same as the essence, and the essence (that was in the cauldron before it became the solution) can be an unfitting ingredient that ruins the potion.

** If you research old alchemy works you'll find that a base that was used and was also attributed in witchcraft were the Chymous, which is composed of the four humors: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. These four humors then circulate in the vessels.

** Water. Maybe blood or poisonous things for darker, viler potions. Maybe milk or honey for complicated healing potions. For example most Hogwarts potions pre O.W.L. level appear to be based on water however i remember prior to his resurrection Voldemort used a potion made by Nagini's venom to stay alive in homunculus form. Felix Felicis apparently uses Malaclaw Venom.
