** Just a quick write up I tried to make. Im no author.

"Another one" Rufus Scrimgeour mutters as Harry enters the room"

On the floor in that tantalizing script that haunted them from crime scene to crime scene was the note.

"Lumos of all things?" muttered Harry as he picked up the note. "The 'Hogwarts Killer' held up to his promise after all."

This all started last week when a letter arrived in the Auror Act Anonymously division. The letter claimed that too many of Hogwarts children leave the school uneducated, and it is time I teach them what you could really do.

That's when the bodies began to show. First in St Mungo's where the entry staff were charmed asleep and a body left in the reception. A match from the ladies cigarette case was turned into a needle and stabbed into her jugular vein.

Next a body delivered by floo into the Leaky Cauldron where the food in the persons mouth was turned into a bird, chocking him to death.

In every one of these cases, that note in that fluid cursive was pinned to the body with the 'Spell of the day' inscribed.

"Match to Needle, Avifors, Lumos... before we know it we will have hundreds of victims!" screamed Scrimgeour. "I need answers now! This is a PR nightmare!"

Harry looked at the victim. Rebecca Morgan according to the wand registry but they would have to investigate that back at the morgue due to the fact that the body was unrecognizable. Burns covering every inch of flesh, eyes turned to dust, the throat can not even be called that anymore.

"Well we are not going to find anything else here. Just have to wait for the murderer to screw up." Harry says looking back at Rufus.

"Another body shows up, you get to say that to the press" Rufus says angrily as he stomps toward the door.

"And send someone from DOM to come down here and check for magical residues"

"Yes sir" Harry replies sarcastically.

It is. That is was untransfiguration is all about - the transfiguration reversal spells. They wouldn't exist if it were useless.

That wouldn't be the transfiguration spell either. That would be accidental spell damage. There is a whole ward in St. Mungo for that.

But then that's not technically killing someone with Nox, as OP said, since they would lose their soul but still be alive. Also, even if losing their soul counts as dying, it would still be dementors who did it.

Magic is all about intent. The body is one big mechanical object. There's lots of things you can unlock that can cause chaos.

You have valves in your deep veins to keep blood flow in one direction.

You have the Epiglottis that ensures food goes to the stomach instead of the lungs and opens during breathing.

Hell, when it gets down to Colloportus, you can just lock that and they suffocate.
