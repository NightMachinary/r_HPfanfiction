So the idea is that Olivander, a wand crafter/enchanter of great renown, has some kind of failsafe against being attacked in his shop as per canon, whether it's as simple as an escape tunnel, some kind of nasty anti magic ward, or in fact, some kind of failsafe built into the wands themselves that either prevents them from being used against him, or renders them inert in some way when given a command word.


** Like a panic button? Could see a word he can say and activate the protection. I would be honesty curious of a fic coming up with the title "Ollivander's Safeword"

** I had thought about this myself. The story idea was an OC muggleborn becoming fascinated with wands and wandlore and ends up becoming Ollivanders apprentice after Hogwarts. There's really powerful wards that make it so people how wish to harm the wandcrafter can't enter. Ollivander leaves the shop one day and that's when he gets kidnapped. The OC stays in the shop 24/7 after that due to being in danger because she's a muggleborn.
