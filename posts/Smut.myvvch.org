I was wondering, what do you think of smut in fics? Personally, I'm not a fan, since it almost never adds anything to a story. I often feel like people try and hide the fact that their plot isn't all that good or interesting, with a good dose of flesh. A misdirection of sorts.

Also, are people in fanfiction really OK with very graphic stories that feature a bunch of kids the age of 12-16 in sexual relationships? Common people! This is basically child porn!

Teens have sex, we all know that. Alluding to it happening, is one thing, but graphically and gratuitously describing everything that happens is something altogether different ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜«

** It is honestly a very interesting issue. The first thing that must be understood is that most people who read/write fanfiction are... Children. They are in their teens. To them, it isn't weird that 15 year olds are having sex, because they are 15, and possibly having sex.

Now, I do my best to just ignore a fics where first years are having sex at 11, because it doesn't make any sense at all, physically. In my state the age of consent is 16, and while I will definitely say it's distasteful for people with significant age gaps to have relations at that age, when I see two 16, 17, or 18 year olds in a fic have a relationship, I'm generally just ok with that, but it varies on a case by case basis.

Now, the original point, do I think it adds something to a fic? Absolutely, depending on how it's implemented. I've read stories with absolutely amazing relationship arcs that end with the characters making love, and despite it being graphic, it does lend a sense of completion to the story. However, unless you are only looking for smut, I do find it necessary to have plot be the most important thing.

*** Your point of most fanfic authors being young is definitely correct, and I honestly didn't think of it.18 year olds with 15-16 year olds isn't really an issue for me, and it is very common IRL.

Now I always find it a bit silly, when authors make it a point to talk about the Age of Consent... And misunderstand the whole concept completely. I mean, a 40 year old Narcissa Malfoy having sex with 16 year old Harry is absolutely illegal.

In Iceland, at least, the age of Consent is 14, but that is dependent upon both, or all parties being under the age of 18. An adult having sex with someone under 18, can be charged with statutory rape.

Not in the UK. It's pretty grim, but here the age of consent is the age of consent and that's that. The exception is for certain professions where there are issues of being in a position of power or influence, but even then that's only til 18.

***** I went and took a better look at our laws, and a person under the age of 14 cannot give their consent to engage in sexual activity. Statutory rape limitation, is under the age of 15.

****** Everywhere is different with different cultural ideas of morality and sexuality, I don't think comparing ages of consent ever really moves the conversation. There is no easy answer to this, though personally I do worry about the purity culture I see growing in the fandom. I don't want to read young kids having sex and I always expect a story to be appropriately tagged with clear warnings for sensitive topics, but I think that's as far as it is fair to ask.

******* Agreed. As to warnings, I simply gave my story a 'mature' rating. When something is rated as 'mature' people should understand that there may be some scenes that could potentially make them uncomfortable or trigger them.

I refuse to give out a special warning in the beginning of a chapter, or worse, in the middle of a chapter. And I will not be one of those writers that put a million tags in ao3. I just won't.

The word 'mature' in this context has certain implications, and if people do not understand that, that's their problem, not mine.

***** Because to most, somewhat healthy people, myself included, there is a fundamental difference between crimes of sexual nature, and other 'regular' crimes.

How can people not understand that?

It has been very well documented how incredibly harmful it can be to a person's mental development and growth, if they engage in sexual activities when they are too young.

Sex between adults and kids is disgusting, even if the younger person has given their consent. Often, they are not mature enough to fuÄºly grasp the consequences of their actions. Hence, why there is an 'age of consent' to begin with.

Anything sexual involving minors, and/or children is extremely delicate and often very complicated, and should in my view be treated as such. Even if it is in fanfiction.

**** No that's literally what age of consent means. There are some places with close in exceptions, but that would be for a partner who is under the age of consent.

** Fics with a high density of good smut get put in the "read when horny" pile.

Fics with good plot and a medium density of smut get put in the "do not read at work" pile.

Fics with marginal quality plot and a medium or higher density of marginal quality smut get put in the "don't read" pile.

Fics with marginal or better plot and low but non-zero density of smut get read or not read entirely based on the quality of the plot, and I skip the smut. In my experience, authors who don't write /very much/ smut don't write /very good/ smut either, and it's usually not critical to the story.

** My position is that as long as no real children are getting abused, I don't really care what people write, draw, sing, etc; and even if it does make me uncomfortable, it's not my place to complain.

If anything, it might be better if people with dark impulses (that is, people) have their harmless outlets. Therapy is often too expensive, and the old tactics of trying to shame or beat the perversion/sin/vice/whatever out of people have been /spectacularly/ ineffective.

I have a simple rule for this: if they're under 14, don't do it. If they're over 14, don't have the partner over 17.

Simple, but it makes me focus more on where the story goes. Anything other than that is just a short read

** For my own sanity I pretend the child stuff doesn't exist.

If you want to write smut, power to you I suppose, but probably best to post it on s dedicated, age restricted site. If you want some plot with your smut, go for it.

If you are writing a 'normal' story, then leave it out. Even if a reader enjoys smut, they would probably want to go and look for it specifically, not be ambushed by it in the middle of something else. Shoehorning it into be middle of a story always makes everything worse as it kills pacing and normally also characterisation without adding to anything but the word count, and I just skip it.

** I hate smut in stories. Any type of romance and lovey dovey crap makes me incredibly uncomfortable and I just dislike it.

I gravitate to more angsty/adventure stories because of this. Personal preference.

But so many stories insist that the main character be in a romantic relationship which is so irritating. Not just in ff, in life. It's incredibly annoying.

If I like the character and the relationship is realistic and solid (and for me, sarcastic and coy and a little cold) I'll suffer through the smut. But I just can't read romance/sweet things for the sake of romantic/sweet plot.

With regards to the underage thing, I don't read stories unless the writing is compelling. It's rare to find an author u18 who can write well enough to keep me entertained. I really hate the idea of underage people writing and reading graphic things. I try not to think about it, knowing that we were a young once and god knows what I'd be doing if I had internet at that age.
