#+TITLE: What if the dark arts are and any magic really are multi faced because the food makers know the normal counters.A good warder likely knows how wards are broken to protect against it. Just like inferi are weak to flame so fill them with napalm or cover them in water.

It'd be awesome if there are any fics where this is a thing too.

**** Considering the female role in the household in the early 80s, your first post is technically canon with the blood protection.

*** I mean like if everyone knows to bring down the ward/magical protection spell H you just hit it with D,F, and G spells then a good warder would have something to defend against that. An inferi is weak to fire. If you raise an inferi might as well make em hard to kill. The raiser probably took DADA or at least knows an inferi strengths and weaknesses. So like Tom riddle did, have them in a lake, they're harder to burn that way. Or fill them with something flammable or fill the room with a flammable gas. Fire is used and cue fiery explosion that could have killed the person using the fire spell
