Hey everyone! I just saw a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/k417jn/][post]] from 2 hours ago that had a prompt about harry being kidnapped.

One of the comments for that prompt was about how Harry would be taken in by said criminals. This started me thinking because I have seen multiple harry raised by criminals fics before, can anyone recommend any fics that have that in them?

Fic I mentioned earlier: Wizard Kingpin by Odin999 on ffnet

  When she thinks no one is looking, Petunia slaps three year old Harry while stuck in traffic. Mafia Lord Salvator Diadone notices and takes action. This is a Harry grows up in the mafia story, with a bit of a twist. ABANDONED.
