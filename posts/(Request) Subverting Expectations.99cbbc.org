** Umm, there is linkffn(Horry Patter and the Philogoger's Stone), which, from it's name, should be very obvious why I thought would be horrible.

I needed a lot to overlook the very weird names, but this fic has some unique ideas on a magical society based around a very different, very AU magic system. And it's damn interesting because of it, as it's one of the fics you truly don't know what to expect, in a good way.

** I keep recommending it, but definitely Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run. I don't like the idea of Draco/Harry, as it would just never work in my opinion and I definitely have never had a positive opinion on any stories featuring them. But I gave this one a shot because I liked the summary (I was fully expecting to hate it) and it was worth it.

It's very funny and very sweet-with some really quite fantastic characterisations and ideas. Because of the AU aspect it was also at least semi-believable.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

** Linkffn(the lies that bind): that was the reversal from hell right there.

Linkffn(abraxas): super!harry story somehow turned into an all out muggle/wizard war.

Linkffn(elyzium for the sleepless souls): Azkaban isn't what it used to be...

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero) and it's sequels. It starts as a generic 6th year redo, then takes the Harry is a noble hero idea and stretches it beyond belief. By the end of the story he's basically the White Lantern from DC comics while Voldemort is the Anti-Monitor (I'm such a nerd).
