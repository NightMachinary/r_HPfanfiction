  Imagine a world of soulmarks where it is not your soulmate's first spoken words to you, but instead the first spoken words of someone who would make a great mark on your soul.

Not romantic. It's a oneshot.

*** usually it's a body mark that indicates/represents your soulmate or helps you find them.

Common ones are

- their name
- first words spoken to each other
- first thought upon meeting
- Countdowns to meeting them
- Symbols that represent them or match
- Sometimes it's if one writes on their body it shows up on the soulmate too.
- I just read one where your soulmates deepest desire is written on your body

they can be pretty good, but there are a lot of teen angst ones too like OP said

  Starts off from the Quidditch world cup, Harry finds a more important reason to fight for and that sometimes, a fairytale or legend is a lot more than it seems. Discontinued. Sorry.

** Aww, darn. I was going to recommend the Firebird's Son trilogy, but it turns into a bit of a harem towards the end. Extremely AU.

Otherwise, um, linkffn(The Queen Who Fell To Earth) is soulmate-like, but it's not quite the same; and although there are trio relationships later on, they're not /harems/, everyone in them is equal.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

  "Scars can come in handy." --- Magic gives the gift of a soulmate. Separated by war, alliances, beliefs, and blood, but connected by skin. What if you shared the scars of the person that magic has given you? What if you really, really wished that you didn't?

** Linkao3(Welcome to Slytherin) is a Hermione-centric fic where she asks the Hat to put her in Slytherin because her soul mark says “Welcome to Slytherin,” so that /must/ be where she's supposed to go.

But...nobody says that and instead she deals with pure-blood bigotry and wonders what the hell is up with her soul mark.
