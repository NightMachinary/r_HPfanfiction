I cannot believe I asking if anybody knows of any good Harry/Oliver fics. I just "finished" Laocoon's Children and I'm desperate to read something that fulfills the space that the somewhat "unfinished" fic has left in my heart. I picked up very early on that Oliver and Harry were going to end up together and now I really want to read something where they do and I get to see them interact!

Also for anyone who loves a good Sirius/Remus raise Harry fic - Laocoon's Children is for you :) Beware it is unfinished though the author tells us where he (she?) wanted to go with it!


** I have not read the Burren from the Harry Big Bang but that is the first that came to mind [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3217646]]. I just read a great fic where Harry is a girl but forced to pretend to be male. End game is Harriet/Oliver. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5883303/1/Not-a-Girl]] Unfortunately people are very weird about slash on this site and will likely rec the subreddit for HP slash.
