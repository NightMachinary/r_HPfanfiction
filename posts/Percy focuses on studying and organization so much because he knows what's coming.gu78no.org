Percy Weasley was happy, carefree child, much like his youngest brother that we know in canon. When Voldemort returned after he graduated Hogwarts, he had no useful skills or knowledge of magic because he spent his seven years slacking off. He watches the devastation caused by the war, and keeps losing friends and family, until ultimately he is killed horribly. Then he wakes up as a child again.

This time will be different. This time he's going to focus, he's going to learn every bit of magic he can. And if his brothers don't understand why he's so focused, he can explain it to them after he's saved their lives and country.


** intresting you could make this the canon timeline

In percys timeline voldemort came back much later and he lost everything In this timeline he decided he would enter the ministry to prepare it

he worked hard off and then harry said voldemort was back harry had to be wrong right, its five years earlier then when voldemort should come back.

so he stays with the ministry and even earns a promotion, its going well he is on track, and then his father suggests he only got promoted so he could spy on him. Percy was pissed and cut ties he had to stick to the ministry they will forgive him when he stops voldemorts return

percy then warns ron to stay away from harry so ron too could enter the ministry with him.

percy then slowly starts to realise he was wrong and voldemort is back earlier then he should be

but he is in too deep and is trusted in the ministry, so he stays and leaks information when he can

and then he hears about the battle of hogwarts and goes off to fight

** Percy had been many things in his past life, a brown nosed, head boy, and Meticulous but that was only after 3 Lifetimes of trial and error. This life was his last chance he had only managed to save Ginny Last time around he couldn't afford any mistakes if he was going to save the rest of his family. He sighed Once again his seven-year-old self ready to once again Spend the majority of his childhood reprimanding the twins for their foolishness and studying but This moment give him pause every time in every other life whenever he saw the twins scheming he reprimanded them or told his mother, but this time He made a quiet suggestion on how to improve their plan. Instead of the twins spending an hour in the corner Like an every other lifetime before this time Percy was Ensconced in his brothers base of Operations Helping to divide the spoils of a successful heist into thirds. Five raspberry tarts Didn't divide easily between three young boys, Considering two of them didn't know their fractions yet and the other was a time traveler. In this life Percy was studious meticulous and a brown Noser, Or he would at least appear to be to any outside or when in reality he was his twin brother coConspirator and Years later and early investor in their business. Not the joke shop that came later but the shield charm manufacturing business they started up in their fourth year. Wards ,shield charms, Many magical protection devices they saved thousands of lives during the war Both magical and Muggle. But most importantly, that Portable home shield charms were strong enough protect against fire. The Ravaged Europe and England as it had in everyone of Percy's past lives but this time no Weasley was Among the casualties. George lost an ear, Billy was partvwerewolf not and liked his meat rare, and Ginny had to sleep with a nightlight until she was 37 but they were alive and happy mostly, the twins kept badgering him to come out with them And find a girlfriend, but they were all still walking the earth, Sunday's dinners at the Burrow were Boisterous and Lacked the deafening silence of his previous pasts.

They had Survived not because of his studiousness but because he actually Acted like the Weasley he was, he did silence his inner Strategist this time round, He embraced it and encouraged his brothers, His contribution might have been minor but it meant a future to those he loved.

​

percy saved the world by being a good brother, Who would've thought.

** "Avada Kedavra!"

"No, not Percy! You killed my brother! I'll end yo-"

So this was it, then. Death. Capital D Death. It was... more busy than he expected. Instead of a comforting, quiet darkness, he was falling, falling, falling through a vortex of color, iridescent shades and spiralling, warped images.

Hey, he knew that one? That was the burrow! And over there, the Hogwarts express!

Then, he reached the bottom, and hit the ground harder than he'd ever hit anything before.

"AAAAH!"

"Percy, what is it dear? Did you have a nightmare?"

Percy looked around wildly, this was his room, wha- /mum/.

Hugging his mother so tightly he thought he could never let her go, five-year old percy sobbed out his past life, and all its horrors.

--------------

Nothing worked. He tried to change something, and the world would conspire to make it happen just like it did. The only thing he could change was himself, but he could not prevent his mother's death, or the twins' disappearances, or the sacking of Hogwarts.

And he was always killed that day in the siege.

--------------

On the fifth repetition, he was ready to give up. Going through the motions, he tested if he could change something by preventing the twins from blowing up the second shack, and failed.

However, this time, something else happened. He was so used to everything being the same that he was blindsided when Professor Dumbledore appeared on their doorstep a few years after he'd travelled, tiny little Harry in tow.

"It's not safe for the boy, I see it now."

His parents and Dumbledore had whispered deep into the night, speaking of dark things, but Percy could only think of the way little Harry's eyes had looked around, gained a shimmer of recognition, and then hidden it again.

--------------

Over the next months, Harry slowly but surely became just another brother in the Weasley household. He sat by the table, played Quidditch with the rest, and interestingly enough, sook Percy's company in the meagre library.

They'd become tenuous friends, not as strongly as Harry and Ron, but they did not hate eachother. The boy was frighteningly quick for his age, grasping complex topics and formulas with almost the same ease as Percy himself.

It couldn't be...

"Hey, Harry," he started offhandedly, they were deep into a dissertation on the properties of counter-resonant shieldbreakers, "Remember when you used that greek aegis barrier to deflect Bella's specialty?"

It was an event that always happened during the siege of Hogwarts - Bellatrix Lestrange, the insane Death Eater, had in her time invented a few spells, but one of them was much more vicious than the others. It was an unholy amalgam of curses so warped and convoluted it could eat itself through any shield by activating different components in flight. The only effective defense against it was the dynamic aegis, an adaptive shield charm from greece.

"Got 'er good, didn't I?" mumbled Harry thoughtlesssly, before clapping a hand over his mouth and looking at Percy in horror.

Percy was doing the same.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.
