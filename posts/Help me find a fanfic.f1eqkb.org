:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay so I read this fanfic a while ago, and can't seem to find it. I remember that it takes place in Hogwarts and Harry convinces everyone that he can do anything/make anything happen with just a snap of his fingers. Also I think he has a time turner at some point, but McGonagall takes it away because he uses it inappropriately and she's worried he would get addicted to it.


** That's Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.

Edit: you can also listen to the podcast of it.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

******* Oh i agree. Everyone that complains about MoR disregards the absolutely horrid tropes that plague Fanfiction. Mindless bashing and Mary Sues everywhere (just to name a few), but no, MOR is the one that is bad.
