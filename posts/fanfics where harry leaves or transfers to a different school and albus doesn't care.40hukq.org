we've all seen those lousy fanfics where ahrry leaves Britain or hogwarts and moves somewhere else or to a different school and dumbledore tries to force him back, ever seen one where harry does leave and dumbledore doesn't care or try to make him come back? he's like ok well i'll just fix the riddle problem myself or something like that

ever seen fanfics like that?


** I've never seen one, but if you're looking, I'd suggest browsing wrong-boy-who-lived stuff, especially ones that have Neville or a non-Potter as the one, or stories in which Harry really isn't the boy-who-lived. There's really just no way you're going to find a good story in which Dumbledore let's Harry leave if Dumbledore thinks/knows he's the boy-who-lived.

** Wrong-boy-who-lived is certainly a good place to start! I read a Harry goes to Durmstrang fic (I wish I could find it, it was abandoned when I read it but I used to periodically check back just in case!) that was really good. Harry was ignored at Hogwarts (his brother was thought to be the boy who lived) so he transferred to Durmstrang.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
