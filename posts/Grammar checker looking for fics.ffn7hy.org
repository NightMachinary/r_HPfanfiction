I'm not much of a writer myself, but I love a good book or fic. Something that just annoys me from time to time is poor grammar. I can't spellcheck for my life but I don't mind reading any fics, be they long or short, PG or NSFW and returning them with corrected grammar for no charge. I'm just bored and want to support this amazing community, even those who ship Snape and Hermione (weirdos). message me and I'll try get back to you within 24hrs (bear in mind I have a life and Uni to deal with).

Good luck and Happy writing! :)

(I'm flairing this as misc but if it should be a self promo please tell me)
