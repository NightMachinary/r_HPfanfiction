Any recently released Harry x Fleur that are good?


** There's Harry Potter and the Horcrux Hunt which is a Harry/Fleur/Tonks story that is in progress with regular updates. While not the most serious fic (Its premise is a drunken, magical wedding) it is enjoyable nonetheless.

  Fleur and Tonks' plans for the future get derailed. Now they are pulled into Harry's hunt for horcruxes. How will things go with an Auror and a trained Curse Breaker along? Rated M for language, mild violence, and sexual situations.
