Was recently reading a fiction that had Neville as the boy who lived, and so no "golden trio", and with Harry as the main character on the outside of the social structure and as described in my requests title. Would love to find some more fan fics with a Harry of a similar nature.

A Harry who is shy and quiet, flitting around behind the scenes or on the edges, and not someone who is remotely extroverted or even always willing to be near crowds or groups. A Harry who, to some degree, hides who he is and what he does, and yet who is powerful magically or extremely intelligent. A Harry who struggles to connect with most people around him, but wouldn't completely close himself off when put in the right situation, and also one who would attract interest from other outcasts or unusual people.

I don't care where he is sorted, if he grew up with the Dursleys or not, what branch/es of magic hes good at or powerful with and so on. This is mainly about who Harry is as a person. As stated my only request is that he still be powerful magically or intellectually but obviously likely in a subtle way fitting his personality. I would love if there is romance of some sort but its certainly not required (however no main character slash please).

Thanks!


** The child of Azkaban would qualify, but I imagine you've already read it. Year one is complete, year two is a WIP (most recent update was last week).

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
