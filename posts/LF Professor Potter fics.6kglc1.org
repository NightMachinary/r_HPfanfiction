Looking for fics that involve Harry becoming a professor at Hogwarts. These can be AU or canon. I'll admit that I like AU because many of my favorite characters die in canon and I'm not a huge fan of the pairings as written in canon.

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.

*** I decided that It's schlock and rates a 5 out of 10 for me. Poor writing & poor characterizations but a kick ass first chapter fight. It's a pity as he could have really ran with the reluctant Harry trope. Instead it became mired too many POVs and OCs having odd conversations that have no bearing on the plot.
