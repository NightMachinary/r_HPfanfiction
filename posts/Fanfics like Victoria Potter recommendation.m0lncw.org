I check everyday to see if it is updated and I want something to read while I wait. I love everything about this fanfiction but my favorite things are the way magic and the wizard world is portrayed, the characterization, the fact that characters act their age, the original take on canon events and lastly that Victoria is a girly girl ( a rare thing in fem Harry) I would like your recommendations it doesn't have to be femharry or even have Harry as a protagonist I just want a story that is feels magical.


** You could try Certain Dark Things by eirajenson. It's a femharry with many of the same strengths as Victoria Potter: excellent prose, age appropriate characters, magical world building, and no bashing. It's set in a world that feels like a somewhat darker version of canon. Some of Riddle's horcruxes have become sentient and that really alters the broader political context.

Currently in year 3 with regular updates. The primary endgame pairing may be a little off putting (I totally get that), but at this point it's a completely gen fic and the author has made it clear that it is not going to be romance-centric.
