I'd love to read a fic where Harry is obsessed with Dumbledore and tries to emulate him ( his beard, spectacles and his fashion sense), i.e. to say his devotion to Dumbledore rivals Bellatrix's loyalty to Voldemort or Colin Creevey's obsession with Harry.


** He ropes Hermione and Ron into hunting the library with him looking for a spell to make his eyes twinkle. Ron thinks he is loonier than Luna. Hermione now understands why people found her hero worship of teachers so annoying...

***** From what I remember, the Hat was split between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw and she just made a final push. So it was at the very least her 2nd most suited. I'm not sure any amount of arguing would have put Harry or Ron in Ravenclaw, or Hermione in Hufflepuff.

****** It has been a while since I read the books but I thought the Hat wanted her in Ravenclaw. I'll need to read it again to be sure. Loyalty and hard work sound like Hermione, no? H+R belong in Gryffindor without a doubt.

#+begin_quote
  Young Tom Riddle watches Dumbledore set his wardrobe on fire and thinks it's the coolest thing ever. From that point on, Tom only wishes to become a man as great as his Professor. Dumbledore really, really doesn't know how to deal with the little psycho kid following him around.

** Omg, I can just imagine little Harry with gold half-moon spectacles and wearing jewel-coloured robes with matching pointy hat and high-heeled boots. He would grow out his hair and apply a Colour-Changing Charm on them so they would be auburn like when Albus was young because we all know he would get around and asking everyone and read everything he could about the Headmaster. He would try his very best in Transfiguration and Charms as those were said to be Dumbledore's best subject and he would pick the Alchemy option for his N.E.W.T. levels.

** I know it's not exactly what you asked for, but I know a fic where TOM RIDDLE was Dumbledore's fanboy.

...

No, I'm not kidding. He even created a club and everything. It's a hilarious read, in case anyone is interested. It took me forever to find it, but here it is!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18394745][A Mentor's Burden]]

Here's a little extract of it:

[...] â€œErtan, what's Professor Dumbledore's full name?"

Ertan looks like he would rather jump out the window than answer, and Tom prepares himself for yet another devastating disappointment. Just another proof of the Professor's greatness, that he has the skill and patience to teach this bunch of little brick-heads.

"Albus... Wulfric... Brian?"

"You forgot Percival," Argo corrects him, and earns a brilliant smile from Tom.

Smiles will have to do until he learns how to twinkle warmly.

"Good, good. And, the final question -- What house do we want to join?"

"Gryffindor," the kids chorus all together.

Of course, after reviewing all of the Professor's life accomplishments, who wouldn't?

"I expect to see you all there."
