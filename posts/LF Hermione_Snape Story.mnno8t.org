I am looking looking a Snape/Hermione fic where Voldemort is dead but the Dark Mark is killing Death Eaters so to save Severus, Albus (he's alive) de-ages him back to like 17 or so. Severus goes to classes and such while they try to find a cure.

Also looking for a Snape/Hermione fic where the muggleborns are being targeted specifically and so they get assigned a teacher/order member to look after them. Hermione is assigned to Snape and she lives in his rooms with him.

Either ringing any bells for anyone?


** Is the first one by Ms Figg?

***** Severus redux is also a great young snapex Hermione fic. Young Snape creates a potion that makes his copy travel twenty years into the future.

A looooot of stories have this premise. Can you remember anything else about the story? Which year, post or pre dh?

*** I'm trying to remember if I am mixing 2 stories together. But from what I am remembering it would be pre-DH. Hermione and Snape did something together before they were assigned together, so they take advantage of it because they have to spend time together. There are other muggleborns in the school that also get assigned a bodyguard type thing.

I read it so long ago that this is really the only thing i remember
