It starts out innocently like Harry always wanting a family then Hogwarts comes around and he sees possibility to reunite with his mother and father, and then as it keeps progressing through the years it just keeps getting darker and darker.

No slash, I don't care if it has a bit of incest in it.

The Art of Self-Fashioning though is pretty much exactly what you want, except instead of bringing them back from the dead, he's bringing back their minds.

********** I can see where you're coming from on that but I don't agree. Terry is just one of those people can't comprehend why someone wouldn't want friends.

And yes, Regulus is creepy, no doubts there. But in more of a "I'm bored out of my skull and slightly demented so you're going to be my next project" kind of way than anything sexual.

I think you're seeing undertones where they're not. Nothing I've seen in that fic is sexual.

** I am planning on writing a oneshot based almost exactly on this idea. I talked to someone else about it on this subreddit like a week or two ago. Also not exactly what your looking for but if you want Lily resurrected you can check out my current story (WIP) Linkffn(11707435) . I think people are enjoying it, and I think I'm better than some of the crap I've come across on ff.net but I'm not a top tier writer by any means.

**** Just a warning. Lily's resurrection is not the main focus of the story and it doesn't happen until pretty much the current update. I'm working on the next chapter now. I'm hoping now that my university term is ending I'll be able to pump out chapters fairly quickly. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11707435/1/Things-Are-Not-Always-As-They-Seem][here]]

** I have but one question: Why is it always his mother? - I've read several fanfictions where Lily gets to live again, some where both elder Potters come back (either from the dead or from hiding!) but I can't remember one fanfiction where it's James that comes back (I've read a few where he survives because Voldemort didn't kill him because he either wasn't home (out with Sirius for example) or just knocked out because Voldemort wanted to end the fight as fast as possible) from the dead :(

ps: It might just be me, but firstly I've grown up with my dad (because my mum didn't really fight for custody (I am glad she didn't, my father is the better role model etc.) - she after all had her new boyfriend (later new husband)) and I've been betrayed by my mother (she stole from me - a significant sum of money), so I am not part of the "a child needs its mother" faction (instead I think that a child needs a good parent, whoever that may be in the end: mother, father, grandparents etc.)

****** Maybe not, but it's always the mothers who get put on pedestals and frankly I am fucking sick of that shit (I mean I loved my mother despite her having basically given up on custody (I admit that now I am glad she did!), but look where that got me, she was/is a bad mother (she never attended important milestones in my life like say graduation from school!), a liar and thief! Surely I am not the only one who got duped (or otherwise treated badly) by their mom, but there's the cliche of the dead-beat-dad, but not the cliche of the bitch-mom...I really wounder why?) Sure moms are important, but so are dads (single parent households aren't ideal - there's enough studies that show that children of single parents turn to crime more often, that they don't fit in etc. etc.)
