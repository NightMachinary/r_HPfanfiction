** I received an error message when I posted the new chapter. I think it's not just the update date.

*** Yeah, there are more than a few things going on. Updated time, notifications, ability to update at all. I think a lot of authors are just holding off on posting until some issues are resolved. Hopefully still writing though, I certainly wouldn't mind a flood of updates in a couple days.

*** That error message is the current bane of my existence. Posted two chapters since this started happening, and that error message popped up twice. Not to toot my own horn, but for the story I updated, I usually get 3000 hits and 15-20 reviews in the first 24 hours of posting a chapter. I had less than 2000 hits, and less than ten reviews since I posted the chapters at the start of the month. All because the notifications aren't going into e-mails.

** ...Your post just made me realize that I didn't get an email notification about it. Unacceptable.

** Last update email I got was early on the 1st, and I usually get at /least/ one every other day. My follow list on my profile doesn't reflect an update being made on the 1st.

Hopefully it gets resolved soon, more for the authors than anything.

** I reported the problem a couple of times this week and got no response at all. So I don't know if the site managers are working on it or if they could care less.

*** If you at any point think the site admins of FFN give a crap, you're sorely mistaken.

Case in point: Report someone for plagiarism. It can take up to a month for any resolution.

** So ordering favourites by update time doesn't work? i had a weird situation where Red Right Hand looks like it's been updated but hasn't, but maybe they just edited t. It must only affect some fics though, because some do appear when they've been updated

*** I saw something similar happen. Harry Potter and the Iron Lady was listed as having updated yesterday, but the new chapter wasn't available until about 12 hours later, even by typing in the URL directly.
