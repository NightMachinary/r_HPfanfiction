I know about [[/r/HPharmony]], but it's seems that subreddit is almost dead, so I'm making this request here.

There're a lot of HHr stories, but most of them aren't good and it's one of the reasons why some readers don't like this pairing. After reading such stories I can agree with them, very often I want to ask an author the question "Do you seriously think how it works in real life?".

But I still hope to find a good HHr romance that can really show (not just tell) how this pairing can really work.

I'm asking you to recommend good stories where definition of "good" are (without particular order):

- Not post-epilogue. If it's written correctly, breaking apart two families with kids is more angst than romance;
- Multi-dimensional characters with good and bad traits;
- Harry and Hermione are equal partners in their relationship;
- Not too OOC;
- No stupid or dumb situations to force drama (like "I love him/her, but I won't tell anything because of blah-blah-blah");
- Romance should be significant part of the story, not just some background action;
- "Mature" covers emotional level of story and possible rating (but not necessary);
- Completed (at least the romance part);
- Preferably without Harry buying Hermione's attentions with some expensive gifts or dates;

Thank you!


** Try *That Old House by vanillaparchment* linkffn(4703843). It's a postwar story (minus the epilogue) showing them as a mature couple. They aren't perfect, they argue but make up eventually. There is no forced drama or bashing of any kind.

Also check out *So Wrong for Me by scarlet and gold* linkffn(4078985). It's one of my favourite short fics.

** You came up with some good criteria. Especially the equality part seems to be really lacking in most stories: It's either all about Harry or Hermione.

Two stories that I'd like to recommend are Vox Corporis (seems to have been deleted from ff.net?! Whyyy?) and [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185][Forever Knight]]. Forever Knight is pretty angsty, but it deals a lot with "how can an equal relationship between them even work?". It's pretty far off the beaten track with the whole Vampire thing, but it really gives Hermione the opportunity to be her own person.

I read "Forever Knight" several years ago. At that time I was really impressed with it. As I remember the plot the only concern I have about it is that after leaving Hermione had her own life as she wanted, but Harry was a lost puppy until she was force to appear in his life again. It's not a turn off and it goes well in the context of the plot, but still...

And "Vox Corporis" in in my list to read :-)

Yeah, I think that was just necessary to justify the time skip. Hermione needed time to adjust to her new career and the author didn't want to skip over anything too interesting or significant.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

** Hmm, you dont want to have "post-epilogue" Fics, but are looking for "Mature" H/Hr....its a little objective, dont you think?

And as sfu69 said before, the Harmony subreddit isnt dead. Less activity maybe, but i got response for opened Threads, if there is a possible answer for it. Also, if no fic with a Criteria as you look exists, no one can help you. The only way would be to write a Fic on your own.

But anyway, i wanted to give you a Fic on the way. Its Post-epilogue, but H/Hr are adults in this (obviously) and its a Series of Fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3239478/CPO-Backstreet]] the Beginning fic is "Harry Potter and the Resurrection Movement. To be honest, im not fit with all Harmony moments in these Stories. But in total, they are good enough.

I don't think my criteria are something impossible. If they are it means there's no such thing as good Harry-Hermione romance story.

******* Yeah there's already one "as she did so" in the first chapter of the story you posted and two in the second chapter. The Epilogue is pretty great: I count 10 "as (s)he did so"s. It's beyond ridiculous. They serve no purpose.

Seems like the author really hit a nerve with me, since I remembered just from the name... it's like nails on a chalkboard.

******** Is English your Mothertongue? If so, im nt suprised, you detect stuff like that. But how would someone describe something that "s/he did" else?

********* No, but I don't think it needs any special language skills to detect repetition?

#+begin_quote
  But how would someone describe something that "s/he did" else?
#+end_quote

Any other way? Just use "and" or "while" or anything else? 95% of the "as (s)he did so"s can just be removed without harm:

#+begin_quote
  "And when I get back?" she said, smiling at Harry as she did so.
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  "And when I get back?" she said, smiling at Harry.
#+end_quote

that's still bad, to be honest:

#+begin_quote
  "And when I get back?" she asked, giving Harry a big smile.
#+end_quote

********** AHH! Now i remember. Yes, i detected it, too. Yes, the huge amount of using seemed strange to me. But i think, i never actively thought about it, but instead saw them as Filler Word like "Just"
