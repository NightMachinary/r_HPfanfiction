My husband asked me a question tonight and I am having trouble coming up with an answer. He asked, "Why is it just Harry Potter fanfiction for you? Why no other fandoms?"

I love science fiction and fantasy, but for some reason HP just pulls to me differently and I can't explain why. Do you guys have a similar thing or do you share your fanfic fandom equally with other worlds? Is there a way to know if fandom in one world would correlate to another known world?

It feels silly that I can't answer this question! lol Why DO I love HP so much more than anything else and to the exclusion of any other fanfic? Is there a way to discover a reason?


** Harry Potter is not my favorite fandom, but I have read the most HP fanfictions by far.

Why? Because the community is the largest. And when there are so many people contributing and reading, people take notice. This leads to people sticking around for longer, putting more effort into their work, which leads to longer and better stories generally. This in turn attracts even more people to the community. It's sort of a snowball effect.

I would love to read fanfictions for other fandoms, especially ones I enjoy more than Harry Potter. But sadly, the quality just isn't there. Most other fandoms I explore have a handful of good, lengthy fics at the very most, which is kind of depressing.

*** I agree completely. I've been reading fanfiction for Worm (by Wildbow) for the last few days, but after the first few dozen fics, it's hella hard to find decent works because there's just a lack of material.

** I used to exclusively read HP fanfiction, but despite the enormous pile of HP fanfiction out there, I sort of feel like I've tapped out the good stuff. So I've moved on, mostly. At first it was Naruto, but I've lost interest in that too for the same reason.

Nowadays I'm basically binging on Worm and Mass Effect Fanfiction. I still read HP fanfiction, but it's hard to find fanfiction for this fandom which is both good (in a technical sense) and interesting.

** Most of what I read is /Naruto/, /Harry Potter/, and /Friendship Is Magic/. /Naruto/ and /Harry Potter/ have cool applications of magic. /Friendship Is Magic/ is mostly goofy slice-of-life stuff, but can provide some actually-interesting long-form works on occasion; also, FIMFiction.net is way better than FanFiction.net, so it's easier to find good stories.

** I occasionally read stories set in Tamora Pierce's world, and one of my favorite HP fanfics is a crossover with Torchwood, but I mostly stick with HP. Why? Part of it's because I'm not into a lot of fandoms that generate a lot of fanfiction (Star Trek is an exception and I sometimes do read stuff there, but not often). I don't even know what Naruto is except that people love to write about it.

The other part is that Harry's story is the only book series that the child in me doesn't want to say "The End" to. The first book came out when I was 11 and while I never got my Hogwarts letter, I enjoyed returning to school with Harry every year or so until I started college. I don't want to cut off my connection with the child that I was, so I keep reading fresh, new stories of Hogwarts.

Finally, while there are some wonderfully written fanfics out there, there is also a never-ending supply of excellent, original, published novels that I want to devote the majority of my limited reading hours to.

** /So many characters./

I think honestly though, its because JKR leaves so many things ambiguous and only touches on so many aspects of the world, so fanfic authors have a multitude of entrance points even before looking to create an AU with differences to canon.

There's also the fact that unlike many fandoms e.g. Naruto or MLP, Harry Potter was an absolutely global phenomenon that has reached a huge audience, so probably statistically is already likely to have more 'good' authors.

And it was the defining series of a generation (probably my generation). I can't think of anything that comes close to reaching its scope and influence at the minute (maybe game of thrones, but at the minute that's adults-only, so it loses some crossover appeal) so until that happens, HP will continue to hold its place as the top fanfic fandom. It has a dominance similar to Stat Trek now I would say, and that gets made exponential the more it branches off in different directions hitting different audiences (e.g. love it or loathe it, Methods of Rationality, which brought a lot of older readers into the fold).

You know, I think this is it for me, too. I feel like her "bad guys" are also fully developed or at least moreso than most worlds. You can turn almost any character in any way and make it canon-ish with a few adjustments and that is because the characters are so REAL. Just like us.

A Song of Ice and Fire has some good ones, but there's just so little. I've actually read a good League of Legend fic, an ever deader fandom. Doctor Who is almost entirely stupid fangirl fantasies. Pokemon appears to have almost no competent writers. Most anime and manga has very, very little, including big ones like Fairy Tail.

I think other than Naruto and HP, the only size-able fandom is Twilight, and I refuse to touch that with a ten, no, hundred foot pole.

** I mostly read MLP:FiM stuff, and usually just read HP stuff when something is recommended to me. This is not because I don't like to read HP stuff --- I just find FFN impossible to use. I was fine with it before I discovered FiMfiction.net, but after using that for a while FFN is nearly unusable in comparison. The lack of proper voting causes a lack of proper sorting, which means you have to scroll through three pages of crap to find something good.

I've also been starting to read fanfiction of [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com][Worm]]. If you haven't read Worm, go read it right now. It's completely worth the month or so it'll probably take to read. Seriously go read it. The problem with the fanfiction is that it all seems to be posted in Spacebattles threads. I haven't gotten very good at finding it yet. What I have managed to read has been pretty great, though.

** I read quite a bit of HP fanfiction, probably more than any other fandom these days. Largely this is due to the enormous variety of fics, but the reason I started in the first place was dissatisfaction with the canon events in the last three books.

When I find myself reading other fandoms, it is usually for a similar reason - Ranma 1/2, for example, lends itself to continuation fics. Some universes are just fun, though, so you want to see more of them. Crossovers, of course, are a mixed bag, but they can be enormously entertaining. Any sufficiently popular fandom is going to have a few interesting stories at least. HP has volume, age, and enormous crossover/fusion potential on its side.

**** Ooh I can answer this one. Supernatural is what I consider my main fandom and the one that got me into fanfiction. There are some overdone tropes like there always are, but then there are also the standouts. (Honestly, everything after season 5 I just consider to be only ambiguously canon, so the fics I read are either AU or pre-s5.)

When I am feeling angsty, I love reading "amulet" fics where Dean realizes how awful he was to do what he did that one time. (Not spoiling anything, haha.)

Destiel has a ton of fics that I've never read because I have the unpopular opinion of hating Cas, but if you ship it, there's quite a bit to go through.

Then there are a bunch of case-fic stories that are set within canon and add depth to certain seasons without changing the plot. K Hannah Korossy is one if my favorites as is Disasteriffic Kaz.

Well, probably told you more than you cared about.

** At the moment I read exclusively Harry Potter fanfiction. This means it's very difficult to find anything new and good to read. I used to read Stargate and HP fanfiction, but now there's not a lot of good new Stargate fanfic and I've basically read everything I want to read already.

I write both HP and Stargate fanfic though in pretty much equal amounts - I have two series on the go, one in SG and one in HP, and both of them have ~70k words written.

I read loads and loads of other things, usually fantasy genre, but for fanfiction the only stuff I really want to read is Harry Potter. I think it's because Rowling created a really cool world, one that I wanted to live in as a child, but also left out a ton of details. I think the HP universe is an excellent framework, and even the plot itself is really good to explore, so fanfic is just so diverse and varied.

I can read something set basically in the canon universe, or I can read a radical AU, or I can read something a bit more in between. There's so much content, too. In smaller fandoms there may only be like, thirty or forty fanfics total, and more than half of those can rate 'terrible'.

I used to read fanfic for Disney's 'The Gargoyles', but that fandom is pretty much tapped out by now. The big name authors all retired, or moved on to other fanfics, and even the release of the comics failed to really kickstart any writing that I wanted to read. I was writing my own fanfics for that, but eventually I just gave up because the interest wasn't there and I'd moved on.

** I read a lot of Naruto ff, too. I started there before moving to HP after running out of good fics to read. Right now I tend to read much more HP. The reason for that, and for why they're the only two I read with any real frequency, is that most fanfiction is utter shit. The ratio of good to bad is simply horrendous and gets worse the smaller the fandom, so Naruto and HP are the only two with a real amount of quality stuff. Even then, I've read most of the good stuff already. Also, some series lend themselves better to fanfiction than others. Naruto does this fantastically, so there tends to be a bit more of it. HP, not so much, but it's ridiculously popular so there's still some to go around.

Basically, I need the world itself to be something I pine for, so to speak, and so far ME and HP are the only two that have moved me to such a degree that I just can't let it go. Fanfiction then allows me to stay in those worlds indefinitely.

** Like a lot of people are saying, the most consumed FF would be HP, but I actually had a lot of fun reading the gigantic stories (400k+) set in Stargate SG1. There are only a select few purely Star Wars stories that I enjoyed, but they were awesome. And of course there are crossover stories. There are quite a few HP/SW and HP/SG1 crossovers out there that are very much up to snuff. I can give concrete examples later if you're interested..

** Most of the fanfic I've read has been Harry Potter. There' such a variety of works, and since the fandom is huge, the fics keep getting churned out.

However, I do read other fandoms on occasion. Some of my favorite fanfics have been from "The West Wing." The writing tends to be more mature than Harry Potter, probably because members of the fandom are older.

** I used to read HP fanfic almost exclusively. But over the last several years, I've been reading less and less of it, and these days I'd say I'm about 50% HP and 50% other stuff. Largely, it's because whenever I pick up a new HP fic, I feel like every idea in the story is something I've read somewhere else. Don't get me wrong, I'm not accusing the authors of plagiarism. I think it's just that so much HP fic exists, that for any idea you have, there is about an 80% chance that someone else has had that exact same idea, and unfortunately for me, about a 50% chance I've read that other fic.

As with a lot of people in this thread, apparently, I'm reading a lot of MLP:FiM (probably 50% HP, 40% MLP, and 10% other stuff). I'd say the main reason is because that community makes the good fics so easy to find. Discovering a new HP fic that's good can mean hours and hours of slogging through FFN, and after a long day, I'm just not interested. Finding a good MLP fic is just a matter of checking what's hot/trending, or setting your sorting appropriately on fimfiction. It goes to show just how important discovery is to building a community: I'd only call myself a casual fan of the MLP TV show, if even that, and I still vastly prefer Harry Potter. But the bronies are really, really good at showing off there works (fanfic/music) to best effect. Heck, try getting into Wizard Rock these days: there's no community for it, no reddits (as far as I know), no websites, podcasts, etc. All of the above actively exist for pony music.

Oh, boy. To be blunt, I can't. Sorry! As someone who is completely blind, and was born that way, I'm afraid that my reasons for liking the MLP fanfic (and even the TV show a little for that matter) are completely different from the average MLP fan. I'm not sure I can even speak for them at all. I could speak for myself, but I don't think that would go any way towards actually answering your question. Plus, it would probably be objectively wrong; I've learned from experience that my opinions about TV shows, and especially cartoons, usually are. Maybe [[/u/gameboy17]] can chime in, here?

I tried to answer this once, four or so months ago, and arrived at the wrong answer. If your curious, and enjoy walls of text that don't really go anywhere, that discussion is here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatTheFanfic/comments/2yjjz4/even_my_precious_world_of_darkness_cant_be_spared/cpa8qqb]]

If you go down far enough, there are even fic recs! Somewhere. Eventually.

Edit: all lies. The thread is so deep they don't even show up on that page. Gotta start deeper in to see them: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatTheFanfic/comments/2yjjz4/even_my_precious_world_of_darkness_cant_be_spared/cpaznhx]]

  do you have an example that could "convert" me?
#+end_quote

Well, the fic that converted me, sort of, was /Friendship Is Optimal/: [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal]]

I say sort of because at the point I read that, I knew absolutely nothing about the characters or world of MLP. I just enjoyed the fanfic so much that I decided to read other MLP fanfics. In fact, it was months and months before I even agreed to try a single episode of the actual show, because the fanfics were so enjoyable I was absolutely sure it would only disappoint me. Fortunately, It didn't. But I'd still rather read a fanfic.

If you enjoy rationalist style fanfic, maybe that'll convert you, too. If not, it probably won't.

****** Sure it can. A blind person talking about a TV show he can't see can be wrong in just so many fascinating ways. We're only perceiving about half the content, after all. I still enjoy TV shows, but I recognize that I am inherently wrong about them much of the time, because I can never base my opinions on all of the facts. And when I'm not wrong, because the matter of opinion is subjective, I'm not sure that my subjective opinions are of much use to you.

But the thing is, being wrong is OK, at least in matters of fandom. As long as you're enjoying yourself, you're doing it right. That's why it pushes my buttons so hard when people try and tell us what fics are good, and what aren't, and what fics we should all hate. And that happens far, far, far too often in this community, and in fact drove me into a rage-explosion as recently as this morning.

This is all kind of unrelated to your original question, though. I hope at least one of those links turns out interesting for you!

** I'd love some good fanfics set in my favorite fantasy universes, but they simply aren't out there. For example, I'd love to read some Conan fanfics set in Robert E. Howard's Hyborian Age, but fanfiction.net has 13 Conan fics, with only one over 10k words. By comparison, ff.net has over 700,000 HP fics. It does seem to be somewhat generational; fanfiction authors seem to be younger and my favorite fantasy books were at the height of their popularity long before Harry Potter got big.

** I got into fandoms through Supernatural, so those will always be first in my heart. Unfortunately, I'm a bookworm and fanfiction has spoiled me. You can pick genres AND characters AND relationships AND plot without being overly picky. Plus I always have my phone on me. So when I say I've exhausted multiple fandoms, I'm not kidding. I went from Supernatural to Merlin to Sherlock to X-men to Harry Potter with some Avengers sprinkled in.

The issue I have with Harry Potter is that because it's been among my favorite books since I was a wee lass, I'm picky about what I want to read. It's a massive fandom, but there are some common pairings and tropes that I just can't read which narrows down my options by quite a bit.

With Merlin and Sherlock and etc, I am more lenient. Oh, another story where Arthur doesn't realize Merlin is magical? Great! Oh, John and Sherlock have immense sexual tension but never act on it? I can read those stories for months!

I've found good ones, because of course there is just so much of it - but I find that that's the problem - there is /so much/ of it, that it becomes difficult to find the good ones, and I tend to not like the ones people recommend. The only other fan fiction I've read is Daredevil/Marvel and it's more consistently better written than the Harry Potter fics I find.

However, I LOVE the idea of fan fiction and Harry Potter is still 99% my favorite - just so hard to find anything good in my opinion.

I am not afraid of slash or explicit content and am honestly more likely to read well written smut than a boring rated G story. (I'm open to good examples if you have any on that, though!)

**** It definitely depends on what one is looking for! It's always reminded me of the idea of fetishes, you know - how each person has a different fetish and it might be weird and incredibly particular. Same with fan fictions! I'm so picky. My favorite type of HP fan fiction is canon-compliant or close. So those "missing moments" of Dean at Shell Cottage, or Harry's Best Man speech at Ron and Hermione's wedding, or what I'd LOVE to read is decades later an excerpt from a biography on Harry's life or a collection of articles or something (so one-shots, I guess, long fics I have trouble getting into because I'm always worried they will eventually turn out bad). I've found stuff like this, but I generally have not been impressed with the writing. I used to like fics of young Harry at the Dursleys, but they always went unrealistically overboard with the violence.

I'm also just not into romance, which is 99% of fan fiction. Even if it's canon. I don't care about reading Harry and Ginny's marriage, and I definitely don't want to read them having sex.

But I've enjoyed the fics of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1704793/OwlPostAgain7][OwlPostAgain7]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] quite a bit, if you're looking for some examples!
