​A hush fell over the Great Hall as Harry's name was called. He could feel the hundreds of eyes staring at the back of his head as though the collective gaze could pierce through his skull and into his brain. As a flash of uncomfortable heat rushed through his body, Harry separated from the group and began to walk towards the old hat floating above the stool. Every step that brought him closer to the hat also fueled his awareness of how intently he was being watched, the silence becoming more and more pronounced. He wished they would all stop looking at him, he thought, as he placed the hat on his head and closed his eyes to avoid catching someone's eye.

​ “You don't like attention, do you Potter?” came a voice from -- where? Inside his head, it seemed, but Harry didn't think it. “Ah, I see. You feel as though you haven't done anything to deserve this attention. What acts, then, are worthy of attention Potter, if destroying a powerful dark wizard isn't one of them?”

​ It's the hat, Harry realized. He should have expected as much when he heard the hat's poem, but didn't realize it could speak inside his mind. Harry didn't quite like the intrusive feeling of another mind intertwining with his, even if that other mind belonged to a dusty old hat. And, he decided, he didn't like the condescending, almost accusatory tone the voice in his head had. It's as though the hat was implying that --

​ “You wonder what the world would be like if he didn't come for your family. Would you have spent the first eleven years of your life in ignorance, treated as second-class and thought of as even lower? Would you have been subjected to the cruelty of your muggle counterparts, constantly bullied and forever an outcast watching from the sidelines? Yes Potter, I see what lies in your mind, even in the deepest and darkest of crevices,” grinned the hat, or at least what Harry thought was the impression of grinning. He didn't like the hat and its invasive sentience at all, but it made a rational point.

​Suddenly and without warning, his mind travelled to what he could do with magic. He relished in his thoughts of using magic to get back at Dudley and his friends, at cursing his aunt and uncle until they were unrecognizable, at destroying every person that had a hand in creating the life he lived for the past eleven years. He thought about what it would be like to be respected for what he was able to do, and how with that respect, he could gain something he'd never had before: the loyalty of a few close friends. His mind flooded with joy as he thought about these things, forgetting the watchful presence in a small corner of his mind. And then those emotions were gone as quickly as they came, replaced with a very empty and hollow feeling. He couldn't think like that, it wasn't right.

​ “You are a complicated young wizard Mr. Potter. I have been sorting students for ages, and only a handful stood out with a similar maelstrom of inner conflict. Each of those witches and wizards went on to accomplish very big things in the wizarding world. Some contributed to magical society greatly, while others sought to conquer. Undoubtedly, you are cut from the same cloth Potter. But where to put you? Your mind is split, and I have very little doubt that you will succeed on either of two paths. But which?” ​It seemed to Harry that the hat was talking to itself now more than him. He could still feel every student's eyes on him, but it seemed like they were whispering now too. Harry realized that he had been up there for a very long time, much longer than anyone else so far. He opened his eyes to just peek at the peering faces in the crowd. He spotted Ron sitting with his brothers at the Gryffindor table, and thought about how appealing the ideals of the House were. As he scanned the hall, he noticed the blonde-haired boy, Draco, quietly laughing with a group of older Slytherins. He didn't particularly like the boy, especially since the encounter right before sorting made it clear that he was no better than Dudley and his group. But still, Harry couldn't help but feel that he was driven by jealousy. Here was someone who had everything Harry never had. Maybe he shouldn't throw away an invitation of friendship with Draco so lightly, Harry thought, as it could prove a useful resource moving forward.

​ “Hmm. You are a unique wizard Harry Potter, unique indeed. But I believe that one path is better suited for you, one that will lead you to unparalleled greatness,” chimed the sorting hat in Harry's mind. He could feel as the hat withdrew from his mind, an uncomfortable feeling akin to prying off an octopus tentacle wrapped around your arm.

Once the last remnant of the hat's mind was out of Harry's, it began to address the Great Hall with its decision. Harry didn't hear the sorting hat's words due to an explosion of clapping and cheering from the far right rows of tables. As he took his place among the students that he would call his family over the next 7 years, he thought he saw Professor Dumbledore's smile vanish. But when he looked again, Dumbledore was whispering intently to a professor with greasy black hair and a hooked nose.

He locked eyes just briefly with the man until Harry's attention was shifted back to the table from a slap on the back. “Wait until you get a load of our common room Potter”, Draco shouted over the celebrating Slytherins.

** So, the excerpt above was written yesterday and because some of you want to see more, I decided to continue. But instead of continuing from that point, I want to create a comprehensive story, so I started from the beginning. If Harry ends up in Slytherin, then fundamental points in the story have to change to reflect that. I kind of have an idea of where this whole thing will go, but it will take time. Unfortunately, I don't have a ton of time (usually just my lunch break at work), so I'll edit later but post what I've got to continue the story. That also means that I can't flesh out my ideas as much as I would like, but maybe I can revisit in the future and hash out something better. I haven't done this before, and haven't written creatively since like middle school, so we'll see where this goes. Keep in mind that some elements will be drawn from the books, but most will not be. So, without further ado, here is chapter 1.

+____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________+

*Chapter 1 - Boring Family, Troubled Boy*

Number Four Privet Drive was as normal and boring a household as could be. Vernon Dursley, a round tomato of a man sporting an unkempt mustache, was not a man of great influence and means, but he was known and respected in some circles as a family man and provider. His wife, Petunia, a shrill woman built like a reed, was kind enough and completely devoted to her son Dudley. Too devoted some might sneer, as Dudley was as thick as a tree, both mentally and physically. Now the neighbors knew /all/ about Dudley; neither Vernon nor Petunia let an opportunity to sing his praises and achievements pass by. And Dudley, having never learned the fine art of humbleness, always made sure to loudly let the other neighborhood kids know about his latest and greatest toys. So, in many cases, Number Four was about as unique as the well-manicured lawns of each house. That is to say, not unique at all.

But they did have a secret. See, the neighbors knew of Petunia's troubled sister and her troubled husband, and how they both died in a tragic accident. They knew that the Durselys agreed to take in the boy and raise him as their own, a move that divided the otherwise sensible neighborhood for a time. They didn't want a troubled boy causing mayhem in their neighborhood. No sir, not Privet Drive. Well the boy, named Harry (the neighbors got a sense of how troubled his parents were with a name like that), wasn't seen outside all that much. He didn't play with the other children and seemed to keep to himself inside the house as much as possible. So, the neighbors forgot all about their worries and went on with their uninspiring lives as the years passed. Unbeknownst to them, Vernon hated Harry and forbade him to go outside lest he “cause any trouble for the family”.

You see, Harry wasn't like the other boys and Vernon didn't like that. He didn't envision Harry in his family's life, and Harry felt that anger. His bedroom, if you could call it that, was a small cupboard under the stairs that locked from the outside. Dudley and his friends loved that little feature almost as much as they loved stomping on the stairs to cover Harry in dust just because they could. Harry never really fit in any group, and Dudley made sure it would stay that way. He was an outcast for all intents and purposes.

Harry had thick, dark brown hair that fell on his head like a mop which contrasted incredibly with his emerald green eyes. As Vernon couldn't be bothered to purchase clothes for him, Harry had to wear all of Dudley's old clothes. If he was in bed, he could be mistaken for a dirty pile of laundry with how baggy those clothes were on him. He had a lightening shaped scar on his forehead, a vestige from the accident his family was in. He was prone to outbursts as a very young child (true, they subsided in number and strength as he got older), and strange things started happening around him.

When Harry was seven, a neighbor boy was picking on him during a rare moment where he was outside; a few hours later, the boy returned home out of breath and bleeding from various scratches. It seemed as though he disturbed a group of birds and the park and they harassed him as he ran home. That same year, a boy that constantly knocked Harry into the lockers at school found himself with a broken arm after falling from a tree he swears he didn't climb. When he was nine, Dudley had to come from school for a week because his eyebrows disappeared after knocking Harry's books out of his hands at school. And the most recent event, just before Harry's eleventh birthday, when the glass barrier in a snake exhibit seemed to vanish after Dudley and his friend shoved Harry out of the way to view the snake, causing them to fall into the cage with the snake. Between those events, smaller things happened. Valuables were lost, things that shouldn't rattle rattled, harsh whispers were heard from Harry in the science wing. People started to steer clear of him. But not Vernon.

He raged at the slightest thing that was barely removed from “normal” and every time this happened, Harry had to go to his cupboard (usually without dinner). And, as Harry drew nearer to his eleventh birthday, these occurrences began to happen more frequently. Owls began to be seen flying around Privet Drive. Lights would flicker on and off repeatedly throughout the day. Men and women in strange clothes would be glimpsed walking by the house but on a second look, they weren't there. And suddenly, it all stopped the day before Harry's eleventh birthday, when an owl with a letter in its beak landed on Vernon's head while he was watering the garden. Shouting, he slapped at his head and only succeeded in poking himself in the eye as the letter was dropped and the bird was already gone. Picking up the letter and reading with his one good eye, he saw that it was addressed to Harry Potter.

Angrily, he went to open the letter but was stopped by a sharp jab in his back. He turned around slowly to see an enormous man with a very large beard staring at him. His eyes moved to the comically small and pick umbrella that was pointed at him, and the color drained from his face.

“Dursely, ya ol' prune, that letter isn't meant fer ya. Now, would ya be so kind as'ta invitin' me in? I need'ta talk with Harry,” boomed the man in a deep voice that made Vernon's bones rattle. Vernon slowly turned around, closing his eyes and wondering what he did to deserve this. As they neared the front door Vernon, with the braveness of a man of his stature, turned around and meekly asked, "And who the ruddy hell are you? I have a right to know before I let you in my house!"

The big man chuckled, winked, and pointed his umbrella at the door which opened to reveal a bewildered Harry Potter standing in front of his cupboard.

"Oh, er, hiya Harry. It's good'ta see ya again," beamed the large man, leaving Harry to wonder where in the world he has met this man before.
