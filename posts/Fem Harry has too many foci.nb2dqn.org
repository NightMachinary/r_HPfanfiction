:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I just remember one scene very vividly and it's explanation.

The explanation is that fem Harry is paranoid, and the reason that hogwarts's attendance is so low is because few magical stuff can perform all the branches of magic and use wands, other people learn one discipline, and have specialized Foci.

Harry buys a shit ton that look like regular things so she's never unarmed, I'm talking rings, necklace, bracelets, hidden on her body, wands as hair sticks, just a ton.

The scenes I remember is her going to I think the ministry and having to disarm, handing over her wand, and being asked to hand over any other foci as well, and just people being shocked as removes like 20 Foci from her person.

To help identify it, it should be on FF.net and it probably has 80k-100k words as those were the filters I searched by when I first started really getting into fanfiction


** I know I've read that story recently and I think it's Godling Ascending by High Pot In Noose, its also a Percy Jackson xover btw.
