So say: Minerva is in charge of Slytherin's, Snape is in charge of Ravenclaw, Sprout is in charge of Gryffindor, Flitwick is in charge of Hufflepuffs, or mix them around in whatever way.

How do you think the teachers would treat the students, would the students act differently with different people in charge? I don't see Minerva letting the Slytherins get away with stuff

Maybe have it a rule that if a Hogwarts Student eventually becomes the Head of House, they cannot be the Head of House for their own house, to avoid favoritism or something like that.

What do you think? Who would you put in charge of what house? What would happen, etc?

Peter is Snape and Meg is the more anti-social Ravenclaws
