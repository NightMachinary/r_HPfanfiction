** Dumbledore looked in horror at young Harry. He had left the boy examining the sword of wonderflonium, a sword destined to put an end to a dark lord, but has so far refused to help against every dark lord.

â€‹

"You did what?" Dumbledore asked, trying to appear as grandfatherly as possible.

"I, err, Dropped it?" Said Harry, pointing to a strange sword-sized hole in the floor of the Headmasters Office.

â€‹

This was bad. The sword would cut through anything., It would not stop traveling downward until it ran out of matter. Maybe there would be a underwater pool under hogwarts to stop it or...

Suddenly, the Wonderflonium sword hit the core of magikium at the center of the earth, and the entire earth was consumed by a massive fireball.

Magic relaxed itself, The prophecy that the wonderflonium sword would eventually end the dark lord, and that Voldemort would die at the hand of Harry Potter had come true. It cared little for the lack of other life left on the planet. Life was adaptable. In a few million years, it would be back.

** linkffn(Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe) has that by the boatloads. All sorts of magic/muggle fusion from swords to spaceships. It's a very good read for that, but extremely lacking in plot beyond the Avengers canon.

  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, but only after the world has been destroyed. Harry has his vengeance, but gets pulled into Voldemort's ritual and is dragged with his body to an alternate universe. First Chapter sets up the first scene. You can skip it reasonably safely. - Complete - Now up on webnovel under my original author name, burnable.

** Try linkffn(Weapons Free by angelicxdiscord). The second Voldemort war spreads beyond Britain and to include the muggles.

linkffn(Unconventional Harry by kb0) has Harry using muggle weapons in the Tournament.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Muggle Tri-Wizard Tournament by MartinDC) also has Harry using muggle weapons in the Tournament.

I remember another story that had Harry finding a semi-automatic pistol that conjured its ammunition as one of its plot elements, but I can't remember the title.

  We've been fighting this war for a long time. Muggles, they call us. They struck first. England fell. Then France. Spain. Italy. It took us ten years of tactical withdrawals and air strikes to stop their advance. Now it was our turn to push back.

** Well, if you dont mind 40k there's an ongoing crossover series where Harry gets sent to the 41st millenium after 1st year and becomes an astartes librarian, then later an inquisitor and eventually gets sent back to hogwarts in his second year. Features an ultra powerful hyper intelligent genetically engineered manchild who does not comprehend the concept of "peaceful negotiation" deciding that wizarding society is utterly backwards and does not have nearly enough religious fanaticism or military industrialization. Seeing as 40k is not hust fantasy but /science/ fantasy, lots of fancy guns ensue. It also features a uniquely fascinating perspective on wizarding politics.

** I got one for pistols. It's a WBWL fanfic but Harry's now basically a OC. He's also a She. I don't remember if there was a proper ending to it. One of the few docs where harry's sibling is actually a nice guy, though everyone else gets bashed through the roof.
