  Peeves, though he was nasty about everything else--ickle firsties and orphan girls--got it immediately. For all six years of Harry's Hogwarts tenure, he dropped water balloons on the heads of anyone who misgendered her. Professor Binns never quite figured it out, but he didn't know any student's name. Nearly Headless Nick gallantly and somewhat awkwardly called her lady and tried to hold open doors for her, despite the fact that he couldn't open them. Snape called Harry "Mr. Potter" for all seven years that he was in Harry's life. Around year three, Ron stopped counting the detentions he got for his increasingly sarcastic responses to this.

  Harry hasn't always had things easy. But with the defeat of Voldemort, maybe he can finally get some rest. But make no mistake, it has taken a toll on Harry. He has grown tired of being the famous Harry Potter, only to discover there may be other options.

** So this isnt quite what id consider a 'traditional' trans Harry story but id consider it to have some of the same/similar themes that a trans story would. Linkffn(To Reach Without) is about a Harry that gets turned into a girl via his own accidental magic shortly after Sirius' death and how he copes with it.

One of the biggest reasons id consider it akin to a trans story is that he gradually realizes that hed never been comfortable in his body as a boy and had always been somewhat femm but had to suppressed it. So if he were in a non magical world perhaps it may have come of in a more 'normal' way eventually but magic so yeah. Its maybe a little heavy on the 'woe is me im a girl all of a sudden and this is crazy and weird blah blah' early on/ before he realizes that he prefers being a girl but if you can look past it i think the story is rather good and it may be right up the alley that you're looking for.

*** My biggest problem with this fic is that it isn't really a gender change fic, but rather an angst fic in disguise.

This is best illustrated by way of an example: the author makes it so that the wizarding world has no nudity taboo. The result of this is that a major conflict/plot point is bypassed entirely. Normally in that situation, you have the problem of placement: the women are wary of having fem!Harry in their midst as they are used to thinking of him/her as a man and suspect intentions, while fem!Harry no longer feels completely comfortable around men. And on top of that, assuming that Harry's sexual preference doesn't magically flip, you have the point that the women kinda have a point - a Harry who is attracted to women should be secretly thrilled about the idea of being surrounded by naked women.

My issue is that it seems pointless to write a gender change fic if you're just going to dodge issues like that. None of the women care about nudity around fem!Harry, and fem!Harry doesn't have any interest in their nudity despite still being attracted to women (instead of sexual interest, Harry has yet another emotional breakdown).

The fic instead focused intently on showcasing a version of Harry who is emotionally weak/fragile, with the unfortunate implication that femininity should be associated with weakness and fragility. The gender change was rather unnecessary, but it's something all too common in HP fanfic: authors who wish to show Harry as weak, vulnerable and a bit pathetic often give him increased femininity. It's all the more depressing that it's mostly female writers doing this (the male writers are too busy writing power fantasies).

Oh well.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)
