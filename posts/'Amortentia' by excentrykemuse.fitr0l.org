Anyone have a pdf of this particular Harry/Romilda fic? I've searched high and low and only found dead links... I've read it's the best Romilda fic out there but unless someone's saved it, its gone


** *Edit:* I removed my saved copy of Amortentia. The author now has a website [[https://excentrykemuse.com/fanficindex/][here]] where the fic can be read.

**** I don't have The Death Mist. I haven't read most of excentrykemuse's fics, so I don't know what the Lux Kingsley stories are, but everything I have by the [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwfE6l6RtZAsRVZ2WXF4djExNjA][author can be found here]].

** There is also linkao3(14164617) ... please, consider the tags. It is about rape and its consequences, so I can imagine it can be trigger for a lot of ugly things for those where it matters.

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.
