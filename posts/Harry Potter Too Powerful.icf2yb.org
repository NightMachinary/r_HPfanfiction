I've been looking for a fic for a while now that has Harry as too powerful, as in, *problematically* powerful. When he tries a Disarming Spell, it dislocates his opponent's shoulder, Aquamenti fills a swimming pool, and so on, with a special focus on how his mental status has to change to find fine control. If the consensus is that it can't be found, I'll give it a go.

​

Thanks for your time.

*** The Final Battle:

Spells arced through the air like metors, crashing against the faltering shield around Hogwarts. Voldemort's armies stood row on row, black-robed, masked Death Eaters in the center and the more ragged Snatchers and Imperiused victims on the wings, firing down on the beleagured school, the towering shadows of giants in the rear while a black cloud of Dementors swarmed over head, obscuring the stars. Harry could see the defenses failing- in a moment they would break, and Voldemort and his followers would storm the school, slaughtering everyone inside. Slowly, he raised his wand, and pointed it in the general direction of Voldemort's army. The aim didn't really matter, but he kept it at the center, where the Death Eaters were. He didn't want to hurt the innocent if he could help it.

"Bombardo Maximus!"

The Earth erupted in a column of fire and dust and flying boulders, an entire hillside vanishing in a single wrenching burst of destruction. The shock wave hit a moment later, shattering windows and bowling over many of the defenders, Harry among them. When he sat up, nothing remained of Voldemort and his Death Eaters, save for a few scraps of charred clothing. Here and then on the fringes, a few bodies lay, some moaning and writhing, others silent and still. Others were stumbling into the woods, or apparating away with cracks he could not hear, his ears still ringing from the blast. Even the Dementors had been scattered. Harry quickly averted his gaze, swallowing hard. With one spell, one moment of letting loose after all those years of carefully-learned control, he had killed... he didn't know how many. The Second War was over, ended in a single blast of magic.

********** Potions in the wizarding world appear to have relatively short (or wildly inconsistent)shelf lives, not to mention that all the forms of wizarding travel occur with quite violent movement, making it seem like broken potion bottles would be common ( especially because despite technically having spells to stop things from breaking, wizards are idiots and I truly doubt they would remember to use them) Thus making the Mandrakes a more reliable resource to then turn into a potion yourself

** This fic isn't entirely based around your prompt, but I do believe it has elements of it in it. In Refiner's Fire, Harry gets a plot driven massive power boost (the Refiner's Fire), and struggles with controlling his power post boost. Like there's a scene where he tries to levitate a quill and he bricks it into the ceiling. And he has to learn to fine tune it, from the basics. However, it's not the actual main plot, and more of an ongoing side conflict alongside the main plot.

It Could Only Happen to Harry by HoosYourDaddy

Something to do with defeating Voldemort led to a massive increase in Harry's raw magical power. It's too much for his body to handle and it will kill him. Luckily, Pomfrey talked to some fellow medical professionals that she knows and one of them has an answer. Transferring magical potential via ritual sex magic.

The fic is surprisingly decent and funny, considering the premise. Very smutty though, in case that wasn't clear.
