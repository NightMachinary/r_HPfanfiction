I get why Rowling decided to write Voldemort the way she did; to make it easier for Harry and co to defeat him later on, plus Harry is the Main character; so of course he has to win. But, I don't know; seeing the adult Voldemort, was disappointing. The few snippets we got from teenager Riddle Jr seemed far more interesting (to me, personally).

While Voldemort was power hungry and powerful, I always saw him as cunning and convincing; I mean I know that Bellatrix is crazy, but she obviously liked him a great deal. I always thought him to be like; let's say Lucius Malfoy like; but even more so, in a way. Very easy with the words, having people listen to you; I mean he is able to get a ton of followers, and I'm sure a large portion is because he agreed with them, but another part has to be with his personality.

I always thought of it as charming, charismatic, cunning, (he's able to play a cat and mouse like game against Dumbledore for so long). Saying just the right thing to get people on his side, that kind of thing.

I'd like an adult Voldemort like that in the stories, please.

Not really looking for too much else. I don't want Harry to be over powered or anything, I don't want Hermione/Draco or Harry/Hermione, I don't want anything else major, I just want that.

I don't want Hermione to be Mary-Sue Hermione or Hermione to be evil or anything like that. Or anything too crazy with ooc characters (though I suppose Voldemort would be, kind of?).

I just want an intelligent Voldemort. Note Harry can be smarter/stronger as well, but I've read so many OP Harry; just make it believable for the story, please.


** It's very far from complete, but linkffn(Carpe Noctem) shows some promise. Voldemort's consciousness goes back to his teen years after being killed, and as a result of having a complete soul again, he regains most of his sanity and sets out to be smarter about his rise to power this time.

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) fits. Voldemort won the first war and is charismatic, clever and sane. Wizarding Britain under him is a decent place even if there are a few ethically questionable things going on. There is no main romance plot line and Harry is not overpowered or super smart/powerful.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux by the Imaginize) The horcrux in Harry's head awakens when he is a child. This version of Voldemort is quite manipulative and charming while slowly influencing Harry to do what he wants him to do.

linkao3(Keep Your Enemies Closer by Riddletobien) I thought he was well portrayed here as well.

  Voldemort discovers his human horcrux and takes control of wizarding Britain. Harry is allowed to live though it's a knife-edged journey: attending a darker version of Hogwarts, Harry deals with vengeful classmates, a strange connection to Dark Marks, and worst of all, Tom Riddle's voice whispering inside his head. AU dystopia. No slash, mostly gen. A story about two arch-enemies forced to coexist.First chapter edited and improved, try it out :)

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

Not necessarily, I mean it was apparently Lily's love that kept him from dying, combined with the surprise Horcrux inside of him. I don't even think that a smarter and saner Voldemort would understand the power of love all that much.
