** In my experience, "it's not the ship, it's the characterization" is a pretty global phenomenon when it comes to fandom. Just about every ship is going to have a group of fanon tropes and characteristics which become ubiquitous. In most cases, Wolfstar included, it's not so much an accurate reflection of the entire fanbase as it is a popular/often discussed portion.

** Or they turn into all-gay-all-the-time character later, when some manager ordered more diversity in characters. Hmm, I haven't mentioned Blake Moran in the Madam Secretary, have I?

He wasn't gay before, but then he suddenly turned gay, and couple of episodes later he starts to date the most abused character in the history of universe, Stevie McCord, so he is suddenly bi. I mean, really?

** Completely agree. The characterizations are just off.

** I haven't noticed Wolfstar characterizations being any worse than fanfiction characterizations in general.

The Snape incident would have been a deal-breaker in any healthy relationship, but Remus canonically puts up with way too much crap from his friends, so it's in-character for him to forgive even that. He seems especially vulnerable to be a victim in abusive relationships, looking at Sirius and Tonks.
