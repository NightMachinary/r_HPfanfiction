I love the m-rated long, novel-length SSHG fics where some semblance of Severus and Hermione's personalities remain (I feel like even with Hermione's lovin' Snape wouldn't just go completely soft!) Lemons are heartily encouraged. I find that I am especially drawn to Snape in the muggle world (like his background comes out or he is in hiding). Any recommendations??

For reference, I've read Care of Magical Creatures, Pet Project, Post Tenebrus Lux, Teaching Miss Granger, Chasing the Sun, and Becoming Familiar with a Man of Misery.

**** Sweet! [[https://darsynia.dreamwidth.org/29180.html][Here is the old post on dreamwidth.]] Fully half of the links do not work anymore, and some of them I can't remember well enough to search for them, but I stand by all of the recs, so if you want to dig them up with google or the wayback machine, it's worth it. Especially For Someone Special and Pawn to Queen, both crazy good stories with massive amounts of sex, lol. Here are some I dug up, though!

Heart Over Mind by Reagan - my all-time favorite back in the day. Hermione has a weird reaction to a love potion, and strange happenings result. It's such a believable romantic arc, and a fun premise--basically she is unaffected by a particular potion because she's already in love with someone so perfectly that it won't affect her, which is a rare happenstance.

​

[[http://www.themasque.net/wiktt/efiction/viewstory.php?sid=2635&warning=2][Ordinary People by Hayseed]] - A SS/HG story that strives for realism.' Hermione is very advanced for her age, and Snape decides to help her with her research. Along the way, they fall in love--not because they're fantastically beautiful or handsome, but because they've made a connection with each other. A must-read, IMO.

​

[[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/][Getting the Hang of Thursdays by Hayseed]] - (A different archive, because the link from Ordinary People requires a login) Oh dear lord. This fic has a fantastic premise; (trust me, it's a humor piece) Hermione dies over and over again, ala Groundhog Day but with a darker twist. I don't want to ruin any of it, but don't knock it till you've tried it!

​

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=2981][Somewhere I Have Never Travelled by Savageland]] - okay, so you have to get a login to an old archive, Sycophant Hex (all SS/HG) to read this, so I totally understand if you don't want to register to read it. It is 100% worth it, though. A time travel twist--Hermione as an older woman decides that she has to go back and try to alter the way that things have turned out. Under an alias, she shows up at Hogwarts, and things get complicated when sparks fly between a professor that doesn't realize who and what she really is. It's SO GOOD.

​

The Heart With No Companion by Michmak - Hermione is injured in a battle and is relatively comatose. The only visitor she has is Snape, and she is unable to communicate the fact that she can hear and see everything around her. Eventually Snape is compelled to find a way to free her from her mental prison...

  PART 27 ADDED, COMPLETE. Something odd about Hermione causes her to have unexpected reaction to a love potion. Only it's one which no one expected. How could a lack of reaction cause so much trouble? AU to Books 5 and 6.
