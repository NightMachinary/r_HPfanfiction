Hi,

This is my first time posting, but I'm looking for a fanfic I read a while ago that was post-hogwarts. I don't remember the exact plot line, but I remember random parts of it. I think it picked up after the end of the battle of hogwarts or a couple of months afterwards. Harry Potter joined the auror department and so did Neville and I think Ron too. There was a scene in a chapter where Harry got mad and blasted a wall down. Another auror, i think her name was Christina, hugged him after Harry did that. That same auror also had two kids and the older one wants to be a holyhead harpy. Fleur's younger sister also wants to be a quidditch player. Another part I vaguely remember is an auror telling Harry he could be friendlier with the other aurors like Neville who had been talking to other aurors and getting to know them better. I'm sorry I couldn't remember much of the plot. What I did remember seemed really trivial.

Thanks so much to those who responded!
