So I've been reading Harry Potter and the Daft Morons and I might have a winner in Most Obnoxious Harry (even in a bashing fic). This fic stars a most incompetent Dumbledore who gets outmanoeuvered from the very first chapter, an evil Mrs. Longbottom (never seen that one before!) and of course a H/Hr relationship where the Granger parents are much better than the average Magical.

Now I was wondering, what fic would you *absolutely NOT recommend?* And why not?

Linkffn(12562072) for those with a morbid curiousity.


** I don't unfortunately remember name of that fic, but Harry was teaching pureblood customs in his first year (even to students from seventh year) and in the first lecture he explained why Ravenclaw sign is a raven. Oof

**** My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me: 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because that summary gave me cancer anyway.

** Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness. Great premise, terrible execution. Some plot points are frankly ridiculous, but it's the characterization that makes it terrible. All the boys in the DA are militaristic heroes, while the girls have the roles of adorers, healers and victims. All characters who aren't ethnically English are portrayed in a very stereotypical way. Established canon characters like Neville or Snape act completely ooc, like Neville torturing people or Snape trying to feed students to werewolves. And then there's the hyper-militaristic overall tone of the fic that even glorifies child soldiers. Do Not Recommend.

**** No, there is a difference between stories about underage characters doing heroic things, which is a common trope in childrens' and young adult literature, and the militarism displayed in stories like DAYD. In fact, Dumbledore if anything goes towards the other extreme, trying and failing to shield Harry from Voldemort again and again and only starting to prepare Harry for facing Voldemort once he knows his remaining lifetime is counted in months rather than years.

I also can't see any glorification of children taking part in war or glorification of war at all. Just look at how Colin's death is treated, as the tragic death of a boy who had no business even being there. Or the small scene of Ginny trying to comfort the injured girl. Or Fred's death and the impact it has on the Weasleys. This is about the suffering of the individual and the grief and loss their loved ones feel.

Contrast that to DAYD, which is full of bullshit like the DA praising the noble sacrifice of one of their members for their cause. Said member was like 14 years old if I remember correctly.

You are forgetting the scenes where Sprout prepares the mandrakes (which should have utterly decimated the Death Eaters) or how proud Neville's grandmother is that her 17-year-old grandchild is in the frontlines. Or Neville later on becoming a hero for standing up against Voldemort, despite being underage. And the same stuff happens after the DoM battle.

Canon is a very filtered world, while DAYD is a more realistic approach to a civil war. And many countries are proud of their (dead) underage fighters, just look at Poland with the Warsaw Uprising. It is not "bad fiction", it is a reality of our world.

** There is a story on FFN where Harry overhears Snape and Malfoy talk about Draco's mission during the Christmas party. He gets angry. Meanwhile McLaggen slips Hermione a love potion. Harry finds evidence of this, goes to the Gryffindor tower and discusses the issue with Ron. Harry points out that their friend is being raped right now, Ron decides that she had it coming and Harry then sits around and does nothing. He has the map and the cloak, but he just sits there and waits for Hermione, who is being raped at the same time.

The author justifies this with "Harry is angry" and generally making bad decisions, so it's totally in character. The boy who knowingly went into a Death Eater ambush to save his godfather, who was unlikely to be at the Ministry in the first place leaves his best friend to be raped because he is angry. And Harry is very clear about the fact that Hermione is being raped, not just some harmless fun as the magical world sees them.

At this point, it is not even the end of the first chapter but I dropped the story like a hot turd (not to insult potatoes for the comparison to that fic).

  The pain caused by the Cruciatus Curse is described by Harry Potter as being worse than "one thousand white-hot knives, boring into the skin" and beyond what most people will ever experience.The sensation of the curse is so intense that the person under the effects wishes for unconsciousness and even death, as a means of escaping the searing pain.

HJPEV is a bit autistic and arrogant little prick but his heart is in the right place. He's trying to help people in his own way.

To be fair this is not just about "Morons", but the majority of all fanfiction. Almost no fanfiction author can write a real world reaction when his/her protagonist is a lier/deceiver/prick/arsehole/etc.

** I can't remember the name of it for the life of me, but there was an almost total rip-off of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champions Champion) if it were written by a 12 year old. Like every plot point was copied in this fic while still being poorly written. Champions Champion isn't an amazing fic but it was amusing enough. This other fic is one I legitimately want my time spent on it back. I'll try to dig through my post history to find it.

  In his dreams Harry discovered Voldemort was going to attempt to get him into the TriWizard Tournament. In retaliation he tricked the Goblet of Fire to emit the names of the people who wanted him in the tournament. Four names came out, including Albus Dumbledore. Now the new Supreme Champion is forced into the tournament. See how he fares. Dumbledore!Bashing.

As opposed to that one time a neural net made a chapter? Are we no longer allowed to call bad stories "bad" because the story was written by an actual human being with feelings? Every story out there is made by someone, and I'm pretty sure the authors know what they're doing, have heard every possible criticism before, and most certainly don't need people like you do be "ashamed" on their behalf.

That is not what I implied at all. I never said that you cannot criticise, although, if you do, it should be done constructively. This thread is going as far as an anti-recommendation for certain fics, which is the complete opposite of what this subreddit set out to achieve. If you dislike something, stop reading it and move on with your life. If you feel the need to post about a fic, warning other people off it because you are a delusional child that must whine about /everything/ they come across, then you are a part of the issue.

But, no, the issue is far from just, and I quote, ‘Criticising publically available stories' and crosses more into the territory of actively posting fics for people to avoid because /you/ dislike them. You are not criticising, you are downright bashing. Nothing in this thread has been criticism and more groupwanking about ‘bad' fics.

#+begin_quote

You can, but do it with a sense of matureness, not a glorified group chat whining and moaning about something like a teenaged girl. However, if a story is bad, why did it leave enough of an impression on your that you /must/ come and tell other people to not read it. You remind me of Facebook mothers.

I am ashamed because this subreddit is meant to be a place where we can discuss and advertise fanfiction, not set out to bash it and go as far as not recommending it. I mean, slash fics already had to create their own subreddit because this sub seemed to blindly downvote anything with even the teensiest bit of gay in it.

A truly welcoming community.

***** That's true for me as well. The thing is at 2 million views, and I just don't get it. Maybe it was because it was written during some sort of sweet spot, back in 2009 before the indy!Harry/Daphne phase started to die out. Perhaps it managed to get archived into a bunch of different sites which people keep stumbling upon or something. It's kinda weird because every now and then it will get a brief burst activity and some reviews will pop up from different people, and all I can say is that their taste sucks if they actually like it.
