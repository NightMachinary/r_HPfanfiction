In this fanfiction,

- Draco lived in a run down apartment with a lot of junkies

- Ministry stipend was only a few dozen pounds a month

- Dudley worked for the ministry of magic as some kind of social worker

- In Draco's apartment, the closet contained mostly feminine clothing

- When he went to buy groceries, he returned the change to the cashier

That's all the details I can remember. I'd really appreciate it if anyone could help me find this fanfiction!
