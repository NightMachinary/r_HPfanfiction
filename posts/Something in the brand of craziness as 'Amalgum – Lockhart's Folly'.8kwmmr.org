Don't even recall what made me read this story, it just sounds so weird and dumb. But holy smokes, this rides the line between crack and interesting plot so well I couldn't put it down when I first read it. I haven't seen much like, so I'm curious if others have.


** Eh, not for me. The initial chapter was somewhat interesting, but it was adopted from another person. It quickly descended into a tropey mess of "Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Gaunt-Slytherin" and an annoyingly forced relationship between Harry and Hermione (despite being my OTP) including a stupid version of Ron-bashing (Harry-Lockhart is basically a massive dick to him and manipulates everyone else into being mean to him). I lasted maybe 8 chapters before I dropped it.

*** Not to be a dick, but what does your opinion on the story have to do with my attempt to find others like it? It's flaired a 'request' thread to look for recommendations, not critiques.

**** Eh I am in agreement with him, the story itself was terrible, it could have been great though. linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) will always be my gold standard for crack with the the story being both insane and absolutely wonderful. I have written a rant about A-LF before, the general mean spirited nature of the MC made the crack elements of the story sour, but I really do recommend this story as the difference in writing quality is amazing.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

***** I think seventh horcrux is a relatively fun story but I find it difficult to get properly invested in something quite so silly. I have this issue with a lot of cracky fics though.i like funny stories but I struggle to care about characters in most of them and normally end up dropping them after a while.

****** I find that it is fairly dependent on what sort of stories you prefer, my favourites have always been ones where the characters are actually enjoying themselves for good portions of the story. Realism is very low on my list, suspended belief is the core of crack stories, just enjoy the lunacy for what it is

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!
