Does anyone have any good fanfiction where Snape turns into a teenager? More specifically, something happens that turns him into a teenager during the Golden Trio's time at school. If possible, gen fanfics would be the best, but it's okay if there is romance - No Snape/Hermione, please. Also long fics would be preferable, but short ones are fine too.


** There's a very recently published story, "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29422965/chapters/72280395][That Snape Boy"]], that fits what you're looking for. "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23940205][Second Chance]]" is an AU one-shot where he's turned into a teenager during the trio's era. It's not the most in-character story, but it's still kind of fun. Otherwise, "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11075550/1/Pint-Sized][Pint Sized]]" is a multi-chapter that updates every now and again. He's not quite a teen, but he's twelve, so it's pretty close to what you're looking for.

** He's not a teenager in this but he turns back into a child right after the war ends. Really well done imo. Very believable kid Snape. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23728378/chapters/56981551]])

  When Harry decided to retrieve Severus Snape's body from the Shrieking Shack, intent on giving him a proper burial, he never thought he'd insted find the boy he saw in the memories, from the playground, scared, spitting mad, and with no idea how he got there.
