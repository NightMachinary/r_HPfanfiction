The question of how easy or hard it would be to break the Statute of Secrecy has come up in discussions before, and many seem to think that modern communications and the Internet will make keeping magic a secret impossible in the future. "News will get out" is an oft cited argument.

And yet - even if news about magic would get out, why would muggles believe it. Would you believe it?

Imagine watching a youtube video about some "wizard spells". Would you believe that magic is real? Or would you think that's some hoax? CGI? What if the government(s) and experts claim it's a hoax? Would you believe a guy on the street that magic was real and he got cursed, but fixed? Or if it was your friend?

What would it take for you to believe magic is real? Government confirmation? First-hand evidence? HD videos? Testimonies of people? Which people?

*** This probably wouldn't be enough for me. I would sooner believe I had gone insane and needed to visit the doctor than magic was real.

I would need first hand evidence AND wide-spread societal acknowledgement including acceptance by respected public figures. Both are necessary. Experience alone and I would doubt myself, societal acceptance alone and I would assume it was some kind of elaborate prank or mass stupidity.

***** Spoken like a creationist. Contrary to popular belief, the fundamental nature of the universe cannot be determined by personal opinion.

One should distrust all anecdotal evidence, no matter the source. There's nothing special about my own experiences relative to other people. Any experience in isolation is an unreliable source of knowledge.

Humanity has developed institutions of knowledge for good reason. The large scale collection and testing of experience has proven far more reliable in discovering genuine knowledge than trusting one's own intuition and senses.

I mean, think about it. Arthur Clarke's third law, even seeing something like transfiguration in person could potentially be explained away as an amazing illusion or hypnosis or super-high technology.

To be convinced, I'd probably need to be exposed to something obviously magical at the pet store, or walking down the street...heh, how many people do you think would want a cute, fluffy, low-maintenance puffskein if magic were real?

*** I remember watching a documentary about James Randi and how he, plus a few others, managed to trick actual scientists into believing in magic for an pretty impressively long time. Like, during almost a year of studies while being filmed and picked apart by the best of the best. And they did it with slight-of-the-hand-tricks. I agree with you, I think it would take scientists agreeing that its real and not a joke plus some personal interaction to make me believe. Like, a wizard or witch would have to show me proof via portkey travel or something.

That being said, if it was someone I knew personally, like I friend or a family member, I don't think it would take too much. A few spells here and there and and introduction to the world with a few newspapers or something. Nobody I know personally would be smart enough to pull off an elaborate prank to make it seem like the wizarding world is real.

** Nothing, I think would be the correct answer.

We already know of a force that can invisibly act on objects to move them around or levitate them. It is called magnetism. It would appear as 'magic' to those who don't understand it, but once you begin studying it and understanding its limitations the magic goes away.

If I was to come in contact with storybook-esque magic, my immediate reaction would be to study it. (Honestly, a reaction that doesn't happen enough in magic-type books). What are it's limitations? Does the mental state of the practitioner matter? Does Exhaustion effect it? How does it actually interact with objects. Is there some kind of detectable field around them? Lets quantify its strength. Ok, lets have you cast the same light spell 100 times, does it change? How about if we move you around? Let me get an instrument that measures the strength of the light...

It wouldn't take much to convince me there is some unknown power in the world that some people can control with will alone. A fully reproducible, describable experiment. I'd likely even be ok relying on the community at large to verify the experiment rather than require I see it first-hand.

The problem with the notion of magic without rules is that the world doesn't work without rules. If there really is such a thing, how can you call it anything beyond chaos. And if there was really will-controlled magic of that nature, with no limitations, how has the world not been destroyed by some nihilistic wizard who happened along? And if you are willing to tear down enough of the rules of the universe, eventually I'm going to start thinking we are all a figment of some omnipotent imagination. Maybe one who thinks she is a high school student but doesn't really know her powers...

And of course, Magic with rules is just science. Atomic bombs, magnets, gravity... once you understand them, we don't call them magic.

** I'd have to see a magic demonstration with my own eyes I'm a paranoid and cautious person by nature for me to believe it's not butter I need to see the car facts. No illusions just flat out raw magic until then seeing a video would interest me at most while hearing people claim they saw it would be taken with a grain of salt not yet ready to believe but not outright rejecting it. If enough people start making claims I'd then start to do my own research since at that point something would be clearly going on.

** Ive always wondered this. With the technology in today's world, combined with the possibilities to fool the eye, either via "muggle magic" or simple tech tricks, it seems like it would take a LOT to break the statute of secrecy and would probably require a large scale event reported by multiple media sources across a country and seen by hundreds if not thousands of people. Even then, it might not be enough. A good example would be the mass UFO sightings that pop up occasionally around the globe, often with recordings, where you just cant know for sure one way or the other.

To personally believe it I would likely have to experience it first hand and over a period of time before I truly believed, or at least have such a large percentage of the world see proof of it, that there is no denying its fact.

Then again, look at what happens with God or Gods. Millions believe with no real "proof" other than their "belief". Ive never seen a god or gods. We have no scientific proof of a god or gods. And yet, most religious people choose to believe he, she, it, or they exist.

Or if it just keeps being reported on. If I hear of paranormal activities by weird people in robes for weeks on end, I'd eventually give it some credibility.

** When I see evidence of it somewhere while I also see concerted efforts by established authorities genuinely doing everything they can to cover it up.

It's not so much the what as the how that would clinch it. Like if videos were being spread on the chan boards with the chans being taken offline without explanation not hours later, but with so many people having downloaded it that the spread can't be stopped and reaches critical mass at some point and everything goes to shit after that. That would be the most realistic scenario that I would believe that comes to mind.
