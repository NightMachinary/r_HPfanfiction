  Fem!Harry. After saving the Philosopher's stone, Dahlia Potter soon discovers the world isn't as black and white as she believes it to be. She suddenly discovers the truth of her true parentage and is faced with the threat of not just Lord Voldemort, but beings and people off realm, who would wish her harm, if they discovered who her father is.
