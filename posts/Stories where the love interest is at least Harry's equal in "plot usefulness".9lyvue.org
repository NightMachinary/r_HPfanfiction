First of all, I am not looking for Mary Sues or flawless fanonHermione. I want a capable love interest, not someone who is just there to look pretty. I want stories where Harry isn't the one who does all the badass stuff.

With that out of the way, are there any stories where Harry's girlfriend/wife is at the very least able to match him when it comes to plot usefulness? She might not be able to kill Voldemort (due to the prophecy), but there are plenty of other bad guys who need killing. Or backroom deals to be made. Or any other aspect where she can get things done while Harry struggles.

Please, no slash, no "return to the present" plots like in Delenda Est and preferably no Ron/Hermione or Hermione bashing.


** linkffn(6311215)

It's part of a trilogy. The love interest is Daphne Greengrass and though she isn't equally as important as Harry, she is essential to his success

  First in the Lion's Trilogy. Daphne likes Harry, and decides she wants to get to know him. Harry is receptive to her advances. Little do they know of how their blossoming relationship will change the course of fate.

** I don't know what "return to the present" means. Do you want no time travels who know the future? I'm assuming it is something more specific than just someone going into the past?

Well, Grains of Sand in the Hourglass fits most of your request, but it does involve the main character traveling back in time and is a bit of a fix it fic. It is well written. linkffn(12188150)

​

Hermione is the main character in Escape linkffn(11916243), and Harry is the supporting love intrest. Fits exactly what you are looking for.

​

The Red Knight also kiiiinda fits, although Harry is more of a side character (and female, don't forget female). linkff(12141684) . It is about a reincarnated Ron (who lives in a world with Fem!Harry so Ron is/was kinda a love interest. Can't really say more). It meanders a bit in the middle, but is good.

​

Final Protocol linkffn(12775205) Has Harry as a disabled Love Interest to main character Susan Bones.

** Can I recommend a single scene? The graveyard scene in Cold Blood:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5786099/1/Cold-blood]])

Harry is incapacitated and Hermione goes total BAMF to get them out. Sadly the rest of the fic doesn't hold that quality.

There's also a few oneshots&drabbles that play with this topic:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10034465/1/The-Hostage]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3292515/1/Duty]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12266512/1/Protector]])

Any fic that decidedly subverts the "Damsel in distress" trope gets lots of bonus points from me, but it's surprisingly rare. Some fics start out with strong strong love interests that contribute to the plot in a meaningful way and then completely devolve and regress them to being spectators (like "Unexpected Assistance")

You get a lot of negative reviews when you have Harry rescued out of a spot of trouble. Even if there was no way he could have done anything without getting a killing curse in the back at point-blank range. I speak from personal experience here.

***** Dawn of Darkness. Tonks saves Harry's bacon in chapter 8. Many reviews (and PMs) either pointed out that an abuse of power is in fact illegal (oh really) or that Harry should have pulled some Hollywood stunt to free himself. But given that it is some of my earliest works, I really have to rewrite the first chapter since it has way too much exposition.

If you liked Drool, Under Guard might be something for you. Same focus on humour, just with a Hermione/Tonks pairing.

She is clearly miserable since she "cannot" go with Harry, but doesn't just ditch the dude.

Let me make it clear again, she declines an invitation with the boy she is into over someone to whom she has no connection.

Mediocre as it may be, that fic is in the upper reaches of the pairing. Which is sad because Flowerpot is a top three pairing for me. Doesn't help that its mediocrity comes from having many lows to go with the highs, so you're as likely to love it as to hate it depending on what you're looking for or hate in a fic.

On that note, linkffn(the halfblood romantic) is better written and also features a more than competent Fleur.

Linkffn(final protocol) is just ok, but it also fits your requirements.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) could also be argued to fit, the plot half runs around the love interest and she's certainly a capable witch.
