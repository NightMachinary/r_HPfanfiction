Do you write characters well? Do you come up with interesting plots? Do you build intricate and intense worlds of majesty and wonder? Is your realism so real that you're really good at it? Are you ridiculously talented at coffeeshop AUs? Kinky A/M/O smut? Do you excel at the exceptional? Are you incredible at the inane? Do you just word good? Simply put, when you write a thing, what do you think you do well?

** My ability to write engaging summaries that draw readers in. I swear I could write a fanfiction about Harry taking a piss and make the synopsis sound intriguing and interesting even if the actual story is complete garbage.

*** Ugh, I am /terrible/ at summaries. Probably comes from being generally long-winded.

** I consider myself pretty well-rounded as a writer, though my biggest strength would probably be my ability to write humourous scenes or my ability to write realistic character interactions. Those are the things I'm most consistently praised for in my reviews

** Dialogue. Rubbish at action but dialogue, I can nail.

** For me, either avoiding/closing plot holes or doing passable action scenes. The former comes from hating it when stuff doesn't make sense or is OOC, the latter is mostly being able to visualize the setup and sort of letting the characters go.

My biggest weaknesses are character interactions (I tend to devolve into lectures, speeches, and infodumps) and (as stated elsewhere) summaries.

** I'm really good at coming up with interesting story ideas with some powerful emotional scenes throughout the story.

I'm really bad at writing any of it down.

** I think I deliver on both counts when I use the "angst and humor" tag

I think I'm good at incorporating cultural references into my fics (without shoving it down your throat, hopefully)

and I think I'm good at capturing some of the "happy free confused and lonely at the same time" feelings of your late teens into your twenties

** In the fic I'm working on now, I think I've done all right with characterization and continuity. It's also my first long fic so I've been playing around a lot with foreshadowing and it's turned out well.

Having a detailed outline really, really helps.
