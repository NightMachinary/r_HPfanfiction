Just reread the best fanfic ever written, My Immortal... I really want a short prequel covering all the events that apparently happened before the story started. Some of the events which would occur in this story-

​

- Harry changes his name to "Vampire", briefly dates Draco Malfoy, who /gets a tattoo of his name/ then Harry dumps him for a Gryffindor girl named Brittney.
- During the same time, Hermione discovers that she is not a Muggleborn, but rather, a vampire of the Smith Family (infamous vampire clan, I assume). She then converts to Satanism, stated going by "B'loody Mary" and transfers to Slytherin.
- Ron dyes his hair black, changes his name to "Diabolo" and transfers to Slytherin.
- Ron somehow uses magic to change Harry's scar from a lightning bolt into a pentagram. Harry starts wearing concealer over his scar. He also gets contacts.
- Hagrid goes back to school, presumably to finish his degree? Also becomes a Satanist.
- Snape converts to Christianity and starts going out with Lupin.
- It turns out that Author Weasley is the father of not only Ron and +Ginny+Jenny, but also of Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. They also convert to Satanism.
- Dumbledore paints the Great Hall hot pink.
- Neville /also/ discovers he was born to vampires, and changes his name to "Dracula". He begins dating Hermione.

Has anyone written this? I suggest it starts with Filch dumping a ton of lead paint into the water supply.


** Not quite, but linkffn(My Immortal Lily and the Art of Bringing Me to Life) is (be warned, it is a spinoff/crossover of Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus, which I recommend reading anyway) disturbing, creepy and very very well written.

#+begin_quote
  On what seems like an ordinary day in Hogwarts Lily and company find themselves in a surreal reality that seems to hinge entirely on a strange transfer student by the name of Ebony Way. Now, with reality tearing at the seams, Lily must find a way to save the universe before everything she knows and loves sinks into a goffick abyss. Crossover with the immortal fic "My Immortal"

** Here, I started it

------

​

"I certainly hope you all finished analyzing the results of the Lineage potion for homework," Snape said "because I will be basing your entire grade upon it."

"I did, Professor!" B'loody Mary said "It turns out my real parents were vampires!" Snape sneered at her but collected her homework

"Uhm, it also turns out my parents were vampires," Neville said, handing over his parchment.

"You copied mine!"

"No I didn't!" Neville defended himself. "In fact, I'm changing my name to Dracula right now!"

"Mine says I'm a Weasley," said Vincent Weasley née Crabbe.

"Mine too," said Gregory Weasley née Goyle.
