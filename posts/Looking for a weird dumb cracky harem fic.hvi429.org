I don't remember much since this was from a few years ago, it had Neville and harry form huge harems (including Neville being coddled by Bellatrix and treated him as a dark lord), they had a quidditch game between their two harems at one point if I'm right. It also has Draco being turned into a girl by their mom and being betrothed to Ron, who then runs away and becomes like a mercenary when he learns of this.


** Actually the fun part was that Bellatrix wanted to make her little Neville the next Dark lord and was making all the cute Slytherin girls be his dark consorts/harem. His grandmother shows up at Hogwarts to stop Bellatrix until Bellatrix mentions grandbabies hundreds of grandbabies. Then Augusta is "all in".

** I have not read it, though I would venture to guess Harry's girls are more Quidditch prone than Neville's girls.
