  So I saw this headcanon on tumblr the other day that was like "what if Minerva had trusted dumbledore a little less and she and her wife bought the house next door to the Dursleys" and then there was a dream and I told Lils and our minds ran with it. So here we are. Fluffy oneshots for when the long AU's get too deep and intense for both you guys and us.Love,Des and Lils
