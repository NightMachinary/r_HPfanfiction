#+TITLE: Most of the fics I see on this sub are either already finished or abandoned. What are some new fics (published within the last year) that really stand out?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] has gained insane popularity here in recent days (and rightly so), but I'm putting it here just in case you missed it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10298447/1/An-Avalanche][An Avalanche]] is an insanely YMMV fem!Harry LotR x-over, but I thought it was cute and well written. Give it a try on a rainy day.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is]] was pretty good. Nothing mind blowing, just a solid reincarnated Harry story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is one of the strangest stories I've had the pleasure of reading. Give it a lick, you just might like the taste.

*** I just started on "Seventh Horcrux" and it's hilarious! I was having a bad day and haven't laughed in a long time, but this cheered me up :)

The rest look pretty good too. Thanks for posting these!

*** Thanks for the suggestions. I'm already caught up on Seventh Horcrux, and it's really good. "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" seems pretty interesting, I think I'll start that next.

Mileage may vary indeed. The whole first chapter is a long series of random events, conveniences, and inexplicable character interactions. Especially suddenly deciding to be friends with Malfoy for no reason.

If you're going to be that dismissive of the basis of the crossover you might as well just start /in medias res/.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][Lane_Anasazi's What You Left Behind]] started recently and looks good. Its a fairly simple AU, with Harry being born a year earlier and some other divergences leading to Sirius raising Harry and Dumbledore being fired after the War. He (she?) recently described as "Canon plus" - following the same tropes as canon, but doing them in a different way.

** For me, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10808348/1/Great-Hearts][Great Hearts]] is one of the newer fics I've read that stands out. It is complete however; but it's a well written short missing scene from PoA.

** I second Death Before Dishonour. The writing isn't perfect, but the plot is interesting.

It's been a while since I read it, but [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1561418/chapters/3311486][Hadrian Lecter: Becoming by savya398]] stood out for me, because I never read anything like it before. It's a Harry Potter/Hannibal Lecter crossover. Lecter isn't your regular psychopath though, he's a wendigo. Summary:

#+begin_quote
  Dr. Hannibal Lecter isn't what he seems. He's a monster wearing a well-tailored person suit. And when he gets his hands on young Harry Potter the wizarding world will never be the same.

Do you have any recommendations for us, bpile009?

** A Marauders Plan is really good. No bashing (though flawed characters qbound) it is H/Hr but is currently 69 chapters.
