In fanon, we always see Alice and Frank attending school with the Marauders. Alice is presented as a best friend to Lily while Frank typically shares a dorm with the Sirius, James, Peter and Remus. However, a logical argument against Alice and Frank being in their year is that they were very well-respected aurors on accounts of Dumbledore and Augusta Longbottom, as well as a very brief memory of Crouch talking about them in the pensieve.

Dumbledore later says:

#+begin_quote
  'The Longbottoms were very popular. The attacks on them came after Voldemort's fall from power...those attacks caused a wave of fury such as I have never known'.
#+end_quote

~GOF, 508

The Longbottoms were apparently beloved by the wizarding community that Dumbledore, who was very old by that time and had seen a lot of things in his lifetime, thought that the wave of fury that their attacks caused was so strong, that he had never known anything like it. That implies that they were really loved and respected within the community. Augusta Longbottom later calls them 'well-respected'.

If Alice and Frank were indeed in Lily and James's year at Hogwarts, they would graduate in late June/early July and immediately enroll into the auror training programme, which takes three years in total. If it's exactly three years and they both entered in early July, then they would both become official aurors by July of 1981. We have to take into account that Alice was pregnant with Neville and had given birth to him almost exactly a year before and would have been nine months pregnant. I can imagine Alice undergoing training early in her training but not later into it, as she would later learn of a prophecy that would force both of them into hiding. That would occur in 1980 and Alice would still have a hear of training left for her to become a full auror. Unless the Longbottoms go into hiding much later and they leave Neville in the care of someone else but still manage to become full aurors and in the short span of July and October 31st become icons so beloved and held in such a positive light by the community then I don't see how that's likely. Unless they were ridiculously talented and managed to complete training earlier/accomplish huge feats of awesome in the war.

I find these tidbits here interesting:

#+begin_quote
  'The four of you stand accused of capturing an auror - Frank Longbottom'

  'You are further accused,' bellowed Crouch of using the cruciatus curse on Frank Longbottom's wife'.
#+end_quote

This text in Goblet of Fire strongly implies that only Frank was an accomplished auror by then but Alice wasn't or was undergoing training until she was pregnant with Neville and had to quit early on. Alice wasn't even mentioned by name here, only as Longbottom's wife. Maybe Alice was younger than Frank and he was an auror before she had graduated, and was held in high respect by then while she was on the path of following him until she had fallen pregnant with Neville. Augusta says however that they were both well-respected aurors. It might have just been Augusta trying to instill some awe in Neville's friends so she also considered Alice in her statement. However, the well-respected part seems very true.

#+begin_quote
  'They were Aurors, you know, and very well respected within the wizarding community. Highly gifted, the pair of them'.
#+end_quote

Up until then, I'd believe that Alice and Frank were way older than the Marauders and only knew them through the Order of the Phoenix. McGonagall tells Neville that she recalls that Augusta had failed her charms OWL. What if, with that tidbit of information, we assume that Augusta was the same age as McGonagall (without counting Fantastic Beasts as canon).

#+begin_quote
  ' Take Charms and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless'.
#+end_quote

I can't see how McGonagall, who seemed to have started working at Hogwarts when she was around 21, would know that about Augusta unless she attended school with her. I also think it was impossible that she taught her. Assuming that she was indeed around her age, Augusta would be born in 1935/1936. By 1960 (the year the Marauders were born), she would be around 24/25 and it's very possible she would have Frank by then. But if we subscribe to the theory that Frank was older than Alice, she might have had him at bare minimum when she was 17/18 when she was still in school. By 1960, Augusta would be around 35/36 and it's very possible that she had had Frank by then, in the time period where she was 17/18 to 24/25. That is all of we do take the fact that McGonagall was born in 1935 as canon.

In conclusion, I see that if Frank and Alice were indeed in the Marauders' year at school, it could work out. They might have 'thrice defied' Voldemort in an epic feat in front of the public while still undergoing training and it would have held them in a high respectable position by then, even if Alice and Frank later go into hiding and they barely continue their full training. After all they're supposed to be incredibly talented wizards if we trust Augusta. Or Frank is older than Alice and he was an accomplished auror and they still managed to defy Voldemort three times in an epic feat while Alice went into hiding with Frank before she can accomplish her training, which would explain how Crouch didn't name her as an auror before the public.

Personally, I like to believe that while Frank was older than Alice, she was still as old as Lily and the Marauders but just astoundingly talented that she managed to win the community's affection during the war while only undergoing training. Depending on how they thrice defied Voldemort obviously but it could just be arresting a very notorious figure on Voldemort's side or just dueling him or thwarting him in public. But I adore the thought of Alice being this magical prodigy that was the top of her year and a huge threat to the Death Eaters while only undergoing training. Overall, I think it's possible that they weren't much older than the Marauders and Alice being their age explains why Crouch doesn't mention Alice as an auror.

Another explanation is that while Alice had Neville she decides to not continue her training while Frank finishes his training and works as an auror until the prophecy is announced. But it Harry/Neville would be conceived around Halloween of 1979 and born in July 1980, which would give him a bit of time to become a respected auror before he went into hiding. I personally prefer the version where Frank is older and Alice is in the same year as the Marauders.

Of course, this all depends if we rely on Augusta being around McGonagall's age, whether older or younger but I think it could work. McGonagall could've after all known about Augusta and her charms OWL while she worked briefly with her in the Ministry as a colleague. Or if we take into account McGonagall joining the transfiguration department and Augusta being another, albeit older, professor of transfiguration with her (since she really wanted Neville to take Transfiguration), it could be some sort of a circulating joke between the teachers about Augusta always advising students to drop charms as a subject. However, this is stretching things far I think.

I'm not claiming that this is in anyway plausible or anything more than mere wishful thinking but I think it's fun to think about it, especially if Augusta is the same age as McGonagall.

What do you think? Can Frank and Alice be in the Marauders year at Hogwarts? Or do you prefer to think of them as way older than fanon lets on?

** I don't have a problem with Alice being in the same year as the Marauders and Lily. Alice is pretty much a blank state and Lily is a barely fleshed out character. We can make them friends without contradicting anything.

However, trying to insert Frank into the same dorm as the Marauders looks really bad.

James made friends with an abused kid from a Dark family, a werewolf terrified of being found out, and the (probably) shy Peter. Why would he exclude Frank?

The Marauders had many secrets which would be revealed if anyone looked too closely i.e. lived in the same dorm for seven years. They had a guy with a /furry little problem/, became animagi, disappeared after curfew every full moon, made a real-time map of Hogwarts, played a lot of pranks, etc.

If Frank had been a Percy-like character who hated pranks, he would have reported to McGonagall at least about the animagi and full moon expeditions. If he wasn't, he would have been part of the group. Since neither happened, we have to assume he was in a different year than the Marauders, most probably older by a few years.

I remember a fic that had more number of students in Hogwarts in the Marauder era compared to Harry's generation. So Frank was in the same year and a Gryffindor but lived another dorm room with four boys. This is plausible since Harry's year was probably very small and the most affected by war and we rarely see how rooms are distributed in other years.

Alice could be in any house. I guess it's easier to use known names as Lily's friends rather than complete OCs. Thus we have a lot of fics with Alice </random surname/>, Marlene McKinnon, Mary McDonald and Dorcas Meadowes being in the same dorm as Lily Evans.

***** I mean, the first order of known members probably was mostly gryffindors. It's not a random sample, it's all people that Dumbledlre recruited and he likely would have recruited from his house. If you're gonna make a mini army youd probably want people known for being brave.

We know all the marauders were gryffindor, dumbledore was gryffindor, lily was in gryffindor and Hagrid. I guess we could kinda count snape as the 1st order and thus theres 1 for slytherin.

Frank and moody are very likely gryffindors. I'd also put my money on the prewett brothers being in gryffindor because houses do tend to follow familial lines and we know molly was in gryffindor.

I think edgar bones would be hufflepuff though since Susan bones was a hufflepuff. Daedalus diggle seems potentially hufflepuff too based on his dumbassery

The rest are probably a mix of ravenclaw and hufflepuff and could really go either way

James learned about the order through his parents, and he invited his closest friends along.

It could also be why dumbledore had James become headboy and lilly become headgirl to have two strong supporters in a leadership role

One recurring problem with Rowling's worldbuilding is that she says the structure of the society she writes is very similar to modern British society with its associated scale, but everything else she writes only makes sense if magical Britain is a village of maybe two hundred people. So everyone knows everyone, people in their early twenties can be "renowned", and being the best at Quidditch in your high school means you can certainly go pro and even play for the national team.

***** A couple things to keep in mind:

The war was in full swing around the year time-fram that Harry and his classmates were conceived. Just look at how many kids lost their parents or their aunts or uncles in the war, and apply that to the rest of the wizarding community, and keep in mind that these are the kids that survived, and had parents who wanted children despite all the risks and danger and fear.

With all that in mind, it's easy to see how Harry's class would be much smaller than the norm for Hogwarts.

Also keep in mind, that JK Rowling /really/ did not want to overload herself by including dozens of names that she's never keep track of. She basically limited herself to naming 5 or so boys, and five or so girls for each house for Harry's year, simply to make it easier on herself. That doesn't mean there weren't more kids in his year, it just means Rowling didn't want to mention them all.

In fact, even in Gryffindor, there are various "official" sources that put extra girls in Harry's year that are never mentioned in the book by name, in particular Day Dunbar, and a girl who was never given a name by any source.

You might think that's a stretch, but what about the names of characters from Harry's Sorting, that never get mentioned again? Or how he skipped over a bunch of names in his narration until he got his name called?

Hell, even Daphne Greengrass, one of the most popular Slytherin characters in fanfiction, has less information about her than Fay. The only information we get about Daphne is that her family is one of the Sacred Twenty Eight, that she was the sister of Draco Malfoy's eventual wife, Astoria, and that both Astoria and Daphne were both raised with the ideals of pure-blood supremacy, and that's all just from Pottermore and Cursed Child, where Daphne is still just their because of her association with Astoria.

The point is, that JK Rowling ran a very tight ship, and she only included characters that were tangentially related to the plot or generally setting.

Hell, Blaise Zabini was only mentioned initially because he was the character who got sorted last, and it was only years later that we got anything relevant about his character.

I'm pretty convinced that part of the reason why Harry almost always missed the Sorting was because Rowling couldn't bear coming up with a bunch of new names.

I'm also convinced that if we /did/ see those Sortings, especially from years 3-6, we'd see a lot of kids named Harry, Lily, and James, but we see none of that, instead most kids below Harry's age are unnamed.

Again, because none of them were even tangentially plot relevant in any way.

** I'm super into digging this deep into the books, but in this case, I think JK just decided to change it between GOF and OOTP. The context in which we learn about Frank and Alice in GOF is the formal charges against their attackers. Given that context, I can't believe that Barty Crouch Sr would get it wrong. At the time she wrote GOF, I think that only Frank was an auror.

At the same time, in OOTP, Augusta states that they were both well-respected aurors. It's /possible/ that she is fudging the truth a bit to boost Neville's pride in his parents, but it's more likely that for the story JK wanted to tell, she decided that they were both aurors. It's entirely plausible that she didn't realize she was contradicting herself, or she might've decided that, like Charlie Weasley, Marcus Flint, and Lucius Malfoy, the story is more important than the fine details.

Basically /all/ of the ages in the series are deeply screwed up. In Deathly Hallows, Lucius is a prefect when Snape is sorted, but in Chamber, he's stated as being 43, which is about 7 years too old for him to have still been at Hogwarts when the marauders' generation began. The advantage is that it leaves a lot of room for interpretation in fanon, at the cost of a fair amount of vagary in canon.

I've always pictured the Longbottoms around Arthur and Molly's age.

*** To be entirely honest, aside from the main plot there's very few stuff I consider canon in Chamber of Secret and Philosopher's Stone to be in line with the original series. There's so much later contradictions with the books it's baffling. For example, you posted Lucius's age and OP said something along the lines of Alice originally not being an auror but later being named as such.

There's also stuff such as lily and James being head boy and head girl but when they're discussing prefects/heads Sirius and Remus bring nothing of the sort. Unless Hagrid was misremembering in the first book. There's also the Quidditch calender apparently, which is in line in all the other books except First Year. Then there's this entire confusing time when Lily and James died and Harry is dropped off at the Dursleys, which for lots of reasons doesn't add up in the later books if we take into account the first one and its events.

Piers Polkiss is described as small and scrawny but later described as big as Dudley. Petunia was shocked to hear about a 9¾ but she WAS there once upon a time, at least once. Why would she act shocked. Petunia knew how to get there but unless she acted like she didn't know, I don't see how she could forget. There's also the entire Charlie thing being a Quidditch legend and not having won for 7 years since he left apparently. But he must've graduated for only a year when Harry started Hogwarts so why the hell do they act like he was much, much much older.

There's also so much other stuff but I'd be writing forever if it means listing all of them.

Look at the Death Eaters: Bella was born in 1951 and Narcissa in '55. So, Narcissa was a 5th or 6th yr and we know Lucius was at least a 5th year in 1961. Andromeda was either gone or in her 7th year.

Snape is said to be friends with the Lestranges (Sirius talks about a married couple so this is def a plothole.) /But/ that's not to say the brothers weren't in their early teens in 61 because someone had to befriend young Crouch. Sirius also mentions Wilkes, Avery, Evan Rosier, and Lily mentions Mulciber. Regulus was a year younger.

Lily and James were also said to be popular in their own rights. So I don't mind the friendships. Most of what I read has them all close in age, but in different houses, of course.

This did make me realize that Crouch Jr. is really underutilized in both eras.

** Not necessarily. Like others here, I assumed they are close enough in age to attend school at the same time, but not be in the same year. So Frank or Alice could have been say sixth or seventh years when the Marauders were first years.

**** Yeah, they definitely could have. My point is just that OP seems to be implying that Frank being in the same year as the marauders is the standard, but I don't think that I have ever seen it done.

** The wizarding community is relatively small, so its wouldnt be out of place for someone to say anyone who was an Auror(assuming thats more equivalent of an Inspector or Detective, than a beat cop) as a well respected member of society. As far as ages, no clue with almost no canonical hints(although I like the idea of Alice being younger than Frank just because it breaks up the dated in Hogwarts->Married pipeline thats a tad overused.)

** My headcanon has Alice and Frank be a few years older (but still around for a large part of the Marauder era) while the Marauders, Lily, Severus, Mary, Marlene, Avery, Mulciber and Evan Rosier all go in the same year.

** I like to think Frank is maybe 5 years older than the marauders and Alice is two years older and Lily befriended her because she was a prefect and Alice was head girl. I usually think of Alice as a Hufflepuff though.

** They are clearly older than the Marauders.

On another note, I really hate how Lily and the Marauders were so young. Before their ages were known, I thought Lily and James had gotten married years after they graduated from Hogwarts.

** I always figured they were older, largely because Lily and James were Head Boy and Girl, which would put Frank and Alice as less academic or less brilliant if they were in the same year, which doesn't fit with how they're otherwise described.

Also I would find it improbable for both couples to be the same age and The Order to have such a high proportion of recent school leavers as its top agents. And for Frank & Alice to be so universally well respected at the age of 21.

*** To be honest, I always thought of Alice and Frank as way older but of we assume that Augusta was the same age as Minerva, I guess it could work, although barely. I usually hate prodigy characters but I think it'd be even more tragic if they were some sort of early on Dumbledore figures. A wasted potential kind of thing where their brilliance is forever wasted because they're insane now.

I hate the Order being some kind of constant 1978 Gryffindor students reunion. I also don't see either of Marlene McKinnon or Dorcas Meadowes being as old as Lily and James. I actually made this account to talk about it, it's actually in my first post where I ranted about all of them being in lily's dorm and coincidentally all of them are also Gryffindors.

However, I do like the idea of Greta Catchlove as Lily's friend. She was born in 1960 too and we can assume that she attended Hogwarts. I think it's better than all of Dorcas, Alice, Marlene, Mary, Emmeline and Hestia all being lumped into her year. In extreme cases Molly and Tonks are jammed in too, which brings me a good laugh.

** I think it's possible that Minerva is older than Augusta, given that wizards can live to an excess of 150 years, which would allow her to be a teacher when Augusta was doing her OWLs. I don't know why you assume it would be impossible.
