Are there any stories where a calmer Sirius didn't attack Peter or at least the Aurors realized something was wrong in the aftermath of fighting Peter and Sirius didn't wind up in Azkaban? Completed/Actively updated fics only please.


** So, in linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7) Sirius breaks out early to raise Harry. Innocent is completed, as are two of the planned sequels. Active updates.

**** Yeah, I know. Not exactly what OP was looking for, but close enough and good enough that I thought it was worth a mention.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

*** Ugh, I love this story, but I can never finish reading it. I started way back in 2013 and I keep dropping it and having to reread it.

**** Yeah, it's pushing a million words at this point. It's a project. My favorite part of the fic is gryffindor!draco - its the only fic I knowfof with that trope - but it moves so slowly because of how many main characters it has.

** Hmm ... well, it does happen like that in “When in Doubt, Obliviate” (linkffn(6635363)), as Sirius doesn't attack Peter [[/spoiler][though he's not the one to raise Harry]].

So it probably isn't what you want, but on the off chance that it is I leave it there.
