** 7-part series of short, satirical takes on the books. I've never read Ayn Rand, but I still found them all quite funny.

Some quotes:

#+begin_quote
  Harry laughed, cool and remote, like if a mountain were to laugh.
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  Professor Snape stood at the front of the room, sort of Jewishly.
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Ron stood before the Mirror of Erised. “My God,” Ron said. “Harry, it's your dead parents.”

  Harry's eyes flicked momentarily over to the mirror. “So it is. This information is neither useful nor productive. Let us leave at once, to assist Hagrid in his noble enterprise of raising as many dragon eggs as he sees fit, in spite of our country's unjust dragon-trading restrictions.”

**** If only he had an overbearing mother to harp on him for not becoming a successful doctor or lawyer.

** u/andtheasswasfat:
#+begin_quote
  Hermione ached with desire for the both of them to master her, but nobody paid her any attention. They had empires to build.
#+end_quote

This sounds like a perfectly normal shitty fanfic to me.

** ... excuse me while I send this to every lolbertarian I, for reasons that escape me, still keep on my FB friends list.

Though, to be fair, this bullshit /sort of/ works in relation to magical Britain, place is a borderline authoritarian state even before the Death Eater takeover in my opinion.
