I'm looking for fics where Harry (hopefully before Hogwarts, but either way doesn't matter much) uses fictional sources to create new magic, or to learn magic himself. I can't remember the titles, but I know there's a story where he learns magic from Naruto manga, I know there's something about lightning where he creates magic in the summer between Hogwarts from... Fairy Tale? Anyway, that's the kind of thing I'm hoping to find more of!

Sorry if I chose the wrong flair, I couldn't find anything saying 'fic search' or an equivalent.

â€‹

Edit: The first story is Harry Potter's Epic Discovery by JohnDeath. The second story is Lightning Dragon's Roar by ZeroRewind.

#+begin_quote
  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

*** Weeb is on my 'to read' list, but I keep ignoring it. I think I started it while it was still being written and it didn't really grab me... then again it hadn't gotten that far in at that point - Harry was into the anime, etc. but didn't really know about magic yet I think. I'll move it up a place or three.

**** It's not a good fit for your request because Harry fails most of his attempts. He's a perverted weeb not a hero with anime powers. I read Lightning Dragon's Roar where Harry throws around cool powers and Weeb is bascially nothing like it.
