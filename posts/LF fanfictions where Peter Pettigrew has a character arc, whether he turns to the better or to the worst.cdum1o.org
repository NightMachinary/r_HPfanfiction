I just want a story where Wormtail has an actual character arc, where we see his transformation from Sirius, Remus and James's best friend to becoming a coward and someone white eventually betrays them in the war.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I adored [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][the Shoebox Project]]'s version of Peter, and while it doesn't go far into the war and his betrayal you can see how it begins to happen.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

** Just finished reading (unfortunately, WIP) linkao3(18697885), and there Severus tries very hard to make Peter resistant to temptation to betray them. Thus, Peter is a way more interesting and with more three-dimensional character.

  "After his death, Severus makes the decision to return to the world of the living, starting in the summer of 1975. With his adult knowledge on the upcoming war hidden inside his 15 year old body, he finds his way back to Lily, and his new position in the wizarding world."[Story related warnings can be seen on the first page.]

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
