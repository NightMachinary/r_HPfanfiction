Dumbledore in the story believed by keeping harry weak in all ways (mental, intellectual, magical, physical, health, etc) he could at least delay if not prevent Voldemorts return by this keeping Riddle weak as well. The Unspeakables realize what Harry's scar is and his reaction to Quirrel. They capture Quirrel with Riddle still attached and send him through the veil, then they hunt for all of his other soul anchors. Dumbledore is sent to prison. Eventually all that is left of Riddle is in Harry's scar but with care, help, proper training, etc. Harry lives a long life and ultimately when he dies, the last of Riddle dies as well.

  If there are intent-based protective wards such as Albus erected around the Dursleys, how would Hogwarts be if it had some?

  Harry's treatment at the Dursleys didn't make him -- it broke him. At Hogwarts, broken children make their way to the home of the badgers. No one protects like a badger. The outcome? Heads fly. This is the trial of Albus Dumbledore. Rating due to child abuse mentions. Format is weird.

*** I mean it may not be as exciting as Harry doing everything, but the story sounds like what might happen if all the professionals were competent.

Other than the Dumbledore thing. That's just AU.

  It does, however, sound like a deliberate attempt to write a straightforward and contrived happy ending
#+end_quote

Quite possibly.

#+begin_quote
  Where is the conflict?
#+end_quote

It's entirely possible for this fic to have conflict. Who knows what might happen while hunting down the horcruxes. Seems very possible that Lucius hears about it, then the good guys have to compete with the Death Eaters.

Maybe Dumbledore doesn't go down quietly.

I will agree, though, that from the sound of the fic I doubt there is much conflict.

#+begin_quote
  Is this how Harry gets his happy childhood? If you're gonna go there, what's the point of 11 years of Dursley suffering first? Just go there directly.
#+end_quote

Some people like the Hurt/Comfort thing. I can enjoy reading it sometimes.
