(Idk if that's the right tag?) But people get betas to read over what you write, right?

I don't have a beta (but I can write consistently. I've got about 20 started things, all with at least 100 words, some with 3000, none of which are finished - most are one shots, some are chapters) and I haven't ever thought about looking for one (mainly because I feel they would get bored waiting for me to finish something because I started something about 2 months ago, haven't actually finished it yet)

But I mean, would it be worth it? Personally if I ever do finish something (it's happened ONCE ever) I read through it all about 5 times, adding bits here and there which totals up for about 500 more words extra by the time I stop reading through and editing and am ready to post it.

But if I had a beta that would like, bug me to write, do you think that would work? Wouldn't know where to find one tho 😂


** It sounds to me like you don't need a beta - you need somebody to show you where the Save and Delete buttons are.

A story's beta isn't a co-writer. He or she is an adviser, a checker, a sounding board, an info dump, and whatever else the writer - the alpha - needs.

A beta doesn't always tell the alpha to write, either. Sometimes the beta has to tell the alpha to go and do something else because their head isn't in the game.

And sometimes a good beta will tell their alpha that what they just did isn't good enough. I did that at the end of last year and there are comments from other authors that say they've had betas do the same, so I know it's not just me.

I suppose I'm saying that if you're looking for simple encouragement then ask your mum and dad. If you want real help then you have to post some stuff, learn from the criticism and find someone willing to help you along.

This isn't supposed to be discouraging. Posting your writing on the Internet is an incredibly brave thing to do. But you need to trust yourself. 100 words isn't the start of a story, it's a post here - this post is 247 words alone. 3000 words is a one-shot. That can be great to start with but if you want to write you need to take it further.

Best of luck in whatever you decide to do.

**** If you want to DM me a link or some text then go for it. This probably isn't the start of a beautiful friendship though.
