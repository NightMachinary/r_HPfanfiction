** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby][Itachi, is that a baby?]] linkffn(11634921)

A pure crack fic where Itachi from Naruto adopts Harry Potter. Dumbledore gives more of a fuck during the even crackier omakes than in the actual fic.

**** The governors apparently would bitch about it, and it's not if he cares if they get pregnant as teens.. as long as it happens during the Summer, not on his watch, not his problem.

Seriously, not word for word obviously but that's what he says.

Though considering how few new witches and wizards there are attending hogwarts, especially after the last two wars you'd think everyone would be gungho about more births.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** Linkffn(9818387). The amplitude, frequency and resistance of the soulbond. It's not a typical soulbond fic, H/G, but one of my favorite dumbledores. One of my complaints about fic dumbledores is that they're often very serious, and there's not enough of the 'alas! Earwax!' part.

This Dumbledore is about 92% 'alas! Earwax".

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.
