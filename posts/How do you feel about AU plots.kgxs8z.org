I'm planning a massive AU. Because of a few changes in the past, the entire series deviates wildly. First, second, and third year will have vaguely similar plots, but after that? Almost everything changes.

Some changes are:

- The prophecy has a few word changes that gives it a whole different meaning.
- AU!Harry is a girl.
- She isn't interested in the Philosopher's Stone because she doesn't go to Diagon Alley with Hagrid.
- The Triwizard Tournament it exactly that: a /tri/wizard tournament.
- Umbridge? Still a horrid woman, but she's not at Hogwarts because of Voldemort-related rumors.

The plot I'm planning will be focused on some of the AU lore, and on character growth. AU!Harry will never be a normal girl, but she won't be raised like a pig for slaughter or fighting big-bads in her fourth year (not too many big-bads at least).

So, what are your opinions of AU plots?


** I mean if you want to write *massively AU* fics, you may want to get rid of MOST canon stations, including the PS shenanigan.

Here are some examples that I consider *massively AU*:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]: James and Potter got Voldemort that night with a nasty trap. They burnt down their own house, faked their deaths, and fled Britain altogether. As a result, Harry was raised by his loving parents and never went to Hogwarts. But that doesn't mean he turns out to be a nice guy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]]: Lucius Malfoy won through a daring maneuver after Halloween 1981, and Dumbledore had to flee for France with his remaining followers. Harry was raised by Sirius there and went to Beauxbaton with the Weasleys. But they would have their revenge 18 years later.

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/1087368][There is Nothing to Fear series]] features a Gryffindor Tom Riddle. Needless to say, things are SIGNIFICANTLY different in this universe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]]: Harry is blind and can't go to Hogwarts. He's soon joined by a badly crippled Hermione in his special education school. PS and CoS events do still happen in this fic, but nothing after Year 3 is the same. Similarly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]] still let PS and CoS happen with significant changes. But it's Petunia, Sirius, Bill, and Fleur who did the heavy lifting against Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]] features a better Gilderoy Lockhart who gets to raise Harry. PS and CoS happened with significant alterations, and the plot is mostly resolved by then.

*** I'd probably throw in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series as well, because the lack of a war has changed the whole political landscape. Even though there are some plot elements that are recognisably inspired by canon, they're just that: a recognisable canon element incorporated into a world that is very different at its core. Tom Riddle is alive and well and has quite different (albeit still villainous) goals, but no Horcruxes. Harry was raised by her parents; all the Marauders are alive, and both James Potter and Sirius Black are (necessarily) active in politics. There's quite a bit of exploration of class consciousness and the treatment of the slums. It's really a whole new story.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** Character is key when it comes to AU

The amount of times I've come across fics where the summary is 'what if Harry did x at y canon moment' only to find Harry got replaced by edgy OC #24940213 is disheartening

** At this point in time, AUs are some of the most interesting things in this fandom. The more you deviate, the better! I can only encourage you!

And Girl!Harry are becoming a soft spot of mine, so I'm even more curious about the outcome.

** That sounds really interesting I'd love to read it when it's up. I think AUs can be good or bad depending on what the specific AU is but yours sounds good. I like writing AUs they're fun I'm currently planning one for next gen era which barely has anything in common with cursed child.
