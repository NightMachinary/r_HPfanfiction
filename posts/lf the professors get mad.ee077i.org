Its sort of become an unwritten rule that harry and co never get punished for their larger adventures like the chamber or the stone

but i was wondering if there are any fics where the adults get pissed and take points and give punishments because harry distracting quirrel from the mirror stopped whatever trap was going to be sprung to trap toms spirit or why they didn't think to go to a different teacher after finding the chamber or at least have found a way to get roosters for the basilisk

"Dumbledore hired him. Dumbledore gave him his stamp of approval. I went for help from Dumbledor's man. Don't get salty at me because he turned out to have deceived 'the greatest wizard of our time.'"

"Why do I get points taken away but you don't go to jail for endangering every student in this castle by inviting the most terrible Dark Lord in Britain's history into the school?"

*** My headcannon is that the traps were only meant to slow Voldemort down, giving Dumbledore enough time to get into position to capture Voldemort after he was ensnared/distracted by the Mirror of Erised.

The Mirror really is insidious, imo the darkest object outside of the horcruxes.

**** Maybe, to me it's just more proof Rowling's had no plan past getting that first book out and then was desperately making stuff up after that.

Proof, Riddle knows about a 1,000 year old Basilisk he can control, that's already in the castle. That thing would tear through those traps in seconds.

Scary mirror he can't figure out. That's okay, he can drag it down to the chamber of secrets and figure it out there at his leisure.

So many plot holes she introduced in just that one book. See Dumbledore flying to the ministry makes perfect sense if the first book is the only book.

We don't have anything else to magically move with yet. Even Harry's accidental teleportation/appriation is strictly line of sight.

Later books introduce non-line of sight teleportation, Portkeys, Floo network and even Phoenix Fire travel.

My headcanon is the first year should be used as a really rough draft at best for most things. Iirc the Slytherin dorms in the dungeons was introduced second year, making sending student away from them into their dorm towers far more reasonable.

***** We don't know if Dumbledore flew all the way to the Ministry. All McGonagall says is that he flew off. She might've meant this metaphorically, or he might've just flown to the edge of the Hogwarts anti-Apparition enchantments.

Though I do agree that we shouldn't take the first book too seriously.

  flew off for London at once.‚Äù

Just pretend that she meant, "floo off for London" and an over-eager editor "corrected" it.

** This sounds like something fanau Malfoy would say.

"Look at Potter saving the school, fighting a thousand year old Basilisk, destroying parts of Salazar Slytherins secret chamber, destroying private property (the diary) and improper use of school relics. When's he going off to Azkaban you think?"

If your plan to stop a decades old dark Lord is easily foiled by a group of three preteens you deserve to lose talking privileges, like forever.
