I am looking for a /good/ Story where Harry has the unusual talent of casting Magic by playing music or singing. I don't particularly care what instrument or if he does it by being a good singer.

I remember reading a short fanfiction that took that direction where McGonagall was a sort of mentor to him, but I would like a longer story.

** Not sure if this is exactly what you're going for, but Harry does use music to do magic.

*** Thank you for the suggestion. I will definitely check it out.

Edit: Keep the recommendations coming. I honestly can't believe it's so hard to find stories with that theme. It feels strange to me that a fandom as large as Harry Potter has not jumped on that idea more.

  ‚ÄúJust... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.‚ÄùWhat was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** Hmm I remember reading a fic that had a short scene that involved music and magic...I forget the fic but the character is doing a herbology exam and the plant will only grow if you sing, so they sing bohemian rhapsody.
