:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey there.

I've been searching for a crack one-shot fic set during the third task of the triwizard tournament. It's from the point of view of the public and the judges put a listening charm on each champions. They hear Harry cruse, sing, talk to himself and laught it up until he end up in the graveyard. The charm still works, giving them a front row seat on everything that's happening there until his return.

Anyone got any idea what it is?

  Some may consider him useless, but Ludo Bagman has been absolutely inspired by muggle sports channels. As a result, a camera charm has been created. It is ready to catch all the action of the Triwizard Tournament and broadcast it into every home over Wizarding Europe. Now Harriet is on the big screen, and the crowd is going to see a lot more than they bargained for. FEM/Harry.

*** The one I'm looking for is not a fem!Harry and is definitely a one-shot.

I'll still give this one a try so thanks.

**** Yeah, but there is nothing lemony about it, she is just not he, there is not much more in it than that. I am not sure why the author actually bothered to make her a girl; probably the author was a lady as well, and she felt more comfortable writing a female character.
