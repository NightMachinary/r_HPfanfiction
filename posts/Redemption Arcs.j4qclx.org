We all love our redemption arcs. Heck, there's even an entire trope about draco's redemption arc/bad boy status ( Draco in leather pants).

What are your favorite and least favorite Redemption arcs in fanfiction? What is the most unlikely redemption arc for an HP character you've ever seen? What's the cringiest? Who would you like to see in a Redemption Arc that you haven't seen before?

I'm currently writing a (semi)redemption arc for my Slytherin best girl, Pansy Parkinson. It's hard to avoid the sudden â€˜heel to face turn' pitfalls without explaining why a bad character has changed their mind and is acting differently. My best and most obvious reason is self-preservation - She's still a sneering, smirking aristocratic snob, but after some eye-opening conversations with Gryffindors at the beginning of 6th year, she comes to realize that service to The Dark Lord probably isn't all that it's cracked up to be.

Speaking of which, what common pitfalls do you see in Redemption arcs, and does anyone have any advice to avoid them or make the Redemption arc seem more realistic?


** For writing a convincing redemption arc I'd say the hardest part is often the source material. You need a character with three dimensional motivation before you can start redeeming them in a convincing way. Despite being a villain Draco gets fleshed out enough in the later books to provide enough varied material to begin a redemption arc.

By comparison someone like Pansy is left a little two dimensional in canon. She's a mean girl but not much beyond that. To redeem her you need to first build up her character enough so that there is something to redeem. Give her a life beyond being a bully to Hermione, expand on why she's Draco's sort of girlfriend and what it means, tell us what she sees herself doing in 5 years. Once she has motivations beyond that of a cardboard villain you can start throwing obstacles in her path, things that make her question her choices and her beliefs.

** My main requirement, and favorite part, of redemption arcs is that the character needs to face a hard decision with lots at stake (a decision that we as readers can understand why it would be hard). I don't think it's enough for the character to just suddenly be open minded and learn to be better, I want them to make the "right" choice and then face the consequences.

I think that's why so many Draco fics start his redemption arc at the end of HBP. In canon we see a tiny glimpse of him making the right choice by lowering his wand to Dumbledore, but then chaos ensues and that arc isn't ever really fully completed in a satisfying way (in my opinion).

** The most convincing and enjoyable one I've read so far, which also stylistically writes in a similar manner to JKR's canon, is linkao3(23296162) The Disappearances of Draco Malfoy. Malfoy takes the offer by Dumbledore to lower his wand at the top of the astronomy tower, and this fic is the subsequent effects of that. One of the reasons why I have been enjoying this fic, still a WIP but not abandoned, is because of how it's a genuine, and long, redemption arc.

Firstly, many redemption arcs don't adequately address the multifaceted problems of a characters previous position. They often make the character have a convenient lightbulb moment and suddenly they are on the right path. This Malfoy fic shows how many different aspects and assumptions of his life have been affected by his previous ideas. Even when he wants to be better, his old ideas rear their heads. He feels harried and attacked even though he's trying to change. He's in denial about how bad his parents are, and then shame and guilt when he starts to confront it. The shame he exhibits is defensive and guilty all at once.

There's many aspects of a redemption arc that's hard because the character has to deconstruct so much of themselves, and the void it leaves is upsetting.

The fic also shows the complex problems with the people around the character trying to redeem themselves. So Malfoy's parents love him adoringly but are reprehensible to muggles, muggleborns and others. He loves them, but they would slit the throats of his new companions (the golden trio) if it convenienced them and he feels strong panic over that. Many in the Order don't trust him and deflect his ideas when they're brainstorming, so he has to give them to others and let them get the good credit. People needle him for his old views, especially when they're stressed, and he resents it. But he grows, and it's convincing, and that makes it a good fic. Redemption arcs need to take into account the realistic response from the people around the character in question.

I'd love to see more redemption arcs that are convincing, and also weirdly a few un-redemption arcs? I think, controversially, that if Dumbledore and Snape both survived, they would have both had really uncomfortable conversations with other people, and would have had to both front up to the bad and cruel things they did, as well as get the good credit. It's almost convenient that they died and got given reverence and redemption in death. War heros are best dead for a reason; when they're alive, the Grey of their actions is a lot more prickly, and they both would have had to speak to a lot of of their actions. But there could be redemption arcs found there too.
