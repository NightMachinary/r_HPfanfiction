As my long fucking title says, I'm looking for fics that actually cover any of the things fandom fights about. I don't care what position they take, I just wanna read something where Harry (or other characters, if appropriate) actually has/have those doubts about things and those doubts feature in the plot. Are there in-depth discussions with Harry and Hermione about whether or not Dumbledore really was raising Harry like a Sacrifice or just doing his best with what he had? Or is there a scene with Harry actually debating Snape and the Marauders about who was the worst fuck-up? Does the Order discuss whether Molly was being helpful to Sirius in book 5 or an utter bitch? I think it could be interesting to read about the characters debating and dealing with the alternate interpretations of these things like the Fandom does - complexity of plot arising from simplicity of interpretation, y'know?

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** Dumbledore is obviously manipulative, the question is if it's to good ends or not.

Ginny being oedipal is a fun joke but it's weird if people take it seriously. I doubt very many people with spouses with the same color hair as their moms consider this a problem

*** And now I have this weird idea of Harry and Ginny who think they are happily married to each other but are actually both a bit deluded: Ginny not really seeing Harry for who he really is; never getting past liking him for being the boy who lived & Harry who also never really saw Ginny for who she is; his subconscious just leading him to her because of the red hair and because he was looking for a mother that he kinda found it in Molly Weasley. ðŸ˜‚

** I'd like to see a 5th year AU where it starts off like one of those manipulative Dumbledore, manipulative Weasleys fics, but the twist is that Voldemort is using his connection to Harry to mess with his head and make him think he can't trust anybody- kinda like Inception or Total Recall.

** To actually answer your question:

The first ~1/3 of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]] has Hermione calling out a lot of things like wtf Dumbledore, wtf Draco, and the rarer but still important wtf McGonagall.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2841153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Sword of Gryffindor]] has too much smut to easily skip but it's generally very silly smut so depending on your reasons for avoiding it you might be fine. Think more Howard Stern than Pornhub. It has lots of little author rants peppered throughout about things that people are still fighting over.

I'm very asexual and smut is about as interesting to me as football - for context, I fell asleep at the last big stadium match I attended (Liverpool vs Manchester United, at the United Football Ground). That's why I mentioned plot and character development - if there's something to the smut beyond just people sticking various things and parts into each other, then I might find it somewhat entertaining or at least be able to slog my way through for the plot or character stuff. Otherwise, not my thing.

  calling out a lot of things
#+end_quote

It's not so much calling out things that I'm looking for as it is 'debating' them. If she calls them out and gets an actual answer in response that seemingly justifies whatever she's calling them out for and everyone thinks they have good reasons for their viewpoint and it becomes an actual conversation. I'm looking for something more than just:

Hermione - "You're a dick, Dumbledore."

Dumbledore - "Yes I am, mwha ha haaaa!"

Think of it like the fights people have in this subreddit over which idiot was at fault in the Remus debacle.

"Sirius is fine! He didn't do anything wrong!"

"No, Snape is fine! Sirius tried to kill him!"

"James is still evil! He just went for Remus' sake!"

etc. Imagine if the actual in-world characters had those kinds of arguments.

I also don't know who Howard Stern is. Googled him and he's apparently an American Radio Personality, but I don't understand the reference.

**** I'll keep an eye out for debate fics. SoG does start with "Ron sucks" but quickly moves to "Ron rules!" but it's more of a thing that happens than a thing that gets discussed.

I think there's enough stuff happening during the smutty bits that you won't be too bored. If it were a moral thing I'd say skip it.

***** Cool. Thank you kindly. I never thought there'd be many - we argue too much in forums for those feelings to be getting out in stories - but I'm hoping for at least one or two. :)

And also cool. Good to know. Yeah, definitely not a moral thing, just a boredom one. Not something I'm really qualified to issue moral judgements over anyway. :D
