I know most of you love her but I enjoy bashing fics even when i like the characters


** Well, I dotn really read fics that bash Hermione but here's one, linkffn( Let's Try Again) Edit: that's the wrong one, this should be it: linkffn(Let's Try Again), I think it was the space after the first bracket that messed it up

  Harry Potter is done with life. He did everything and all he wanted was to pass on to the next great adventure. Sadly, rules get in the way of this and he must now find a new way to keep living. It's not all bad though. At least he gets another chance to live life his way and on his terms. Warning: Mentions of attempted suicide and other stuff to come.
