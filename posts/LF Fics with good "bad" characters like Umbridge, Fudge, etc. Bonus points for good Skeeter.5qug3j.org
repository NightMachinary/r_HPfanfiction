I realized I've seen a few good Umbridge, like two good Fudge, all the good!Voldemort ever, but no good Rita Skeeter fics. Good here obviously meaning not-evil rather than well-written.

Crossovers, slash, bashing and dark!harry fine. No mpreg, romance/smut-driven plot, pottercest, genderbending or harems. Thank you!

  Harry arrives late to the Weighing of the Wands, and experiences a very different, and much more intimate 'interview' with Rita Skeeter. Harry/Rita Smut

** In the they shook hand series where harry is a Slytherin and friends with Malfoy, he gets to know skeeter through Lucius and she gets fond of him. She isn't really good but she definitely helps in the fight against voldemort by publishing articles and always publishes stories that make harry look good. the series also makes other characters like umbridge, fudge, percy, lucious look good through harrys eyes but the are not truly good

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

Umbridge rescues Harry from the Dursleys. She's still ghastly but she's raising Harry to be manipulative.
