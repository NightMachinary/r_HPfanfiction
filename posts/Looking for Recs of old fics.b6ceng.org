Okay this might be an odd request but I am hankering for some old fanfic (and likely showing my age) but I am looking for recs for fanfic that was written after OOtP and before HBP (although it may not have been finished before then). Preferably Gen or Het with H/G and r/H though implied Remus/Sirius doesn't bother me. Complete preferred, but not required. Thanks!


** How about pre-OotP, post-GoF? Linkffn (The Phoenix and the Serpent) is an excellent AU, in no small part because it was written prior to so much of canon being revealed. It features:

- Moody being an actual badass and not just a paranoid old dude
- Sirius, Remus, and the rest of the order actually fighting a war
- My favorite "power he knows not" of any fic, by far.
- Tactical dueling with great combat scenes
- A nice, different interpretation of Flamel
- An awesome way to approach a H/G-esque relationship, especially considering that it's a B-plot

Can't recommend it enough, really
