Prompted by opinions learned while reading through the threads about perceived muggle "wank" and wizarding downplay, I'd like to attempt a discussion thread.

How would a full blown war between both sides go?

For simplicity's sake, assume an affronted English squib reveals the existence of the magical community and muggle society as a whole is rightfully(?) enranged by the secrecy and memory violations of the wizards. A war ensues.


** *1. Most likely outcome: immediate return to status quo*

In the first instance, I see any such war failing to get off the ground.

We see in HBP that wizards rearrange a phone call between two Muggle world leaders without any problem, and without their consent. We also see that the Ministry inserted Kingsley into the Prime Minister's office for months without anyone noticing. Wizards have control over Muggle government.

So it appears that in most important respects, there was already a war and the wizards won. It was just so one-sided that the Muggles didn't even know it was happening.

Really, given wizards' control of Muggle government, in a non-ideal wizards vs Muggles discussion (i.e. a discussion which is about the actual societies in question, rather than an abstract technology vs. magic question) you should be assuming that the Muggle government will be on the wizards' side.

So it's less Muggles vs. wizards and more a subset of the Muggle population vs the Muggle government with wizarding support.

The squib who raises the alarm is likely to be deliberately ignored and/or silenced by the Muggle government.

*2. Second most likely outcome: delayed return to status quo*

In the event of a breach of the statute of secrecy beyond the ability of the Muggle government to control, I would still expect a lid to be put on things quickly.

The world's governments, within wizarding control (and in any event having an interest in preventing mass unrest) are going to announce that the "reveal" was a hoax. Wizards will move quickly to take control of Muggle media (assuming they don't already control it) and have the media do the same. Probably similar with influential individuals such as prominent scientists, politicians, celebrities, etc.

This is going to be helped along by the fact that in the HP universe, Muggles have a documented psychological response of magic of denial, even to the point of refusing to see what is in front of them.

The status quo will not be perfectly restored, however, as there would be a section of Muggles (viewed by other Muggles as nutty conspiracy theorists) who still believe. But these can be picked off over time with memory charms etc.

*3. Accepting the hypothetical*

But let's assume for the sake of debate that somehow a war between wizards and Muggles does get off the ground. Essentially you are now asking the question of technology vs. magic, because you're waving away all of the actual societal circumstances of the two sides and creating a hypothetical war between all Muggles and all wizards.

My own view is that wizards have a significant advantage. Their locations are not only unknown but cannot be found. If by some miracle they were found, they are in any event inaccessible to their enemy.

On top of that, wizards have a plethora of stealth and mind control abilities which would render any organised Muggle resistance with a hierarchical management structure impossible to sustain. Wizards would just repeatedly take control of the people at the top of those structures. On the basis of concealment, stealth and mind control abilities alone, a single competent wizard probably has the ability to take control of the Muggle world (just think of what you could use those abilities for IRL) never mind a whole society of them.

If by some incredibly unlikely chain of events you ever had the situation where a wizard and Muggle were in the same vicinity and aware of each other, then I have three observations:

A. If it's the beginning of the war, the wizard is not particularly skilled and is ignorant of Muggle capabilities, the Muggle is likely to win.

B. If it is no longer the beginning of the war, the wizard is likely to have protections in place (e.g. protective amulets, clothing) prior to entering a Muggle area, rendering the Muggle's arsenal ineffective.

C. Even if the wizard does not have protections in place, if they are a skilled wizard (e.g. Aurors and above) then likely their ability to cast magic on the fly is sufficient to counter anything the Muggles can throw at them.

This is where the debate starts to create a lot of tangents, because the answer essentially boils down to your answer to various questions regarding the nature of magic.

- Can satellites piece concealment spells?

- Can any Muggle weapon overcome a (correctly cast) magical shield?

- Can bullets get past an impervius charm?

- Does the flame freezing charm have a temperature limit?

My answer to all these questions is "no".

This comes down to two points: firstly, the relationship of magic to physical forces (i.e. the strength of magic); secondly, the means by which magic takes effect (i.e. the intelligence and flexibility of magic).

*3A. Strength of Magic*

There are essentially [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/the-three-depictions-of-magic.38783/][three ways]] of viewing magic. Of these, the first and the third are the main ways people view HP magic:

#+begin_quote
  /A. The Unified Natural Universe (Science magic)/

  In this view, magic is a part of the natural universe, a phenomenon like gravity, electromagnetism, etc. It is a form of energy. It may be an unknown aspect of physics, but fundamentally magic is a part of the same system and is subject to laws which do not contradict current understanding of how the universe works (such as the laws of thermodynamics).

  /B. The Dualist Universe (Cheat code magic)/

  In this view, the universe operates on two parallel systems. There is the natural system (the universe as described by physics), and the supernatural system. The natural system is the "default" system on which the universe operates. However, in certain circumstances, the supernatural system can be engaged, which overrules the natural system and suspends its rules in favour of those of the supernatural, for a limited time and space.
#+end_quote

Now, I think trying to argue which of these holds in the HP universe is an interesting but unhelpful tangent to the discussion at hand. It is far easier to point out that, even though magic is stronger in B than in A, /in either case magic is still incredibly strong./

In the case of A, where magic is energy, from what we see wizards do in canon it must be that they have access to an astounding quantity of it. We have seen wizards create kilograms of matter with transfiguration. That matter is permanent, real physical stuff, not an illusion ([[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/posts/1086681/][link for that tangent]]). The ability to create kilograms of matter - without being tired at all from doing so - indicates that (if magic is energy) wizards have access to quantities far exceeding the largest nuclear bomb ever detonated.

In the case of B (which I consider much more likely), magic overrides physical law. There is no physical force which can overcome or limit magic; rather, the limits of magic are determined purely by reference to magical theory/law such as Gamp's law.

In either case, wizards' magic is more than strong enough to counteract the effects of any Muggle weapon you can think of.

*3B. Intelligence of Magic*

This is essentially the question of whether that strength can be directed in the appropriate ways to counteract Muggle weapons/surveillance. It doesn't matter if wizards have the strength to oppose Muggle weapons if they don't have the means.

There are two general points to be made about the way we see magic work.

The first is that spells are flexible. We see that the Shield Charm has been used:

Against magic and physical things. To block, defect and reflect. Static or in motion. Temporary or permanent. As a two-directional wall or as an omni-directional protection.

So, as a general rule, I don't think it is appropriate to look at a spell and think “we see it behave like X, that is the only way it behaves.” As a general rule, a single spell can behave in a lot of different ways, depending on what the caster wants to do with it (and subject to the caster's magical ability). I would always err on the side of assuming that a spell can adapt to meet a certain scenario.

The second is that spells are not limited to a physicalist understanding of the world. They can target job positions, words, and information (secrets). They can distinguish between squibs and Muggles, even though they are biologically and magically identical. They treat concepts such as bravery, love and even “food” as objective facts which exist independently of people, rather than subjective opinions or emergent properties of the human mind.

I would venture to put the flexibility of magic as follows: magic is able to target/treat as real any distinction capable of being made by language.

So with these two points in mind, let's tackle two common points by way of example.

#+begin_quote
  Light goes through a shield charm, which means it is permeable to radiation
#+end_quote

This is an overly mechanical/physicalist understanding of the shield charm. The shield charm is not a physical filter. It is a magical protection. What it stops is likely defined not by reference to some list of properties or attributes, but rather by the concept of protection itself. I would suggest that the shield charm stops any thing which, on a common sense understanding, is dangerous.

#+begin_quote
  You can get around unplottable charms by targeting the thing next to it
#+end_quote

Used to say you can e.g. just target the Black Lake rather than Hogwarts and thereby get around Hogwarts' unplottability.

Again, this is an overly physical way of viewing magic. Unplottability prevents the mapping of its object. If you say “X is next to Y”, this is a form of mapping. To take unplottability seriously is to admit that no matter what clever scheme you think of, if the end result of that scheme would be to know where Hogwarts is located, then the charm will prevent it.

*3C. Conclusion*

In short, magic has both the strength and intelligence to protect wizards from any Muggle weapon you can think of.

*** *4. Postscript: Victory Conditions*

Finally, it is worth considering: what do the two sides actually want from this war?

Wizards likely would be fighting for a return of the status quo. It is no response really to say “there are so many Muggles, wizards can't fight them all”. Wizards don't want to fight them all. The wizards' goal is to be left alone.

Muggles, on the other hand, seem to be fighting for a guarantee of freedom from wizarding interference. That's much harder to achieve - how do you even know that you have achieved it? Muggles wouldn't know the difference between a world without wizards and a world where the wizards make them think there are no wizards.

Ultimately, if the fight were to continue escalating then wizards' last resort would presumably be to have the Muggles annihilate each other in a nuclear holocaust (excluding a time-travel based last resort). I have no doubt that wizards would survive such a holocaust and be able to use magic to restore the Earth to a pristine state in its aftermath.

** There would never be a war in the first place. Wizards can be very good at hiding and muggles massively outnumber the wizards.

Think about how would you or your parents react if someone revealed a 'wizarding world'. I'd guess:

- They wouldn't really take it seriously

- /If/ presented with incontrovertible evidence, they would want to reach out to these people and learn more about it. Relations would probably be pretty friendly; you might even know some people who are related to these 'wizards'.

- /Suppose/ for some reason, relations cooled. (It would have to be a pretty good reason.) Even then there wouldn't be a war.

  - The muggles might make demands of the wizards, or even try to govern them, but it would be like yelling at a wall.
  - The wizards would probably retreat further into hiding, increase security and obliviation, maybe even try to block off contact with muggles completely.

- And /if/ there was a hot 'war' between muggles and wizards? Then the muggles would get rekt.

** I think the whole Muggle "wank" comes actually from the source material. Personally I believe that an average Joe would stand absolutely no chance against an average Dedalus but if it comes down to open war, based on canonical material, I would think that wizards could not face a Muggle army (although I also believe that Muggles themselves, in this day and age, would not throw themselves into a war against wizards nor start another round of witch hunts, but would rather try to establish diplomatic relations with them).

While there could be lots of possible scenarios, one canon thing that might suggest that wizards might not be able to defeat Muggles in an open war is the International Statute of Secrecy and that happened during the 17th century when Muggle weaponry was nowhere near to what is today and the outcome of the battle was far more dependent on brute force. Whether it was the sheer number of Muggles or the lack of competence of wizards doesn't matter. Sure, one may argue that wizards just wanted to live peacefully, be left alone so they decided to be the better folk. However another thing that comes from Pottermore from the writing on Ministers for Magic, it appears that wizards, particularly those in positions of power, were quite hostile towards Muggles so if you could easily wipe out or enslave those annoying pests why bother going into hiding from them.

Also while wizards could resort to more hidden tactics such as enslaving governments or committing acts of terrorism, it must be noted that, while not explicitly stated in the books, it may seem that the Imperius curse does not work so well on strong willed people. And a lot of times, especially in times of crisis, it's strong willed people that get the power. Therefore I would have a hard time imagining that it would work on a Napoleon or a Gengis Khan. I would think that it didn't even work on Rufus Scrimgeour so that's why Voldemort preferred to kill him instead of just turning him into his puppet minister (would have raised less eyebrows and the whole ordeal would have gone way more quietly if there was just a gradual transition to the anti-mudblood policies). As for acts of terrorism, Muggles would probably just identify them with the help of secret services and hunt them down one by one.

Also not all wizards are as competent in terms of magic as Dumbledore or Voldemort or Grindelwald and also a lot of them seem to lack basic reasoning skills as Hermione says in the first book. So they can be outsmarted by the craftier Muggles who were forced by circumstances to develop such skills.

** Muggles have to know simply because you had a lot of authoritarian governments in the past century. You might be able to hide magic from the Police Constabulary of Northern Wales, but not from the Gestapo or the NKWD/KGB. Because those organisations would not hesitate to "interrogate" the parents of muggleborns until they reveal everything about magic. Then the Muggleborns would be given the simple choice between spying for the state or having their parents shot. The Western Allies would get that information from 3rd Reich archives and human assets, and get another huge chunk of information from the Stasi archives once Germany reunited.

As for the actual war, in an open battle wizards lose. The average wizard cannot cast a basic shield charm and they are going up against everything up to and including ballistic missiles. Chemical weapons would probably even work against skilled wizards (Sarin, mustard gas and the like), but are banned since the 90s.

BUT

Why should the wizards give battle? They can simply imperius the governments and military leaderships. So I foresee a clear wizard victory with quite a lot of guerilla resistance, especially in the US as the element of surprise and an abundance of firearms are a great equaliser. Here in Europe we don't have that, with maybe Switzerland being the exception as reservists get to keep some of their military gear.

The "best" outcome the Muggles can hope for is mutually assured destruction. Some missile submarine or remote base with standing orders to launch if the government has fallen will get their missiles off, which would spark a chain reaction and wipe human civilisation out. And even if you believe that, for whatever reason, wizards are immune to radiation, the ecosystem would still collapse and getting food would become an issue as you cannot transfigure it.

*** Have you ever heard the term glass cannon before?

That's pretty much what both sides remind me of. I'll admit taking a wizard by surprise with a gun might be an issue (they seem to be a sturdier lot), but they can deal a lot more damage.

My issue with excessive muggle weapons in fics tends to be the death eaters completely dropping the idiot ball. Voldemort, for all his arrogance, is very knowledgeable.

As for the debate, it really depends. I presume shield charms deflect bullets due to it working on the physical, so anyone wearing enchanted clothing might actually be bulletproof. Considering the irresponsiblity of Fred and George, they would possibly have been sold.

So it's an arms race of sorts. They'd try to work around enchantments, etc.

So in the end, it usually overly complicates a story.

** Wizards can hide perfectly, even from their own kind. They can hide even better from Muggles. They can teleport over basically any distance, either with apparition or portkeys. They can imperius, confound, and obliviate anyone.

A war would never happen. In fact, I strongly believe the ISS would never be broken, if wizards are half-competent. But if it did, the Muggles' only chance would be to strike hard and early before wizards can adjust their thinking and organise.

** It would NOT be muggles VS wizards. If the muggles had no magical support and no idea what they were up against, they'd have zero chance. But you can bet that people like Hermione Granger would not fight side by side with people like Draco Malfoy against defenseless innocents. (Since muggles don't know about magic, it has to be the wizards who are the aggressors.) No, there'd be plenty of defectors who'd support the muggle side. And with a little magical support to get through hiding magic, things would look a lot different. The majority of wizards are civilians without much battle experience, and the ones aligned with the Order and decent people would defend the defenseless muggles, so it'd essentially be Order + muggles VS Death Eaters + corrupt ministry. And now you have combined armies wielding fast guns and versatile wands against wizards who have ignored muggle progress for centuries and know almost nothing about technology and how to defend against it.
