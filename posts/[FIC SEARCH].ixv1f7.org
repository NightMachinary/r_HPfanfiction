:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fanfic about 6 months ago or so in which the weasley's start their own bank against gringotts. Can anyone help find this fanfic?


** The only story that I've read that might be what you're looking for is Reunion by Rorschach's Blot. It has the Weasley's owning a bank, being forced by a treaty negotiated by a malfoy to close and then years later being able to reestablish the bank when the treaty is breached.
