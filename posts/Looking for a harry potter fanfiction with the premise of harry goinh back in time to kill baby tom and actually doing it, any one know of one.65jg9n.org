  Go back to the beginning, that was the plan. Stop Voldemort on the cusp of becoming a dark lord, stop him before he created his first horcrux and change history before it could be written. That was the plan, only Harry made a mistake.

** would be nice anti-trope story :P

I had an idea once where Harry travels back, adopts Tom. But Tom still grows to be a dark lord, learns time travel magic from Harry, kills Harry and turns his glasses into his first Horcrux :D
