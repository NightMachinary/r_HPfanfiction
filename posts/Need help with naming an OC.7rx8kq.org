** a.

#+begin_quote
  why do that work when I can crowdsource it?
#+end_quote

Because it's your story and writing is hard work.

b. Why overcomplicate things? Badass Black-Bones seems eminently suitable to me.

** Obviously with last name like that the kid is destined to be a pirate, so I suggest good piraty names like Teach, Kidd, Barberosa, Long John, Flint, Drake, Gunn, and Morgan.

Flint Black-Bones would be best. Obviously they need to be obsessed with treasure and freebooting and talk like a pirate at all times. For a house, I suggest they be sorted into the Scurvy Sea Dogs and have there own ship on the lake.

** Look at any of the Black family who were disowned, and pick from there. Alternatively, Edgar, for the only other member of the Bones family to be mentioned.
