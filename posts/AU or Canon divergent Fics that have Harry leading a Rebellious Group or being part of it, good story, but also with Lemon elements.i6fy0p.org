As in the title, either its an AU fic (which i might prefer) or Canon Divergent. I thought about something like the DA. So harry might teach his group stuff or he is part of a Rebell group. This wouldnt be a Harem, but he might sleep with the one or the other Women from the Group. I thought that Fleur would have a special interest/attractivity in Harry, since his capabilities in fighting the Dark arts. She is not with Bill. Maybe she even fall for him, but that would be one-sided because Harry is either to much focused on the Goal or he simply doesnt love her, though he finds her attractive.
