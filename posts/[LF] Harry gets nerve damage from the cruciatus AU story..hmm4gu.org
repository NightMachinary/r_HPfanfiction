:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi all, I'm looking for a fic I read a long time ago (ff.net or ao3 only) where harry has nerve damage or is partially paralyzed at a relatively young age (hogwart age, maybe 13 or 14, not deathly hallows or later). I don't remember how that happens or what the plot is at all though. I believe the first scene is of him outside a muggle cafe (?) with a muggle girl oc who he ends up rescuing and taking to some safe house type place. Also he goes to Malfoy Manor (I think) and uses his magic, but not a particular spell, to walk down the driveway or to the gates or whatever so the Malfoys don't know how injured he really is. Thanks in advance to anyone who recognizes this!


** Brutal Harry linkffn(7093738) and it's sequel Hero Harry linkffn(8532802)

The cafe scene you're thinking of is at the start of the sequel.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

  As Magical England grinds itself through civil war and Magical Europe at large collapses in upon itself, Harry hunts through it all. Dumbledore has disappeared, Lucius Malfoy has publically fallen out with Fudge, and most the population of Hogwarts has fled to America, bringing many families of Muggleborns with them. Sequel to Brutal Harry. Rated for violence/messiness.
