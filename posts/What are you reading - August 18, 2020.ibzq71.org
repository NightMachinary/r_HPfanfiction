** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7321738/chapters/59982046]]) I love this because it turns Harry into a sort-of overpowered character(with constant and reliable resurrection and access to magic no one else possesses), but gives them to a growing teenager, which downplays it. Yeah yeah yeah you could take over the world, but wouldn't you rather hang out with your friends and be awkward with your (boyfriend)?

  What if that night in Godric's Hollow went differently? What if Harry did die? What if Death stepped in and made a deal with the Savior of the Wizarding World? How different would Harry's life be after that deal?(Or, Harry makes a deal with Death and in exchange gains something Voldemort has fought his entire life for. Immortality. And a strange friendship with Death)

** I just re-read Bobika's Beyond the Curtain. It's a shame that it hasn't been updated in months and the last chapter was such a cliffhanger.

What I like about this story is that the author's words makes me imagine a post-apocalyptic movie. I guess I've watched too many Resident Evil and war movies for me to even see certain scenes in my mind.

This is a story where Voldemort has won the war and has put up a curtain that separates a huge chunk of Europe from the rest of the world. Within the curtain, Voldemort reigns as Emperor while outside, a struggling resistance movement continues to oppose him.

This story is full of clashing political ideas, a road trip across a wasteland and the keeping and revelation of many secrets.

The first 2 parts of the story are complete. If you don't want to get frustrated by the cliffhanger on the last chapter, which was supposed to be the start of the third part, just read Chapters 1-18 & skip the 19th. I hope that the author still plans to update this.

** Im re reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7189349/chapters/16316573][“Wear me like a Locket Around your throat” by VivyPotter]] and somethings been niggling at my brain as I've been reading it.

Has anyone else noticed the big plot hole that is Hagrid's absence from Harry's life in the 1940's? Theres a hell of a focus on Tom Riddle opening the chamber of secrets, yet the author doesn't even mention Hagrid. Theres been frequent mentions of Harry lamenting that he misses his friends and name-drops Hagrid so I'm a bit disappointed I guess. Myrtle's even a key character for a while, yet not a hint of a third-year Hagrid.

I'm thinking that the author deliberately chose to ignore the fact that Hagrid was a key victim to the first opening of the Chamber of secrets. Although, I'd say he was as much of a victim as Myrtle.

I guess it just irks me that he's not present in this story, especially when key events happen that should have included at least, a mention.

EDIT: LMAO NEVERMIND hagrids finally mentioned, though it is a bit late imo

** linkffn(When the Future Died by SpikyStar) I just finished it and I have to say - I really enjoyed it. I haven't read too many time travel fics with Harry staying an adult, usually because it ends up with people noticing immediately. The elemental angle was very intriguing to me and I'd like to find more. Also the Prof!Harry thing was nice, I'm probably going to dive into more of those as well. A very easy read, but it hasn't seen an update since 2010 sadly enough so it is unfinished.

** linkffn(The odds were never in my favour)

This was recommended last week as well and I just started it then. So far it's a very long, in-depth, AU fic in which the main protagonist is Alexandra Potter, Neville is the boy-who-lived, and the main issues in canon (Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets) are situated within a much larger and more complex situation involving pureblood Wizengamot politics, Hogwarts inter-house conflicts, and entirely new villains from canon. It's currently a WIP but updates regularly and is already at 600k words. Would highly recommend

I always thought it was kinda nutty and one of those lord things, but the good Dumbledore and Weasleys look like a pleasant way to offset the usual Ron hates Harry cause he isn't Gryffindor trope.

**** I kinda liked it ? I've seen it recommended a lot and I've also seen a bit of hate towards it but I think that's mainly because it's so popular. It hasn't really subverted any tropes yet, rather is has only done them well. But it's really interesting to read because of the hundreds of side-plots, many of which haven't been resolved yet and I'm kinda waiting for that moment when it'll all tie in together. Things will be getting interesting now that Harry's beginning his fourth year... more emotions, more politics etc. Sure the kids talk like adults but do you really want to read a 1mil word story with kids saying purely what they speak like at 11/12?

** I've been reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shedding-lionskin-harry-potter-au.862342/][Shedding Lionskin]] by BeaconHill.

I don't go looking for HP fanfics but this was one by an author whose work I trust to be generally excellent so I had to check it out, especially after I read the premise! I'm a transwoman so I have kind of a morbid fascination with works that feature any sex-changing weirdness, I like to see that stuff explored but near-enough always it turns out that the person writing it is doing it from a very cis perspective or the protagonist is explicitly unwilling in the process. Not so with this! Here it's more of an accessory to the actual plot of the fic and entirely consensual, which allows for the author to execute on their awesome premise with none of the grossness I usually have to fear.

I haven't really described said awesome premise, mostly because it'd be a waste of time when the summary is right there. It's excellently written, interesting, and full of little touches here and there that makes everything /pop./ Can't recommend it enough. I literally came here to write this because I'm trying to pass time between updates :P

** Currently rereading through the works of White Squirrel. Right now I'm on Linkffn(Animagus at War by White Squirrel) though I accidentally spoiled the newest chapter for myself by clicking on the wrong button. A great series, though many already know that, and I can't wait to see it continued, though it hasn't been updated since May. White Squirrel has been updating other stories, so I imagine it's a matter of time. Great fic, not afraid to take jabs at itself, the source material, or the fanon as a whole.

** Just read linkao3(Ice Cream) as recommended by [[/u/MrMrRubic][u/MrMrRubic]] . Deliciously evil and funny, plus nice and short (9k words iirc). I guess I'm on the Haphne train now.

Have been reading linkao3(Orders of Magnitude) on and off. This is a prequel of Significant Digits and in the same AU. A bit weird and disjointed but excellent in some parts, and gets into some of the deeper mysteries about Merlin, the construction of Hogwarts and the Chamber of Secrets, etc. I'm told the ending is disappointing but I haven't gotten to it yet.

Does anyone here talk to the AO3 developers? It would be great if there was a way to download a story as a plain text file. I don't like flipping around through html pages or using an epub reader. Call it old fashioned but I still prefer plain text. Thanks ;).

I don't like having to retrieve each chapter separately, and the more obvious whole-story download links were only epub, pdf, etc. Converting epub to text hadn't occurred to me but I guess it also sounds feasible. Pdf to text isn't so good because pdf creation throws away a lot of info.

Anyway, now I'm going to use "view entire work" and save the output, on AO3. No idea about FFN but AO3 is a start. Thanks!

That looks nice. I've gotten fanficfare working and it does about the same thing so I think I'll use it for now. Also I didn't notice it earlier but AO3 has an "entire work" button that gets the whole story with one click, avoiding having to retrieve individual chapters.

  A whole day of Shinki staring at Shikadai seems like a drag, but thus far he hasn't found any sort of common ground with his cousin, and doesn't know where to start. Neither of them know much about the other, and it doesn't matter how much his mother nags him to 'make an effort', it won't mean a thing unless Shinki is open to this whole friendship-cousin-family thing anyway.

  Adrien wakes up in a hospital bed at 3h34 Thursday morning."What happened?" he asks the nurse. "Last I remember, my friend Marinette tripped on the stairs at school and took me down too. But that was Monday morning."Was there an akuma involved? he doesn't ask. He is used to---he hates, but he is familiar with---coming to with a new hole in his memory. But three days is an awfully big hole. Did I fight Ladybug again? Did I hurt anyone? If it was an akuma, and I'm still in the hospital after---what happened to my Lady?"Is she okay? How hard did I hit my head?"The nurse starts to quiz him, and then she pages a doctor and she starts to quiz him, and it's well past five before anyone thinks to actually tell Adrien that he did not in fact hit his head and black out for three days straight.Adrien had maybe thirty minutes of experiential memory---five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear: those orders of magnitude meant that half hour must be insignificant, not worth mentioning---and Marinette wasn't there beside him. He did not know if she remembered anything between the elevator and the kiss. He did not know if she remembered anything else.

** I just wrote this on another post, but I'm currently re-reading 'Percy Take the Wheel' by Kitty Smith on ffn, as it has updated since I last read it. It is an incredibly well-written story that explores the relationships and feelings of the Weasley children after their Molly dies and Arthur is hospitalised (that's not a spoiler; the first chapter is literally just after the funeral, and the death/absence of the parental figures is the premise for the whole story.) I absolutely love this story as it really goes into depth into the familial relationships between the siblings, and the development and changing nature of those relationships now that Percy has taken over the guardianship of his younger sibling as Charlie and Bill are away working to earn money to support the family. It goes into depth (literally at one point) into Percy's psyche and why/how he got to the mental place that he has by the start of the story (the summer before second year) and explores magic in interesting and inventive ways.

I love this story; I did when I first read it, and I love it just as much, if not more, the second time round. I cannot recommend this fic enough.

** Kneazle is always a good shout for Hermione centric fics and recently Yesterday is tomorrow (everything is connected) has been picking up speed and getting very exciting. It's a timetravel fic in which Hermione is one of the Evans sisters. The premise itself is not new at all, but I like the approach and it's a rare James/Hermione fic that works, at least so far. The latest chapter also has a massive, but good cliffhanger although Kneazle luckily doesn't do them often, so I'm really looking forward to seeing what happens.

The characters are interesting and well fleshed out, the relationships between Hermione, Lily and Petunia are complex but realistic I'd say, and I really enjoy the friendship with Barty and Regulus as well. The way Hermione deals with her situation as such is also pretty good, and we even get to explore magic that is a little different.

Kneazle's fics are generally right up my alley. There's also the famous GoT/HP crossover “the Winter Witch”, and various other crossovers and timetravel do-overs that are all written to a pretty high standard!

*** Was literally coming this way to say this, but you did it much more articulately than I would've! Absolutely seconding though, can't wait for the next chapter and seeing how it'll play out, especially since all three are involved!!!

  James Potter went five years at Hogwarts without realizing Lily had a little sister. Hermione would have preferred if he never realized she existed. Now she's stuck, in Potter's circle of awareness, and maintaining the timeline. Not like he makes it easy, or something.
