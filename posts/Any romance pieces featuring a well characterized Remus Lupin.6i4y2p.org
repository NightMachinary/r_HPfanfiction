** If you don't mind Lavender/Remus, linkffn(Stars Fall by Lady Altair) is excellent.

*** Hey, can you, please, tell me a bit about this fic. It sounds kind of interesting, but Lavender has me a bit concerned. Well, you know she was in canon, so...

**** So this story doesn't take place until years after the battle, where the age difference is acknowledged. Lavender is a lot more mature than in canon. I thought it was really believable, and really enjoyed the story and characterizations

**** If it helps, here is the complete summary:

/A post-DH AU in three parts. Even in the best of all possible worlds, happy endings aren't for everyone. Long after the Battle of Hogwarts ends, Lavender Brown must fight for her own happy ending. Remus Lupin will help her, because no one has ever needed him like this./

It does take place over the period of several decades and Lavender's growth is very realistic and true to her character. She's still the same Lavender underneath but her experience during the Battle of Hogwarts changed her.

  A post DH AU in three parts. We all craft our own happy endings. Even in the best of all possible worlds, romances decay and constellations fall from the sky, but Remus Lupin will pin them back up in a world that has already forgotten what he sacrificed.

** lmao I get annoyed by exactly the same thing on R/T fics where Tonks pretty much seems to have daddy issues and Remus acts like a grandfather until they break up in the sixth book. like I get they have a large age difference, but they're both consenting adults, please. salt aside, here are two of my favourites!

anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/769148/MrsTater][Mrs Tater]] - I think they're quite popular in the R/T committee and I could never shut up about how wonderfully they write the characters. They have several oneshot/<5K fics that chronicle several moments in the canon, like Mad Eye's death, or after the Ministry - but also quite a lot of in-between off-screen canon moments like them going for a shopping trip, or bathing Teddy and other such cute stuff. It's not in order but it's very strictly lined with canon, these oneshots, so they wouldn't be too confusing imo. Also, they do have sexual scenes and they're quite well written/rated - nothing special, quite vanilla, but they're good! Just have to mention the excellent characterization again, Tonks especially is very well done here - perfect for anyone who's really into the canon but also wants to see hidden moments!!! Remus' unsureness and his confusion is also very well depicted and in explored in detail, if I recal right, there was a good one where Molly coaxes out his dears. Only tough thing is that you've got to read and then go back to each one as the author wrote them as separate fics rather than a set of connected oneshots. Dates - 2011/2010 ish, so you'll have to scroll quite far down the author's profile and no new ones are posted. Well worth it though, imo.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11840896/2/Unbefitting-Strains][Unbeffitting Strains]] - So far there are around 25K+ words and 2 chapters, one for OOTP and HBP and one more due. I think this one has what you wanted in terms of Remus characterization, as far as I recall he's quite well rounded and verbose without being granddaddy-ish. Something I really liked about this fic is that it manages to be really entertaining apart whilst sticking to canon - R/T end up in the Taj Mahal, in Madame Tussauds, multiple shenanigans etc etc. Sticks nicely to canon, Greyback is especially fleshed out and there are some good one liners on morality/racism etc. Also incorporates Muggles and the Muggle world well - they talk a lot about Indian mythology and old American films quite a bit without breaking suspension of belief. I think it /was/ quite sexy if I remember there were a few fully fledged sex scenes with some control aspect on Remus' behalf, and it's also very nicely written and peppered with literary references. Date - 2016/2017. I've reviewed and PMed the author and they say the final DH chapter is due this month but I'm not too sure.

  In which Remus and Tonks fight battles, arrest criminals, befriend werewolves, overcome inner demons and, despite it all, find themselves a happy ending. A love story, and a story of the Order years. (My Remus/Tonks epic, years in the making! This is the second half of the story, set in the Half-Blood Prince year.)

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? NOW COMPLETE!
