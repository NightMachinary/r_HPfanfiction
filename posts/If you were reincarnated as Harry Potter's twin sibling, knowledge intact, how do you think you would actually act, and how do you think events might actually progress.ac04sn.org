If Nagini can't be gotten, wait til you know Arthur is going to be attacked in 5th year and then ambush it..

*** About half the Horcruxes could be destroyed a week after we arrive at Hogwarts. The diadem is in the room of requirement, and we know how to open it. The locket is at Grimmauld, which we can access after freeing Sirius by capturing Peter, which should be easy if we can stun him while he's a rat, not suspecting anything. The ring is at the Gaunt house, which Dumbledore can get after we tell him to be careful because it's cursed. The cup is in the Lestrange vault, and should stay there for a while since the Lestranges are in Azkaban, so it's not a priority. The diary will be given to us if we don't change the timeline too much before 2nd year, so we can simply tell Ginny "hey, Tom Riddle is actually Voldemort, you should probably not befriend him, he'll just use you to murder students, give us that diary". Nagini could be difficult, but we know that Voldemort will use Riddle Manor as his base of operations once he returns, so we can tell Dumbledore to send the entire order of the phoenix and the entire auror force there as soon as Harry gets strange dreams. Harry's Horcrux might be difficult since Canon isn't very clear about it, but it might just be a "get out of jail" card for surviving another killing curse. And destroying the other Horcruxes will be easy, since we happen to have easy access to Slytherins basilisk.

**** True enough, but we're a kid that shouldn't know about dark things like Horcruxes, so getting a reputation as a seer covers you for that, as you "Foresaw it" at least means Dumbledore will believe you, and him believing you before it's too late will basically turn the fic into "Competent Dumbledore wins the War by basically reading the Books" if you don't change too much on the outside.

Can't get rid of the Horcruxes in the First year unless you oust Quirrel early, as Quirrelmort might check on the Diadem off screen that we don't know about, and if he finds it gone... it'd fuck up EVERYTHING.

And even then, Swiss accounting should be solid enough to withstand some MoM investigation, especially since they wouldn't know to look in Switzerland. Outside of the initial withdrawal, nothing happens on the magical side. As far as they know, you withdrew a few thousand Galleons and that's it. They would not know of any fortune you made on the side.

****** So, assuming they actually bothered to/were capable of investigating these suspicions (others have made plenty of arguments against that already), or assuming the muggle get suspicious and you don't want to charm them (not that they could do anything about you just getting lucky), the easy way out is to just invest in more than just the companies you know will succeed. Invest in thos companies plus some you know will do okay or fail.

This act would probably give me enough pull to convince dumbledore of multiple horcrux and have him help me capture pettigrew so sirius gets released before needing to escape.

** Try my hardest to get us away from the Dursleys as soon as possible, for one. As you said 'twin sibling' instead of just 'twin' or 'twin brother', I assume I'll keep on being female. Sad as it is, people would probably take the abuse of small girl more seriously than that of a boy. Also, I could certainly accuse Uncle Vernon of certain, /specific/ things to speed up the process. (Note: false rape allegations are fucking wrong and fucked up, but I do feel in the Harry/Dursley situation that I could be forgiven for wanting to say it to get my brother and I away from the family, and it would be as a last resort).

I'd also work early on being seen as fairly bookish, though not in a Hermione-like way. More like fictional stories, especially involving magic and fantasy. After being particularly obsessed with Dahl, 'Matilda' in particular, I'd 'pretend' to be magic like her and hopefully be able to have some early show of magic in a way that Harry would see, and get him to open up about any magic he may have shown. I'd convince him we were magical and that it was perfectly normal (for us), just like in Matilda. I'd try to get him to help me figure out just what we can do and to work on doing more and more. I'd try to make him more confident and a little more interested in study and work ethic if I could.

I'd also try to 'somehow' sense things/know things about evens and people, like Sophie in Halloweentown, though sadly that won't come out until Harry and I are well out of Hogwarts. But I'd be able to 'just know' about things, like Mrs. Figgs cats being unusual, and (assuming we haven't escaped the Dursley's yet), that Dudley will grow up to be a decent man. Maybe I could convince him to become nicer earlier on. I'd also 'know' stuff about Aunt Petunia and Mom, and see if I could change her or at least unsettle her with the knowledge.

A day or so leading up to the arrival of the Hogwarts letters, I'll warn Harry that 'something's coming, something is going to change', further establishing my 'ability' in Divination or some shit. When the letters come, Harry will fully know it's real and have concrete faith in my 'future-sensing' capabilities, if he didn't already.

Because Hagrid is necessary in terms of us getting to Diagon, and just because I love him, we won't be able to find a way to answer the letters, though we'll have snuck one from the Dursleys. We'll probably end up in that shack on an island again, and Hagrid will come for us. I won't let Hagrid give Dudley the tail if I can manage it, though, because then Dudley will owe me, or at least see I defended him, and maybe put some more stock in what I said about him being a decent person, or having the potential to be.

We'll get our supplies with Hagrid and be shocked at the Voldemort story and my brother being the Boy Who Lived. We'll get all of our supplies, and go along with most things as in canon, except I'll share to Harry that there's something 'off' about Quirrell. I won't antagonize Draco Malfoy in the robe shop, but like Harry, I won't befriend him, either.

Come Hogwarts Express time, we'll find our way to the Weasley's and ask for help getting on the train. Ron will sit with us, I'm sure. When Malfoy shows up, I'll move to shake his hand before anyone can devolve to insults, and then I'll 'sense' something about him, distract him from being rude if I can. Hopefully the situation leaves Ron, Harry, and Draco neutral to one another for the time being. I think I'd claim that my sense of Draco is that he's 'really smart, going to be brilliant someday if he studies well - he'll change the world!' I'll tell him he looks 'blue' to me. This is bullshit, of course, but maybe he'd think a little more.

When Hermione comes by looking for Trevor, I'll let her know that he'll turn up when the time is right, and ask if she's read Matilda. (I'm almost positive she has!). I'll try to get her and Neville to stay with us and open up to Harry and Ron more, so they both go into things a little less isolated.

Sorting time. Most of this goes to canon, until Draco, heeding what I mentioned, isn't put in Slytherin instantly, but into Ravenclaw. He's a bit shocked, but proud. His family won't be TOO angry, either, because it's a respectable house, and at least isn't Gryffindor or Hufflepuff. Even Lucius probably couldn't argue the importance of intelligence.

Now is the tricky part - not having had any super horrible experiences with a Slytherin-to-be (and with Draco not going to Slytherin after all), Harry probably isn't as biased against the house. However, he still needs to be in Gryffindor and befriend Ron and Hermione, 1 because he needs them and they're great, and 2 because I can't fuck up the universe too badly and still have my future knowledge be of a help. Suppose he and I read a lot about knights and heroes as kids, and I let him 'save' me from something at some point before, leading him to still head to Gryffindor..

As to myself, I'm a little unsure. I'm normally given Hufflepuff in the Sorting quizzes I take. But, surely, my manipulations to this point, my ambition, and all of the sneaky cunning shit I've had to do peg me as a Slytherin? That would go a long way into keeping Harry from getting SO biased, but what would Snape do to me? Ron would probably never accept me, as 11-year old Ron HATESSSSSSSSS Slytherin. And aside from Draco, I don't know a large amount about any of the other Slytherins, so navigating the house would be challenging.

While Hufflepuff would be great, personally, as I AM one, I don't know it would be the best choice for me in this scenario. I'd love it, but the closer I stay to Harry and the original timeline events, the better I can work with them. So I do my best and hopefully make Gryffindor.

At some point, someone cottons on to my 'sensing' abilities and Dumbledore or someone thinks I have a special affinity. It will make things easier, but this assumes I somehow am able to keep Dumbledore and Snape out of my head..

Anyway, if all goes well, I mention my 'off' feeling about Quirrell to the right people at the right times in order to get Dumbledore suspicious and have him do something.

As this is getting pretty long, I'll skip around. I befriend Neville and try to work on his confidence. I try to help Hermione tone it down so she isn't as hated. I do my best to stop Ron from injury in the chess game. I'm friendly enough to Draco, I like flying, Harry still makes the team, I gain Slytherin-tolerance by pointing out they shouldn't go to their common room during the Troll incident because it's in the dungeons. We still try to get the Stone, but suspect Quirrell, not Snape.

In the grand scheme of things, I do my best to try to save Cedric and Sirius, protect Luna, and enjoy being magical. I help Harry and Co fight Voldemort.

Apologies for the long ass response, this was very fun to think about! If I was any decent, I'd want to write my version of things with this as the prompt, but I don't think 'self-inserts' are generally well accepted anyway?

I agree - Dumbledore may mess with the cops and social workers. To that effect, I suppose I'd need to get REALLY GOOD at Occlumency and show false memories of Vernon violating me sexually - maybe THEN Dumbledore would actually act and get us out of there. Several problems with this - 1, it's shown that even Slughorn cannot manufacture a fake memory with no gaps or weird shit that gives it away as fake. 2, Dumbledore is incredibly clever, and if he got even a HINT that I was able to occlude at that age with no training, he'd probably peg me as Dark. 3, I'd still be a person with less than 1st year experience, and have to go through and learn everything. There's no guarantee I'd be any better at Occlumency than Harry was; in fact, nothing suggests I'd be any kind of talented witch at all. I'd probably be roughly average at best, albeit very studious and knowledgeable.

*** You should probably learn Petrificus Totalus immediately, sneak into Ron's (and Harry's) room, use the spell on Scabbers, grab the rat and bring him to Dumbledore ASAP. Tell him you had a weird feeling about the rat, and he'll test it and find out it's an animagus.

Seriously, the man murdered your parents and framed your godfather. How can you not think of getting him when he's sleeping in Harry's room and you know it?

Once Sirius is free, you never have to see the Dursleys again, you can spend the Christmas holidays with him at Grimmauld Place, and you can have a weird feeling about the locket Kreacher has and bring it to Dumbledore to get an excuse to start Horcrux Hunting.

After that you can have a weird feeling about that spot where the room of requirement is, and find a strange diadem there. Tell Dumbledore, Horcrux #2 gone.

In second year, after your weird feeling about Quirrel just barely saved the Philosopher's stone, you can befriend Ginny so that Tom isn't the only person she talks to, and have a weird feeling about her diary (probably ASAP before Tom notices what's going on and you become the first victim instead of Colin), get Ginny to introduce you to Tom, ask some questions and reveal him as Voldemort. Once Ginny gets over her shock, take the diary to Dumbledore, Horcrux #3 gone, and the Chamber disaster doesn't happen.

Now with Sirius out of Prison it means that the notable events of third year just don't happen. No dementors, no Wormtail, and Lupin probably was teacher in second year after you met him in first year as Sirius' old friend and informed Dumbledore that you had a bad feeling about Lockhart.

With third year completely different, it's here where you take Divination and suddenly you can't predict anything anymore. The irony.

Dumbledore probably trusts you after randomly finding 3 Horcruxes, a Death Eater and the Chamber of Secrets so you can be a bit more direct with giving him all the information you have about the whereabouts of the remaining Horcruxes.

Will Moody be real Moody or still Barty Jr? Is Harry getting entered into the Triwizard? What about the rebirth ritual, and Voldemort taking Harry's blood being a necessary part of the plot?

A lot hinges on the events of PoA and Wormtail's escape. As much as I adore Sirius and want an out for Harry and I, I don't know if it'd be worth that risk in potentially ROYALLY screwing up the timeline and my ability to 'predict' things. It may cause much more damage than it prevents.

***** No wormtail will certainly delay any plans Voldemort may have. If Dumbledore can manage to get into Gringotts all the Horcruxes except for Harry and Nagini will be gone by 2nd year. Pettigrew being captured before he returns to Voldemort is the only way to get Sirius free. While it does risk uncertainty about Voldemorts plans (he'll still need Harry for the ritual), you can't expect someone to spend three years with the man who murdered his parents without doing anything about it. Ideally Dumbledore would replace all of the bones of Tom Riddle Sr. with bones of someone else, with an alarm charm and everything so that if he tries some other plans to get Harry, the ritual will fail and Dumbledore knows where Harry is and can rescue him (and kill the Death Eaters wondering why the ritual didn't work).

** I would certainly feel compelled to save some lives, but probably make things worse.

I know if I change things too early the knowledge will be useless and it's hard to predict how much change is too much. So it just seems like a long shot, especially since Harry having a sibling is already a big change.

And honestly, the best thing to do would be to tell Dumbledore. He is much smarter and more powerful than I am (I know zero magic), so he can actually quietly do something about horcruxes. Meanwhile I will use my adult mind to learn as much magic as possible (hopefully I won't have to stay with Dursleys). Depending on my progress, I can also help destroy horcruxes or at least be useful later. Nothing really bad happens until 4th year, so I will hopefully have 13 years for it.

*** You can probably change a lot in the first few years.

One trip to the room of requirement and you have Ravenclaws Diadem, one of the Horcruxes. One owl to Sirius, and he'll find Slytherins Locket at Grimmauld Place. In second year, you can have a quick talk with Ginny, telling her about Voldemorts true identity, and you have another Horcrux. With no chamber of secrets opened, Sirius free and a quick mention to Dumbledore about Quirrel, the first three years will be much more normal and a lot less dangerous. By the time Voldemort starts to return, you know exactly that he's at Riddle Manor with very few Death Eaters (Wormtail is already captured, remember?) so the Order of the Phoenix can save the day, kill Nagini and capture Voldemort in his weak form. Some Veritaserum later, all Death Eaters are in Azkaban, all Horcruxes are destroyed except for Harry, and Voldemort is captured, so the only remaining task is to get Voldemort out of Harry's scar, which should be easier with no war going on.

Fourth year is when it gets tricky. You can easily fuck the whole thing over by tainting the bones of Voldemort's father if you are careful about it in the first 3 years, but Cedric would die if you do nothing else. It would Sabotage the ritual tho. From there things would go mostly to the wind except some fixed things like the horcruxes which are the most important.

** Try to track down anyone that has a vested interest in Harry's safety (and that has good intentions and isn't in league with Riddle) and get us both there ASAP. Knowing my personality, I probably would've feared Dudley a lot and acted as a shield for Harry getting beat up... though I don't think people would turn as much of a blind eye if they saw that Dudley was beating up his legally blind cousin. I would tell anyone who would listen in the neighborhood about how bad Dudley beat me and Harry up. If someone listened, whatever the UK's version of Child Services is would've probably taken both of us away, but Dumbledore would probably intervene and keep us there anyway. If we're still there at the Ripper-chases-Harry-up-the-tree incident, I'd run straight over to Mrs. Figg and beg her to do something and tell her everything (assuming she doesn't already know).

If somehow we're still with them after the letters arrive and we go to Diagon Alley, I'm calling the Knight Bus and have them take us both to... somewhere. I'd try the Weasleys first since they seem to be good parents. If they somehow don't take us in, I try to find the Longbottoms. If they don't have us, then I'd feel out of options, so I'd try to find literally anyone on the "good side" in Harry' year and beg their parents.

** I think what I would do is a twin sister.

But regardless, a sibling, especially a twin, especially a twin /sister/ invokes a fundamental change in the story. An insert of a character who knows everything may as well be "Sandbox mode" where you intervene when you feel like it. A sibling on the other hand goes right down to the prophecy. Does the prophecy need to change? Maybe Neville has a twin as well. Or perhaps the prophecy is the same, but Voldemort attempts to kill Harry first, the love charm kicks in and wastes Voldy before he can try to kill the twin. I like this angle, it's what I would take.

Next: even if your character knows everything in the books, you're still growing up with Harry and the Dursleys. Even with future knowledge, these are still people you're living with day in and day out and forming relationships. I think the Dursleys would be softer, specifically I think I'd take the approach with the sister having her mother's charm, and the Dursleys being begrudgingly pleasant, or at least not tyrannical as they were before. They might be inclined to favor the girl and still be harsh on Harry, but this is where that knowledge would come in, the sister knowing the progression of the story would either decline the favoritism, or leverage it for better treatment for Harry. I think this would end with the two still doing a lot of chores around the house, and a not especially loving home life, but one that's far better. To that point, we see with Harry that the worst part of living with the Dursleys after his first year is the isolation from his friends it brings.

I see the greatest amount of conflict between the kids and the Dursleys would be the school letters. I don't know if I'd take them all the way to the island, or if I'd just make Hagrid show up earlier, but I think he would really want to see both kids. We get to Diagon Alley, nothing differs significantly, we get to 9 3/4, Harry still meets the Weasleys. I REALLY like the idea of people growing up basically not giving a shit about Sister Potter, only knowing that Harry defeated him. I think I would make it a recurring joke that it's not common knowledge that he has a sister because all they've ever heard about is "Voldemort murdered Harry Potter's parents and then failed to murder him" and they'd leave off "and his sister was in the crib next to his but everybody ends the story at "Voldy died trying to kill Harry." This accordingly leaves plenty of room for the sister to develop how she wants---and keep in mind, she's a person, she might know the future but she still has her own wants and needs and dreams!---so here is the question. Is she part of the group, and the three become four? Or is she content to be on the periphery, like Neville?

The exact narrative arc is if the author wants it to be crack or not, but I think either way she intervenes in mortal threats (So everything after book 1)

• Book 1 remains the same, perhaps she helps with smuggling the dragon, but I suspect she might think it have some ultimate significance.

• Book 2, she determines some way to convince Dumbledore there's a basilisk in the school. The most effective way would be revealing future knowledge, so this could just be a fairly boring arc, where she shows Dumbledore the diary, gets him to kill the snake, destroy the diary, and probably figures out some way of getting Dobby freed like Harry does. My "entertaining" arc would be Dumbledore kills the snake, but the sister isn't sure who has the diary, and there's still the final confrontation between Harry and Riddle and somehow Harry still pulls the sword and destroys the diary.

• Book 3: Pettigrew's caught and Sirius is exonerated before he needs to escape, so the entirety of the Book 3 plot is subverted. Normal year.

• Book 4: Once again this is a arc/narrative question. With the Chamber/Pettigrew, Dumbledore trusts the sister, so does she want Harry to compete in the cup? This would require her to leave Barty in place, or perhaps she busts him right after the Goblet of Fire hoodwink. I genuinely don't know how I'd do the cup/portkey/graveyard. Otherwise after she busts Pettigrew I'd imagine she'd say "oh yeah and Barty Crouch Jr. is still alive," which preempts Goblet of Fire except the graveyard.

(By the way, in the background during all of this the Horcruxes are getting dunked on by Dumbledore.)

Maybe I set it up so the graveyard is the final confrontation. I like the idea of this because it might mean Dumbledore and Harry go together to the graveyard, which could be cool.

• Book 5: So assuming that for whatever reason the story is progressing like canon, Dumbledore stops the Dementors, maybe Umbridge is preempted outright and the ministry sends some other shitty but at least not evil instructor. DA probably still exists in this scenario because fuck it why not. Harry doesn't go to the ministry, or it's bait if for some reason they need to prove Voldemort is alive.

• Book 6: Ring's already destroyed, Dumbledore's no longer dying, if the horcruxes haven't been dunked on yet (for whatever reason) that starts in this one, and instead of memories it's just Dumbledore and Harry playing seek and destroy. Don't really see a compelling reason to have Dumbledore dying at the end of Book 6 with everything before this.

• Book 7: IDK. Again, I just figure any way you slice it the story's all solved by this point. Alternatively there could be some interesting area about the ministry being under Voldemort's control in all but name, and Hogwarts being kind of a powder keg, and horcrux dunking happening during this year in secret, leading up to Voldemort's move on Hogwarts to take out Dumbledore & Harry, and him subsequently losing.

Really, like I said, I think I would construct it such that the graveyard is the final battle. I think it lines up neatly with the timeline and with a character with mostly perfect knowledge, and then Harry/Sister enjoy a quiet final 3 years at Hogwarts.

** If magical/

Step 1: Learn enough wandless magic to k.o. an adult muggle. Pseudo-telekinesis (?)

Step 2: Scare the dursleys enough so they're not much of a bother to you and your twin. Keep it a secret from Harry if possible.

Step 3: Learn enough chemistry to be scary with transfiguration, train enough to be able to run a long time. (Check if magic can act as chakra and try ninja shenanigans, if it doesn't work no problem)

Step 4: Wait for letter and whomever takes you to diagon, secure moneys. Wait to find RoR before buying books and other extra stuff unless you find something worthwhile like occlumency books and magical common knowledge, maybe goblin history in case they are the ultra helpful kind, if not no problem.

Step 5: Stick to cannon unless Quirrelmort becomes an issue, try to get into ravenclaw if possible. Harry probably won't change much since I'm not much of a family guy, he'll probably be more outgoing and get some more friends.

Step 6: Learn enough so you can tell if you are obliviated, ideally prevent it from happening, back up memories (?) If it works run to tell Dumbles about Quirrell and hope for the best. Same plan if if takes longer, more than 3rd year? make plans to bomb little hangleton and pray you're not the one selected for the TWT, train wandless accio everyday just in case.

Step 7A: HOLY SHIT HE OBLIVIATED ME! I'm in a Evil!Dumbledore storyline! Despair for a few months while trying to steal(bond) as many elves as possible, move everything away from the RoR ( check if instructions are avaliable if not fuck it) Take harry and if she's cool Hermione with her family away to wherever you can hide from everyone. Learn as much as you can, have elves look for pple worth saving and take them away if war breaks out. Imperio your way to nukes and blow everything away as many times as necessary. I'm not a good person tbh.

​

Step 7B: Good!Dumbledore storyline! YAY!! 1rs year goes the same BUT the trio never make it past the door to fluffy, Snape smiles while stunning them. Dumbles face Quirrell, let's Spiritmort get away. Have Dumbles take the map from the twins so he can make sure Harry's fine before any of that.

​

Step 8: If you're lucky canon should be relatively the same. Check with dumbles if Harry can spend the summer with his friends (may as well give him a family experience since you're kinda cold), ask for a contract so the Wealeys can never potion Harry or similar scenarios (it never hurts to be cautious). Check on Luna in case she's cool to hang out with, plus magical animals are cool.

​

Step 9: Dobby and Lockhart shenanigans, good, canon still canon. Dumbles takes the diary while ''checking'' on Harry. Second year should be a quiet one.

​

Step 10: Let canon be canon until Dumbles get's a chance to capture the dog and the rat. Have him mess with his memories so he think he get's away the same as canon while tracking him to voldie.

​

Step 11: By this point all Horcruxes except the cup should be accounted for (unless Dumbles is THAT cool and can get it from the goblins) and nagini should be with voldie. Capture voldie, destroy Horcruxes, find a way to destroy the one in Harry. Worst case scenario let babymort AK Harry in case the prophecy is a thing. Happy ending (?)

Optional:

Step 12 : Learn as much magic as possible. Track the 1% with all the moneys fucking up the world, go on a killing/imperio spree, try to unfuck the world as much as possible using said moneys.

Step 13: Create some space wizards company. Profit!

Step 14A: MAGIC DOESN'T WORK OUTSIDE THE EARTH! D:

Repeat step 13 but help non magicals do it instead.

Step 14B: MAGIC STILL WORKS OUTSIDE THE EARTH! :D

Really happy ending ;)

​

There may be some plot holes or canon may change but I think this would be my main plan.

He still has the Cloak of Invisibility, and he trusts my information after I located all the other Horcruxes.

-Now that we have all the Horcruxes and all the Hallows (imagine Dumbledore's shock when I tell him that I know exactly what his wand is), it's his job to figure out how to get rid of Voldemorts soul without killing Harry (and maybe preserving those ancient artefacts) and we can focus on our normal hogwarts education and spending time with our Godfather and Defense teacher. We're only first years, after all.

** Besides the main problem that Harry doesn't have a twin, and one does not fit in the story one iota. So you already start off super-contrived, as you gotta explain how either you have a pair of neglected twins at the Dursleys (and Harry's character development would be very different if he had a confident through that), or you got another 'Found family after joining the wizarding world' situation that Sirius fills quite nicely.

Next, you have to explain wtf reincarnated as means. Baby with a previous lifes knoweldge? First off, that would really, really suck. Second, events from the books should never even get close to happening, all it really takes is getting old enough to hold a conversation. Plus you'd be rich. Filthy rich. Anyone with a modest understanding of history would be able to make lots of money off of historical events.

Or you have someone taking over a body after it is grown. Setting aside the fringe horror of you killing whatever body you take over, you are being put into a situation which has already dramatically been altered from the books (as previously mentioned, Harry didn't have a twin brother and if he did everything would drastically change pretty much everything about the story). So your knowledge is basically useless (not that it wouldn't be anyway, for other reasons).

I have never understood the whole 'Harry has a twin' thing. It makes no sense in the context of the story, in the context of Harry's character. As far as I can tell, it is just a way for authors who don't want to write a real OC or SI to ease into it. Or for some reason want a teenage version of Sirius for Harry to connect to. And don't even get me started on the whole WBWL thing. You have a perfectly good Neville if you want to do a story about the prophecy being misinterpreted, and for some reason authors keep pushing in OC siblings instead.

/sigh/ this is just something I think I'm not going to get. And I honestly wouldn't even mind a story that was 'What if Harry had a sibling, how would things change'. But that is never the story written. It is always 'I need this kind of relationship for harry, so lets force it in', falling into the same mess a lot of magical core, inheritance, or marriage law fics do, just a lazy plot device. Only it fits the theme of the books even less.

I'd also, I imagine, save everyone all kinds of time with the PoA and HBP plots.

** Revel in the favoritism I'd receive as the Boy Who Lived, relentlessly bullying Harry. I'd then feel betrayed due to him being Sorted into Slytherin, giving me greater impetus to continue my poor treatment of him. After he proves that he is a Magical and political genius, continually out performing me in every theatre of life, I would go insane and try to kill him, probably around mid to late Seventh year. I would fail spectacularly, my final thought being the realisation that I was the Wrong Boy Who Lived.
