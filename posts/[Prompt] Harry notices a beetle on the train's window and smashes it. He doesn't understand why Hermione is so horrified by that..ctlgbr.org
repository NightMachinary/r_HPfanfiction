** “Are you okay, Hermione? You look like you've seen a ghost,” Harry said cheekily, nudging Ron in the ribs.

Ron pressed his nose to the window and asked, “Is Peeves following us again?”

Harry sighed, lamenting the fact Ron would never understand muggle humor. Normally Hermione would at least give him a pity chuckle, but she was too busy staring at the smashed beetle on the window in open-mouthed horror.

“I.. You...” Hermione stuttered out.

“It was just a beetle,” Harry said, tilting his head at her reaction.

“Just.. a beetle. I think I'm going to be sick,” Hermione said, putting a hand to her mouth as if she was going to vomit.

“Don't tell me you're going to start the 'Beetles are Friends' club,” Harry said, again nudging Ron in the ribs.

“I don't get it,” the other boy replied.

“Barf, Ron,” Harry clarified as Hermione ran from the train compartment.

“Yeah, looks like she's going to,” Ron agreed with a decisive nod.

Harry sighed again and went back to his book that the creeping beetle had interrupted.

She would have been thrown in Azkaban for being unregistered anyway. Though I'll admit I don't remember if it's a life sentence or if it's for how many years the person has gone unregistered.

****** Fudge is still in power, and Skeeter is like 95% of his public opinion - ergo, the only thing Fudge is supposed to care for as a minister.

So Harry is now traitor number two behind Dumbledore for proclaiming Voldemort is back and Fudge has the golden excuse of murder of not just a random, but one of his favored crop, AND a women who is adored by half wizarding Britain. Remember that even Molly Weasley believed Skeeter's shit about Hermione's dating life and acted on it, while knowing (of) Hermione for nearly 4 years at that point.

Medal? Except for the potential underage laws that Fudge has been shown to happily ignore, it's Azkaban for Harry.

I don't know about you, but a loose cannon yellow "journalist" like Skeeter is not someone who I'd like if I were in a position where public opinion mattered. Just because Harry was an easier target than just about everyone else doesn't mean that everyone else was ignored prior to him becoming a target. That's terribly unrealistic. "Journalists" like Skeeter are almost never, if ever, the friends of people in power. Afterl all, the enemy of my enemy most certainly isn't my friend.

** I feel like the issue with most of these “X catches/kills rita in her animagus form” is that people are supposed to take on some of the characteristics of their animal, and insects have extremely fast reaction times (<40ms) in response to visual stimulus.
