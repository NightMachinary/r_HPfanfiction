** Linkffn(9885609) has a Harry who isn't believed by anyone except Astoria Greengrass, so they run away together. The fic isn't a masterpiece, but it probably keep you entertained enough.

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

*** This must be the most heavyhanded this ever. Out of 400 people in the school, literally the only person who can even conceive of the possibility of Harry telling the truth just happens to be the person the author wants to pair Harry with. lol

**** Of course he falls in love with the only one who believes him. Why would he fall in love with anyone else? That's not 'heavy-handed'; it's cause and effect.

***** That resulting cause-and-effect doesn't suffer from heavy-handedness except by extension of the heavy-handedness of "random person Harry has never met is the one person to believe him!" (which almost always happens to be the author's Mary Sue/self-insert)

**** Indeed. Personally I didn't believe that she'd be the only one who' would believe him. It's unfortunately one of the best written Astoria/harry.

IMO it ranks 6.5/10. Readable and memorable enough.

** Story: Magicks of the Arcane [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magicks-of-the-Arcane]] Nice twist on the whole take. Harry is competent but not so op that he has no competition. Great magical system

** Look up Enslavement by Jeconais. Its on Fanficauthors.net

Yes you will need to sign up for access... yes its worth it. Most of Jeconais stuff is pretty good.

** Hidden Hero is a very good fic and basically no one believes Harry and those who help him anyway (Hermione, Fred, George) still think he's lying. Ron does come back so it certainly isn't Ron-bashing. Them being proved wrong about Harry not putting his name in the goblet actually adds to the plot in later chapters.
