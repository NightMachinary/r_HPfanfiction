:END:
This is what I can remember:

- Harry lives in a muggle apartment and one day Draco moves in across the hall to him
- Draco is on probation
- Soulmate AU where if person A hurts themselves flowers will bloom on person B's skin
- Draco makes scratches on himself with his nails
- Harry goes for a run one day
- Harry bakes muffins and brings them to draco's apartment
- First time Harry was over at draco's apartment Harry falls asleep in the sun

And I can really remember the rest of the story

  AU where flowers bloom in places where your soulmate is wounded.Harry lives in a small flat in the centre of London and guess who moves in the flat across the landing? no other than Draco Malfoy and he has no clue how to take care of himself.after the battle, before eight year in Hogwarts.Warnings for self-harm and violence inspired by a tumblr post I sadly do not own Harry Potter, JKR does, go thank her ;)
