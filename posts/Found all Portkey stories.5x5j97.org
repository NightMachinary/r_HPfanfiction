** There's also [[http://www.portkey-archive.org/]] for people who want a site slightly less green and with a more functional Search.

** Are there any "must read" stories on this site?

*** Well, I think it's hard to label any fic as "must read", but I thought that /Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire/ was excellent. The general idea is that the 4th name to come out of the Goblet of Fire was Hermione Granger, not Harry Potter. There are reasons for this of course, but I don't want to spoil anything in case you decide to read it.

It's also a H/Hr fic once you get into it, FYI.
