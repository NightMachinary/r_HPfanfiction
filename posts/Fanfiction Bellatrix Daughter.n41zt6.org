I'm looking for a fic about Bellatrix missing daughter, anybody have any good ones?


** There's one where it reveals Bellatrix had a daughter with Voldemort. It seems so stupid though. It gives no valid reason on why Voldemort would have a child. Plus there's also Time travel trope shit that is also stupid, involving Draco's and Harry's sons. I think the fic was called Cursed Child? Or something, idk.

- “The Augurey” linkffn(12310861) (with [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/augurey-or-loosing-of-sanity.html][huge objections]] to this story))

Doesn't mean I like them (especially the last one, see the review)

  "Hermione Jean Granger made her way towards the basement where she knew the child was being kept. She mentally cursed herself for not rushing over here as soon as she had found out. She had been such a coward, putting her own fears and feelings above an innocent child's safety." Or: A rewrite of The Cursed Child.
