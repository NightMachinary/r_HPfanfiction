Any fics that show Harry as an actual teenager. Someone who swears constantly, is a gamer, maybe smokes, or drinks, is always making pop culture refrences. You know, a teenager. Also bonus points if he actually uses common sense regulary.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** I never understand how people think all that stuff is "realistic teenager." I never constantly swore, or smoked or drinked. And I never saw anybody else doing any of that either. I went to lots of people's houses and had lots of sleepovers (mainly just to stay out of my mother's house as much as I could) and nobody ever did that stuff! To me that all just sounds like the OPPOSITE of realistic teenager: it's hollywood teenager. Like "being edgy".

*** I was cursing, trying alcohol, and doing weed and psychedelics all at the age of like 13-15. Cursing way before that too. There are definitely many teenagers who swear all the time, smoke, and drink. I remember when I first said fuck. I was like 11 and one of my friends said, "Finally, you said it."

*** Just out of curiosity, in which country did you grow up (and in which decade)?

Because at least here in Germany, maybe 2/10 guys haven't thrown up from drinking before they turn 18. We are fairly casual about the whole thing, and you can legally buy beer and wine once you are 16. I have family who lives in a wine producing area and I was offered glasses at 14. I know exactly one guy who has not at least tried alcohol before finishing school.

Smoking is a little less popular, although there are many people who smoked the occasional fag when we were drinking. Weed has become a popular again in recent years, but wasn't really a thing when I was a teenager.

The age of consent is 14 here, average age for the first time is 16. Go figure how that translates to teenage sex.

As for swearing, motherfucker, son of a whore, bastard fucker and a bunch of racial slurs (the swear which must not be named in the US is just regular cursing around here) were everyday vocabulary, and I was in one of the "better" schools.

***** I think Europe is a lot more relaxed in that regard. I mean, some US states have 21 as the drinking age and 18 for consent, so the overall attitude will be different (or those laws would have been changed). Germany is especially lax when it comes to drinking, France with smoking (seriously, it feels like at least 2/3rds of all teenagers there are smoking), although the UK in the 90s wasn't really enforcing the underage drinking ban.

I mean, I am usually the voice of reason and even I got peer pressured into drinking too much once. I know that all of my neighbours also have tales of too much alcohol. Those who do not drink due to their religion usually smoke hookahs.

And honestly, as long as you don't end up in the hospital, no one really cares because they too have been young once. From what I have heard about the US, children get more autonomy around here, and the legal consequences of getting caught are almost nonexistent as long as you don't drive under the influence.

****** Only 15 states ban underage drinking. In nearly all of the rest, it's just that you can't buy alcohol, but you can totally drink it if someone else gives it to you.

It's 21 to purchase alcohol /everywhere/ in the country, though.

*** Sorry, but I did. Most of the people at my high school did, if to different degrees. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't always smoking, or drinking, but it was always something. It was smoking for me(peer pressure). Also I said typical teenager, not every teenager, and to me that's a typical teenager. If it's not the same for you great, but it is where I grew up. Also this is directed more to a male teenagers mind-set, that is what i'm looking for after-all. When your a male teenager you are "being edgy", I mean our hormones, and biology in general are constantly messing with us to the point that peer pressure, or a pretty girl makes you want to seem the most manly, the toughest, the best. There are outliers a plenty, but the highest percentage of male teens act this way.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

**** Oh okay. I guess it depends on where you lived? I can only even think of like two kids I even heard about who were said to be smoking. I never heard about anyone drinking, though, or anything else. Not even RUMORS. So it's just always weird to me when people call all that stuff "realistic" when it like never happened at my school or town.

You are welcome, Warryn! :)

*** Ever consider that you and those you grew up around were just more straight-edge? Nothing wrong with it, but teenagers come in all different shapes and sizes. I was smoking weed and drinking at age 16 or so with a sailor's mouth at school since age 11 and I was normal or even tame given those I went to school with. I knew people that were drinking and having sex as early as as age 12. Hollywood dramatizes a lot of teenage antics but a lot of the basis does still exist. Dumb shits that rebel for the sake of rebelling is a very real trend.
