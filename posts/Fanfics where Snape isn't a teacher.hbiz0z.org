Hi, I was wondering if there were any fanfics which avoid having Snape as a teacher at hogwarts at all, ideally with Slughorn replacing him (and hopefully with no bashing).

Imo, this is a much better move on dumbledores part; not only can he keep one of his most important pieces more loyal and happy (not having to work at a job he hates), but he also doesn't put a spy in an almost hopelessly compromising position. I have a lot of opinions about this change, but this is a request post so I'll save them. I do think it is an interesting space to explore though, and I can't find any fanfics which do it (though admittedly I did not search very rigourously).


** I mean he never actually TEACHES anything, just says "Follow the instructions."

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Reboot by Kallanit has Snape along with Harry and Hermione come back in time. Snape never joins the deatheaters, is friends with the Marauders and he is not a teacher instead he owns an apothecary and makes his own brand of cosmetic products. He even acquires his own phoenix as well as a wife.

**** Yeah it's really cool one of my top favorite stories. I typically hate Snape (he needs more Azkaban in his life), but he really meaningfully redeems himself in this.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
