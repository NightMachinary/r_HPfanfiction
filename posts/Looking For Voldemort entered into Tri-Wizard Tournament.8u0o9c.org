Has anyone read a story where Tom Riddle had his name placed into the Goblet of Fire like a 4th/5th entry? Would this kill him if he didn't compete? Could they setup traps before and after? Does he compete like a little baby Voldy? Just interested if this existed. There are plenty of ridiculous stories out there, this could already exist right?


** For Voldemort competing in the TWT, I still think [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), has the best version of how he would do it:

- He organized House Elves to form a paper airplane production line, and launched at least 300 paper airplanes with his names on it into the Goblet.
- He never bothered to figure out the tasks. When faced with the Dragon, he just killed it and got zero point.
- In the second task, he sabotaged Fleur and vanished large amount of water from the lake. He never figured out who he had to rescue so he brought all hostages back.
- He killed his way through the Maze, and easily got the Cup.
- In the Graveyard, he crashed the resurrection party of his other version, which eventually led to the great “Slytherin Memorial Service”.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** We don't know what are the consequences of not competing; in some interpretations it's death, in others you're sucked into the Goblet, Horned-King-style, in others you get a 'COWARD' brand like a more evil version of Hermione's SNEAK (which is a decent extrapolation of our only example of a Magical Contract's consequences), in others yet you lose your magic. Some people even argue that there may /not/ be a magical contract in place with the Goblet of Fire, and Ludo Bagman (who is an idiot) just /thought/ there was and everyone believed him.

Anyway, what I want to see is him hearing of it /before/ it kills him, and /actually competing/. And he has to stop all his plans to take over immediately because if he starts a war the Tournament will be cancelled and then he can't compete and he'll die.

** Yeah, it's been done a few times in some of the older comedy stories. IIRC, one of them has Harry entering like 10 names into the goblet to cover up what he's trying to do.

** There are a few fanfictions that get into the idea to abuse Magical Contracts, because, as it seems, its supposedly super duper easy to get entered into one without knowing about it.

Some of those fanfictions feature an Voldemort that loses his magic due to not participating in the Triwizards Tournament - he usually dies because his body is a magical construct.

** There's one where Baby!Voldemort is put in the tournament, and one of the tasks -- the first task -- takes outside of Great Britain... I think Dumbledore's in the scene. Can't remember the name.

It is definitely a comedy.

** Hmm, in linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency, and Resistance of the Soul Bond), it is slowly revealed that Tom entered the tournament in the 40s using (polyjuice?) and it led to his eventual insanity.

Not quite what you are looking for, but its what I could think of.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

** Obsidian Pen on ao3 has a story with Grindelwald, dumbledore, Harry, and Tom as contestants. Its cross-generational, so they're all around the same age. But there's not a lot done on it. only like two chapters :(
