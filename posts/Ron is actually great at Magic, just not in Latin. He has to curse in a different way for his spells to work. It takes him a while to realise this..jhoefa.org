Being around Fred and George a lot, Ron grew up hearing a lot of swearing. Bloody Hell and bugger being the nicest ones he could get away with, not considered swearing to anyone but the old fashioned and traditional.

Struggling with the Levitation spell after Charms... "Why won't this fucking feather float!" cursed Ron, as the Feather began floating perfectly, just like Hermione's.

"AHH!" screamed Ron as he, Harry and Hermione ran from the Troll. "Why won't this fucking troll just explode!" suddenly, blood and guts covered the trio as the troll did just that.
