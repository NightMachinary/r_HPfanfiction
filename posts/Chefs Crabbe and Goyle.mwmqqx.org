Crabbe and Goyle are always portrayed as dumb half-trolls that are only good at being big and ugly, and I hate that.

I don't think they are stupid, I just don't think they care about things that don't interest them.

For a story I'm writing, I'm going to have a Slytherin Harry actually interact with them as humans and equals. They get to talking and Harry asks them what they want to do or like to do. They answer with helping their elves prepare food, so Harry helps them and gives them his support. Eventually, they become the best wizarding chefs in the world, and own a seven snitch restaurant that caters high class events.

Perhaps Crabbe prefers preparing desserts, whereas Goyle likes baking breads, and cooking hardy things like steak.

Just because they aren't interested in classes, and aren't described as being the best looking pair (despite their actors being rather attractive imo), doesn't mean they aren't people. They have likes and dislikes, interests and ambitions, and portraying them as idiots who can't count past 21 is insulting.

I bet most of you don't even know which is which, they're just Crabbe-and-Goyle, Malfoy's bookends, not Vincent AND Gregory, the TWO humans that get too much hate for things out of their control.

We've gotten a few Dudley redemption stories, and the three of them are rather similar. I think it's time we grow past our prejudice, and give Vincent and Gregory their time, even if it's just a single chapter or a lone one shot.

This is also a request for fics with a similar idea, where Crabbe and Goyle aren't just muscle. I read one awhile ago where they actually were rather good at runes and arithmancy respectively, but nobody gave them a chance.

Anyway, thanks for reading.

TL;DR- Crabbe and Goyle are human, and two separate entities. Treat them as more than just Malfoy's bookends.

** Vince and Greg? I've read quite a few stories where they are their own people. I tend to like them but they also tend to be forgettable.

Case in point...I can't name any of them.

I love forward to seeing what comes of this.

** I vaguely remember reading something where one of the two took up art classes when the school was 'reformed'. Just because he was academically weak didn't mean he had no other strengths. Unfortunately his family and wizarding society just didn't view them as valuable.

** Linkao3(the apple tree). It's a Snarry with an overly powerful Harry. They aren't the focus, but chapter 27 shows them being self aware and more than just guard trolls. I have plenty of issues with this story, but they are one of the aspects that I like.

*** It is one of my favourites, but I can agree he's a little overpowered, even though imo it's done well. What ARE some of these issues?

**** I think the tone is really off for a lot of the characters- they're much more old fashioned in their speech and formal. I find the focus on tradition (the mage things) to be really jarring, considering there's no canon indication that tradition was that highly valued. And they're not really explained- I think it's fine to create your own mythologies for fanfic, I just think it needs to be done better. Like, there's a weight room. Dumbledore apparently completely trusts him to run a class with no kind of supervision. There are just odd things shoehorned into the story. Also, the whole quidditch pitch scene has always sat very oddly with me, as well as the military out of left field.

The thing is, a lot of what I think this story does poorly is done excellently in The Marriage Stone (Harry being so much more powerful, higher in “hierarchy”, traditions, etc) - so it's not necessarily the topic or the angle, but the writing itself. Harry in this story is not the Harry of the books- which again, it can be done well to explain all the personality changes, but I don't think it's done well in this story. I think there's not enough ground work to accept some of the suppositions that are required to really get into the story.

***** Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Never really thought of it, at all, honestly. I really want to read "The Marriage Stone" but I hate and love WIP's, so I tend to wait until they are finished then read them.
