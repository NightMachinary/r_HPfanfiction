We've had a lot of discussions lately about things that annoy you in fanfics, make you quit reading, or are just dealbreakers right up front, but how about we come to the other side of the conversation? What are some of your favorite things that pop up regularly in fanfics?

Personally, I like a powerful, sarcastic Harry that manages to annoy people in power without them being able to counter him..

I also love political shenanigans(given the number of complaints I saw on the other posts, I'm weird).

I also like helpful goblins, but more than that, I like goblins that respect Harry for kicking ass.


** Fics where Ron is a good friend and is intelligent. Not sure if it's a trope, though.

*** So basically like Ron in the books.

*** It's refreshing when I read fanfics where this is the case, but if "Ron the Death Eater" and "Draco in Leather Pants" are tropes, then Ron being a good person is too.

**** It would probably fall under something like "Heterosexual Life Partners" or "True Companions".

** I like a cunning and smart Harry. Someone who doesn't rush into situations, someone who doesn't get riled up easily and has witty comebacks to insults

** Hogwarts 8th year, EWE, slow burn, enemies (to friends) to lovers, auror partners, professor Harry, Sirius and Remus raising Harry, MWPP era, soul mates, bonding, bring back Black.

***** Yeah that was probably the thing that bugged me most about the epilogue. Even the first time when I read the book in a single day, and should probably have been ready to sign off on anything.

They couldn't work her parent's names in somehow? I really like the Arthur Rubeus Potter name somebody on here suggested.

****** Exactly. Arthur probably was the best father figure Harry ever had. Hagrid was his first friend and he's still around to this day.

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.
