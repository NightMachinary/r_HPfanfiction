Seriously, is it 100% original, or is the pseudo-science rooted in the boundary between fiction and myth? Are there any reliable and accurate sources that can be used? How does one make it sound plausible, yet simultaneously pushing the boundaries?

Two noticeable examples of fanfics utilising magi-science would be The Mind Arts linkffn(12740667) and The Arithmancer linkffn(10070079). Not only are they superbly written but also explain, analyse, and break-down HP magic. Personally, I've always been one for "harder" magic systems, but what about you guys? Do you prefer the magic to be "soft" and whimsical in nature, or almost like a mixture of science and magic?


** I often pay homage to other works. For example I asked myself why wizards don't conjure flames inside of their enemies. This draws some parallels to Worm so I made reference to it (Manton).

My stuff on soul magic in linkffn(The Mind Arts) is taken from Semitic mythology.

My stuff for elemental abilities is taken from Hindu mythology.

For rituals I took a page from the book of Full Metal Alchemist. Sacrifice to gain something of equal value.

My stuff from potions comes from chemistry (slower temperatures slow down reactions, kinetics 101) and some ingredients I took from Skyrim (Jazbay grapes, and I did something with bees).

For wand movements I often figured that, on average, more powerful spells take longer to cast, it takes longer to gather and dispel the arcane, compared to a shorter wand movement which would produce a less powerful version of the same spell.

This is how Harry helped Tracey develop the magic “muscle memory” to cast a shield charm. Sort of like lifting a smaller weight until you are practiced enough to just let the magic flow by habit.

Different magical talents came from a list of psychic abilities, which I whittled down to a usable amount, with some balancing. For example, seeing the future can be maddening. (I also took from Greek Mythology in particular for seeing the future and, again, was inspired by Worm.)

I hope this helps.

** I reject the notion that going the quasi-scientific route is the only way to make magic "hard" (i.e. complex and detailed). There are plenty of non-scientific types of knowledge which can serve as an inspiration for a complex magic system, one which does not reduce to "it's magic, don't ask questions" but neither reduces to "magic is just physics that hasn't been discovered yet". See my new headcanon doc for an example of complex, non-scientific magic.

*** It's semantics, but I disagree with the assessment that /your/ purported magic system /isn't/ scientific. Science is not defined by looking sciencey and involving numbers; it's analysis of how the world works and recognizing the patterns the universe follows. In your magic's case, it so happens that those patterns are most efficiently described, not with numbers, but with human words; but as long as laws can be defined, as long as there is a coherent system that exists in the abstract, then its rigorous study /will/ be science.

**** As you say, this is largely semantics, and a huge area of debate besides (whole books have been written about the definition of science) but I disagree with your definition of science, which is far too broad. By that definition, stuff like Aristotle's physics would count as science (as opposed to philosophy).

Not all attempts to understand the world are scientific in nature. Not even all empirical methods are scientific. Science is not really capable of neat definition, but as a "loose predicate" it possesses a number of common features: systematic observation, mathematisation, social institutions to regulate accepted knowledge (such as the journal system/peer review), reductionism, unity, and symmetry, etc. Not all of these characteristics are present in all forms of science (string theory, for example, contains little to no observation) but science will typically display at least a few of them.

All that aside, the word "science" has two meanings in common use: a) the scientific method, as discussed above, b) the body of accepted scientific knowledge. In my post above, I was really referring to b.

** I don't like magic as science in the HPverse. I'm not saying it can't be done right, It obviously can, your recs are enough proof of that, and it isn't reason enough to ditch a fic to me. But I think you can do so much better than that.\\
I'd really like to see more fics with a very detailed and deeply thought out magic system that isn't a physics' rehash.\\
I think it's really better (although certainly a lot harder) to have a magic that operates in a very different way than what we know.\\
I'm not advocating for soft magic, but for hard magic that isn't even remotely comparable to physics.\\
For instance, I really like Taure's direction in Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/]]), even if we haven't seen much yet.\\
Think also of the ancient magic in Enembee's Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light]]), which isn't as much detailed as I'd like.

Outside of fanfics, this is one of the ggod things about some Xianxia, where the magic, although far too much formulaic, often succeeds at feeling really alien in the way it operates. see [[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/coiling-dragon]] for an example.

+The Mind Arts, which is wonderful fic (and certainly one of my favourite recent ones), is also a very good example of something I've really come to despise in HP fanfics and is very common in magic as science types of stories. It's constant use of magical exhaustion doesn't really creates the intended tension in the story, but rather a deep frustration in the reader (at least in my case). I think It would be far better off without it.+ Edit: I was actually thinking about a different fic.

Too often, it is implied you can either have a very detailed magic system or a very mysterious one. I disagree. I'm certain you can have the cake and eat it too, in this case, provided you're smart enough.

** The Arithmancer is really bad magic-wise though.

I have four sources of inspiration:

- Harry Potter media
- Other works of fiction
- Real life esoterics
- Myths and legends

For example in Agrippa's Three Books on Occult Philosophy it's said that:

#+begin_quote
  There are four Elements, and originall grounds of all corporeall things, Fire, Earth, Water, Aire, of which all elementated inferiour bodies are compounded; not by way of heaping them up together, but by transmutation, and union; and when they are destroyed, they are resolved into Elements. For there is none of the sensible Elements that is pure, but they are more or less mixed, and apt to be changed one into the other:

  Next after the four simple Elements follow the four kinds of perfect Bodies compounded of them, and they are Stones, Metals, Plants, and Animals: and although unto the generation of each of these all the Elements meet together in the composition, yet every one of them follows, and resembles one of the Elements, which is most predominant. For all Stones are earthy, for they are naturally heavy, and descend, and so hardened with dryness, that they cannot be melted. But Metals are waterish, and may be melted, which Naturalists confess, and Chymists [chemists] finde to be true, viz. that they are generated of a viscous Water, or waterish argent vive. Plants have such an affinity with the Aire, that unless they be abroad in the open Aire, they do neither bud, nor increase. So also all Animals Have in their Natures a most fiery force, And also spring from a Celestiall source. And Fire is so naturall to them, that that being extinguished they presently dye [die].

Now what is the law that tells us what is possible to do with transfiguration?

#+begin_quote
  Gamp's Law of *Elemental* Transfiguration
#+end_quote

But I wasn't a big fan of that type of body - element association so I ended with something like that (note, it's a very rough note):

#+begin_quote
  The school of transfiguration is based in theory that every object being composed from the mix of base elements: air, fire, earth, water, and aether with the transfiguration being able to manipulate the first four to change the object into another object and as the elements are Core Concepts the change is permanent. The inability to manipulate aether directly results in a limited influence on magical properties and makes creating actual magical materials impossible, and creation of some mundane materials with strong magical properties either very hard (silver) or outright impossible (gold). It also results in the impossibility of recreating virtues that aren't tied directly to material such as "foodness".

  An important part of transfiguration theory are four base types of bodies each consisted with a different element. The early theory associated them as follows: rocks - earth, metal - water, plants - air, animals - fire. But the fire association of animals, in fact, reflected the aetherical aspect of their life force and thus resulted in a high difficulty of animal transfigurations. To combat that the revised system was created where metal was associated with fire and water with animals.

** I think trying to give magic a scientific background or explanation cheapens it. It's /magic/, it's not supposed to have a perfect explanation.

That being said, it is interesting how authors manage to create things. As long as you are consistent and don't make anything too overpowered you pretty much have free reign.

*** One of the 'unofficial rules' of fantasy storytelling is that magic may only be as helpful to the protagonist as the rules themselves are understood by the reader. (see [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SoYouWantTo/WriteAFunctionalMagicSystem]])

If Gandalf could just wave his staff and set the entirety of Sauron's armies on fire, turn the Balrog into a kitten, or teleport the ring six inches above the lava inside Mount Doom, then why was there so much tension?

Instead, pretty much all he's allowed to do is counter Saruman/Sauron's magic, and [[http://engl393-dnd5th.wikia.com/wiki/Light][cantrips]].

Alternatively, The Dresden Files tells us magic has rules, and the rules must be followed (or consequences will be suffered) and Harry Dresden uses magic within those rules as a tool.

In Harry Potter, there's a strange middle-ground---we don't really know much about what magic /can't/ do, mostly because we don't know what magic /can/ do, and for either reason we never learn /why/. So we have to justify it /somehow/.

Even if the answer is "We don't know why."

**** It's strange that you use Gandalf to make this point, as we decidedly don't understand all the magic and metaphysics going on in Middle Earth. Gandalf remains enigmatic, yet powerful.

This is my problem with detailed magic systems, not that I don't love many books with them. Those who subscribe to Brandon Sanderson's philosophy and explain everything often kill the magic.

***** I... I don't understand what you're saying here. What's your point?

Gandalf doesn't solve hardly anyone's problems. His list of achievements:

1. He combats Durin's Bane
2. He heals Théoden
3. He drives away the Nazgûl
4. He guides the Fellowship through Moria
5. He takes Pippin to Gondor

He doesn't actually overcome the Balrog, he doesn't best Saruman in either fight, he doesn't transport some or all of the group with magic, and so many other things.

If he did, there would be no tension. It would be Deus Ex Machina.

Harry Potter magic isn't. They have to work for it---very few are shown to learn the spells quickly, and they /need/ a wand. Apparition is dangerous, and can be blocked. "You cannot Apparate within Hogwarts." There are dozens of /rules/ that /cannot/ be broken, whether the /why/ is ever explained or not.

And Harry Potter magic, because there are numerous rules and restrictions, /know/ what can and cannot be done. Magic stops being Deus Ex Machina and becomes yet another tool, another weapon.

****** My point is that we don't know the rules for Gandalf. We don't know the rules for Harry Potter. Though we know that both have rules and limitations we don't know what those are for the most part. I prefer this to fantasy where all the magic rules are laid out for the reader. I find that takes the feeling of magic away.

******* The thing is, we don't know these rules (although in the case of HP we know some of them) but we know the characters follow them. It's enough to be consistent. The system must be here (and coherent enought in the mind of the writer), it doesn't need, however, to be completely known by the reader.\\
Just how much you need to tell the reader really depends on how magic is used in the story.

I think one of the best examples of this is Alice in Wonderland. Very little is known about magic, everything verges on the absurd constantly and yet everything remains coherent. I think this is because L. Carroll himself knew perfectly well what was possible and what wasn't in this world. The system's there, even if it's only implied, and it's enough to make it work.

*** You might have a good point about cheapening it, but I (an I can only really speak for myself) do try to leave some mystery in some aspects of magic, particularly soul magic, to try and keep that alive.

The fact of the matter is, without a background, Magic has no rules. With no rules you're left with contradictions, and deus ex machina whenever you feel like it.

It makes lazy writing too easy of a habit to slip into. Sure there are those that pull it off, but I need rules and routine.

I feel like that is what makes a universe, no?

** I feel like my method for designing the magic system in the Arithmancer-Verse parallels the real scientific method. First, observe what happens in canon (or sometimes fanon); then, try to craft a theory that coherently explains those observations without causing too many other problems.

Taking transfiguration as an example, in canon, we see inanimate to inanimate (match to needle), animal to inanimate (beetle to button), inanimate to animal (teapot to tortoise), animal to animal (guinea-fowl to guinea-pig), human to animal (Draco to ferret), and human to human (Ron to "Dragomir Despard). Yet we also see that transfiguration /cannot/ create food, despite the fact that it can create animals. So my theory is that transfigured animals are not "real", but are merely constructs, which also makes sense since the caster would not be able to visualize all of the details of an animal's anatomy.

(We know that humans transfigured into animals lose their human minds, and yet Slughorn appears to transfigure himself into an armchair and retain his ability to change back, suggesting that this more of an illusion-type spell.)

We know that conjuration is not permanent (except for /Aguamenti/, apparently), but transfiguration isn't insanely dangerous due to not being permanent like it is in HPMOR, so it either is always permanent (which conflicts with the animals/food restriction), or there's some other effect that keeps it from being so dangerous. So my theory is that it's the second one; all transfiguration is a construct in some sense. Some of it is permanent, but some is not, depending on the specific spell. And notably, you can transfigure something that* look*s like food, but it transfigures back immediately if you try to eat it.

In canon, we see Hermione vanishing kittens. This seems bizarre on multiple levels. It's established that vanishing objects sends them in "non-being", destroying them, and it is very surprising that Hermione would kill kittens even for the sake of homework. It also seems too powerful for the story that you could theoretically kill a person just by vanishing them. Why wasn't it used on Barty Crouch Sr., for example? So my theory there is that vanishing does not work on true animals, but only on transfigured/conjured constructs. (There is some suggestion that vanished objects can be "rematerialized," but this is an even weirder dynamic that we never see used, and I really don't know what to make of it.)

This connects to the other part of my method: if anything would seriously break the story, it's not allowed. So you can't transfigure a nuke even if you know how to build one. This is sort of already there under the hood based on the observation that the world hasn't been destroyed by magical nukes yet.
