I have read several of these types of stories and always found them fascinating. I apologize for the long following explanation and if its too much simply skip the plot info.

--------------

An example of a couple loose plots:

A long time ago I read a HP story where he was never targeted by Voldemort and Voldemort won the first war. Harry ended up growing up in such an environment where Voldemort was in charge and pureblood politics had won out. There was a caste system, and HP was in a strong position in the world, and while not a Voldemort follower he still lived and worked within the world as it was without fighting it. He had married Daphne for political reasons and while they liked each other their positions allowed them to sleep around and live their own lives.

Recently I read another where HP grew up in the same type of world and although in this one Voldemort was dead, the Pureblood politics had won out and the Muggleborn were treated almost like House Elves, and there was a thriving slave scene (sexual or simply normal), within the Pureblood community. Harry was a teacher and still held respect within the Wizarding world and used his finances and influence to purchase Muggleborns or Halfbloods he knew who were bouncing around in the slave markets, who became his wives, consorts, or he simply protected/sheltered them.

--------------

In both these stories Voldemort or at least the ideas behind Voldemort and the Pureblood agenda had won out. Harry was not necessarily a target of Voldemort or at least was not a concern, and Harry, due to his families financial and past political power still maintained a high position within the society. He lived, worked, played, and survived within that world. It wasnt a world at war, but simply a world where the war had already been won, or simply where the Pureblood agenda had succeeded. In most of the stories he didnt really like the world he lived in, but it was what it was. And he wasnt exactly innocent within the world either. He had his vices, his pleasures, his needs, his wants. He certainly wasn't innocent little cannon Harry.

I have read several similar types of stories and always love to read AU stories from this perspective.

--------------

TL;DR bit:

So, please... recommend me anything similar. Stories where Harry lives within a world where the Voldemort/Pureblood side won or simply came into power (whether it was Voldemort himself involved or not) AU stories with some world building. Stories that may contain moral dilemmas for Harry but not to where they overwhelm the story being told. Non cannon type Harry stories.

No main character slash please. Mature ratings or higher preferred although Ill take any recommendations. I am not offended by much of anything (THIS IS WRITTEN FICTION FOLKS) so if it contains slavery, sex slavery, rape, torture, killing, main character deaths, very dark arts, or any other such things, that is not an issue. Completed or at least active Fics preferred of course, but length-wise I'm not picky. Included Romance and/or Lemons are preferred.

Thanks!


** A) Hook me up with the title of those two fics you mentioned you read?

2) Well, there's the abandoned linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom). It's a very, love it or hate it fic. I'm not really a fan, honestly. There's also linkffn(Champion by OctaviusOwl), also abandoned. And then there's the (probably abandoned) linkffn(The Magnate by Halt.CPM). Wow, I'm sensing a trend here.

*** linkffn(Reign of the Serpent) is a WIP being updated currently I've been enjoying. It has a unique AU with a similar presence to what you describe but not identical. Instead of Voldemort winning the 1st War the entire wizarding world changed when Salazar Slytherin came back to Hogwarts after his falling out with the other founders and violently attacked and overthrew them. A caste system is established and enforced with permanent tattoos. Serpents are the ruling pure bloods, in the middle lions are an officer warrior class and ravens are intellectuals while badgers are at the bottom. Muggle borns are tattooless and untouchables and forcibly removed from their families who are then obligated and are institutionalized. Girls are later sold to brothels while boys are sent to certain death on the front line. The militaristic culture is so intense by the HP era because at the same time as canon Grindewald became active. Instesd of beubg defeated he led a rebellion on the continent and the war is still going on along "the border". All the GO characters are there and the story follows Hermione as she is kidnapped becoming friends with Dean abd Justin and using the close to impossible exception for muggle horns to attend Hogwarts and become badgers if they an exam.

*** Sorry but no can do. One I read so long ago.. years and years that god knows what it was. I was half hoping it would be recommended so i could figure it out. The other was a story that started off with an interesting idea, and I was enjoying it but the author deleted it shortly after i stumbled on it on Archive of our Own. That's honestly what prompted me to come here in search of similar ones. I was having a blast reading it and wanted to find more like it after it was taken away (deleted) from me :(

So now I'm hoping to find something similar.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) fits your criteria, although its a more lighter take on the Voldemort won the first war trope. Pureblood politics are not that big of an issue in this, it does have lots and lots of wordbuilding though.

*** So this has been recommended twice now already. It looks insanely long and developed but its plot teaser is insanely short lol.

Mind giving me a little more details (without spoiling the plot of course) about the story?

It says Mentor Voldemort and that concerns me simply because ive read a lot of terrible Mentor Voldemort stories.

It also doesn't show any hint of romance (tags) or anything remotely similar which seems surprising in a fic that long.

Being that its abandoned I just dont want to waste time on a non finished story of that length if its not what I was interested in.

**** Yes, the summary on this fic is definitely not very informative, especially considering its scope and length. Lets see if I can describe this fic somewhat.

So the main idea is that Voldemort won the first war and build a sort of wizard society that tends to work surprisingly well even if is somewhat morally questionnable at times. Takes a while to really get going, but has lots and lots of plot lines and very immersive. Unlike the summary implies, someone does not die or gets maimed every chapter. The violence is mild most of the time and it is actually often fairly lighthearted with lots of humour, great dialogue, good characters and wordbuilding.

Muggleborns get taken away at a young age, get their memories mostly wiped and get adopted into wizarding families. Despite this, everything is mostly good for most people and most don't even focus on pureblood politics that much since no one really has any contact with muggles and everyone grows up in wizarding homes. Although it does come into play later as some people still don't like muggleborns very much. Harry's parents fled to Europe during the first war, but get killed in burglary accident so Harry ends up back in Britain anyways at like age 9 I think.

This fic has very good characters and likes to put a small twist to them so that you can still recognize them but see them in slightly different circumstances (Such as Luna and Sirius as werewolves since war prisoners sometimes get given to Fenrir to his colonies, Dumbledore as an antigonist who is still good, and yet works directly against Harry sometimes, and many more).

Voldemort is not really like in canon. He is like a mix of Tom Riddle and something else. Someone who can be very personable, reasonable, sane, a leader, but of course also at times completely ruthless and sociopathic. Harry is still very much good and stays good (although still a sarcastic, somewhat sassy and rebellious teen who always tries to do whats right) and has a sort of mentor reluctant student thing going on with Voldemort. Voldemort is often in the background dealing with politics and wizarding leader stuff and is not around that much, but occasionally he teaches Harry ancient magic and rituals that he knows and tries to get him involved in politics and put him out as his protege and a public face of wizarding Britain.

Here is a comment by Lucious about them which I think somewhat describes the occasional craziness of their interactions:

#+begin_quote
  Lucius considered that. Was that the secret to his Master's relationship with Potter? Friendship? If it was a friendship, then it wasn't like any Lucius had ever known before. They seemed quite near killing each other on several occasions and close as brothers on others; fighting and laughing and manipulating each other in equal measure. It was borderline deranged, and yet made a strange sort of sense.
#+end_quote

There is no main romance plot lines really. Harry is a teen who occasionally dates a few people and thinks about girls, but never gets into anything serious with anyone. There are a few background couples, but they are not really the main part of the fic and rarely mentioned. Snape has a type of romance mini plot thing going on with an OC, which I know sounds completely stupid but actually kind of works considering the context in which it takes place. Its mostly a very long fic following Harry's life and adventures through crazy situations and the lives of people around him. It is abandoned, but there are 6 completed books that have some self contained plot lines that get closure, although some main ones don't which sucks.

I do recommend checking it out. Like the other person mentioned who rec'd this fic, it can be polarizing and some people don't like it but I personally love it so I definitely think you should check it out and see if that is something you want to read. One thing to note though is that a lot of the really well done world building and politics and crazy scope doesn't come in until later in the fic, but its still a very enjoyable read.

***** Thanks a ton for such a detailed response. It does sound like the sort of thing I would have a love/hate relationship with. I LOVE good world building and AU stories. I also enjoy stories that step far outside the bounds of cannon and yet retain the core connections. That said, its disappointing that the story has no true Romantic subplot with regards to the main character/s, nor does it appear to have any sort of over-arcing goal but rather is more about simply following the journey Harry takes.

Ive already put it on my Kindle to read sometime soon, but like i said at the start, Its sounding like one of those fics that I will read and enjoy, but also hate because of what "could be" but isnt with regards to the fic.

****** Be prepared to invest a large amount of your free time into reading Prince of the Dark Kingdom. That story hooked me, and it's one hell of a long one. I can read around 1k-1.5k words a minute on a good day, yet it took me nearly three works to finish it, despite the fact I devoted a shitload of time to it.

It's an amazing story, and if you are willing to put in the time, it's worth doing so. Hope you like it.

** One of my stories might qualify, "THe Dark Lord Never Died". It's an AU where Lucius Malfoy faked Voldemort's survival after Halloween 1981, and took over Britain. He raised the muggleborns as his Janissary guard and prepared for the return of Voldemort - since he wasn't about to give up his power. Dumbledore and his allies went into exile in France, and Harry was raised by Sirius and went to Beauxbatons.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

Because of him, non-purebloods aren't able to attend Hogwarts, which is the basis for the story. There are three completed lengthy "books", with a (hopefully) temporary hiatus on the fourth.
