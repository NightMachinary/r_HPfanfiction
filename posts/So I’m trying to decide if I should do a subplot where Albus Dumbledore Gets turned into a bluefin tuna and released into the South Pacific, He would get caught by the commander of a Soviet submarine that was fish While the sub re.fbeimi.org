There would probably be a few chapter As the child who accidentally turned Dumbledore into a fish Sneezes at the perfect time And he turns back into a Wizard , Unfortunately directly in front of the captain of the Submarine. Dumbledore Have to spend a few days evading the Soviet crew, So they don't interrogate him using a technique disturbingly called “the rice pudding Interlude”. Dumbledore is able to escape Relatively unscathed but he will be haunted for a while By the fact the captain kept referring to him as Susan. Without any explanation.

I'm thinking of calling it, Dumbledore's undersea adventures.

He gets stuck on Easter Island For a few days after that.


** You won't find many Soviet Subs in the South Pacific, if any. They had no reason to be there and no nearby bases for air cover, support vessels and supply.

Maybe relocate your plot to the Bering Strait to avoid that issue.
