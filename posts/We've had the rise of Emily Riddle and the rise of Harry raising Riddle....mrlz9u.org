:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
...But I've yet to come across a single fanfic where Harry raises a Fem!Riddle. And now I long for Harry adopting a troublesome daughter and doing his best raising her, teaching his daughter some love and familial safety. He might have to settle for sociopathical possessiveness.

Does anyone know such a fic? I've searched but nothing has come up so far.

(PS, your favourite regular Harry-Raises-Tom-Riddle fics are appreciated too.)


** Does Voldemort's anagram change when he is now a femvoldemort? Or do they just skip the whole anagram thing to begin with?

*** Most of the ones i've seen just skip the whole anagram part - the options to make a well-working female anagram name from that set are rather limited after all. But what I enjoy from good FemVoldemort fics is that they alter the motivations, angles and persona enough in a believable way, making for a more complex character. Usually, the name Voldemort is indeed only that, a name, and a tool to be used.

*** No, but it doesn't matter, not at all.

Limpieza de Sangre - from which the name Emily Riddle originates - is quite amazing, especially in handling Emily and her motivations.

If you haven't read it, please do give it a try.

It is not a stretch to say that this is one of the genre-defining stories for HP fanfiction, and it already inspired many more stories.

**** I don't actually like gender bent stories unless it is to add representation through the LGBT stories. If they just change for no reason, the I generally won't read because I just don't like it.

***** I wasn't too fond of changing the gender but nothing else stories either. But in voldemorts case, it seems to help in creating a more compelling and complex anatagonist.

Thats why I'm curious if there's a harry raises girl riddle fic.

*** If the the fic doesn't have adult Dark Lady Femdemort, I don't see needing the anagram thing unless you want to introduce it as a gag.

*** linkao3(22820401) goes the other way entirely - Merope was completely delirious when giving birth, and the midwife dutifully noted the name down exactly as said. Her name is identical to canon Voldemort's.

**** Is it?

I can say that I never actually decided on a name for Voldemort in UP because, ultimately, it's unimportant. Voldemort isn't one to let herself be defined by who she was born as, nor does she want others to judge her for it.

Ultimately, the reader can choose to believe that Voldemort's birth name is whatever makes the most sense to them, but it won't be important to the story.

***** Huh. I took the whole dancing around the unfortunate first name to that degree to be tacit acknowledgement of the canon name. I appreciate the whole "deadname" deal she has going on (having a previous "name that does not exist" myself).

****** Yeah, same. It is rather easy to draw trans allegories to Voldemort, though in this case I went with a more symbolic approach of her not wanting to be defined by her past identity.

  Not all wars are black and white, as Harry learns when the second war with Voldemort seems to be painted in nothing but shades of grey. In which Harry is confused, Tonks is overwhelmed, Barty is a genius, Snape hates everyone, Dumbledore is trying his best, and Voldemort is having the time of her life. fem!Voldemort
