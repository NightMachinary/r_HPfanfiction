** I think Hagrid shouldn't be fat because of all the manual work he does. If anything, he should at least have the shape of the big guy in Moana and not have a belly.

*** Maybe, but I didn't say he was fat. Robes are really very concealing and his beard and hair hide a lot of his face and upper chest. I can just imagine him taking off his outer robe to tame a huge magical beast after it gets torn for the class, then the class is stunned by his immense physique

**** Oh no. I didn't say you thought or said so. In fact, I agree with you that Hagrid would be muscled. It's just that many fanfic writers take after the movies appearances and describe Hagrid as being fat or such (I don,t remember for the books, probably just described as big/tall.
