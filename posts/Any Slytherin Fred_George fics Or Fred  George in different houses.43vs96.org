Not read anything twin-centric before, and think it could be good. Any suggestions?


** To clarify, when you write Fred/George in the title, do you mean a Fred & George ship?

**** You shouldn't be. X/Y usually signifies a ship or X or Y, using it instead of & is just strange

** linkffn(Why Can't it be a Joke by bballgirl32). Fred and George go back in time to interrupt Aberforth and Grindelwald's argument. Their presence means Ariana doesn't die, and when they come back to their own time they find that the world is ruled by Dumbledore and Grindelwald, and the Weasleys are their evil supporters and muggleborns are slaves.

Since the traditional Hogwarts Houses have been replaced with two new houses -- 'Dumbledore' and 'Grindelwald' -- I suppose this counts as alternate sorting too.

The writing is rather mediocre, but it does have some interesting plot points.

  Fred and George end up back in time, break up the fight that would've killed Ariana Dumbledore, then watch Albus and Grindelwald leave without realizing just how much they've changed until they return to a twisted future. More detailed summary inside.
