I've always been curious about the differences between life in Hogwarts and Durmstrang.


** Check out Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. A good durmstrang fic but not finished. Updated still but usually only once a year.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** Linkffn(When a Veela Cries)

Warning, everybody fucking dies in the beginning. And probably later on.

Harry doesn't go to Durmstrang until a while into the story though.

  A tale of rage and revenge, of loss beyond what any person should have to bear . . . and a tale of love, Harry's only hope out of the darkness.

** linkffn(9939304)

It's.. alright. Worth trying out at least.

Fairly AU.

Sirius takes Harry and leaves the country. Narcissa is a good person, she leaves as well, taking Draco with her. She marries Viktor Krum's dad. Harry, Draco, and Viktor are raised as brothers - and they're the same age.
