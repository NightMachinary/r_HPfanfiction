Hi,

I was wondering if any of you have any song recommendations that go with Severus and Hermiones relationship.

Something like (and an example of my taste) Dark Times by The Weeknd or Secret Love Song, Pt 2 by Little Mix

Nothing that's scream-o or super dark rock, please.

Thank you.


** If I were writing a Snape/Hermione story, I'd probably be listening to Nine Inch Nails the whole time.

** Given the nature of the few Hermione Snape stories I had the questionable pleasure to read, I'd recommend something along the lines of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7LhvlzD3Ug][this]], or something equally cliche-BDSM-y.

Though I read one fic in which Hermione dies and her ghost falls in love with Snape, which was a very sweet story. For that one, I'd give something like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eisW0skJ9fU][this]].

** I read a short "the dark side won" story based on The Man In The Long Black Coat by Joan Osborne. That song is perfect for it

** Snape/Hermione is my OTP, so I read/write them often.

I tend to find there are more songs which put me in mind of Snape than Hermione though.

It's usually the lyrics that get me, so even if the tune is perky (like the Frank Turner number), the words are what have me make the connection.

The first is pretty loud so it may not be to your taste but it comes from an era and place when in the muggle half of Snape's life it would have been prominent, and the words are just bang on.

Here are my top picks:

Paranoid - Black Sabbath

Guilt - Hurts

Somebody to die for - Hurts

Too much love will kill you - Queen

Losing Days - Frank Turner

Too much blood - The Gaslight Anthem
