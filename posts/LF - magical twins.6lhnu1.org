Looking for anything where the idea of twins having unusual abilities is a big factor. Gred and Forge -centric is a bonus, even bigger bonus if there are negative superstitions related to magical twins. Not fussed about pairings if that's relevant , het/slash/twincest/poly, it's all good. I love novel-length fic that I can really settle down with, but beggars can't be choosers!


** There was a bit of that in the Pureblood pretense series. F and G had similar auras or something therefore they could do things that are specific to a person's magical signature. But that's about it.

I have actually been thinking about it myself recently.

** There was one where they shared the same soul. It was a minor plot point, and it was because someone hit Molly with a curse during the war, meant to kill the baby. Instead of killing it, it split the baby into two parts, and they were twins with the same soul. Only Harry could tell them apart.

** Twins were automatically 'mated' to each other in the firebird trilogy. It's mentioned as an aside.

Charissa Potter gets betrothed to a twin who shares his soul/consciousness with his sister in the last chapter or two of linkffn(the long game by inwardtransience).

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)
