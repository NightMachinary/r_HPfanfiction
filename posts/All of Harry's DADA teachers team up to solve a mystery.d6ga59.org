** I'm picturing a whodunit like Clue or something, set on a faculty retreat. Like it's a team building exercise and somebody dies and they're all trying to figure it out.

** If you include Carrow from year 7 then there's 4 death eaters and 3 non death eaters. Umbridge follows whoever is in power and Lockhart is a criminal, so Remus is the only good guy.

*** That's why I wanted Quirrell and Crouch to hide it. And also why I left out Carrow, who never taught Harry and is basically just another generic Death Eater.

*** Maybe that could indicate the kind of a setting would it have to be - Afterlife? I've been watching a bit of The Good Place- it could have a similar premise, but with Remus being sent to the Bad Place by mistake and being grouped with the other 6. But than it would be hard to make Crouch act as Moody, the only way it could work would be as his eternal punishment.
