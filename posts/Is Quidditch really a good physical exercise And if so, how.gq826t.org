There are so many fics that portray Quidditch players like they have bodies of a Greek god. I wonder if there is any merit to this trope.


** I imagine a lot of core strength is necessary to stay on the broom with all the manoeuvres the players have to perform in a game. Then you need additional strength as a chaser and beater especially. I imagine the best teams would do whatever necessary to get better, including getting fit. The overall effect of training (better concentration and focus, mental and physical endurance, less risk if injury etc) is probably not well-known in a society like the wizarding world, but pro athletes would probably know. On school level maybe not so much.

** Going at high speed though sharp corners require muscle to hang onto the broom and such without falling off

** Core strength just to stay on the broom for extended periods of time, then there's muscle training on certain parts depending on your position, arms for beaters, chasers, and probably keepers.

For seekers more core strength because they have to do some crazy maneuvers so compound exercises IMO. Maybe arm to catch the snitch.

I wager they all do a full routine of basic physical training to keep in shape and have good stamina(because spending hours gripping a broom while flying must cause some strain at least), so maybe all this muscle definition comes from that.

I would wager they at least burn a lot of calories just from flying on the brooms and having to stay on them for long periods of time with little rest.

** I like to think quidditch is a mix of horse riding + basketball + bar gymnastics.

** Yes, because of inertial forces. The brooms are going at very high speeds, and since the players accelerate all the time (changing direction will cause acceleration), they're subjected to a lot of inertial forces. Core strength has to be through the roof.

When you take into account that every player other than the Seeker uses just one hand to grip the broom, this makes that arm incredibly strong.

The other arm is used to throw the Quaffle, make saves and beat the Bludger, which strengthens the other arm.

Chest, shoulders and back would be trained as well, if only to provide that extra bit of power. Legs don't get a lot of training though.

*** Legs may get a lot of training too depending on what role they accomplish in broom-riding. If they act as an additional means of keeping the body on the broom, then they could well be extremely well-toned as well since relaxing the leg muscles would loosen the body's hold on the broom in flight, which could have disastrous implications when performing pin-point turns or other manoeuvres.

And considering the 3 dimensional nature of the sport, having leg muscles strong enough to keep the body from slipping off when the broom is pointed ground-wards could mean the difference between life and death, so the average Quidditch player would spend a lot of time getting them to that standard. Not that there's much for Hogwarts Quidditch players to do, since every day going to class seems to be leg day thanks to all the stairs they have to climb and descend.

If, however, the legs merely act as an additional means of controlling the broom, then they would be less toned as their role is a lot less demanding. Whether additional training is needed to avoid making the players look like spinning tips as a result would depend on the image consciousness or degree of leg-body dissonance experienced by the player.

** At the very least beaters would be fairly muscular and would have to train, I'd say.

** Considering that they often have to hold on one handed while catching and throwing a ball or swinging a bat, plus they do loops, hang upside down, and other types of maneuvers, I could see how they'd get fit. They also describe maneuvers like standing in their brooms and such during some of the crazier plays. It's kinda like being a gymnast combined with being a rugby player.

** It depends on if there are charms on the brooms to help you maintain your balance. And I'm sorta leaning towards there being some because otherwise staying on a broom going even 40kmh would be excessively difficult.

Of the positions, the only ones I'd imagine would actually need muscle strength rather then reflexes are beaters.

However, in most sports, you have general exercise regimes, so I don't see why Quidditch teams wouldn't have some.

**** I wonder how much of that has to do with the fact that he was chronically underfed while developing and is repeatedly referred to as scrawny. Lack of body size and strength is going to mean that exercise of any kind is going to be hard. Plus Oliver Wood is a maniac so I could see him going too hard at workouts.

*** I think it's more like perching. So you need to be actively holding on to a moving thing and keeping balance and throwing or hitting things. Also in the movies it always seemed like they had to â€˜pull up' whenever they wanted the broom to go up so I guess there's a lot of core strength involved

** Depends. If the fic assumes, it's a struggle to control and stay on top of the brooms then sure it would be a workout but if it's not that difficult to control and stay on top of the broom then obviously not.

More important question is why does everyone forgets Harry Potter world is a world of magic and thus does not require wizards to do physical exercise to be in Adonis levels of shape?

If there is a potion that recreates and/or repairs bones then there is no reason to not assume there could very well be a potion that works all the muscles in the body exactly the right amount each time it is drank.

** I think it depends on the type of practices. If the captains make the team run around the pitch and do calesthenics as part of the training, then it can tone the muscles. While the game itself may not seem to be very good all-around exercise, the players must be ATHLETES to do well.

Think of a keeper as similar to a soccer/futbol/footie goalie: he doesn't run around much during the game, but needs to be in shape to be effective at his position. The chasers essentially play basketball while balancing on a broom, which makes me think of the Olympic sport where they shoot rifles from skis in terms of an equivalent (keeping your balance while aiming accurately). Beaters are basically playing tennis on broomstick with IRON balls (no innuendo intended). Seekers I think are analogous to motorcycle racers.
