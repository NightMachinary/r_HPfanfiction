** One of the biggest things I'm looking forward to with this update is the reduced number of barely related tags being put on stories.

Before this update, AO3 didn't really have an exclude tag, so authors would just fucking 'ping ping ping ping' as many tags onto their story as they could, for more exposure.

Now, though? Better not tag your story for something barely related, or you'll hit someone's exclude tag for something tiny they probably wouldn't have cared about.

*** -"m/m" in the side bar should do it, or -"character a/character b" or just select gen or f/m, this is weird, I've never had a problem including or excluding anything up until now, ao3 has a pretty straight forward and encompassing search system, miles ahead of ffnet if anything, so I don't really understand what the big deal is

**** If you do -m/m it doesn't matter, there's still a million Harry/Draco stories that slip through the filter for some reason.

***** I'm pretty sure it's because of the Multi tag. Either way, you add -99 , -1600, and -1110 to get rid of the Drarry, Snarry, and WolfStar.

******* I don't think there's a list, but to find them, you hover over the RSS Feed button on a ship's page and look at the bottom. That number is the ID, -ID and you're set.
