I was reading Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome, and thinking of Hogwarts Battle School and was wondering if there were many more fics that feature a Hogwarts with a very different style to teaching or different subjects offered. Thanks!


** Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic featured a very different magical world, but it hasn't updated since 2011 so I don't expect another update

  Massively AU. Assume nothing. Harry Potter is born into a very different world than the one in canon. A world where the Greats of history walk among mere men. A world where power is all that matters, and young Harry Potter is a commodity desired by many.
