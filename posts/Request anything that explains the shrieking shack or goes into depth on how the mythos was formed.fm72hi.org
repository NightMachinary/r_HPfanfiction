Would prefer it to not be because of remus but even if it's that it would be fine. I remember reading one fic where it's stated that it was haunted pre remus--an entire 3rd year ravenclaw class died there


** The thing about it being Remus is actually canon IIRC?

*** I know, but I'd like to see how the mythos formed from the perspective of a bystander
