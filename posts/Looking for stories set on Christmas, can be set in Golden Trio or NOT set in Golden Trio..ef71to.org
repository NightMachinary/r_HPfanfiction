Would rather not have OP Harry Potter. Not have Harem Harry or Lord Potter-Malfoy-Gryffindor

Would rather not have Dumbledore and Weasley bashing. Or Bashing in general.

Would rather not Have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash


** Hmm, a christmas story set /in/ the Golden Trio would be a bit hard to find :P

*** Challenge Accepted:

Luna had decided to live among the muggles for a few years to see how they lived. What better way than to see what they teach?

Interested in their schools but not willing to be a student she had used some magic. Mainly confundus and compulsion charms, to give herself a position in a local middle school.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Her class was legendary as she took then to space to study the planets, the ocean depth for sea life and so many more wild adventures.

Still biology class was coming up and so was Christmas. She missed her friends and sent Christmas invitations to see her class Christmas field trip.

Of course they had been portkeys and her students had been nabbed before waking up. It was a Christmas surprise after all.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Liberal use of shrinking charms had made teaching biology class easy. They had also cleaned up some problems they found along the way.

Practical lessons and a free health care event for her friends. Best Christmas present ever!
