Either one works, give me some fics where the Dursleye are redeemed (it doesn't have to be all of them mind you it can be 1, 2 or all 3) or get their Comeuppance for how they treat Harry.

** The Perfectly Normal series doesn't /redeem/ them, as such, but it makes them into reasonable, realistic human beings instead of one dimensional caricatures. They have a civil and relatively sane, if still cool, relationship with Harry. ffn(The Definition of Normal by BrilliantLady)

The ffn(Blood of the Phoenix) series actually redeems them, and the later fics include Harry meeting them for dinner occasionally.

** Linkffn(8864658) or By Baker Street I Sat Down and Wept by Deco

This one has Petunia stepping up to the plate to be a better parent to both Dudley and Harry. There's a lot of world/magic development in this, it's very good but still ongoing (I'm only about 3/4 through of what's published, I tend to jump between stories a lot when I read).

Just a note, it is serveritus(which i've noticed some on this sub-reddit don't like) but it's written completely different from any other severitus fic I've ever seen.

  That's some serious prejudice against ao3.
#+end_quote

With good reason. When you have a tag like "underage sex" on your site you need to start thinking where you went wrong. I don't mind smut and/ or kinks (even if I don't understand some of them) as long as it's consenting adults doing it. But I absolutely refuse to read the wet dreams of some pedophile.

I suppose it could be used in a real story with tones like psychological thriller and horror. But then the author should focus more on the consequences and punishing the rapist than the act itself. Unfortunately, there are too many fics that just read like some sort of twisted fantasy that focuses only on the rape itself.

So yes, I am 100% prejudiced against AO3. If they clean up their shit they would get many more visitors.

***** Seriously? You'll accept rape in a story only if it fits your idea of where it is acceptable and where it's not? Otherwise it's just a "twisted fantasy"? Ao3 like any other such site is a place of expression and I don't believe it's fair to tell people what they can and cannot post. Just because it's not for you, doesn't mean that the story doesn't have an audience.

You said it yourself, that you don't mind kinks. It's not any different. Because people might just enjoy reading certain type of fiction(sexual or otherwise) but then have no interest in doing it in real life. It absolutely doesn't mean that ao3 is full of real life child molesters.

One can argue that the existence of a certain type of information in free access can give impressionable people ideas. But if you look at it that way, then you could ban almost anything. For example, I think that after the release of "13 reasons why" the number of suicides increased. Does that mean that it should be banned? People kill other people in movies/books/fanfiction all the time, is it any less immoral than rape? Most fics have a crucio used at least once, which is a torture curse, let's delete those fics as well.

Ao3 has an amazing(at it's core) tag system. Yes, it gets abused quite often and some fics get over tagged or undertagged. But it's main function is to tell you if the story has a concept that offends or triggers you or is simply not your kind of story.\\
So in contrast to you I respect ao3 for not "cleaning up their shit" like so many other sites do. They could implement a way to completely exclude certain tags(and not have us do it every time we search for something), so that some people can tailor the site to their own dislikes.

I understand, that my opinion is perhaps an unpopular one and I have no intention to attack you, but I also think that ao3 doesn't deserve the hate it gets and wanted to defend it.
