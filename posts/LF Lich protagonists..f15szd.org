Horcruxes aren't really phylacteries, I don't think, not if they don't hold the entire soul. So, any stories with actual liches? Doesn't even have to be a Harry Potter fic, so long as it's of good quality.

Linkffn(12405748)

It's abandoned / unfinished, but it's the closest I've found. I've been searching for fics like this for ages. All I want is full on lich Harry vs Voldemort and everyone is creeped out by undead necromancer Harry, but it's a sparse trope.

#+begin_quote
  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.

** He's not a protagonist, but there's a prominent lich in linkfp(Mother of Learning), which was recently completed (epilogue coming this weekend). Not HP, but it is about a teenager going off to a magical boarding school.

  Zorian, a mage in training, only wanted to finish his education in peace. Now he struggles to find answers as he finds himself repeatedly reliving the same month. 'Groundhog Day' style setup in a fantasy world.
