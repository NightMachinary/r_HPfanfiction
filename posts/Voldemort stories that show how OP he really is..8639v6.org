I'm looking for stories centred on Voldemort, and show how OP he is. Powerful wandless magic before even knowing what magic is, parselmouth(whether just as a useful spying tool, or fanon's parselmagic), incredible knowledge of magic, created his own magic(including, but not limited to, flight, mordsmore, dark mark, etc...), achieved a form of immortality, and a whole host of other things i'm sure i'm missing.

I'm just sick of stories with Voldemort that either focus on, relationships(that are almost always slash between either Harry, Snape, or a Malfoy(I don't mind slash, but only when it's BELIEVABLE)), redemption(which again, without time travel, NOT BELIEVABLE), time travel where, because he's now being raised by "insert name here" he's not as powerful as he was, and there's now some other dark lord(which again, unless done well, is NOT BELIEVABLE), or a multitude of other reasons.

I'd prefer stories to either be over 60k words, or complete, or really good that you can forgive it's word count, or updated very recently, or regularly.

Thanks,

Warryn.


** linkffn(The many deaths of Harry Potter) has a believably OP Voldemort IIRC and it is complete.

*** Yeah, but it's a slash with Harry Potter. I want an in canon Voldemort, which means a Voldemort that even with 100% of his soul, he cared very little for relationships.

****** Sorry, I was thinking of again, and again. It has the premise of multiple repeats, and I 'looked before I leaped', so to say.

On another note, does it focus on Voldemort, because that's mainly what i'm looking for. If it's focused on someone else, it will be difficult not to get caught up with their drama/plot.

******** Cool, but i'm looking for a fic that focuses on Voldemort. There are plenty with him doing truly horrible things, and having truly horrible power, but I haven't found one where we focus on him as the MC. At least without romanticizing it somehow.

** Once I'm done with /Parselmouth/, one of the stories I want to write is a strange, unexpected crossover where 1970's Voldemort is stranded alone in said crossover's setting and proceeds to utterly wreak it.

Morsmordre is the spell used to conjure the dark mark in the sky, its not the dark mark itself. which allows him to summon his death eaters.

**** I may be wrong, but I believe that part of what makes it such a complex spell is that the same /Morsmordre/ spell can be used to cast the Dark Mark in the sky, /or/ to brand a follower with the tatoo-version.

***** we have no reason to assume that its the same spell, or even that Morsmordre is even a complex spell. Of course you decide what your head-canon is, but I dont see the point in creating a spell for two entirely different purposes when death eaters themselves are not even supposed to brand other people. Voldemort would have to create a spell with two entirely different purposes, making it harder for himself and his followers who are not even supposed to use both of the purposes.

******** Don't know what your reading, but here.

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Mark]]

While the spell may be different(which we don't know) they are both the 'Dark Mark'. It's the same image, just glowing. Like I said, while they may be the same/different spell, they both represent the same thing. You believe what you wish, because i'm not going to continue to debate on such a small thing. Their both the dark mark, whatever you believe, this is one thing that is fact.

*** Not really. Morsdmore is a spell that every death eater seems to know, while the dark mark is a creation of Voldemort's, and only he can cast it since it seems to link the death eaters to Voldemort. It's a brand for the most loyal of his death eaters. Technically they're the same, but the casting of it is different, and how it works is different too.
