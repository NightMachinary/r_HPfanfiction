*Yes*, I'm aware that it's a ridiculous concept. It would be like Fenrir Greyback joining the Order (which I would also totally read).

I enjoy ridiculous concepts from time to time because in order for a ridiculous story to be good, the author has to work their ass off creating story lines that make it believable.

That takes a lot patience and skill.

*I'd also accept recs for anything that at face value seems ludicrous, but makes complete sense when reading*

Edit thanks everyone! Upvoted you all

They say you always have a choice and I had chosen. I would fight! I was ready to face life with all its ups and downs. I would follow the path of a warrior, not popular but necessary. I had been part of the war for years. Was I, Hermione Granger, a good person and would I still be good after everything was done? Dark

** I don't have anything but wanted to tell you it's not such a ridiculous idea. According to JK, Voldemort tried to recruit anyone that he found useful. That's why he tried to recruit Lily as well. I don't think that, as a half-blood, he has many qualms about who joins him. The whole blood purity is just a story he sells to his inner circle, just like he promises more souls for the Dementors and protection from wizards to the giants or fresh meat for the werewolves.

*** You're totally right, I was thinking about it from a reader perspective where we know Hermione's personality and morals. From Lord Voldemort's side, I'm sure he thinks with enough motivation, he can have anyone. He got Peter Pettigrew after all ðŸ˜–

#+begin_quote
  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.
