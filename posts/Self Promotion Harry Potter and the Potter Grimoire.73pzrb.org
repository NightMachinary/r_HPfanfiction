Hello yall... I am actually super nervous here, because while I have written before, it was complete trash. I have been sitting and writing and editing this story for the last year and well... im around 16k words published. So.

Feedback? Do you think its terrible? I am not going to stop writing it, as I already started the next chapter, and I have visions of each portion, but I would still like some feed back

** My number one turn off for stories is the questioning lilt in the description. Just tell me what makes your story interesting. I get tired of reading those questions that only have one realistic answer.

"Will you be reading Goblet of Fire or will Harry honor his roots?"

Like. We get it.

Just giving my first impression! I'm ganna start reading. <3

** So you've got a lot of cool ideas here, and I can read the enthusiasm in your writing throughout. I'm a sucker for AU stories with deep lore that spans family secrets and forbidden magic, etc., as are many others. Jumping off at GoF is an interesting decision, too - lots of potential for character development and worldbuilding there, so I assume that was your rationale.

In terms of constructive criticism, I guess there is one glaring issue: the infodumps. I get that you've got a lot of lore to unload on the readers, but presentation is key. Right now, each new piece of info regarding grimoires, family magic, and the like is delivered akin to a lecturer reading straight from a textbook.

You're dispensing important information, yes, but you're also telling a story, so immersion for the reader is just as crucial. At the moment, your lore is undermining everything else - dialogue and characterisation most of all:

[[/spoiler][Malfoy instantly treats Harry differently because he has some book, but according to this AU, he always knew that Harry would get that book. Ron seems to know about the Rites an Heir can invoke at Hogwarts, but Sirius barely knew anything about grimoires when he was at Hogwarts according to his letter. Most confusing of all is where you mention that family magic is no more powerful than other kinds of magic, but Harry's ancestor proceeds to use a "family magic amplification spell" to beat a wizard who would've creamed him otherwise.]]

Your ideas are great, but if you're telling a story and trying to build a lifelike world, you need to exercise restraint and focus on the fundamentals. Best of luck!

** Your summery was good until that last bit. Instead of:

Will Harry show the world why the Potters were one of the most Respected families? Or will he buckle under the strain?

I would say:

Now Harry will have the chance to remind the Wizarding World why the Potters are so respected. And feared.

or something like that

** Full on nitpicking mode? Full on nitpicking mode. Note that I wrote those comments as I read.

1. Title - that repetition is annoying. Even Harry Potter and the Family Grimoire would be better.

2. Description.

#+begin_quote
  When the TriWizard Tournament is opened at Hogwarts, and Harry's year is made more dangerous, he must make the choice of if he would continue as he was, or honor his roots.
#+end_quote

This sentence is ungrammatical and ugly besides. Rewrite.

#+begin_quote
  Will Harry show the world why the Potters were one of the most Respected families?
#+end_quote

*respected

Also "used to be" would work better here.

1. First chapter

#+begin_quote
  He must deliver his package
#+end_quote

*He had to

Your writing is clunky and rife with grammatical mistakes and I'm too lazy to nitpick everything. If possible try to find a beta, having someone point to you detailed problems with your writing should help immensely in improving it.

#+begin_quote
  just as we will never understand technology
#+end_quote

That's stupid and doesn't make much sense considering that wizards adapt technology to their use when they see fit. Unless your AU suddenly removed Wireless, cameras, Express, etc.

The whole introduction is terribly cringy in its preachiness. Also, how does the blood in their motto plays with "Yet family does not mean those of blood"?

1. Second chapter

Grimoires and family magic are clearly presented as something widely known, so Sirius even being a rebel he was should know more about them. Hermione should also encounter some mentions of them when reading various books even if she was short on details.

Also, you seem to be limiting understanding to "know what you want to do", if that's the case and you just need to know what you want to do, want to do it and focus on doing it, then what are those seven years of charms and transfiguration for?

Also, Harry is too quick to just accept everything said in Grimoire, there should be a slower shift, there should be some conflict between what he thought and what he reads. As it stands it's a blatant plot device to quickly skill up Harry and give him a quick character change.

Ok, the change in Draco's behaviour was absolutely retarded. Harry was always a Potter even if he didn't have a Grimoire. There was no respect in his behaviour though. There was also no respect between Arthur and Lucius and I assume that this AU doesn't change that, or there would be no surprise now.

The speech rule is another thing that doesn't make a lot of sense - if there were such thing, they would probably encounter a speech in one of their previous years.

Dark Lord was Voldemort's personal chuuni title. The "genericising" like having it be commonly used (similar case is giving everybody Order's custom skill of using patronuses to really messages) is something you should avoid unless it plays into the changed logic of the AU, which doesn't seem to be a case here.

The story already shows that you handle combat badly. The thing is that canonically they are pretty quick and one hit usually decides a whole fight. While there aren't many interesting duels in the series itself, this framework allows for dynamic, high-tension fights. Having three-hour fights with people hitting each other multiple times make them lose their impact.

For all that talk about family magic not being better than other kinds it sure seems overpowered in the story.

I think this is enough for now. Ignoring even the problems with the content, as it stands the story is in the state in which it should never be published. Instead of writing more you should get back and fix stuff like sentence structure, repeated words, inconsistent capitalisation, misspellings, descriptive beats that don't fit what was said, etc.
