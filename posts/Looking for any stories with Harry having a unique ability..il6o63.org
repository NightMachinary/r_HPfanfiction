** In canon, Harry is the only person to cast spells with his wand without actually holding it. This trait is explored in draco664's Apprentice Potter (and in this fic, he is still the only person who can do it). I liked the action scenes and the story overall is decent but as it was written before HBP, some aspects of world building don't line up with the later books. Also, it has an angry/angsty!Harry for the first 5 chapters (he mellows out later) and is written in 1st person, which might annoy some people.
