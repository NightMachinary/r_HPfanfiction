:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was reading a fic earlier where the Order uses ritual to summon Canon Harry to beat Voldemort, and before he gets sucked in, he manages to get Teddy out of range. Are there any fics where they both get sent to an alternate dimension?

Or Harry and a different character.
