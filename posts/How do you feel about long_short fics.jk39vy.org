Im curious of your opinion, guys. Do you feel intimidated by long stories (100k words and up)?

I have heard a lot of people that prefer to avoid starting reading stories like that, especially if they are in process, fearing they are going to be left unfinished one day out of the sudden. While other people just are lazy or feels theres a limit of how lenghty a fic can be without having the author being indecisive about its course. With this I mean cases of stories of 1M words and longer... THATS JUST A BIT TOO DAMN MUCH...

Funnily enough, Im almost the contrary. I try to avoid short stories. Like, for example, Im fine with stuff like multi-chapter stories composed by drabbles. Because little by little they can build a setting and interactions with the characters that can be really fun to read.

But stuff like oneshots of less than 2,5k words, I avoid them, because I feel like its just not enough to build an all-round story. I know, thats a bit prejudiced and untrue on a lot of cases, but its how I feel about it.

So how do you feel about the lenght of stories?


** I'm not a fan of 1 shots because they are over to quickly when I binge read. While I'm slightly intimidated by long ones, I'd hate to find a really good one shot that's over too quick

** I don't care how long it is, as long as it's good. I just finished a fic that's over 500k words and I couldn't put it down. It was amazing. But most authors don't know how to wrap things up. They just keep adding and end up ruining it.

*** hard agree on the conclusion thing. I've taken to just bailing out sometimes when I feel that a fic has concluded nicely, even if there's twenty or fifty more chapters to go. Some of these long boys have been written over years, and while that's a credit to the writers' persistence, sometimes you can split them into two or three stories, because the tone changes (having said that I've been writing so slowly I know I have the same problem, so I'm not critiquing too hard lmao)

** Any length can have its own merits. One-shots have the benefit that they can develop an idea that's interesting but can't support a full plot, and they don't take long to read. Epically long stories can be just author meandering, or they can be a feast.

Incompleteness and abandonment is more of an issue than length IMO.

** I am not much of a one-shot guy but I also don't like reading long stories that add unnecessary content for the sake of word count, nor am I a big fan of rehashing plotlines from the original story, unless they are described from a different perspective, such as someone who thinks radically different than Harry.

** Depends on how you do it. Long or short fics aren't intrinsically bad, but a lot of fics are longer than they should be or shorter than they could be.

There's a significant portion of 100K word fics that could be far better at 30K words after removing excess dialogue or redundant chapters and such. More narration is great, but there's a certain point where you get too many words being used and too few details being described.

Equally, there are many one-shots and shorter fics that leave me wanting a 100K epic follow-up to them.

Like tropes, pairings, and everything else, it's not what you do, but how you do it. :)

** 20k-100k is perfect I think.

500k is too much already, and above that... *shudders*. unless it's some kind of retelling of the series starting with book one and continuing to book 7. but I have to like it to continue reading.

it also depends on what is written in that many words. like, having 50k words that only describe Harry shopping in Diagon Alley is waaay too much, but 200k words that takes in one whole year is ok.

world building also need more words to... build.

I don't like one-shots (less than 5k words). very forgettable or depressing or about nothing.

** I only read fics with at least 6k words. If a short fic is heavily recommended, I may try it.

Typically, 25k-38k is too long for a short story and too short for anything else.

If it's near 100k words, I'll always read it until I reach the end or I physically start cringing. I hate it when a story is not complete, but I'd rather there be a story than not because I can finish it in my head. I only read HP fanfic because I want to be immersed in a world. Worldbuilding is a must. I want to /live/ as the characters. (Other fandoms that I've tried have disappointed.)

This is called a novella and there are some terrific ones in fanfic, regular fic, and "literature".

**** There are definitely great ones!

It's just that a lot of authors tend to go too broad when writing within that range. They can still be pleasant, but they're not as gripping.

** I always sort by over 100k words first when I'm looking for something to read, I love being able to really sink into it and get a feel for the characters and the writing. A good one shot every now and then is amazing, don't get me wrong, but I've always been a fan of longer stories.

** I prefer one shots and shorter stories- overly long and complex plots rarely hold my attention in fanfic, I would rather go and read something original. Obviously there can be exceptions, but as I'm more interested in character and emotive stuff anyway, shorter fics tend to be better for that.

** I rarely read anything shorter than 2500 words, and never read completed works with less than 100 000 words; sometimes if an in-progress fic looks very good and updates frequently I'll read it before it reaches the 100 000 words mark, but yeah.

Love me some long stories.

I have read 1mil and above fics but they're not my favourite, I much prefer that a writer splits up their story in arcs/seperate fics instead and creates a series.

As for writing, I've found that having a full outline before I write the story cuts down on a lot of excess that you see in stories where they author is just writing whatever comes to them.

usually endings suck anyway, and by reading stories for the story/journey rather than the ending I'm able to enjoy many more stories...even dead ones

#+end_quote

Yes, because I'm afraid of them being of medium quality. If they stink I stop reading right away, no problem. If they're good, then that's what I wanted and I come away happy. Medium = I usually read it the whole way through, burning however many days of reading time, and feel empty and exhausted afterwards.

i don't mind unfinished. There's one currently at 300k+ that I like a lot, that is still coming in installments, so I've read it in bits and pieces as they've gone up. But I wouldn't want to read that much in one go.

** Maybe I'm just odd, I prefer longer fics and I tend filter out anything less than 40k-60k. Even the unfinished/abandoned 100k+ ones don't bother me as much as a 35k abandoned one. 7 times out of 10 if it's abandoned past the 100k mark its because the story has slowed to a crawl, the author has written themselves into a box, or the energy has just gone on both ends, and I can happily set the story down.
