I really want to see how Hogwarts was founded all those years ago. It really will be great seeing the four greatest wizards of their time come together and build a school to educate wizards. We will get to know a hell lot about their motivations, backstories, future plans, etc

Other stories that I'm interested in are:

1. Marauders and their time at hogwarts. This should be really fun.

2. Muggles vs wizards war.

3. Goblin revolution

This would really enrich the lore of this universe.

** Wizards in space.

Bonus point if there is a lore about the Atlanteans (You know the Mythical civilization Trope where all the goodies spells, Patronus, Killing Curse are created by them) left earth millennia ago and left ruins across the galaxy, accessible via Super-Portkey. (I know that looks a lot like Stargate, but I just want Wizards exploring the cosmos honestly).

**** Well, Harry Potter is kid story, but it always bothers me that Wizards and Witches had the power to rewrite the universe at their will for millennia, and the best they could do was to hide themselves in few areas and jack' off on their own bloodline.

the Atlanteans civilization trope or how I envision it, is that there was a super advanced magical civilization eon before, and they grow bored of Earth and left a bit before the rise of the Greeks nations (and that's why the record of fall of Atlantis come from them) they left only scraps of their magical knowledge (some advanced spells like the Patronus, or Killing Curse, or thing like blood and soul magicks) on Earth and just left.

** I'd be interested in a non smutty, not incest-focused Harry/Lily time travel fic where they start out as an accident (eg too much alcohol) and keep ending up in bed with each other despite knowing their family link. Make it cracky enough and focus on the humour and absurdity of the situation. Lily has no connection to Harry in 1977, he has one memory based on dementors. And James reaction would be priceless.

After one too many helpful goblin fic, I'd love a story where Harry gives them a righteous retribution (destroying them politically, destroying their banking system) without going full genocide like you occasionally see in a darkHarry fic.

Generally speaking, I'd love to see more "Harry gets adopted into a family without fucking one of them eventually", especially with a family smaller than the Weasley (fewer characters, more detail for each). There are very few where he gains a big sister sort of person.

** Written by the right person, I think a stories surrounding the Black Family, either during Grindelwald's War or the 2nd Wizarding War would be great.

It could easily be a mix of Downton Abbey and Penny Dreadful, but with magic.

**** Charis and Callidora were distant relatives of Sirius who have only ever been mentioned on the Black family tree. Their sister Cedrella was disowned for marrying Septimus Weasley (Appearantly Charlie mentions that they are his grandparents in Hogwarts Mystery, but it has not been mentioned anywhere else). Charis married a Caspar Crouch and had 1 son and 2 daughters according to the tree. Charis was born in 1919 so depending on the age of Barty Crouch could he be the son. Callidora married a Harfang Longbottom and had 1 son and 1 daugther. I think it would be pushing it a little to say that the son is Neville's grandfather since Callidora was born 1915.

​

Phineas and Iola are two other characters from the family tree. Son and sister of Phineas Nigellus respectively. He was disowned for supporting muggle rights and she for marrying muggle Bob Hitchens. Nothing else about them are known about the two. Not even their exact ages.

****** No clue honestly, not that many. But I am way too into details in my worldbuilding which means I will read anything I can find regarding characters and the world because they might become useful in the future. So when I am presented with characters that are most likely related can I not help but do the math to see what the most likely connection is. The Black family was one of the first ones I did this to hence why I have a large intrest in the obscure characters that aren't even mentioned in the books.
