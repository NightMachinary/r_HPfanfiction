It is a concept that I have never seen explored; AUs where Fred and George dislike/despise each other. Maybe Fred is a bully, just shy of someone like Malfoy, while George is a (relatively) quiet young man who loves books (or vice versa). Perhaps, one twin loves hanging out with Percy, which prevents the latter's betrayal.

There are numerous types of Weasley fanfics, from bashing to wholesome. Why do you think this is the case?


** The closest I've seen to that is in The Prince of Slytherin, but even that isn't for the whole story. They spend pretty much the entire third book disliking each other, but then make up at the end.

** What about keeping them mostly at canon personality but changing one core aspect or event from which everything started to tumble down, breaking the bond they shared for a while?

Lets say, for example, a young Fred and George, a bit before Hogwarts, deciced to play one of their infamous pranks, but something goes wrong and one of their siblings gets seriousely injured (I am thinking lasting impact, but not death. So the memory that they screwed up bad is always around). Obviousely everybody is mad at them, but the worst is that they are mad at each other, too. They may have fixed the rift, but they go to Hogwarts still mad and hurting. Both of them are pretty clever and sneaky (pranksters have to be to a degree, and they made their own products in canon while still school aged). So, one of them asks the hat not to be put into Gryffindore (Fred figuring George will go there, and also he cannot deal being around his older siblings. Or George being like "I cannot be near Fred and he went to Gryffindore.") And the hat sends this respective twin to either Ravenclaw or Slythetin (I kinda like the idea of Ravenclaw. Alternate sorting= Slytherin is a bit too typical.) - That leads to a widening of the rift, possibly the other twin had hoped that they'd grow closer again away from home and now feels somewhat betrayed. ... And from there it is pretty easy to create a train wreck of escalation.

** I would see them as rivals in pranks but otherwise being inseparable. They have so much experience with pranks because when they are not pranking other people, they are pranking each other. They always try to outdo each other. And sometimes their pranks can be really cruel. For example they aim the bludgers at each other during the Quidditch games and if someone gets in the way... well too bad. Fred invites Angelina to the Ball but George then goes to pretend he is Fred and when Fred shows up he laughs it off as a prank. Fred is actually the one to attack Malfoy and pretends to be George to get him banned from the team, but the prank backfires and they both get banned. During the battle of the seven Potters, Snape actually hits his intended target, but Fred aims for George's ear. When Fred dies, it's actually George who planted fireworks in the walls of Hogwarts. However, after they get pranked, they shake hands and the pranked one says "You got me this time".
