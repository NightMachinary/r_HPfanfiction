I read an excellent story once that had Beedle the Bard's book featured in it. One aspect of it involved one of the original, old Beedle books that would add the local culture's children's stories to the end of the book, depending on the region to which the owner carried the book. Has anyone ever heard of such a fic? Hermione /might/ have owned the book in story, but it's possible I'm incorrectly extrapolating that.
