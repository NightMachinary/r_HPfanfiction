Well i saw a story recently where harry goes back in time a long time ago not marauders not his own lifetime but before.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home]]

This is a very good story so im asking if somebody here knows about a story where 1) harry or fem harry(better) goes back in time 2) harry must stay in the past and must live up to the point where he goes back in time (immortal is ok too) 3) must be written at least up to the point of return to the present time That would be great Thanks


** The closest I know are Wizard from the Earth (inspired by a movie called 'Man from the Earth') and Voldemort's Last Spell, which is cool to start but rapidly turns into marvel crossover nonsense after reaching the present day.

Both have Harry going into the distant past and living through without all the modern day stuff. The former doesn't have Harry making it to the modern day, but the latter does (it just gets not-to-my-taste very quickly after that happens).

Unfortunately, that 'niche' of the fandom isn't terribly full, so A Long Journey Home is really the best one of the bunch, which is why I added the one that doesn't go to the modern day - it's half of what's there in this niche. :D

** Basilisk born [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born]] Uses that premise and it flips back and forth between the past and the present very long with 66 chapters I think. The of a linear circle series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028]] Is similar with time travel but not quite the same as your asking for, it's good though so I'll still recommend it.
