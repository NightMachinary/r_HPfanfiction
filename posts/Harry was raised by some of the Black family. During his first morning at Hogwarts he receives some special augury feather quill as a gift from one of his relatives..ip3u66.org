:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The story presents it as a very ritzy gift. I believe it was implied that he probably got it because his family was pleased that he was in slytherin and they had been worried that he'd be gryffindor.

I think time/dimension shenanigans were involved. Pretty sure Harry makes a bet with Draco, where Harry will give Draco the quill if he loses. I /think/ the bet was about Hermione being top of the class in their year.

Does anybody recognize this fic?


** I /think/ linkffn(A Necessary Gift)

I have a large possibility of getting this wrong, but the description is as so:

‚Äã

The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.
