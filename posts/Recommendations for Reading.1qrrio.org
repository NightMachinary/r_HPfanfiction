Hello, can any one else recommed stories similar to Harry Potter: Game of the year edition? It is very good and have some interesting ideas. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8052743/1/Harry-Potter-Game-of-the-Year-Edition]]


** Well, there is Oh God Not Again, if you are looking for parody Peggy Sue retellings, and there is Harry Potter and the Natural 20 if you are looking for Harry Potter running on RPG mechanics.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] is 1000 times better than any of these other, highly cracky gamified story fics.

Yes, HPN20 is a little cracked, but not that much. It takes the D&D mechanics ultra serious and doesn't break the forth wall as a joke, but instead hints /strongly/ that the main character really has been peeking at the DM Guide and Monster Manual. The only problem is, those rules only apply to /him/. Everyone else uses vague HP world rules.

Thankfully for character development (which D&D board games don't always have), despite being an unrepentant munchkin he eventually starts seeing the other +characters+ people in his world as more than character sheets with stats. Because they sadly don't seem to /have character sheets/ (horror!) and instead have emotions and deep back stories.

****** It's been struggling recently.

Hopefully it can be kept up. I'm really looking forward to Milo's take on the Triwizard Tournament...

** Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9708318/1/The-Adventures-Of-Harry-Potter-the-Video-Game-Exploited][The Adventures Of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited!]] by michaelsuave. A good level of writing and semi regular updates, a tad more crackish than hp:GotY as it focuses more on harry abusing the gaming system but its a good read.
