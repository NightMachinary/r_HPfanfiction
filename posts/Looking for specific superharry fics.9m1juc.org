Looking for well written super!harry fics that begins before Hogwarts. Must be over 150k words (or 100k if it's really good). It would also be preferable if Harry was sorted into Ravenclaw/Slytherin.

Optional things: GreaterGood/manipulative!Dumbledore WrongBWL!

NO slash or timetravel.

Cheers.

** 'Make A Wish' series was good, and 'Courage And Cunning' has a Salazar!Harry.

Thanks,\\

** Try blindness by Angela star cat. Harry is pretty op through the story, but there is still tension.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I'm not trying to be a jerk, but I just want to clarify the post flairs and title wording for you, since this is actually a request post.

--------------

*Fic Search:*

When you are looking for a *single, specific fic*. There is a story on your mind that you /know/ exists, and you know a list of things about it, but you still need help finding it. Most commonly used because you have forgotten the title of a story you previously read, or because your google-fu can't find a fic the author seems to have removed from FFN/AO3/etc

*Request:*

When you are looking for *any fics that fit within some general guidelines*. You post fits this exactly, listing some requirements ("super!harry", "no slash", etc) and some preferences ("Harry was sorted into Ravenclaw/Slytherin", "wrong!bwl", etc). This is by far the most common post type here, used to gain recommendations for new fics the OP expects to enjoy due to the guidelines shared.

--------------

After all that, go forth and enjoy the stories shared! I hope your post nets you good new fics to read :)

** This sound like a request i'd have made ages ago. Trust me when I say that super!harry fics aren't what they're cracked up to be, but give me a minute to look back on my past, and i'll see if there are any decent ones.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
