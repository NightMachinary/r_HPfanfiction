Is it expressly ruled out in canon? I'm sure there would have to be charms (or whatnot) preventing it because otherwise why did the trio resort to Polyjuice potion? I just wondered if its only implied or stated outright?


** No, but when you combine the corrupt justice system and the level of bureaucratic inefficiency, you always leave it disillusioned!

******** In that case, remember that disilusionment charms do not work as invisibility cloaks, rather they turn the person into a human chamaleon. A lot of people just write them as flat out invisbility, but honestely if that was the case what was the pint of invisibiity cloaks?

********* True. I'm not in love with any particular method - its a means to an end. He needs to attend a closed session of the Wizengamot. He needs to be completely unseen. I don't care how I achieve that as long as it is in within the logic of the world it takes place in.

********** An insect (or other small) animagus form, in the style of Rita Skeeter?

Using some sort of remote viewing charm, in the style of Extendable Ears? Sneak it onto one of the members of the Wizengamot and let them bring it into the chamber. While the chambers are presumably screened for bugs beforehand they probably don't apply the same level of care to the dignitaries. Even if they do, if Malfoy were running late he'd just bully his way through.

************ Point-to-point communication (in the style of two-way mirrors or even the floo) is already pretty established in HP canon, so it wouldn't be a huge stretch. It would be pretty easy to handwave something that's basically the magical version of a wireless camera and microphone, there are plenty of reasons someone might want to be able to monitor a room without actually being in it.

Fitting the object into your world becomes a bit of a problem, particularly since you'd expect secure chambers to be magically protected against most monitoring methods, common or obscure. It needs to be something that's both almost entirely unknown and accessible to your character.

Or, hell, maybe the Ministry is incompetent. The spells protecting that room were supposed to be touched up but Fudge cut that part of the budget, the people who designed the Ministry's security weren't sufficiently worried about spying within the building (that could be a feature, since knowing what your political rivals are up to can be useful), the meeting was going to be in a secure room but someone moved it at the last minute as an ill-considered power play.

************* It's the Death Eater trials following the fall of Voldemort/Battle of Hogwarts. So Fudge is long gone and so is Scrimegour. Kingsley is care-taking and I imagine trying to sort the ministry would be a god awful mess.

That said - this hearing has to be kept completely stumm. No one from the ministry wants the ramifications of it being general knowledge. I think even the Doctor from St Mungo's would have some spell/charm/hex placed on him to prevent him speaking about it. So its needs to be good enough the average sneaky animagus reporter can't get past it but not so clever it stops my fellow from getting in. Maybe the simplest plans are often the best.

************** Huh, that's an interesting scenario. I'm not entirely sure what to conclude about the overall story from the other threads you've posted here, but I really like the amount of thought you're putting into the various aspects of the world. I'm interested in seeing the fic once you're done writing it or start publishing chapters.

I do think that you're right that going for a super clever solution might not be the best route. The more moving parts a plan has the more likely it is that something will go wrong, and relying on a plan like that takes a special sort of person.

*************** Thank-you. I like to have a solid understanding of how the mechanics of my story world are going to work before I write it so I don't make some error that requires massive rewrites - or worse sneaks through. Its complex with a lot of moving parts so I am working hard at keeping my eye on the ball.

I will be very happy to link you the fic once I get to a point its fit for public consumption. I'm currently under way on the first draft. If my Beta's crack the whip on me I hope to have the first draft completed by the end of April when Camp NaNoWriMo wraps up and start publishing shortly thereafter.

**************** When you can't solve the problem, go around the problem; If they can't get in there /during/ the trial, get them in there /before/ the trial. Have someone (Fudge) let slip the room the trial is going to take place in, then have that information reach the character. After exhausting all avenues, then the character can go "wait a minute!" and voila.
