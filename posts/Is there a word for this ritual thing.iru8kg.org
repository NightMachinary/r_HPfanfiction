So you know in movies when people do satanic rituals they draw pentagrams on the floor? Is there another word for the pentagram drawing when it's not a pentagram? Like if a character were to do an old runic ritual and draw it in chalk on the floor, is there a word for what they drew?

I'm writing a character that traps another one in one of those made in blood and runes (not a pentagram) and I need a word for it. I've tried googling it a hundred times.

** I'd suggest ritual circle, or summoning/binding circle (or whatever shape your character has made) for what you want to use it for!

** Rune Boundary?

Rune Circle?

Blood Circle?

Blood Boundary?

Really just anything that describes either shape or material or look would do. Pentagrams are pentagrams because they are a five sided star shape.

**** Nah.

Most shit is just "How do I describe this in as few words as possible".

Bicycle is a fun one for me. Bi means two and cycle is derivative from circle leading to a word which describes a thing with two circles. Of course over time the word becomes common nomenclature and everybody knows what you refer to when you use the word.

Things are funny that way.

So yeah the goal is to just describe new stuff in as short a way as possible.

Your ritual thing in practice. Just describe the scene the first time as you write about it in full. How the runes are either written or etched in what material and then make your character ask "What's that?" and then name it whatever you want. For all it matters you could call it a Sacremonium or whatever. Your readers will know what you mean the next time it is mentioned.

** Depends on what they're drawing. A Pentagram is specifically the five-pointed star in the circle shape that's 'hollywood traditionally' used in these things, so any alternate suggestions we could specifically give would depend on what shape you were using.

** A pentagram is just a circle with the diagonals of a pentagon drawn in. You could make a septagram (like in game of thrones) by drawing in the diagoanls of seven points instead of five.

In general these kinds of drawing could have lots of names. Faerie rings, magic circles, summoning circles, alchemical arrays, magical zodiacs, rune circles, magical seals (for containing things)

The whole 'pretty geometric drawings are magic' is a pretty common trope across lots of fiction and I still haven't found a single, uniting name that satisfies me

** In HP context you could do "last name" circle, eg a Hufflepuff Circle if she created it

*** It's a SI in the marauder era that isn't a very proficient dueler so she specializes in other branches of magic line wards, runes, potions, and dark magic while she goes on a horcrux hunt. So far she's found two and is working on a third and the basilisk right now. I got tired of SIs that don't change the plot, so I wrote one of my own.

** I think the word you are looking for is a gram. A pentagram is five pointed so it gets word penta(five in latin) put on the front. A circle would be a gram, a square a tetragram and such.
