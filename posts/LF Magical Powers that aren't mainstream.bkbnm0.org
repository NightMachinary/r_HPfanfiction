** -Legilimency/Occlumency. If two people are good at both they could communicate with eye contact and even show each other their memories. Might make studying very efficient. Imagine a smart!Harry and Hermione study at twice normal speed by exchanging memories through Legilimency. Since many fics involve Harry learning Occlumency before going to Hogwarts to prevent Dumbledore from finding out where he was raised this time it's not too implausible.

-Wandless levitation/summoning. Wandless magic is supposed to be super difficult, but if a character spends a lot of time mastering just a few spells like /Wingardium Leviosa/ and /Accio/, that could allow him essentially full telekinesis superpowers. Potentially cursed dark artifact? Don't have to risk touching it, just levitate it. Need the salt? Just say the magic words. Not 'please pass the salt', but '/Accio/ salt'. Hedge maze? Just levitate your shoes and fly over it. Need to find a book in the library? '/Accio/ Hogwarts: A History'. So much potential. But that one guy in the pub in PoA turns his spoon wandlessly, so it's also not implausible.

-Time turners. Almost all fics with time travel involve a single big jump to create a 'what if' scenario, but the casual use of short time jumps like Hermione does in PoA could also be interesting. You could oversleep all the time and just turn yourself back to not miss breakfast. You could confuse Trelawney by accurately predicting what's going to happen after Divination class by turning yourself back a few hours before attending it. And in a battle scenario you could repeatedly save your own arse (like Harry does in PoA with his Patronus). Just being in two places at the same time could give you a pretty good alibi to do anything you want since time travel is a relatively well-kept secret. And it's not too hard to get a turner, just sign up to do all the electives.

EDIT: I thought you were looking for ideas for writing a story, sorry. But the time turner idea is used in Methods of Rationality and the levitation is done in a Black Comedy.

** Apprentice Potter spends a significant amount of time on the use of remote casting with a wand. In canon, only Harry was ever shown using this ability (against the dementors in OOTP). It's a fun read. Note that it was written right after OoTP, so the first 5 or so chapters feature an Angsty!Harry. The angst levels off once he resumes his education, though so I found it bearable. The action scenes were pretty good too!
