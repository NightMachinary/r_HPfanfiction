Despite the many crimes of partially kissed hero, I did enjoy the idea of Luna being related to Alice from Alice in Wonderland. Are there about good fics that explore this or the idea of Luna in Wonderland at all? Any version of Wonderland would work, Carroll, Burton, or Disney. As well as any age of Luna, (eg older for more Burtonesque) though I do like the idea of Lunas creatures in canon being from Wonderland (tell me that a blibbering humdinger and a nargle don't belong in the same world as a jabberwocky)


** Okay, I really want to read a story like this now. Please tell me if you ever find one, please.
