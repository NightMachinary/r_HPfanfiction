I am new to this reddit, but I am rather well-known in the HP Fanfiction world, my name (and penname on Fanfiction.net) is Vance McGill. My stories are here: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Evancemcgill][http://www.fanfiction.net/~vancemcgill]]

I will be updating some of the unfinished stories there -- have a couple of big ones -- before too long.

However, I have some stories on my computer I've been writing... but I haven't uploaded them yet. I'd like to get your opinion on their summaries, and what you think is the best.

1. Untitled Girl!Harry Alternate Universe story: Harry and Tonks are attacked with a mysterious spell and wake up in an alternate universe in which Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry's parents and godfather are alive, Harry has a sister, and Sirius has a family. Oh yeah and Harry turns into a girl! Ships: Harry/OMC (not slash), Ron/Hermione. Takes place post-OOTP. Supports canon but does not always follow.

2. Untitled Girl!Harry Alternate Universe story, may be called Opposite. POST OOTP, does not follow HBP or DH. Harry's drink gets spiked and he turns into a girl. To save his reputation, Dumbledore attempts to put a spell on Hogwarts to make everybody believe Harry is a girl. What actually happens, is Harry and Dumbledore get sent to an Alternate universe where James and Lily had a daughter, the Girl Who Lived. Plot twist is that the potion Harry drank is slowly making him believe he really is a girl... Ships: (Girl!Harry) Harry/Ron (Non-slash), Harry/Ginny (Girl!Harry fem-slash), Ron/Hermione.

3. Untitled story sorta based on From the Past, To the Future (here: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?chapterid=218894&i=1]]) I have not even started on this story though but thinking about it... it is a very recent plot bunny that has nestled in my head.


** I like the idea of Harry turning into a girl and exploring the whole gender identity etc etc...

This a common plot in Manga Like [[http://www.batoto.net/comic/_/comics/nyotai-ka-r925][Nyotai-Ka]] (NSFW), [[http://www.batoto.net/comic/_/idol-pretender-r625][Idol Pretender]] and [[http://www.batoto.net/comic/_/comics/balance-policy-r6263][Balance Policy]] (HIGHLY NSFW)

The first two stories sound similar, (Harry turns into a girl gets sent to an alternate universe)

the third one ... well i really don't know, the link you provided doesn't give a description of the story

PS: have you thought about wirting a story where Harry is born as a girl but for wathever reason has to pretend to be a boy, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver][Sweet Polly Oliver]] is one of my favorites tropes

** I like 1 and 2.

But for 1: "a mysterious spell"? Come on, I'm sure you can find another explanation, something more original.

For 2, I really really like the idea of Harry turning into a girl. I can just imagine all the funny/uncomfortable situations he'd find himself in (especially with Snape's snide comments). I don't know why you'd want to send him to an alternate dimension as there would be enough material to write about by keeping him in his own dimension but that's your call. I can't imagine him paired with Ron however, that would be a major turn off for me.

Good luck for your writing, and keep us updated!
