Hello fellow Redditors!

I've been looking for a story for hours now, and it's driving me crazy! I remember that the first chapter had Auror Harry going to a pub to try and calm down a drunk Ginny and her two (?) Harpy teammates. It didn't go well, and he ended up arresting them all for attacking him, I think.

Turns out they had been exposed to some Dark Magic involving either boggart spit or dementor spit - can't remember which.

Any help would be incredibly appreciated! Thanks!

  Harry Potter has a mission, to track down the Death Eaters who escaped after the Battle. Nothing is more important, is it?
