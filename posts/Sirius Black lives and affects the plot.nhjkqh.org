Maybe Sirius goes with Harry, Ron and Hermione with the Horcrux hunt.

Instead of killed, Sirus gets a trial after the DOM battle.

Sirius talking some sense into Remus, sooner.

Sirius helping the Order and going on missions, etc.

Sirius buying a new place, leaving Grimmauld Place for Dumbledore for the hideout. Sirius getting Harry to live with him, and Dumbledore or Bill putting spells on the new place for protection, or just something like that.

Just any way to potentially change the plots.


** Hell, when this topic always comes up people still state canon events that more than likely will not even happen considering Sirius being alive changes basically everything from that moment on.

Sirius being alive means Harry likely doesn't chase after Bellatrix and could also mean Sirius kills Bellatrix in the duel or at least beats her and if Bellatrix Wins the Duel and Sirius Doesn't die and just get injured i can see Harry running to protect Sirius instead of going after Bellatrix.

Do Dumbledore and Tom still have the Duel in the Atrium of the Minsitry. Does Tom even show up in the first place. considering the timing of Dumbledore arriving Voldemort could already be well on the way to the department of mysteries at that point considering since he doesn't have Harry to torment and talk to in the Atrium when Dumbledore appears.

The Horcrux hunt could be completely different. Dumbledore may not even die or put the ring Horcrux on if he decides to take Sirius or any other member with him to get it instead of going alone and if Dumbldore surived then even more changes happen, Voldemort may not take over the ministry and there could be No battle of Hogwarts unless Voldemort still decied to attack with Dumbledore still in the castle.

To put it simply Sirius staying alive, everything would change from that moment. nothing would likely stay the same so many different things could happen and decisions being made.

It's a Remus time-travel fic. Sirius lives and gets pardoned after POA. The plot after POA is different than canon, but there's a lot of focus on Sirius.

  After his death, Remus Lupin finds himself five years in the past, having erased Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. His wife has never met him; the Boy Who Lived doesn't remember him. He trusts his old friend Sirius to help him put things right, though Sirius has a godson to raise and demons to face...

** I would like to see a fic where Sirius lives but because he continues to treat Kreacher like shit the trio has to go finding Mundungus by themselves. Thus we get to explore a bit more the magical underworld.

Sirius would be completely validated to do so, since Kreacher literally sold him out to Voldemort.

**** I don't care. My response is based on the fact that I would like to see the Magical underworld. Maybe Harry becoming a gangster or gathering around him the scoundrels to help him fight Voldemort.

  Post-OotP - Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. Rebuilding his life with a war brewing in their world isn't simple. It's a good thing he has a family that he can fall back on this time. What he didn't realise was that good things don't last long. Not for him anyway.OR What if Sirius never had fallen through the veil? A canon-interpretation. No Slash/Bashing/Lordships
