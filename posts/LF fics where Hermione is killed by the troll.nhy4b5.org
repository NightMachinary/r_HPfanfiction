Fics where she is killed, or severely injured. Would love fics where the effects of her death or injury on the boys is depicted and how both of them become better people because of it


** That happens in Noodlehammer's fic, although it doesn't have much of a pay off at first (although it does have a big one later on) because Harry isn't friends with her. Warning, it's a very divisive story.

*** The bot has consistently refused to work for this fic for quite some time. I suspect links to this fic are not allowed by Rule 8.

**** Eh, it seems like the bot is really inconsistent about that sort of thing, but whatever.

** Blindness is an awesome fanfic. It's harmony in which the troll causes severe damage to hermione's head with a bash
