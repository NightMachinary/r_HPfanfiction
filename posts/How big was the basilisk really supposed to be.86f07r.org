** Just go with the movie version, something like 50 feet long. The chapter illustration of the shed basilisk skin also appears to be much larger than 20 feet.

** This was a /shed skin/. That is to say, from the snake growing. There's no saying it was at all recent --- maybe she shed that skin three hundred years ago. The movies' 50 feet make sense.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
