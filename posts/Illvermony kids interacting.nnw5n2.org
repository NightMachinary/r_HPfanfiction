** Someone did the math once to calculate how big the classes would be at Illvermony based off the ratio of Hogwarts Students to British Citizens. I don't remember the exact number, but basically Illvermony classes would have to be taught in a stadium if it's the only wizarding school in America.

*** The entire of the canon magical US is a mess of fanservice. The current US demographics are as a result of genocides of the native population, mass emigration from Europe and human trafficking from Africa and then a population boom due to the introduction of modern medicine.

Given JKR I am pretty sure explicitly states that magicals don't suffer from the same diseases as muggles, the magical Native Americans would have proportionally done a lot better than their muggle counterparts, even before using magic to protect/hide themselves from settlers.

While I am not an expert, it was a perfect storm of wars, persecutions, famines and other economic hardship which drove European emigrants to the US. While it is not impossible that magical Europe has similar pressures, given that it seems to be a post-scarcity society which barely populates the land it already inhabits, why would malcontents cross half way around the world when they could achieve the same results by picking a random field and putting up muggle-repelling charms.

While magical slave trade is not explicitly stated not to have existed, the magical world just doesn't seem to have the scale of economy to justify it, especially given how difficult it must be to keep magical slaves while also giving them enough access to magic to be useful labour. Also given the wizarding world is meant to be 'old-fashioned' and they are very good at ignoring things that they don't like, I am pretty sure if slavery was a thing in the recent past, it would still be going on and even oblivious Harry should have noticed something.

This combines to mean that IMO, magical America consist of disproportionately large (at least compared to our demographics) Native groups and then large numbers of muggleborn and 'new' families drawn from the US's muggle demographic over the last couple of centuries.

*** In Harry's year, except for Apparition, there are at most twenty students per class. If the entire wizarding community from North America attends Ilvermorny, at a population about 8x that of UK, you would get 160 students per class. Not a stadium but a big lecture hall definitely. Or maybe they are separated into cohorts.

***** No. Typical Hogwarts Houses at least in Harry's year have about 10 students/house and classes are done with 2 houses usually so 20 student at most. In Ilvermorny you'd have 80 students/house.

*** With Durmstrang and Beauxbatons being the 2 only Magical School of mainland Europe (at least according to Rowling), I really hope for the students that there is some Magical way to quickly learn a new language (though it seems to not be the case in Canon).

If we assume that Beauxbatons take the students from Southern Europe, when we have French, Spanish, Portugese, Italian, German (from Switzerland), plus all the Slavics language depending of how far East the school go (Slovene, Serbe, Croate . . .).

Durmstrang must also be a nightmare between the Germans, Scandinaves, Poles . . .

**** Except Bulgarians apparently attend Durmstrang, so it would seem that at least in Beauxbattons they would be mostly restricted (hopefully) just to Romance languages (and Greek?), and French (or Latin? that would be interesting) could be the official language. However, Durmstrang would be a complete nightmare. Which is a complete fault of JKR, who combined heritages of her ancestors and with the French arrogance and British ignorance created something so unbelievable as the school located somewhere in the Northern Scandinavia with Russo-German name and students all the way from Bulgaria, Germany, Norway, and (I guess) Benelux? Notice, there is no German school, which is as believable as the pigs flying. All those Germans, Dutch and Scandinavians learning Russian? Or all those Russians and other Slavs learning German? And why there are Russians there at all, when they have their own Koldovstoretz (or rather correctly Koldovstvoretz)?

****** Or at least magical country, which may be bigger or smaller than modern day equivalents. Even if you discount magical politics, the national boundaries at the time of the Statute of Secrecy were very different. Sure, maybe a bit late for a magical Roman Emporer, but there is arguable justification for a magical Holy Roman Emporer.

****** I am not sure about that. With the proportion 5,000 Muggles per a wizard/witch, it makes some magical nations awfully tiny. My own nation, Czechs, makes 2,000 wizards/witches. That's rather small village. Yes, you can make a village school out of it, but I would prefer if more nations pooled their resources and have something of their own. And of course, patriot I am, I believe that the gord [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(Kladno_District][Budeč]]), which disappeared IRL after 936 was actually magically hidden and the school is there till now (and of course, wizards and witches from there established later many other schools around Europe, including the one in the Northern Scotland).

***** I think that it was more hang over from Cold War propaganda. Remember that she grew up before, and set GoF only five years after, the fall of the Berlin Wall. Given how lazy she is at porting over our politics to the magical world, I assume that Durmstrang was the evil 'Soviet' school, which was then slightly retconned when she came up with the Grinderwald stuff to be more Germanic.

***** There is also the problem of all the Muggleborns living in Durmstrang territory. Where do they go since the school wouldn't accept them? Are the taking in by other Muggleborn who teach them? Do they not receive any education? Or at they sent to Beauxbatons or Koldovstvoretz, increasing once again the number of languages spoken in these schools?
