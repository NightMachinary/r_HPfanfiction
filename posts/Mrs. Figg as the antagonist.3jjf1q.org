Mrs. Figg is a weak link. Perhaps she bears the blame for Harry living in a cupboard for 10 years? So, is there a story where Mrs. Figg is an antagonist in the sense that she:

 

A. Is an agent of Voldemort

 

B. Is imperiused or blackmailed to act against Harry

 

C. Is independently a bad person, and plots against Harry of her own volition.

 

D. Is concisouly negligent (i.e. just tells Dumbledore everything is fine, "no time to snoop, got to feed my cats!")


** Sort of makes sense in my mind. She was charged with checking on Harry but despite having him over for babysitting his situation doesn't change.

A. Harry doesn't talk at all about living in a cupboard. Badly fitting clothes and being skinny isn't child abuse. Arabella Figg isn't concerned.

B. She is concerned and tells Dumbledore everything. Dumbledore does nothing either because there is no better option or because he wants Harry raised a certain way so he becomes a bold and self-sacrificing hero.

C. She is like Filch, the other well known Squib in the series. She secretly resents wizards for being able to do magic and causes subtle sabotage whenever possible without ratting herself out.

I vastly prefer A or C. Both scenarios in B are just vastly overdone and badly at that. I think A is canon. C would make for a really interesting fic if done right.
