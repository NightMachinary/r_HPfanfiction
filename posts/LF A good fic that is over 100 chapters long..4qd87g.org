** Why?

Here is a link to every story on ff.net over 100k [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=103&len=100&s=2][words...]]

Most stories of tremendous length are split into portions, but even so there are hundreds over half a million words and, obviously, at least 2100 over a hundred thousand.

So again, why?

I can't really help you much more than that. Long fics really aren't my thing.

*** Well, I looked at that list to satisfy my curiosity and after the first three I was down on the floor laughing (well, not really on the floor, but on the tabletop yes).

** I recently finished the [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/1/The-Debt-of-Time][Debt of Time]] and it's good and over 100 chapters. Not sure why this is a requirement for you though.

** Well, I know you know about it, but all I can get off the top of my head is, Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by LessWrong. Atleast it's close, I don't exactly remember.

**** Hpmor is one of the most famous (or in this sub, infamous) fics in the fandom. It's definitely in the realm of common knowledge on this sub.
