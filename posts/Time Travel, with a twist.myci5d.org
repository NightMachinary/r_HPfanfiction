We've seen many time travel stories where the author tries to fix Canon in any way they can. Usually by sending Harry back. But what if the Canon story we know IS the Fix-it Universe? Who'd be doing the traveling? At what point do they start? Were they even trying to fix the time frame we know in the 1st place(1981 onwards)?

This is not an original idea of mine, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jc02s5/a_nonregular_time_travel_story/]] since that thread is 6 months old already, I figured I'd revive it. It does sound like a really cool idea to me.

  Remus Lupin is an anti-werewolf bigot like his father, but Hermione Granger and her time-turner can fix that.
