I've been on and off with this fanfic for 6 years and would like to continue it. I'm on watt pad if anyone is interested also to critique.

A mysterious girl awakens to find herself in the middle of a forest. She doesn't remember who or what she is. One thing for sure is that she is no ordinary being. Come join her on this exciting adventure to finding who she is. Will love, friendship, good vs. evil get in her way or will it help?


** [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] has a Beta Bartering thread. Might wanna try there?
