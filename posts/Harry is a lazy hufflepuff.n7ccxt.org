:END:
Harry is EXTREMELY lazy. Mind-bogglingly lazy. So lazy, in fact, that he spends an inordinate amount of his time finding shortcuts for things. I'm fairly sure he was a hufflepuff in this fic as well, but I can't remember the name of the fic.


** Harry the Hufflepuff is then only one I can think of.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
