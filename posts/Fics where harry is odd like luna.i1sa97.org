  Finding himself in another universe, Harry makes the perfectly logical choice and adopts his younger self, destroys this world's leftover Voldie pieces, and tries his best to avoid happy goblins.

** There's a fic where Harry is very in tune with his magic and he's perpetually happy. Like, to the point where people think he's weird for it. I thought it was called Life is Beautiful but I can't find it. Maybe someone else knows the fic.

** This only kinda applies. In /The Eyes/, like Luna, Harry is very odd. But he is not odd like Luna. He speaks oddly and he sees things no one else can. And he knows things too. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/The-Eyes]])

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
