I just read Evitative by Vichan and omg I cannot wait for the sequel!

I'm now looking for other fics that are similar to this in that they have Harry exploring dark magic or what is typically seen as â€˜evil' magic by most of the wizarding world as well as exploring magical/wizarding traditions and the potentially some of the principles behind magic. Does anyone have any recommendations?


** I just recently read Evitative and I loved it too!! It's hard to find a fic with such a premise but with no bashing, and Vichan did it so well.

*** Yeah! I found it so refreshing how, although not portrayed as the nicest character, Ron hasn't been bashed and used as the easy and quick replacement enemy for Draco! I loved it so much.

**** Oh yes, same! And the Slytherins aren't suddenly all good and misunderstood - they're not evil, of course, but blood prejudice is still a huge problem that isn't just waved away.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12723942/1/Out-of-the-Night]] - there's a dark community with vows, traditions, own type of magic, etc. Not a fan of these types of stories but I think this fits your request to a T.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

  When a more studious Harry Potter entered Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming. A Ravenclaw Harry story. Warning: child abuse, character bashing, and pureblood society.

**** And especially in the first part it's really minuscule, most of the story doesn't even mention it, and when it does, it's very small. Maybe the sequel will have more of it, but in this one it's really barely there
