Looking for stories where Harry has a brother or sister, or maybe both (or more then one) but they aren't the Boy/Girl Who Lived. Harry is the Boy-Who-Lived, or Neville is. Or someone else that isn't the Brother or Sister.

I don't want any bad James or Lily neglect Harry over the Boy/Girl Who Lived stories. Tried some, can't stand them. No offense to anyone who likes the stories, just not my taste.

Would rather have no character bashing unless it makes sense for the story, if it doesn't then no character bashing. Like if it's just the author bashing the character(s) for whatever reason and it doesn't make sense or it isn't believable then I don't want it.

Any rating is fine, am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine

Am NOT fine with Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, don't like the pairings. No offense to anyone who does, I just don't. Any other pairing is fine.

*** How much does it deviate from cannon, read the intro in the first chapter and in it it was portrayed like a canon re-hash but with a sister. So is it just a retelling of the original or is it actually unique story-wise?

**** It doesn't deviate too much from Canon, but the sister & her relationship with Harry makes it super interesting

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** I can think of a couple that fit the first point but not the other. edit* actually I thought of one but it's discontinued, ffn(7524127) though neville is not portrayed in the best light iirc, but I'm not sure. But james/lily and harry's brother are all tight.

**** Yeah, I read harry potter and the veela simply because of the fleur pairing, but unspeakable potter was a bit over the top even for that pairing. The author has a habit of making his harry extremely effeminate. I don't judge but I got tired of reading /Loooong dancer-like legs/
